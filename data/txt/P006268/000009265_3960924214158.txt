PREFACE
This is a combined Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rio
Gra .de do Norte Rural Develc"uent Project and the Sergipe Rural Development
Project in Brazil. For the Rio Grande do Norte Rural Development Project,
Loan 1195-BR in the amount of US$12.00 million was approved on December 11,
1975. This loan was closed on March 31, 1985, almost four years behind
schedule, and loan disbursements totalled US$11.24 million. The final
disbursement took place on June 4, 1985, and some US$0.76 million was
cancelled. For the Sergipe Rural Development Project, Loan 1714-BR in the
amount of US$26.00 million was approved on May 31, 1979. Loan 1714-BR was
closed one year late on September 30, 1985, and an unused balance of
US$15.90 million was cancelled. The date of final disbursement was June 2,
1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Regional

part on special reports and data prepared by the agencies of the respective
project states; a review of the Staff Appraisal Reports No. 927-BR, dated
November 11, 1975 and No. 2358-BR, dated February 22, 1979; the President's
Reports No. P-1704-BR dated November 13, i975 and P-2554-BR, dated May 16,
1979; the Loan Agreements of March 1, 1976 and June 20, 1979; the Updated
Appraisal and Mid-Term Evaluation Reports for Loan 1195-BR; correspondeuce
with the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda on project issues as contained
in relevant Bank files; as well as interviews with officials both In the
Bank and in Brazil who have been associated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower in January
1987 for comments. Comments received from the Ministry of She Interior

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
RIO GRANDE DO NORTE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 1195-BR)
SERGIPE RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - TABULEIROS SUL
(Loan 1714-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Sergipe (SE) Rural Development
Projects were the first and fifth of ten Bank-financed integrated rural
development projects in Northeast Brazil approved between 1976 and 1983.
Experience gained in the projects played an important role in the develop-
ment of current Government policy for the Northeast. That policy
emphasizes poverty alleviation, agricultural investment and increasad small
farmer food crop production.
Objectives
The projects shared the objective of increasing thi production,
incomes and living standards of small farmer families, and of developing
state institutional capacity. The RN project consisted of a minimum
package implemented in two phases. This project was changed dramatically
during implementation. The SE project had more components (extension,
research, land surveying and titling, credit, colonization, education,
health, water) and was to be implemented simultaneously throughout the
project area. Only minor modifications were made in the design of this
project during implementation.
Implementation Experience
Not all of the projects' objectives were fully achieved, although
the implementation period was extended in both cases. Although falling
somewhat short of appraisal targets, physical achievements were much better
than loan disbursements would indicate. After more than six years, sore
US$15.9 million, or 61X of the original Sergipe loan amount was cancelled
when the loan account was closed. Insecure land tenure, rural credit
difficulties, a severe and prolonged drought, shortages and delays in
counterpart funding, and the lack of clear administrative leadership
km .pered project implementation (para. 7.02).  For many of these problems,
little, if aniything, could be done on an individual project basis.



- vii -
The Bank made important contributions through these two projects
to Brazilisn rural development p3licy.  However, supervision efforts could
have been more sharply focussed for increased efficiency. For maximum
impact, a part of the overall supervision effort for these and other,
similar projects should have been set aside to address, in a coordinated
fashion, problems beyond the individual project scope. Recomt3ndations on
technical matters were sometimes vague, in part because missions did not
consistently include the appropriate specialists. In many ways, the number
and diverse nature of project components were more of a problem for Bank
supervision than for the states implementing the projects (para. 7.04).
Results
Because of implementation difficultIeR, the proJects' economic
rates of return are now estimated at about one-half of the original
estimates.  Despite lower than expected rates of return in both projects,
adopting farmers' incomes increased substantially (para. 7.03). Also, the
projects were responsible for the development of an instituoional framework
which should result in the increased efficiency of future rural development
efforts (pars. 7.03).
Sustainability
The net on-farm benefits in both projects, achieved mainly
through relatively simple improvements in agricultural practices and
delivery sytems, are sustainable in the long run and are estimated to
increase over the next few years, and thereafter, to remain constant
(Annexes I and II, Table 6). Two follow-up projects (the Northeast Rural
Development I and II Projects - Loans 2523-BR and 2524-BR), now underway,
provide for the further consolidation of the institutional framework and
the expansion of increased production and income benefits to a much larger
segment of the states' low-income rural population.
Findings and Lessons
(a)  In projects which are the first phase of a long-term investment
program, fundamental development constraints, such as insecure
land tenure or uncertain water availability, should receive
priority treatment in project design and investment (para. 7.05).
(b) The degree of institutional development, an essential factor in
the implementation of a successful rural development program,
should be taken into account when deciding upon specific
objectives and estimating the project investment period and rate
of return (para. 7.05).
(c) In rural development project design, there is a need for
increased "built-in" flexibility, through the establishment of
indicative targets and explicit recognition of the project as a
"time slice" in a long-term investment program, in the appraisal



- viii -
report; In the legal documents, similar flexibility could be
achieved through fewer detailed covenants (para. 7.05).
(d) In countries where the Bank is supporting a number of similar
projects, supervision should be reorganized so that a part of the
overall supervision time for the projects is set aside to address
common problems of a regional or national scope in a cooiAinated
fashion (para. 7.05).
(e) Loan disbursement performance is not necessarily a good indicator
or proxy for project implementation performance or impact (para.
7.05).



I* INTRODUCTION
1.01      Since the late 1800s, the Northeast has been viewed as Brazil's
foremost "problem area." The country's wealthiest region during the sugar
boom of the colonial period, the Northeast subsequently lagged behind as
industrial, agricultural, and commercial activity shifted to the south. In
1973, the Bank and the Government initiated a dialogue on rural development
issues and strategies for the Northeast. The dialogue coincided with, and
was partially the result of, a growing interest on the part of the Bank and
the Government in poverty-oriented, integrated rural development programs.
In October 1974, the Program of Development of Integrated Areas of the
Northeast (POLONORDESTE) was created. It sought to increase the
production, productivity, incomes, and standards of living of small farmers
and their families in selected micro-regions. The Bank, over the next
decade, cofinanced ten POLONORDESTE projects in eight Northeast states.
1.02      The POLONORDESTE projects represent the "first generation" of
rural development in Northeast Brazil.  Reviews of POLONORDESTE and other
Northeast rural programs were carried out by the Government and the Bank
during the 1980s. Drawing on these interim assessments, a "second
generation" of projects began in April 1985 with the signing of the first
two loans for the new Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP) in the
states of Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe.  Subsequently, under the NRDP,
a regional land tenure improvement project (Loan 2593-BR) has begun
implementation, a project for another Northeast state has been approved,
four more have been appraised, and three projects for the remaining
Northeast states are under preparation.
1.03      This report is a combined project completion report for the first
project (Rio Grande do Norte Rural Development Project-Loan 1195-BR) and
the fifth project (Sergipe Rural Development Project--Loan 1714-BR) in the
Bank-financed POLONORDESTE series. An annex on each project contains basic
completion information. The main text focuses on common problems and
issues found in both projects, and in the POLONORDESTE program as a whole.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      A comparison of the identification and preparation of the Rio
Grande do Norte (RN) and the Sergipe (SE) Rural Development Projects shows
evolving acceptance of and experience with poverty-oriented integrated
rural development in the Northeast. After an extended period of research
and discussion in the 1970s, a consensus was reached between the Government
and the Bank that small farmer issues in the Northeast could be addressed
through specific rural development investments. The choice of RN as the
first project site was not so much based on the productive potential of the
project area, but rather on the State Government's willingness to obtain
Bank assistance for general agricultural (not necessarily limited to small
farmers) development. The preparation missions for the RN project grappled
with definitions of the small farmer content of the target group, project



objectives, and appropriate delivery mechanisms. These were fairly well
understood and no longer the main issues four years later during
preparation of the SE project. Instead, cost-effectiveness and specific
technical and managerial constraints for certain activities received
attention. Also, by the time of the SE project appraisal, there was a
growing confidence in the Northeast states ability to implement the
projectso A minimum package approach, including an initial pilot
experience in a small number of municipalities, was taken in RN. In SE,
even with a cut in the number of components during preparation, the project
contained more components than the RN project. In addition, the
geographic area was expanded from that of the State's original proposal.
2.02      A relatively high level of Bank staff input was necessary in the
preparation and appraisal stages for both projects. This can be partially
attributed to the multi-sectoral nature of the project and the need for a
variety of specialists. Nonetheless, in RN from start of appraisal to
Board Presentation, there were four missions (appraisal, post-appraisal,
and two implementation missions) with a total of 418 staff-days spent in
the field, while in SE, there were only two missions for a total of 190
staff-days. Some of this difference is due to the different budgetary
situations of the regional LCPA3 Division (in charge of the SE appraisal)
and the CPS Rural Development Division (in charge of the RN appraisal).
However, at least part of the lower staff-time required in SR was a
function of the learning curve as both the Bank and the Government gained
more experience in the design of this type of project.
Board Approval
2.03      No serious issues were raised during negotiations for either
project. For both projects the Board raised the issue of insecure land
tenure and questioned the projects' capacity for benefitting farmers
without legal land titles. The concern of the Board was justified. The
need for land tenure improvement as an integral part of rural development
was increasingly recognized during implementation of both these and other
Northeast projects.
Objectives and Description
2.04      The projects shared the objective of increasing the production,
incomes, and living standards of small farmer families within a
well-defined geographic area. Development of state institutional capacity
was also an important common objective. Initially, project design was
quite different for each project. In the RN project, a minimum package of
components (credit, extension, applied research, health, and project
management) was to be implemented in two phases: a two-year experimental
Phase I covering eleven municipalities, followed by a three-year Phase II
in 53 municipalities. The SE project was to begin simultaneously
throughout its 15 municipality project area with 11 components (extension,
research, land surveying and titling, credit, colonization, education,
health, water supply, rural roads, marketing facilities, and project
management). The SE project suffered only minor modifications in design
during implementation. In contrast, the RN project changed dramatically
during Implementation. After a three-year Phase I, an updated app,:aisal
report was issued and four new components were added: marketing and



- 3 -
storage; seed production; land tenure services; and inland fisheries/small
reservoir construction. Two years later, a water resources component was
added. The next year, a pilot program was added for seven municipalities
in another region of the State. Finally, a preliminary study for a very
large irrigation program was fi;anced under the project.
2.05      The changes in the RN project reflect two important trends in
Northeast development: (a) the design moved increasingly toward a fully
integrated approach, much like the later SE project design; and (b) land
tenure improvement and water resource development were viewed with
increasing priority over the years. Also, the RN project, in addition to
its specific developmental objectives, was considered to be a laboratory
for the testing of new ideas And strategies for the Northeast region as a
whole. These included: the integrated project design; the definition of a
poverty target group; the two-phase approach; the water resources
component; the Agreste pilot program, and the preliminary irrigation
study. In fact, the Agreste pilot program tested many of the basic design
features eventually incorporated into the "second generation" NRDP.
2.06      In both projects, execution was primarily the responsibility of
state-level agencies, with planning and coordination to be carried out by a
project unit located within an entity attached to the State Secretariat of
Agriculture. Both projects were subject to regional and federal norms and
procedures for POLONORDESTE.
Project Costs- and Financing
2.07      The Bank was expected to finance 40% of project costs in the RN
project and 35% (net of taxes) in the SE project. By the time of the SE
project approval, a 35% Bank financing share was standard for rural
development projects in Northeast Brazil. This included a substantial
amount of local cost financing since foreign exchange costs were relatively
low. In 1983, both projects were included in the Special Action Program
(SAP) for agricultural projects in Brazil. Under the SAP, the average
disbursement percentage was increased to about 67% of p'nject costs., At
the close of the project, RN project costs amounted to some US$30.3
million, or 95% of the US$32 million project costs esttrAated during the
updated appraisal (Annex I, Tables 2 and 3). SE project costs amounted to
US$32.4 or 43% of the US$76 million in project costs estimated at appraisal
(Annex II, Tables 2 and 3). The overall Bank financing was 37% in RN and
31% in SE (para. 3.16).
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The RN loan was approved in December 1975 and became effective in
July 1976. The SE loan, approved in May 1979, became effective in February
1980. A five-year implementation period was assumed in both SARs. The RN
project was terminated at the end of September 1984, about 8.75 years after
Board Approval. The SE project was terminated at the end of September
1985, about 6.25 years after Board Approval. Estimated targets and actual
accomplishments by component are shown in Annex I, Table 1 (RN) and Annex
II, Table 1 (SE).

Common Project Components
3.02      Extension Services.  In both projects, the extension service
succeeded in reorienting its services toward small farmers. The
methodology of working with farmer groups, virtually unknown prior to
project implementation, was commonplace in both areas by the end of the
projects. Research and extension efforts, particularly in the RN project,
technical improvements promoted by the extension service (e.g. increased
use of fertilizer and new plant varieties in SE; improved spacing for
manioc and new cotton seeds in RN) were widely adopted. Crop
diversification was also successfully promoted, particularly in RN.
However, in both projects, the target number of beneficiaries was not
reached (about 82% or 13,040 in RN and about 63% or 5,270 in SE were
reached); and the number of farmers attended per extension agent was
considerably lower than the 200 (SE) or 220 (RN) expected at appraisal.
Staffing shortages due to funding difficulties partially explain the fewer
than intended number of beneficiaries, but the low farmer/extension agent
ratios have a more substantive basis. A severe, prolonged drought from
1979 to 1983, the general scarcity of agricultural credit, and the lack of
proven, affordable technical packages hampered the extensionists' work in
both projects. The lack of land titles or secure tenure arrangements among
potential project beneficiaries was a fundamental drawback. In addition,
while the quantity of training for extensionists was sufficient, on-the-job
follow-up was insufficient; many extensionists may not have been able to
serve farmers' needs adequately. Finally, extension workers in both
projects were expected to perform a multitude of tasks, ranging from
community development activities to drought relief administration. The
time available for project extension activities was relatively limited.
3.03      Agricultural Research.  The reorienting of research objectives
towards assisting small farmers and achieving stronger linkages between
research and extension were important objectives which were at least
partially achieved in both projects. Research contributed significantly to
increased crop diversification, and new varieties were successfully adapted
to local conditions (e.g. manioc and papaya in SE; cotton and beans in
RN). In RN, the initial reluctance of researchers to leave the
experimental station was overcome, and EMPARN (the RN state research
agency) became one of the pioneers in integrated farming systems research
in the Northeast. As a result, the integrated approach is now the
predominant form of research in the new NRDP. However, the impact of
research efforts was diminished by tle: (a) poor quality of off-fatm
trials, leading to unreliable results; (b) the loss of many trials, due to
the drought, particularly in RN; (c) inadequacy of dissemination efforts;
td) failure of researchers co carry out appropriate economic and financial
analyses of technical recommendations; and (e) poor vertical integration
with the national research company, EMBRAPA, so that some available
technical packages developed in regional research centers were never tested
and adapted to specific project area conditions.
3.04      Credit.  Credit was the most problematic component in both
projects. Prior to 1983, under the projects, more credit was being
directed to small farmers. Simplified credit procedures and an expanded
banking network encouraged the entrance of new borrowers. After the start
of the Brazilian financial crisis in 1982, credit availability and the



- 5 -
number of credit beneficiaries dropped off sharply (to about 10% of the
number of beneficiaries estimated at appraisal). Although a generalized
absence of rural credit was the predominant problem, other factors
negatively influenced credit provision to project beneficiaries. The
highly subsidized interest rate led to the administrative allocation of
credit funds within the banking system. Compounding this basic problem was
the lack of an adequate credit monitoring and control system which resulted
in poor, untimely allocation of funds within the banking network. The late
and incomplete submission of records was responsible for substantial
reductions (50% or more) in Bank loan disbursements for credit. Also,
given the highly subsidized rates for small farmers and high administrative
costs for each loan, local bank managers had little incentive to increase
small farmer lending. Also, many managers were reluctant to lend to small
farmers without guarantees and through group credit applications.
3.05      The relative abundance of highly subsidized credit (at about 12%
nominal rates) until 1983 and the scarcity of credit thereafter clearly
distorted farm investment decisions and influenced farmers' willingness to
adopt technical recommendations. For example, the availability of
subsidized credit stimulated an overuse of chemical fertilizers in SE,
while discouraging the adoption of animal traction in RN. After 1982,
farmers were unable to finance all the inputs required for specific
technical packages, and consequently, adopted recommendations in a
piecemeal fashion, making choices based purely on cost considerations.
3.06      Land Tenure Services, Titling and Colonization.  Both the SE
project and Phase II of the RN project had land components concentrated on
titling and purchase of land for redistribution to small farmers. In both
cases, institutional capacity was almost non-existent at the start of the
project and had to be gradually strengthened. Consequently, the absence of
trained staff, efficient land surveying methods, and mcdern equipment
delayed project execution. This was most serious in SE where only 14% of
the target number of titles was reached. A variety of problem: also slowed
land acquisition and redistribution, even though in SE, local cooperatives
were eager to assume responsibility. The poor performance of the land
components in these two projects as well as other Northeast projects was
instrumental in focusing Bank and Government attention on land issues. It
became evident that in addition to political willingness, administrative,
legal, and technical definitions were needed, followed by intensive
training of involved staff. At the same time, project implementation was
demonstrating that the lack of secure tenure for many target farmers could
impede rural development efforts. Consequently, in later projects, e.g.
Piaui Rural Development Project (Loan 2015-BR), the design and
implementation of land activities were given priority attention. This
priority was confirmed when the Government began preparing a regionwide
land tenure improvement project, viewed as the cornerstone of the second
generation NRDP. A Bank loan of US$100 million for the regional land
project became effective in March 1986.
3.07      Marketing.  Both projects had very limited marketing
interventions. in SE, a farmers' market was built and equipped. In RN,
administrative expenses related to an Advance Production Purchasing Program
(CAP) were financed. CAP was intended for the smallest and poor farmers
who had no access to the banking system for seasonal credit and who had no



- 6 -
bargaining power with local intermediaries. In both cases, the results of
project investments were negligible. The farmers' market never became
fully operational, largely because it could not compete with and did not
build upon traditional marketing channels in the area. The CAP program was
initially viewed as a success. However, the scarcity of regular sources of
credit, the high levels of subsidy, and the losses sustained because of the
drought, turned the program into little more than an unsatisfactory and
non-sustainable substitute for official rural credit. By 1983, its impact
was minimal. In both cases, preparatory market studies, which analysed the
risks in greater detail, might have reversed the decision to finance these
activities.
3.08      Health and Sanitation.  Both projects provided funds for the
construction and equipping of health posts and the training of health
workers. In addition, the SE project financed the construction of village
water supply systems. This latter activity was successful, with appraisal
targets surpassed by 284%. The State Government's interest, demonstrated
by the establishment of COHIDRO, a state water resource development
company, was a major factor. Construction targets for health posts were
also surpassed in both projects. However, the selection and training of
health workers were generally weak, and supervision of the healthposts
inadequate. In addition, some health posts were not functioning at full
capacity because they were improperly located in the first place or because
they lacked vital supplies, such as vaccines. Recurrent cost financing and
operation and maintenance of health posts continued to be problems. The
projects were unable to satisfactorily address these difficulties which
required a comprehensive reform program at the State Secretariat of Health
level. However, the identification of these issues eventually led to their
being addressed in a more comprehensive fashion, as exemplified in the
recently approved Northeast Basic Health Services Project (Loar 2699-BR).
3.09      Project Administration.  For both projects, a small project unit
within an existing agricultural planning agency was to be responsible for
coordinating the activities of the numerous executing agencies. In both
cases, fairly significant administrative changes occurred. In SE,
administrative responsibility for the unit changed from the Secretariat of
Agriculture to the Secretariat of Planning, a trend similar to that
observed in most other Northeast states. In RN, the parent agency, the
State Agricultural Planning Commission (CEPA-RN), changed its legal status
in 1980 to that of a foundation, allowing it greater financial and
administrative autonomy. In RN, the size of the project unit grew
significantly through the years. Also, some decentralization occurred
through the increased use of field managers. The performance of the
project units in both states may be considered satisfactory, given the
following constraints:
(a)   Lack of authority.  In most cases, the project unit was expected
to coordinate agencies with greater financial and administrative
status within the state. Also, project personnel were not
accountable to the project unit, but rather to their managers
within the executing agencies. Although this was intentional in
order to enhance the capacity of existing agencies and not create
parallel institutions, it did undermine the project unit's
authority, particularly at the field level.



-7-
(b)   Irregular funding.  Shortfalls and delays in counterpart funding
frequently masked implementation problems and poor performance,
and made it virtually impossible for the project unit to sanction
unsatisfactory performers.
(c)   Lack of appropriate regional support.  SUDENE, the
Superintendency for Development of the Northeast and the regional
coordinator of the POLONORDESTE program, was unable to provide
che project unit with appropriate technical and administrative
back-stopping. In fact, SUDENE at times issued unclear
guidelines or required reports or documents which increased
administrative tasks and decreased the resources available for
field supervision.
Specific SE Components
3.10      Roads.  Although physical achievements (76% of the appraisal
target) were reasonable in light of budgetary cuts, poor coordination
between the State Highway Department (DER-SE) and the municipalities and
lack of funds negatively affected maintenance. Unsatisfactory local
competitive bidding limiting competition was a major topic of Bank
supervision from 1984 until project closing (para. 3.18). The constructed
roads did noticeably improve access throughout the project area, incressing
some small farmers' marketing opportunities.
3.11      Education.  Project activities were successful in expanding
educational opportunities. Quantitative achievements were generally
satisfactory for school construction and training, but only about 50% of
the curriculum development target was met. Some improvement in the
Secretariat of Education's (SEC) administrative methods also took place.
Despite these achievements, the project was unable to address some
fundamental problems: low teacher salaries; inadequate geographic planning;
a lack of maintenance and appropriate materials for schools; a lack of
consistent supervision; and SEC's frequent administration changes* The
project did, however, focus attention on these issues, and a regional
project addressing these problems in under preparation.
Specific RN Components
3.12      Seed Production.  Project investments resulted in increased
availability of improved varieties of sorghum, bean, cotton and corn
seeds. Production, however, fell short of providing 50% of total seed
requirements as envisioned in the updated appraisal report. The drought,
the lack of irrigation, limited processing facilities, and the absence of
reliable demand projections hindered implementation. Given these factors,
the 50% target may not have been a reasonable one.
3.13      Inland Fisheries.  After a slow start, this Phase II component
successfully distributed over a million fingerlings to about 440 farmers,
as well as stocking nearly 30 public reservoirs. However, most of the
activities were confined to the Caico area (the area closest to the
fisheries facility) because of budget cuts which affected the availability
of personnel and transportation to extend activities throughout the project
area.



- 8 -
3.14      Water Resources.  This institution-building component was added
in 1981 to: (a) strengthen the technical capacity of the Secretariat of
Agriculture which approved plans and supervised construction of small dams
and reservoirs; and (b) increase the extension service's ability to provide
assistance to farmers with small irrigation schemes. These goals were
partially achieved, mainly because increased federal funding for water
resource investments (dams, cisterns, community irrigation systems) created
conditions conducive to the strengthening of these institutions.
Nonetheless, the quality of both dam construction and extension services
for irrigated agriculture still require further improvement.
3.15      The Agreste Pilot Program.  The Agreste Pilot Program, added in
1982, represented a compromise between the State and the Bank. The State
had prepared a full-scale integrated rural development project for about
50 municipalities in the Agreste area of the state. The Bank, on the other
hand, was reluctant to finance a full-scale project because preparation
data indicated a difficult land tenure situation, limited water
availability for productive use, and a relatively poor stock of tested
technical recommendations for small producer agriculture. In order to
develop activities and delivery systems which would address the specific
development constraints found in the area, the pilot program covered seven
representative municipalities and focused on five components: water
resource development, land services, extension, research, and
administration. Although physical achievements were mixed, largely due to
funding delays, the pilot program provided A testing ground for innovative
methodologies, some of which were later incorporated into the regionwide
NRDP.
3.16      Special Studies,  The administration component provided funds for
studies to assist in the preparation of future development projects. These
funds were utilized in the preparation of several major studies, including:
(a)   the preliminary studies for the Serido irrigation project, to be
constructed under the water resources component of the Northeast
Rural Development II Project.
(b)   the Sao Francisco Transbasin Action Plan, which provided a
conceptual framework for future irrigation investments in the
regions; and
(c)   the preparation studies for the Northeast Rural Development II
Project, for which a US$61.4 million loan was approved by the
Bank in April 1985.
Disbursements
3.17      Both projects share a poor disbursement history.  In the RN
project, total disbursements amounted to US$11.2 million or 95% of the
original loan amount (Annex I, Table 4). However, after the first five
years of implementation, total disbursements were only US$3.2 million or
27% of appraisal estimates. In the SE project, total disbursements were
US$10.1 million or 39X of the original loan amount (Annex II, Table 4).
The remaining balance of US$15.9 million was cancelled in July 1986.
Throughout most of the implementation period, disbursements ran below 50%
of appraisal estimates. The projects shared the following constraints:



- 9 -
(a)   shortfalls and delays in counterpart funds;
(b)   failure of bank managers to maintain adequate records and submit
reimbursement requests for rural credit;
(c)   non-availability of rural credit, particularly from 1983 on;
(d)   high inflation rates combined with slow reimbursement procedurea,
producing constant erosion (estimated at 20 to 30%) in the US
dollar value of reimbursement requests;
(e)   diminished execution capacity because of the severe and prolonged
drought (1979-1983), much worse in the RN case; and
(f)   competing uses for counterpart funds, because of other rural
special programs, emergency drought relief measures, and the
presence of non-Bank-financed components in the projects.
In addition, because of the constant devaluation of the cruzeiro and some
real cost savings, unit costs on many items were lower in US dollar terms
than those estimated at appraisal. Also, Bank and Government expectations
concerning execution capabilities for some components were overly
optimistic.
3.18      Beginning in 1983, disbursement rates in both projects improved
dramatically. This was due to the establishment of:
(a)   a direct channelling system between the Treasury and the
projects, reducing delays in the receipt of counterpart funds;
(b)   a Central Bank advance system to pre-finance the share of
counterpart funds which eventually would be reimbursed by the
Bank loan;
(c)   Special Accounts in US dollars at the Central Bank, accelerating
disbursements and allowing expenditures to be claimed for
reimbursement at the rate of exchange in effect on the date of
expenditure; and
(d)   an increased Bank loan disbursement rate of about 67%.
All of the above measures were approved in connection with the Bank's
Special Action Program.
Procurement
3.19      International competitive bidding was not used in either project
because project investments were generally too small, too diverse, and too
dispersed. Nearly all goods and services in both projects were procured in
accordance with local competitive bidding procedures, reviewed and found
generally acceptable by Bank staff. A small amount of civil works in each
project was carried out through a combination of self-help and force
account. The only procurement problem which arose was in connection with



- 10 -
road construction in SE. Bidding documents contained fixed price limits
which discouraged bidding and curtailed competition. The Bank brought this
matter to the Federal and State Governments' attention on a number of
occasions, including a letter in April 1985 which warned the State that the
Bank would not finance contracts signed after June 1, 1985, if satisfactory
procedures were not followed. The State subsequently agreed to modify its
practice.
Reports and Auditing
3.20      Reporting.  Both projects utilized quarterly reporting procedures
and formats mandated by SUDENE. All quarterly monitoring reports were
received by the Bank, although not always in a punctual fashion. The
reports were too long, too detailed, and often focused on unimportant
information. Nonetheless, they did provide some general indication of
physical and financial progress. On numerous occasions, the Bank discussed
with SUDENE the need to improve the quality of the POLONORDESTE monitoring
system. This included partlcipation of a number of Bank staff, from both
LCP and AGR, in a regionwide seminar held in 1983. Although changes were
frequently introduced, the overall quality of monitoring reports only
improved marginally. In addition, credit reporting was inadequate for both
projects (para. 3.04).
3.21      Accounts and Auditing.  Separate project accounts were maintained
in each executing agency. Isolated violations of this practice were
generally caught by the annual audit reports and immediately brought to the
State Government's attention. The first annual audit report for RN was not
received until July 1979, but for both projects, all auditing reports were
finally received, although generally with delay. The audits were performed
by the Secretaria de Controle Interno (SECIN), the Federal Government's
internal auditors. During the last two years, a Bank review of Brazilian
auditing procedures has taken place, and the Government and the Bank have
discussed ways of improving tae quality, independence, and timeliness of
the audits.
Adherence to Covenants
3.22      In general, adherence to the Loan and Project Agreements for both
projects was satisfactory, with the exception of the three major areas
outlined below:
(a)   Provision of counterpart funds.  Required funds for carrying out
both projects were not provided promptly as needed, although some
years (e.g. 1984-85) were better than others. Shortfalls and
delays in counterpart funding were mentioned continuously in
supervision reports and letters. In late 1983, the Bank approved
a Special Action Program designed to alleviate funding
difficulties (para. 3.17). Despite some improvement, funding
remained a problem.
(b)   Availability, lending policies, and procedures for rural credit.
Although prior to 1983, rural credit was relatively available,
credit reporting was unsatisfactory. Consequently, compliance
with stipulated lending policies and procedures in the Loan



- 11 -
Agreements was virtually impossible to monitor* A number of
changes in on-lending conditions and interest rates occurred; the
Bank was seldom officially notified. After 1982, rural credit
became increasingly unavailable. The POLONORDESTE seasonal
credit line was formally abolished in 1983, but no changes were
made in the legal agreements. No land purchase credit (RN) was
ever made available. In short, very few of the covenants
regarding rural credit were satisfactorily complied with. The
Bank's dissatisfaction with the availability, lending procedures
and policies for rural credit throughout the country has been a
major element in the Bank's agricultural sector dialogue with the
Government. In 1981, new Bank lending for agricultural credit
was discontinued, altho gn no changes were made to existing loan
agreements. In 1983, l1nding resumed following a comprehensive
interest rate agreement, included as part of the conditions in
the Agricultural Credit and Export Development Project (Loan
2348-BR). That agreement has been recently renegotiated to
reflect positive changes in Government interest rate policy.
This latest agreement occurred after the closing date for the
projects, and lack of credit remained a constant, unresolved
problem in both projects.
(c)   Bank receipt and review of annual plans.  Both loan agreements
specify that draft annual operating plans were to be sent to the
Bank for either review (SE) or approval (RN), with subsequent
Bank receipt of final approved copies of the annual plan. These
provisions were never complied with, except on an ad-hoc basis
during supervision missions. As a consequence, official annual
plans seldom matched the multi-year plans contained in the Bank's
appraisal reports. Compliance was never formally requested by
the Bank.
In addition to these three major arpas of non-compliance, both projects'
legal agreements contained a number of specific covenants which lost their
initial relevance due to changed circumstances during project
implementation. In those cases, legal amendments were seldom proposed or
processed. The no longer relevant covenants were basically ignored by both
the Government and the Bank.
IV. ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
On-Farm Benefits
4.01      Despite many similarities between the two projects, their impact
has been substantially different. In RN, the prolonged drought from 1979
to 1983 resulted in dramatic area and production declines for all crops
(Annex I, Table 5). Since production data for 1984 and 1985 for that state
is not yet available, the only conclusions regarding possible project
impact must be drawn from the pre-drought Phase I years. In those years,
project area increases in cotton and food production, mainly derived from
increases in area with some yield increases, surpassed original appraisal
estimates. During the drought years, there was a concentrated effort to



- 12 -
develop more drought-resistant seeds, to diversify into crops such as
sorghum, and to increase the area permanently utilized for riverbed and
shoreline cultivation (vazantes) and the area with small-scale irrigation.
While applicable so far to a relatively limited number of beneficiaries, a
sampling in 1984 of small farmers utilizing a combination of
drought-resistant technologies showed an average net farm income of
US$1,615 (compared to the updated appraisal target of US$640 for similar
farmers). For farmers adopting only improved seeds and more efficient
spacing and inter-cropping systems, net farm incomes based on samples drawn
from on-farm research trials, were between US$560 and US$620. A random
sampling of non-project farmers showed average income levels below US$500.
Consequently, despite aggregate production to date far below appraisal
estimates, the project impact has been positive on beneficiaries' farm
incomes.
4.02      In SE, better data on project benefits are available.  Also, the
effects of the drought on agricultural production were less severe.
According to samples taken in 1981 and 1985, productivity increases among
project farmers ranged from 45% to 94% for manioc, passion fruit, coconuts,
corn and oranges (Annex II, Table 5). With the exception of manic^, yields
for these crops were consistently higher than pre-project levela and among
project farmers than non-project farmers. Increases in total area under
cultivation were also recorded for project farmers, about 18% for permanent
tree crops and about 11% for other crops. These increases in yields and
areas were also reflected in beneficiary incomes. The weighted average
income from farm activities increased to about US$2,270 for project
beneficiaries. This is about 60% of the appraisal target of US$3,715 at
full development (12 years). However, total income from both farm and
off-farm sources averaged about US$3,840. Income increases were largest
for farmers in the 10 to 50 ha category, reflecting their increased ability
to produce and market high-value crops. Smaller farmers (under 10 ha)
producing mainly subsistence food crops did not enjoy any real income
increase from the project and may have had to seek increased off-farm
employment. Nonetheless, survey results show thet even those farmers were
significantly better off than non-project farmers whose average real
incomes declined significantly (about 35% to 70%) from 1981 to 1985.
However, the larger and more progressive farmers tended to be most able to
take advantage of the project and benefit from it. The project also was
able to create about 4,900 labor-years of increased farm employment.
Rate of Return
4.03      In both projects, the economic rate of return has been estimated
at about one-half of the original appraisal estimate: about 13% as compared
to the original 27% for SE and about 8% as compared to the original
estimate of 15% for RN. In both cases, actual production and cost data
were used, combined with assumptions based on those made either during
appraisal or during the economic analysis of the follow-up projects
(Northeast Rural Development I and II Projects - Loans 2523 and 2524-BR).
The principal reasons for the lower than expected rates of return are: (a)
a lower than expected number of direct beneficiaries (para. 3.n2); (b) the
lack of production and investment credit (para. 3.04); and (c) the
unusually severe and prolonged drought from 1979 to 1983 (Annex I, Table 6;
and Annex II, Table 6).



- 13 -
Other Benefits
4.04      A number of project benefits are not reflected in the economic
rate of return analysis. Road transport, basic health and education
facilities, and safe drinking water became much more accessible in the
project areas, either because they were directly financed 1; the projects
or because the projects attracted complementary investments. Small cities
within each project area grew at an impressive pace during the project
implementation period. While mainly explained by exogenous factors,
increased demand for products (e.g., small irrigation equipment in RN) and
services (e.g., open-air markets) arising from project investments helped
to stimulate an increased level of economic activity. Finally, the
institutional development and training which took place under the projects
will result in significant cost savings and efficiency gains for future
rural development activities.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      Numerous federal, regional, and state agencies were involved in
the planning, execution, coordination, and supervision of the projects.
As implementation proceeded, both planning capabilities and the handling of
common, execution problems improved noticeably.  The projects succeeded in
strengthening the provision of services to small farmers to the extent that
some agencies, such as the extension service, redefined their general
institutional priorities toward small farmers. Project administration was
not without problems, however. Competition (and duplication) among the
various levels of government and among agencies at each level and the rapid
expansion of staff and bureaucratic procedures hampered efficiency. Lack
of clarity and constant changes (formal and informal) in the definition of
responsibilities diminished institutional accountability within the
POLONORDESTE program, including the RN and SE projects.
Federal Level
5.02      Through the years, the projects were subject to a number of
different coordinating arrangements at the federal level. Regardless of
the arrangements, responsibility for major program decisions remained
diffuse, involving a number of different ministries. The lack of clear
institutional leadership at the federal level was at least partially
responsible for the persistence of several major project problems,
including those related to credit and counterpart funding.
Regional Level
5.03      The POLONORDESTE unit within SUDENE provided regional
coordination and supervision for the entire POLONORDESTE program, including
the RN and SE projects. Although the unit managed to perform necessary
administrative tasks (e.g. budget consolidation) which allowed program
implementation to proceed, it was never able to fulfill its technical
assistance and quality control roles. SUDENE's overall institutional



- 14 -
difficulties, coupled with the unit's lack of status within SUDENE, created
permanent shortages in financial and human resources. In particular, the
shortage of trained, motivated personnel was acute. As a result, the
POLONORDESTE unit at times was perceived by both federal and state agencies
as little more than an additional layer of bureaucracy.
State Level
5.04      Considering the constraints (e.g. lack of authority, funding
shortages), the state project units' coordination performance was
satisfactory (para. 3.08). 1. addition, project preparation and evaluation
skills improved noticeably in both states. The performance of the SFR unit
ia particularly noteworthy since it did not experience the increase in
taff which characterized the RN and most other Northeast project units.
Among state executing agencies, performance was mixed. Increases were
nearly universal in geographic coverage and services directed toward small
farmers. F'r some activities, such as land services, integrated farm
management research, inland fisheries, and rural water supply, the projects
succeeded in creating execution capacity where virtually none had existed
prior to the project. Despite these advances, the quality of project
services, such as extension, health and education, was higaly variable, and
in some cases, did little to improve prevailing conditions. An important
factor was the absence of beneficiary participation in project planning and
implementation. Such participation not only could have resolved certain
project design and implementation issues, but would have increased
institutional accountability.
5.05      Despite complex administrative arrangements, the projects made
significant advances in setting up the institutions and systems required
for the successful execution and management of rural development
activities. While there is a continuing need for improvement, an
institutional framework is now in place which caii be effectively utilized
in the implementation of the second generation NRDP. Many of the
administrative arrangements and operating procedures, such as the role of
the coordinating unit and the .se of annual operating plans, have been
incorporated into the NRDP. Also, building on the lessons from the
projects, planning of the NRDP has focused on providing clear federal
leadership, strengthening regional coordination and supervision, and
increasing beneficiary involvement.
VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      Bank performance was mixed.  The Bank made important
contributions through these two projects to Brazilian rural development
policy. The emphasis on small farmers, the attempt to integrate related
services, the production orientation coupled with the poverty orientation,
and the focus on land tenure improvement as a necessary condition for
Northeast rural development were ideas strongly promoted by the Bank that
subsequently were fully adopted by the Government. Not all of the Bank's
influence was beneficial, however. A number of elements introduced by the
Bank in project design were not well suited to the specific circumstances
in each state, and in some cases were rejected from the onset by the



- 15 -
executing agencies (e.g., State Government intermediation in land rental
contracts in RN, and extension agents exclusively dedicated to credit in
SE). In other cases, activities which in retrospect seem fundamental, such
as water resource development and drought management activities in RN, were
omitted from the original design. The result was that the RN project, in
particular, existed in a perpetual state of "being redesigned." It is also
tempting to say that the Bank was overly optimistic during both projects'
appraisals regarding the physical targets and the five-year implementation
period. However, the Bank appraisal missions actually reduced targets and
costs and had a moderating influence over Government planners who were much
more optimistic.
6.02      Despite a substantial commitment of Bank resources, supervision
of both projects was inadequate in a number of aspects. During Phase I of
the RN project and throughout most of the SE project, the quantity of field
supervision was sufficient. However, with the Phase II expansion in RN, it
became increasingly difficult, given available resources, to adequately
supervise implementation in all of the project sub-areas. In addition, the
focus of supervision efforts may not have been the most effective. In RN,
from 1981 on and in SE, from 1983 on, significant Bank attention was
diverted to preparing new components or follow-up protects instead of
supervising on-going activities. In both projects, recommendations on
technical matters were sometimes vague, and some components were not
adequately supervised, in part because missions did not consistently
include the appropriate specialists. In many ways, the number and diverse
nature of project components were more of a problem for Bank supervision
than for the states implementing the projects. Finally, much supervision
time was spent on major implementation difficulties, including
institutional issues, funding delays, and credit shortages. This time was
well spent, but the dialogue on these issues would have been more effective
if a part of the total supervision time dedicated to these and similar
projects had been set aside to address the issues in a continuing and
coordinated fashion and on a program-wide basis.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The RN and SE projects were the first and fifth in a series of
ten Bank-financed integrated rural development projects in Northeast Brazil
approved between 1976 and 1983. The projects helped to focus Government
attention on the need to raise rural living standards in the impoverished
Northeast, as well as the potential contribution of small farmers in
increasing food production. Partly as a result of the experiences
generated in these two projects, the Government in April 1985 approved a
new multibillion dollar 15-year development initiative for Northeast
Brazil. The Projeto Nordeste is based on a new regional development
strategy which emphasizes investment in agriculture and places priority on
increasing small farmer production and productivity.
7.02      The 15-year Projeto Nordeste timeframe stems from the recognition
that objectives were Qnly partially achieved in the first-generation rural
development projects. In the RN project, after more than eight years, most
physical targets were achieved. In SE, after more than six years, some



- 16-
physical targets were achieved (e.g., healthpost and school construction),
but others fell short of the goals set during appraisal. The projects
shared a number of implementation difficulties. The lack of secure land
tenure and the projects' inability to provide effective land services,
limited the number of direct beneficiaries. The relative abundance of
highly subsidized credit until 1983 and the scarcity of credit at any
interest rate, thereafter, distorted farm investment decisions and
influenced farmers' adoption of technical recommendations. At the same
time, research and extension efforts did not pay sufficient attention to
the affordability of technical packages. A severe and prolonged drought
from 1979 to 1983 resulted in massive crop losses, particularly in RN.
Finally, serious shortages and delays in counterpart funding and the lack
of clear administrative leadership and adequate technical guidance from
involved federal and regional ministries and agencies hampered the states'
ability to implement the projects. Many of these problems were regional or
national in scope, and needed to be addressed on a program-wide basis.
7.03      Because of these difficulties, the projects' economic rates of
return are now estimated at about one-half of the original estimates: 8% in
RN and 13% in SE. Despite lower than expected rates of return, surveys
show that in both projects adopting farmers' incomes increased
substantially. Yield increases appear to have played a major role in SE,
while in RN crop diversification and area increases contributed heavily.
In addition, roads, health and education facilities, and access to safe,
potable water were improved throughout the project areas. Increased demand
for products and services arising from project investments helped to
stimulate economic activity and the growth of small cities. Finally, the
projects, through institutional development and training, have left behind
an institutional framework which can be built upon to increase the
efficiency of future rural development efforts.
7.04      The Bank played an important, and on the whole, positive role in
both the design and implementation of the projects. However, Bank
supervision of the projects could have been more effective had it been more
sharply focused. Although the missions did a reasonable job of detecting
and analyzing major implementation problems, in retrospect, many of these
problems went beyond the scope of an individual project supervision mission
and should have been handled on a program-wide basis. Also, too much
supervision time was devoted to preparation of follow-up projects. All of
this meant that less Bank attention was focused on concrete technical
issues and ways of improving delivery systems, although this may have been
appropriate under the circumstances. Finally, it is clear that the Bank
structure is not well-adapted to the supervision of multisectoral projects.
7.05      A number of lessons can be drawn from these projects.  Many of
these lessons have been incorporated into the "second generation" Northeast
Rural Development Program which began in 1985 and can be reflected in
future rural development programs:
(a) In projects which are the first phase of a long-term investment
program, fundamental development constraints, such as insecure
land tenure or uncertain water availability, should receive
priority treatment in project design and investment.



- 17 -
(b) The degree of institutional development, an essential factor in
the implementation of a successful rural development program,
should be taken into account when deciding upon specific project
objectives and estimating the project investment period and rate
of return.
(c) In rural development project design, there is a need for
increased "built-in" flexibility, through the establishment of
indicative targets and explicit recognition of the project as a
"time slice" ir. a long-term investment program, in the appraisal
report; in the legal documents, similar flexibility could be
achieved through fewer detailed covenants.
(d) In countries where the Bank is supporting a number of similar
projects, supervision should be reorganized so that a part of the
overall supervision time for the projects is set aside to address
common problems of a regional or national scope in a coordinated
fashion.
(e) Loan disbursement performance is not necessarily a good indicator
or proxy for project implementation performance or impact.

Telex No. 048 of March 10, 1987. I acknowledge receipt of the preliminary
draft of the project completion report on the Rio Grande do Norte Rural
Development Project and the Sergipe Rural Development Project-Tabuleiros Sul.
The report covers the formulation, implementation and performance of the
projects in question, together with the problems encountered during project
execution, thus providing a valuable frame of reference for future projects
focusing on rural development and small farmers. I agree essentially with the
observations made, but would add to the factors that hampered project
implementation the heterogeneous, slow and metropolitan execation structure
and the low level of identification with the action proposed under the
projects. I have requested that the report be studied and will let your
division have our comments as soon as possible.
