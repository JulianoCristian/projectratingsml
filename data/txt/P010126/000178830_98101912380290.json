   increase its domestic oil production through expansion of\n            output from the Toot field; assist OGDC in strengthening its\n            capabilities in the effective conduct of oil operations; and\n            provide the means for evaluating the potential of the\n            recently discovered Dhodak field and preparing for its rapid\n            exploitation. Major project components include: the drilling\n            of eight wells and provision of surface facilities at Toot;\n            logistic support (heavy road transport equipment and a cargo\n            aircraft) for OGDC; a seismic survey and reserve evaluation\n            at Dhodak; provision of instructors and equipment for the\n            Oil & Gas Training Institute; and management and\n            accounting consultancy services for OGDC.
