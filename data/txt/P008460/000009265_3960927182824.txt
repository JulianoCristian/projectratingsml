MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
',  OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
/,                   TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE HUNGARIAN NATIONAL OIL AND GAS TRUST
AND THE FATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
FOR AN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on proposed loans to the
Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) for US$100 million equivalent and
to the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) for US$10 million equivalent is   -
submitted fior approval. The proposed loans would be at the standard IBRD
variable interest rate with 15 years' maturity and would help finance an
energy development and conservation project. OKGT would pay to the Guarantor
a premium of 10% per annum over the Bank rate on the outstanding amount of the
Bank loan.
2.       Background.  The energy sector is central to Hungary's development
process and accounts for an important share of Government investment.  Over
the past 15 years energy investments have accounted for up to 15% of total
national investment and about two thirds of the volume of investments financed
by the central Government budget. Even with this high level of investment,
Hungary has had to rely on imports for a large share of its energy needs,
accounting in 1987 for 48% of total primary energy consumption. Hungary is a
mature oil and gas producer, resulting in a declining trend in discoveries.
Continuing exploration efforts are justified but will increasingly have to
involve the most modern techniques and a more integrated exploration
approach. Through the 1970s, Hungary's energy policy was directed to meeting
the needs of a capital and energy intensive industrial investment program,
while energy prices below economic cost encouraged overall energy consumption
growth. In the present decade there has been a gradual shift towards greater
emphasis on demand management, supported by substantial improvements in energy
policies. Further improvements are needed, in particular concerning energy
pricing and the loss-making coal subsector.  Hungary's energy consumption per
unit of GNP is still well above that of most developed countries with market
economies. The income elasticity of demand, which has declined considerably
in this decade, needs to be reduced further and thus limit the need for new
investments in the sector, thereby permitting more substantial investments in
the directly productive sectors of the economy, in line with the Government's
strategy. This would require active demand management including an improved
pricing structure, and a carefully optimized investment program including in
the oil and gas sector.   The Bank has supported the Government's energy
policies in the past decade through four energy sector projects (two energy
conservation projects, a petroleum project and a power project), all of which
are being effectively implemented.



-2-
3.       Rationale for'Bank Involvement.  Since lending to Hungary began in
1983, the Bank's country assistance strategy has focused on supporting
Hungary's program of reform and structural adjustment to make the economy more
efficient, flexible, market-oriented and competitive, especially in
convertible currency markets. In recent years, this strategy has been
implemented mainly through a series of hybrid loans for industrial
restructuring, combining quick disbursing funds to support institutional and
policy reform, and investment funds to support restructuring at the enterprise
and subsector levels. Investment loans in other sectors have also supported
implementation of the reform, as well as improvement in enterprise
efficiency. Following the adoption by the Government in 1987 of medium-term
program of stabilization and adjustment to correct imbalances created by
economic deterioration, the Bank stepped up its aup:ort to the reform through
an industrial sector adjustment loan. This loan, combined with an IMF Standby
in 1988, pLovided crucial external support to strengthen the Government's
increased reform and adjustim-et efforts. The Bank's assistance strategy will
continue to support the Goverrment in carrying out its adjustment efforts. It
will address medium to long term constraints to sustainable growth, assist in
developing institutional capacity in line with systemic reforms, and help
ensure Hungary's continued access to axternal financing. In the energy
sector, the Bank's policy dialogue has resulted in significant improvements in
policies and support for the strengthening of sector institutions, in line
with the development objectives. Continued Bank support is important for the
policy framework to develop in line with overall Government objectives,
removing the significant remaining distortions in energy pricing, making the
priciqg system more responsive to border price movements, and strengthening
the capabilities and autonomy of the leading enterprises in the energy
sector. This is particularly important at the present stage of energy policy
reform due to the sensitive social implications of pending policy changes. At
the same time, the sector enterprises, particularly within oil and gas, need
outside stimulus and support to modify significantly their traditional
organization and mode of operations. Within the energy sector, the petroleum
subsector is expected to suffer a sharp decline in economic production unless
measures are taken to broaden participation in the industry and to modify the
existing exploration practices, while the coal mining companies need to have
more autonomy and responsibility for their investment decisions and e:onomic
results, without counting on Government subsidies.
4.       Prolect Obiectives.  The main Project objectives are to support: (i)
significant improvements in the policy and institutional framework of the
energy sector including appropriate pricing coupled with subsidy elimination,
restructuring of the coal mining sector and improved investment planning in
the power subsector; (ii) development of the oil and gas sector througn
gradual restructuring of the national oil and gas company (OKGT), opening up
the sector to foreign investment, an improved petroleum taxation and
regulatory framework, and financing of priority investments; and (iii)
preparation of an updated energy conservation program and financing of related
investments. These measures will strengthen demand management, improve
resource utilization and reduce the energy sector's demand for investment
funds.
5.       Project Description.  The Project, of which the Bank loan to OKGT
would finance the convertible currency component, would include high-priority
investment subprojects in oil and gas field development, upgrading and
enhanced recovery, underground gas storage and pipeline network improvements,



3-
in addition to exploration and production equipment and studies, technical
assistance and training. The investment subprojects have all been evaluated
by the Bank, and found to meet minimum technical, economic and environmental
criteria. (In one,case, the detailed project design is being reviewed in
order to increase further its viability.) The Bank's evaluation of the
subprojects proposed for financing has already been instrumental in
significant improvements in their design and costing.
6.       The OKGT loan will also support the opening of Hungary's petroleum
industry to international investment as well as OKGT's institutional
development, building on the technical in'provements achieved under the first
*  etroleum project.  Consultants have been recruited to help prepare a
contractual framework for international oil companies to undertake exploration
and production in Hungary. OKGT will strengthen the emphasis on its core
activities (oil and gas exploration, production, transport and refining) and
implement selectively an improved management information system. its
exploration activities will be reoriented towards a more integrated approach
in order to explore for reserves in geologically complex locations; the
exploration decision process will be more clearly based on economic criteria;
and the service activities will be organized in separate units. OKGT will
prepare a strategy for developing gradually an export market for some of its
petroleum services.
7.       The loan to NBH will provide foreign exchange iinancing for the
energy conservation program financed through NBH and the participating
commercial banks to support conservation subprojects initiated by the
enterprises themselves. Onlending for an individual subproject will be
limited to US$1.5 million equivalent and would be for a maturity not exceeding
12 years including three years of grace. The funds will be onlent through
commercial banks on a first-come first-served basis in continuation of ongoing
Bank loans, and will finance the direct foreign exchange costs of (a)
industrial and other enterprises for eligible enexgy saving and background
industry subprojects, and (b) energy monitoring equipment required by
enterprises and institutes to strengthen their ability to monitor energy use
effectively and carry out energy audits.
8.       Procurement will be based on Bank guidelines.  Revolving funds of
US$7.0 million and US$2.0 million for OKGT and NBH, respectively (equal to
about four months of disbursements), and retroactive financing for OKGT of up
to uTS$10 million equivalent (10% of the US$100 million loan to OKGT) are
proposed.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. The procurement method and disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Gr9up
operations in Hungary are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7674-HU dated April 3, 1989 and a map are also attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, agreements were obtained from the
Government, OKGT and NBH on: (i) The Government's energy policies and actions
including confirmation of the basic energy pricing program and bringing the
prices of all energy carriers up to the level of their economic costs, and the
elimination of all preferential energy consumer prices by 1991 (for natural
gas, night electricity in the whole country, and day electricity in the rural
areas and smaller urban areas) and 1993 (for coal, district heating, and day
time electricity in Budapest and the other large cities) in approximately
equal annual increments. As a first step, the Government intends to put into



-4-
effect before October 1989 consumer price increases with a weighted average of
more than 20%, including adjustments of more than 30% for coal and more than
352 for day time electricity in Budapest. These price increases will
represent a significant first step in the price adjustment process; (ii)
OKGT's institutional development policies aiming at reorienting it towards
more efficient institutional organization and practices; (iii) OKGT's
technical assistance program under the project, including for management
information system, export market strategy, field development practices,
drilling and well-stimulation practices, exploration methodology and petroleum
contracts; (iv) OKGT's use of qualified consultants in exploration management;
(v) OKGT continuing to meet miinimum financial ratios for pre-tax profits
(minimum 8% of resources used), long term debt/service coverage ratio (at
least 1.5), current ratio (at least '.5), and long term debt to equity ratio
(maximum 60:40), and continuing to prepare satisfactory financial statements
and to have these audited by an acceptable external auditor; (vi) the
modernization of the framework for the Government's oil and gas regulations
with the aim of expanding OKGT's operational autonomy; and (vii) NBH onlending
the proceeds of the energy conservation loan to participating commercial banks
for relending to enterprises for eligible energy conservation investment.
Eligible banks will be those classified as eligible participating banks under
industrial restructuring projects.
10.      OKGT has sent to the Bank a Letter on its Institutional Strategy that
places heavy emphasis on the need to base operational and investment decisions
on profitability criteria, in the context of increasing operational autonomy
and increased concentration on the core oil and gas activities. It is
intended to transform'OKGT into a joint stock company, when this is permitted
under the evolving lego'l framework, and there will be an institutional
development program aimeJ at improved efficiency and integration of technical
disciplines and the separation of service activities into separate units. The
oil and gas exploration methodology will be modified, including through the
help of integrated sub basin geological studies. Foreign investment in
exploration and production will be welcomed based on a contractual framework
now under preparation.
11.      Benefits.  Significant improvements in the energy pricing structure,
supported by the Project, will: bring consumer prices gradually in line with
producer prices and thus eliminate energy-related subsidies, remove the
pricing preferences for certain industries, and abolish power pricing
anomalies for certain regions and in peak-off peak pricing. Together with
steps to strengthen power investment planning these measures will provide an
improved policy framework, restrain the growth in energy demand and encourage
rational inter-fuel substitution. The coal restructuring program supported
under the Project will eliminate subsidies from the Government's budget,
establish criteria for the support of new investments and promote the closing
of uneconomic mines together with a rationalization of the surface activities
of the mining companies. The Project will result in the opening of the
petroleum sector to international investment and in a significant
strengthening of OKGT, which will continue to play an important role in the
Hungarian petroleum sector.  Together, these measures should make it possible
to reduce the rate of decline in domestic oil and gas production.
12.      The OKGT subloan will finance high priority development investment
subprojects with ERRs of from 17 to several hundred percent. In addition, the
Project will also finance high priority OKGT investments in pipeline



debottlenecking and upgrading and expansion of Hungary's underground gas
storage capacity, permitt1ng the delivery of gas in the high demand winter
season. The energy conservation subprojects will assist Hungary in achieving
energy savings. The subprojects will meet high minimum rate of return
criteria (182 in line with minimum rate of return criteria for ongoing energy
conservation projects in Hungary), and on the basis of the subproject pipeline
and past experience, should show ERRs of 25%-35% and more, which are well
above the estimated opportunity cos- of capital.  The energy conservation
subprojects are expected to have a positive environmental impact by reducing
energy waste.
13.      Risks.  The Project has set ambitious objectives which could turn out
to be difficult to achieve in full if the policy and institutional changes
should take longer to implement or yield results than now expected, e.g., for
social or political reasons. These risks are considered to be within
acceptable limits in light of the analysis and dialogue that has preceded the
Government and OKGT undertakings and the overall commitment to sustained
policy reform. Further, the Project provides for carefully designed
consulting support and consistent Bank follow-up. The OKGT subprojects have
been well prepared and carefully examined and thus present low technical
risks. All subprojects have also been reviewed for their environmental
impact. Special risks were found in only two subprojects, where sour gas and
COz create corrosion and embrittlement problems. These risks are being
addressed satisfactorily in project design.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with tte Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
D4 ectors approve the proposed loans.
