The\n            project is composed of two loans. First, a loan to the\n            Hungarian National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) to finance the\n            direct convertible currency component of investment\n            subprojects for oil and gas field development, upgrading and\n            enhanced recovery, underground gas storage, pipeline\n            expansion and modernization. Also, the loan will finance\n            exploration and production equipment and technical\n            assistance. The seond loan is to the National Bank of\n            Hungary (NBH) to finance energy conservation subprojects\n            through participating commercial banks in continuation of\n            the ongoing lines of credit for this purpose."}, "docdt": "1989-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
