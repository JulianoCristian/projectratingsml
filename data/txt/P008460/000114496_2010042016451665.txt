(a)
For  withdrawals  of   the  Authorized  Allocation,  the

Categories for Parts A  and  B  of  the  Project shall follow such
procedures as the Bank  shall  specify  by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals  shall  be  made  only  after  and to the
extent that the  Bank  shall  have  been  satisfied  that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will  be  utilized  in making payments for eligible
expenditures.
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of the Special  Account:  (i) was made for an expendi-
ture or in an amount not  eligible pursuant to paragraph

payment or  the  portion  thereof  not  so  eligible or justified.

Bank into the Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has
provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be
.
