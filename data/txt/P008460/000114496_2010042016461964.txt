Borrower shall furnish to  the  Bank  a  request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which  do  not  exceed the aggregate amount of
the  Authorized  Allocation.
On  the  basis  of  such  request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
 
(b)  (i)
For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account,  the
Borrower shall  furnish  to  the  Bank requests for
deposits into the Special Account at such intervals
as the Bank shall specify.
 
(ii)
Prior to or at the  time  of each such request, the
Borrower shall furnish  to  the  Bank the documents
and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph
4
of this Schedule  for  the  payment  or payments in
respect of which replenishment is requested. On the
basis of  each  such  request,  the  Bank shall, on
behalf of  the  Borrower,  withdraw  from  the Loan
Account and deposit  into  the Special Account such
amount as the Borrower  shall have requested and as
shall have been shown  by  said documents and other
evidence to  have  been  made  out  of  the Special
Account for eligible expenditures.
 
All such deposits shall  be  withdrawn  by  the Bank from the Loan
Account  under  the  respective  eligible  Category,  and  in  the
respective equivalent amounts,  as  shall  have  been justified by
said documents and other evidence.

For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the  Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to  the  Bank such documents and other

5.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph
3
of  this
Schedule, the Bank shall not  be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
 
(a)
if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be  made  by the Borrower directly from
the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph
(a)
of Section
2.02 of this
Agreement; or
(b)
once the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible  Category  for  Part  A  of  the Project, less the
amount of any outstanding  special  commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant  to  Section
5.02
of  the  General Conditions with
respect to Part A of  the  Project,  shall equal the equivalent of
twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
 
Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan  allocated to the eligible Category
for Part A of the Project shall follow such procedures as the Bank
Page  12
shall specify by notice to  the Borrower
.
Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after  and  to  the  extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all  such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized
in making payments for eligible expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment  out  of  the  Special   Account:  (i)
was  made  for  an
expenditure or in an amount  not  eligible pursuant to paragraph
2
of this  Schedule;  or
(ii)
was  not  justified  by the evidence
furnished to the Bank,  the  Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A)
provide  such  additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or
(B) deposit  into  the Special Account (or, if the
Bank shall so request, refund to  the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or  the  portion thereof not so eligible or
justified.
Unless  the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree,  no further
deposit by the Bank into  the  Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided  such  evidence  or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.
 
(b)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special  Account will not be required to
cover further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
 
(c)
The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion  of  the  funds  on deposit in the Special
Account.
(d)
Refunds to the Bank  made  pursuant to paragraphs
6
(a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or  for  cancellation in accordance with
the relevant provisions of  this  Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
