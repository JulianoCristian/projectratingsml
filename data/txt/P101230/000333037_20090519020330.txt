Implementing Agency  MinistryofFinance andEconomic Affairs
Financing Data       SDR 127.7 million (US$190 million equivalent); standard IDA terms: 40-
                     year maturity with a l0-year grace period; single Tranche
Operation Type       DevelopmentPolicy Lending
Main Policy Areas    This PRSC series focuses on two overarching objectives: (1) sustaining
                     high and shared economic growth; and (2) expanding the effective
                     delivery of basic public services through the government budget. In line
                     with Tanzania's       Growth and      Poverty     Reduction   Strategy   (or
                     MKUKUTA), these objectives map out into three broad policy clusters:
                     (i)growthandpovertyreduction;(ii) oflifeandsocialwellbeing;
                                                           quality
                     and (iii) governance and accountability. Specific program outcomes under
                     the growth and poverty reduction cluster are: (i)Improve business
                     environment by maintaining a conducive macro framework and reducing
                     administrative barriers; (ii)
                                                 Increase access o f private sector to key inputs,
                     inparticular credit and backbone services; and (iii)  Improve livelihoods in
                     rural areas where the majority of the poor work, through improved

                                    I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      This program document proposes a Seventh Poverty Reduction Credit (PRSC-7) for
Tanzania in an amount of US$190 million. This is the fourth credit in a series of five annual
PRSC operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the implementation of Tanzania's National Strategy
for Growth and Reduction of Poverty 2005-2010 (known as MKUKUTA).

2.       The Bank's PRSC supportto Tanzaniais provided within aharmonized framework for
general budget support (GBS) with 13 other development partners (DP), comprising a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM)
for GBS for the implementation of MKUKUTA,and ajoint reviewprocess, culminating in a
joint Annual Review (AR) in October/November. The framework is designed to support
domestic accountability, reduce transaction costs (especially for the government), and
encouragethe further development anduse of Tanzania's own systems. The program structure
follows the three pillars of Tanzania's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (MKUKUTA),
namely Growth andReduction of Income Poverty, Social Well-Being, and Governance.

3.       Within the overall GBS framework, the PRSC series focuses on two sets of objectives:
(1) sustaining high and shared economic growth; and (2) expanding the effective delivery of
basic public services through the government budget. Given the advanced stage of reforms in
Tanzania, these two main strategic areas map out into seven operational policy areas for the
PRSC series: (1.1) agriculture and natural resources; (1.2) infrastructure; (1-3) environment
for private sector development; (2.1) monitoring of service delivery in social sectors; (2.2)
public expenditure and financial management; (2.3) effectiveness of public administration;
and (2.4) anti-comption and accountability of the State which is receiving heightened
attention from the government, domestic stakeholders anddevelopment partners.

4.      This operation builds on previous achievements under PRSC-4 through 6, and
addresses emerging challenges and risks, posed inparticular by: (i) modest progress since
                                                                       the
2001 with respect to income-poverty reduction, as revealed by the publication of new poverty
data; (ii)the impact of the global economic downturn; and (iii)a slow-down in economic
reforms on several fronts, which, given the strategic alignment of this PRSC series on a
critical set of policy measures, is reflected ina lack-luster performance of PRSC-7.

5.      The trends inpoverty reduction are describedinSection I1below, andthe implications
in terms of program design for PRSC-7 and 8, notably an increased focus on income
generation and rural areas, are discussed in Section V of this document. The impact of the
crisis on Tanzania i s discussed in "Recent Economic Developments and Outlook" in Section
11, and the Bank responses are discussed in "Operation Description" in Section V. The
progress on the government program supportedby PRSC and on the broader policy spectrum,
and the options to addressperformance shortfalls, are described in SectionV under "Summary
of Overall Progress" and "Description of Policy Areas".

POVERTY OUTLOOK
6.     The recent Household Budget Survey (HBS) depicts mixed progress in poverty
reduction. Higher economic growth and public spending inthe last six years have contributed
to sizable improvements with respect to the ownership of durable consumer goods and
housing quality, as well as some social indicators, included those related to education. Other
important measuresof poverty such as basic-needs income poverty, and social indicators, such
as those for nutritionand water access, have shown little progressor evendeterioration.

7.     Between 2001 and 2007, basic-needs income-poverty incidence fell slightly in
mainland Tanzania. The poverty headcount ratio declined and so did the poverty depth and
poverty intensity. Poverty incidence in Tanzania mainland fell by 2.2 percentage points from
35.7 percent in 2000/01 to 33.5 percent in 2007, implying an increase in the total number of
poor by around 1.3 million, given population growth. The reduction inthe headcount poverty
ratio has been largely uniform between rural and urban areas. Income inequality did not
worsen on average. The dynamics of income-poverty were driven therefore mainly by low
growth in real private consumption, which increased by only 5 percent in per capita terms
over the whole 6 year period, as a cumulative increase of the price of the basic needs
consumption basket by 93 percent erodedthe real value of consumption.

8.     The MKUKUTA objective to reduce poverty to 19 percent by 2010 is clearly
unattainable, while the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) objective to reduce it to 19
percent by 2015 is off-track. As Figure 1 illustrates, in2000/01 Tanzania was already off track
to achieving the MDG objective, but between 2001 and 2007 the situation aggravated. An
analysis of the distributionof consumption suggeststhat achieving the MDGremains feasible,
because a relatively large mass o f households have consumption levels not far below the
poverty line. The MDG objective could still be achieved if economic growth were to move
these households across the poverty line. To do so an annual broad-based real consumption
growth of 3.2 percent per capita would be required (or a 29 percent increase between2007 and
2015). This is an ambitious and achievable objective, albeit the deterioration of the global
environment makes it quite challenging.

9.      Economic growth reduced poverty in the country as a whole by 2.3 percentage points
while a slight increase in inequality increased poverty by 0.1 point. Inparticular inrural areas
where 74 percent o f the population resides, very little change was observed: consumption
growth was negligible, while inequality remained largely unchanged except for the extreme
tail ends o fthe distribution.

10.     The HBS results show a significant increase inownership o f consumer durables which
contrasts with the modest increase in household consumption. All households, poor and rich,
rural and urban, report increased ownership o f consumer durables. The observed increase in
consumer durables reflects a reduction in their relative prices              -the overall real value o f
consumer durables has remained largely unchanged between the two surveys                 - and possibly
savings from the above-average agriculture years. The increase in consumer durables i s
mirrored in improvements inhousing conditions which can be observed inall areas and for all
quintiles. The ownership o f productive assets in agriculture, however, shows a marked
decline. The HBS also reports on important trends inthe social sectors, which are detailed in
the Social Development Sectiono fthis document.

11.     Overall, given that poverty is multi-dimensional, an adequate reflection on progress in
poverty reduction needs to take the various dimensions o f economic welfare into account.
This i s particularly relevant for Tanzania where one finds limited progress in some
dimensions (income poverty; household consumption, nutrition, value o f durables and assets),
regressions in other (water; ownership o f productive assets) and progress in yet others
(ownership o f consumer durables, access to health and education).                  The lack of strong
progress in basic needs income-poverty, resulting from slow growth in private consumption
coupled with rising prices, indicates the need to address in priority supply side constraints to
private sector income generation at the micro-economic level, particularly in the rural areas,
while ensuringa higher level o fprice stability at the macro-economic level.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
12.     Tanzania has sustainedsolid growth of around 7 percent per year since 2000. In2007,
the economy is estimatedto have grownby about 7.1 percent.Notwithstanding the worsening
international environment in the second half of 2008, favorable domestic factors - such as
better rains and continued economic momentum - have contributed to underpin robust
economic growth (estimated at 7.0 percent GDP). Overall, Tanzania has maintained a good
record of macro-economic stability. Fiscal policy, while strongly expansionary since 2000 on
the back of a large increaseinforeign aid, has remainedbroadly on aprudenttrack, sustained
by particularly strong domestic revenue performance coupled with large debt relief. The
underlying increase in public expenditures has allowed a significant expansion of service
delivery in both the infrastructure and social sectors, albeit administrative and miscellaneous
expenditures have also been rising fast. Inflation, however, has been above the government
target of 5 percent since 2004. It has significantly accelerated in 2007 and 2008 as
international commodity inflation added to domestic liquidity pressures, and it hovered at
around 13 percent in the last quarter of 2008 and early 2009. As mentioned above, the HBS
indicated an evenhigher price increasefor households over the 2001-2007 period.

13.      The real effective exchange rate, whichwas overvalued at the beginning ofthe decade,
has converged to a more competitive level. The external position of Tanzania remained
strong, with increasing official reserves covering around 4-5 months of imports. Underlying
this trend was, however, a continued widening of the current account balance (excluding
grants), which moved from around 4 percent of GDP to around 11 percent over the last four
years, driven mainly by higher imports. The current account deficit is no longer fully covered
bythe amount of foreign aid, andis more dependenton FDIflows.

solid growth (see Table 2). The 2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) estimatedthat
three quarters o f the increase in the GDP growth rate, from less than 4 percent in the late
1990s to around 7 percent in the first half of the 2000s, could be attributed to higher
government spending, fueled to a significant extent by larger aid flows. Even so, the private
sector still contributes around half of the overall GDP growth rate, and Tanzania's share o f
world exports has been increasing steadily since the mid-90s, mainly on the back of a large
growth in gold exports, although manufacturing exports have also experienced significant
dynamism.

15.      Overall, there are signs of an incipient structural transformation, albeit slow and
concentrated in a few urban areas. Key constraints in infrastructure and in the business
environment are not being removed sufficiently fast, and in some areas, such as the port
operation or business licensing and registration, the country has beenexperiencing reversals
inrecent years. Accumulation of modern technology and skills is proceeding very gradually,
with a large part of the population still employed in low productivity agriculture, requiring
sustained efforts to improve education, especially at the secondary and tertiary levels. The
growth inpublic spending may not be sustained at the same level. There i s a broad consensus
that the country needs a more operational shared-growth strategy, built on the country's
comparative and competitive advantages, which could help to consistently prioritize and
screen economic policy and public investment. In the near term, sustained high growth will
have to rely more on sectors such as transport and logistics, tourism and natural resources, and
a more dynamic agriculture sector. Qualified humanresources required for such growth will
continue to be of critical importance.

16.      Although agricultural GDP i s reported to have beengrowing at around 4-5 percent per
year, the data on rural income growth and productive assets from the Household Budget
Survey suggest that income generation in rural areas has stagnated. Yields of staple crops, a



                                                     5

mainstay of the livelihood for the predominantly poor subsistence farmers, appear to have
been flat or declining, with agricultural growth primarily driven by extension of cultivated
areas, along with shifts inthe composition of crop production. Inthe cash crop sector, the very
gradual pace of reform of Crop Boards appears to have been accompaniedby a surge of new
modalities for licensing, regulations, supporting anti-competitive practices which hinder
profitability for the smaller farmers and businesses.

17.     The natural resource sector, including tourism, mining, forestry, and fisheries, is a
significant supplement to the subsistence for a majority of Tanzanians, and it fosters the
environment on which much of the population's health depends, and provides the basis for
much of the economic non-farm growth in the formal and informal economy. Natural
resources are positively contributing to economic output, and are expected to be a growing
source of income, generating exports from traditional activities such as forestry, fisheries,
mining, and tourism. However, recent evidence indicates shortfalls in governance and law
enforcement leading to unsustainableuse of these resources that undermines shared economic
growth inthis sector.

18.     Over the past five to six years, the government has made significant efforts to improve
the business environment through several reform programs, including the Business
Environment Strengthening Program (BEST), a Tax Modernization Plan (TMP), and the
Second Generation Financial Sector Reform. These cover: (i) reform; (ii) reform;
                                                                labor              land
(iii)business registration and licensing reform; (iv) tax administration reform; (v) regulatory
reform and (vi) financial sector reform. While tax and financial sector reforms have proceeded
positively, business environment reforms have lagged inimplementation and consistency, and
their impact to date has beenmarginal. Also, some recent government measureswith respect
to market regulations, foreign direct investment, and the minimum wage, while well-
intentioned, may be problematic with respect to sustaining a conducive and reliable
environment for the private sector.

19.     Tanzania ranks low interms of its business environment, being ranked 127 inthe 2009
Cost of Doing Business (CoDB) indicators. Tanzania actually dropped two places in the
CoDB rankings this year, reflecting a slack inPSD reforms, after being one of the world's ten
top reformers in 2006. The recent Investment Climate Assessment reveals that while large
firms are faring relatively well in terms of productivity, there i s a large discrepancy with
smaller-sized firms compared to neighboring countries, indicating that excessive regulation
might directly favor larger and better connectedfirms.

20.     The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) revealsthat the major constraint to formal
firms i s energy. Overall, infrastructure bottlenecks are still a serious constraint to private
investment in Tanzania, and while some sectors, such as road and energy, are gradually
improving their performance and institutional setup, others, such as the port, railways, and
water sectors, are still underperforming. The inadequate capacity of government to handle
PPP transactions inan efficient andtransparent way has limitedthe contribution o f the private
sector to the finance and management of infrastructure in Tanzania. Continued improvement
inthe sector andthe PPPpolicyframework will becriticalto unlock the situation.




                                                6

21.     Tanzania has made considerable progress inthe development of its financial sector in
recentyears, albeit most enterprises - as elsewhere still finance investmentprimarilythrough
                                                     -
retained earnings (68 percent of new investment). The coverage of banking services is still
low, with 10percent of the population reporting operating a bank account in2007, against 6.4
percent in 2000 (HBS). The mainstreaming of micro-credit institutions inthe financial sector
i s a positive development, and the microfinance institutions are expectedto play an important
role in providing access to credit for the poor. The Government i s preparing a rural finance
strategy, coordinated by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust. A new mortgage and leasing
billapprovedthis year should contribute to the development ofthe sector.

22.     The macroeconomic policy mix to support growth and poverty reduction has been less
than fully successful, as it has supported a growth pattern based on public expenditures and
the absorption of large external liquidity flows incapital intensive sectors, suchas miningand
construction. The fast aggregate demand expansion has had a tendency to overtake the
country's supply response, still crippled by infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks, resulting
inhigher prices that have curtailed real household consumption and ultimately dimmedthe
poverty impact of economic growth.

IMPACT OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS AND OUTLOOK
23.     On top of these medium-termissues, the country is now faced with the impact of the
world economic crisis. Tanzania is likely to be affected through the export channel mainly
                                                                                         -
tourism, regional manufacturing exports, cash crops, and natural resources       - and by lower
capital flows   -from private and possibly official assistance sources. Overall, at the macro-
                                                                                                   ,
economic level, Tanzania i s likely to be on the right side o f the commodity price shocks
because of the structure o f its trade balance, which i s heavily influenced by oil on the import
side and gold on the export side. The financial sector i s mainly sound andnot exposedto toxic
assets.

24.     Overall, staffprojects that these shocks could reduce GDP growth to around 5 percent
in 2009, and 3.2 percent under a the lower case scenario. Growth is projected to recover its
pre-crisis level inabout two years (Table 3). The BOP deficit might be inthe order of US$300
million, which would remain relatively manageable given the current level of reserves. On the
fiscal side, domestic revenues may still increase slightly in real terms, but compared to post-
crisis projections, current forecast points to a revenue shortfall ranging between US$250 and
US$450 million. Prudent fiscal policies inrecent years provide scope for relaxing the limit of
zero net domestic financing and allowing the budget deficit to widen. Inagreement with the
IMF, some further fiscal expansion could be envisaged in the 2009/10 budget under
preparation to accommodate revenue shortfall. However, as stressed at the conclusion o f the
recent IMF review mission under Policy Support Instrument (PSI), any planned increased
spending, notably in infrastructure or social protection, should be financed on a sustainable
basis and geared towards fostering long term growth potential or cushioning the most
vulnerable segments of the population from the impact of the crisis on atemporary basis.


25.     The social impact ofthe slowdown, ifuniformly distributed, is estimatedat worst to be
an additional 1 percent in the number of poor, as well as increasedpoverty depth. However,



                                                7

the social impact i s expected to be much larger as shocks are likely to be concentrated and
affect some categories disproportionally. Inthe cash crop sector, coffee, cotton, and cashews
are produced by a large number o f small farmers, totaling some 1.2 million households. The
processing o f these commodities i s made by larger firms that employ around 40,000 formal
employees. At the same time, while many o f the small cash farmers also grow staple foods,
estate workers, landless agricultural laborers, and formal employees may have little fallback
options if their main livelihood disappears. Tourism employs around 300,000 persons, while
non-food-related manufacturing employs another 45,000 persons. These groups are
predominantly urbanworkers, and a marked reductioninemployment would be highlyvisible.

26.      While the poorest subsistence farmers, who are not highly dependent on cash crops,
would not be directly affected by the export slump, they might suffer from lower personal
transfers and government expenditures. Subsistence farmers are also vulnerable to climatic
shocks, and already this year's short rain season, accounting for around 25 percent o f maize
production, has been erratic. A further rain deficit inthe long rain season could create major
food shocks for most o f the poor.

27.     The government's emerging strategy to deal with the impact o f the crisis and o f a
possible drought year i s to: (i)protect public investment         -especially in infrastructure -to
sustain medium-term prospects for shared-growth; (ii)try to support employment by
facilitating credit guarantees by commercial banks to firms in distress; (iii)support food
security through an expansion and reform o f the fertilizer and seeds voucher subsidy scheme,
andthrough a more strategic use ofthe National Grain Reserve stocks. A task force headed by
the Central Bank Governor will review the situation by mid May and propose remedial
measures which could be implemented in the next budget. The Bank will engage with
government to review the scope, modalities, and costs o f these interventions, in as much as
they may require additional funding and would affect growth. To help finance the larger BOP
and fiscal deficit, the government has requested access to the IMF Exogenous Shock Facility
under the PSI for an amount o f around US$330 million, and is also discussing with bilateral
donors extra fundingrelatedto cushioning the impact the international crisis.

incomparator countries. There is also concern that the Student's Loan scheme continues to
gain a larger share of the education budget, while the needs of the secondary level are not
adequately funded. While ESDP has been revised, robust strategies and plans for basic and
secondary levels have yet to be developed. The core challenges for the secondary and higher
education levels are about providing equitable `quality' of education service, improving
learning outcomes, and ensuring fiscal sustainability.

32.     Public social protection mechanisms are currently very limited and fragmented, and
include the community health fund, the national insurance fund, subsidies for social services,
and the Bank-supported Social Fund TASAF, which h d s community-based public works
and has started pilot conditional cash transfers. The government is still finalizing a National
Social Protection Strategy, and the challenges will be to arrive at a strategy that is realistic for
a low-income country, where social vulnerabilities and poverty are deep and widespread. In
this context, the eventual scale-up of social protection mechanisms as a response to the
international economic crisis might not be straightforward. A recent nutrition study by the
Bank showed that malnutrition is widespread, and the best strategy to attack it might be to
leverage synergies with existing social programs, rather than a major nutrition-specific
funding effort.

33.     Following a decade of under-investment,the HBS showed that improvements inwater
access have not been fast enough relative to population growth with access indicators showing
a slight deterioration between2001 and 2007. The most recent data show an increase inaccess
to clean and safe water of 2 and 4 percent inrural andurbanareas, respectively, inthe year up
to mid-2008, thanks to substantial investment by the government, increased participation of
communities, and good rains. It remains necessaryto improve the reliability of data and of the
M&E framework for this sector. The institutional upgrading ofthe sector is proceeding, albeit
at a slow pace, with both the Water Supply Act and Water Resources Management Act has
beenrecently approved by Parliament.

34.     A problem across service delivery sectors concerns the ability of government and
stakeholders to assess both the degree to which strategies are implemented as well as the
impact of strategies. Even in sectors where extensive data is collected, the compilation and
interpretation of data is improving only gradually. This issue has become a main focus of
government-DP GBS dialogue.

35.     High population growth, close to 3 percent annually, still creates huge pressures on
private resources - through increasing dependency rates - and on public resources for social
servicesprovision. Itis unclear ifthe government has an effective policy inthis regard.


GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

36.     Tanzania has made good progress in implementing governance related reforms, as
reflected inits governanceindicators which compare favorably to other Sub-Saharancountries
(ranked inthe first tier of Transparency International corruption perception index and the Mo
Ibrahim governance index). Significant challenges remain, though, including with respect to




                                              10

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

28.      Tanzania ranks 159 out of 177 countries in the UNDP's Human Development Index
(2007/08). The country, under its two successive Poverty Reduction Strategies, has sought to
expand social services. Education, health, AIDS and water all have sector strategies endorsed
by the government and Development Partners.Insome areas, strategies are still beingdefined,
refined, or redefined, e.g. a social protection strategy is just being drafted and a new
HIV/AIDS Multi Sectoral Strategic Framework hasjust been endorsed.

29.      The mainland has completed an extensive external evaluation of healthreforms during
the period 1999-2006. This review, combined with the 2005 DHS findings and the 2008
update shows, that reforms are improving health outcomes, system performance, and
efficiency through better management of domestic and external financing. Health indicators
have generally improved, with under-fivemortality declining from 155 to 112 from 1999 to
2004, although maternal mortality has not shown similar progress, due partly to slow progress
in improving referral care and hospital reforms. In terms of support to the sector, the
evaluation concluded that the SWAP has resultedingreater sector coherence and consistency,
which has secured higher levels of both domestic and external financial resources for health
throughout the evaluation period. The Health Basket Fund has been a particularly effective
mechanism for supporting Local Government Authorities intheir efforts to strengthen council
and district health services, complementing the system of Health Block Grants institutedby
the Government. The robust annual review and ongoing monitoring mechanisms that have
been developed have also played a key role in this success. The new Health Sector Strategic
Plan I11(2009-2015), which i s inthe final stages of approval, focuses on ongoing monitoring
of these key indicators, as well as on specific actions to address the areas that need
improvement, especially maternal mortality.

30,      Ineducation, Tanzania has made impressive strides inincreasing primary enrollment
to achieve full universal primary education, albeit it i s still not on track to achieve it by 2015.
It is now facing major demands at the secondary as well as higher education levels. Recent
official data, however, show that the net enrollment ratio stalled in 2007/08 after years of
increase. The percentage o f cohort' completing Standard VI1 has dropped to 65 percent in
07/08 from 72 percent in 06/07, which i s a cause for concern interms of reaching this MDG.
Although the number of qualified teachers i s increasing overall, the pupilto teacher ratio has
worsened to 54 to 1, which remains high by international standards. At the secondary level,
while overall enrollment has increased(about 25 percent for lower secondary and 1.4 percent
for upper secondary), the completion rate for the upper secondary level declined from 93 to 73
percent in 2007/08. There are also major quality concerns, at both primary and the secondary
education levels, interms o f learning achievements.

31.     At the higher education level, expendituresper studentare over 40 times higher thanat
the primarylevel. While higher education costs more ingeneral, this ratio is muchhigherthan

weak domestic accountability, extensive corruption, uneven implementation and weak
coordination o f core reforms, and wavering commitment to decentralization.

37.     Tanzania has dealt effectively with a major corruption case at the Bank of Tanzania
(BOT).Following the external audit of the External Payment Arrears (EPA) account at the
BOTby the National Audit Office which documentedthe breakdown of internal controls and
the leakage of over US$110 million from EPA prosecuted several high ranking civil servants
and businessmenimplicated in this case. The government also prosecuted of high ranking
public officials and businessmeninvolved in mismanagement of a mineral audit contract and
the Richmond emergency power generation deal. These steps demonstrated commitment by
the government to start taking action against corrupt citizens and sent a strong message
against impunity.

38.     A National Anti-corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP 11) was launched in
December 2006. It encompasses a holistic anticorruption agenda covering civil society, the
private sector, the legislature, and the judiciary. While the legal framework for fighting
corruption has been significantly strengthenedwith the enactment of the new anti-corruption
bill (PRSC 6 prior action), further deepening of legislation incontiguous governance areas is
necessary. As mentioned earlier, the government has, over the last year, been able to bring to
court a number of grand corruption cases, demonstrating that the overall institutional
framework i s being enforced, and starting to dent the culture of impunity.The PCCB has been
also active to investigate corruption allegations at the regional level.

39.     Tanzanian media and political parties continue to enjoy a mostly tolerant and open
environment and have continued to raise other allegations of corruption and misuse of office,
even though some of the repressive laws on media freedom are still in place and are
sometimes usedto silence the media. Civil society continues to press government on enacting
a new media law based on a draft developed through a consultative process involving media
and other stakeholders.

40.     The judicial system still faces daunting challenges, notably: (i) in dispensation
                                                                           delays
of justice and commercial dispute resolution due to backlogs and to civil and criminal
procedure laws which are not yet consistent with a market economy and expedited dispute
resolution; (ii)technical incapacity (human resources) to address challenges brought by a
market economy, including technological, economic, and political changes; (iii)        corruption
complaints; (iv) poor case reporting; and (v) inadequate alternative dispute resolution
mechanisms.

41.     Public service reforms have been underway for several years and have helped put in
place more transparent systems to manage the public service and slightly improve
remuneration, particularly for professional, managerial, and technical staff which have been
leaving the service at a faster pace than other groups, although the impact of these reforms in
the executing agencies i s still to be fully felt. Inthis secondphase of reforms, the government
i s focusing on results and accountability of public services, recognizing that it needs a well-
performing public serviceto deliver services.




                                                  11

42.     Tanzania has a relatively sophisticated Public Financial Management (PFM) system
that i s markedly better than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. A number of diagnostic
reports carried out in the last year, including a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment for 2008, have significantly addedto the knowledge of the
PFM system in Tanzania. The PFM system is strong in ensuring budget performance and
aggregate fiscal discipline. Some of its legal aspects have significantly improved in recent
years, notably inthe areas of external audit, internal audit, and procurement. The 2008 PEFA
assessment points to the need for further improvements regarding the quality of budget
classifications, and the full integration o f recurrent and development budgets. There is a need
to improve the quality of budgeting and to strengthenthe credibility of the budget as a firm
government financial and operational plan. Predictability and control in budget execution i s
another area where several weaknesses have been identified. The ineffectiveness of payroll
controls and shortcomings of internal controls and audit in non-salary expenditures in the
MDAs have also been identified as area of concern, raising the risk of corruption, leakages,
and patronage. In general, accounting, recording, and reporting remain weak, and little
improvement has been made in recent years, thus undermining the management o f services
and the intendedallocation of resources. The internal audit function is poor although efforts
are underway to improve it. There i s also little available information on the delivery of
resourcesto service delivery units.

43.     Inrecentyears, PFMprogresshas beenpatchy, becausethe governmentumbrella PFM
reform program basically stalled for two years. Last year, the government launched a new
phase of the program intended to address the most critical issues, although implementation
has been slow to start due to inadequate leadership of the program inthe Ministry o f Finance
and Economic Affairs, which appears to have now beenaddressed. The thirdphase of Public
Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) has finally started in July 2008, with
renewed support and commitment from DP. Areas of focus are improvements to cash
management, payment systems, coverage and integration of Integrated Financial Management
System (IFMS), andbudget classification.

44.     External audit has been significantly strengthenedwith the passage of the Public Audit
Act in 2008. This Act has substantially increased the powers and responsibilities of the
Controller and Auditor General (CAG) and strengthened its independence. Under the new
Act, the CAG has now full freedom in terms of the scope and type of the audits.
Recommendations can now include revisions in any relevant law. A major structural reform
for internal audit has been initiated. The government has decided to remove the internal audit
function from the office of the Accountant General and to make it independent, reporting
directly to the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury. Revisions of the reporting arrangements
inMOFEA are finalized and the new (draft) internal audit strategyhas beenwidely discussed
withvarious stakeholders.Itis likelyto be implementedinthe next few months.

45.     Following a decade-long reform process, under a new Procurement Act, the
procurement function has been decentralized to procurement entities, and an autonomous
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) has been establishedand fully staffed, with
a functional website. Capacity in executing agencies, however, is still weak. This i s
particularly true in local government authorities, bodies that have an increasing influence in


                                                 12

rural growth and poverty levels through district development plans (DDPs) and a system o f
capital development grants programmed through the local plans.


                        111.     THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

46.     The Government o f Tanzania completed its second poverty reduction strategy, called
MKUKUTA, in June 2005. The strategy, covering 2005-2010, emphasizes accelerating
private-sector led growth by building a competitive economy supported by an efficient
government. It also recognizes that policies will be required to ensure that growth i s shared
and benefits the poor. Building on experience with previous poverty reduction strategy, the
MKUKUTAadopts an outcome-based approach stressing inter-sector linkages and synergies.
It identifies three clusters o f broad outcomes: growth and reduction of income-poverty;
improvement o f quality o f life and social well-being; and governance and accountability.

47.     The President and Parliament were elected in mid 2005 on the basis o f an electoral
platform, known as the C C M manifesto, from the winning party's name. The C C M manifesto
has become the explicit programmatic platform o f the government under the new President,
and is cited before the MKUKUTA in the budget speech as one o f the key drivers o f
government policy. The C C M manifesto and the MKUKUTA support similar overall
priorities, but the two agendas appear to imply different implementation strategies. The C C M
manifesto's focus on infrastructure outputs has beenseen, at times, as distracting from agreed
and more articulate sectoral strategies. How the government is able to balance any tensions
between the two will be critical to the quality o f its development policy.

48.     The government reform program in implementing the MKUKUTA is articulated in
five core reforms in the public sector and governance areas, and in a number o f sector
strategies. These thematic and sector strategies are the foundations for practical policy
implementation, although they are unevenly synchronized with MKUKUTA, their level o f
ownership through government i s variable, and their translation into the budget cycle i s not
fully transparent. Areas where sector or thematic strategies are lacking are education and
economic growth.

            IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS

49.     The proposed PRSC-7 i s fully congruent with the`country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
presented to the Board o f Executive Directors in March 2007. The CAS consists o f
government's Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST), a multi-donor Joint Program
Document (JPD), and a World Bank Group supplement, with details on the WBG strategy,
progress under the previous CAS, FY06-FY10 programs and projects, IDA financing, and a
WBG-specific results matrix.

50.     The JAST clearly identifies General Budget Support (GBS) as the preferred aid
modality. GBS is believed to foster ownership, donor harmonization and alignment, and
domestic accountability. Development Partners (DP) have endorsed government programs and



                                                13

strategies, increasingly using harmonized aid modalities and relying on government processes
and systems. Subject to continued progressonpublic andfinancial management, procurement,
budget planning and implementation, and development outcomes, budget support i s expected
to continue to be an important instrumentfor Bank support over the CAS period FY07-10.

COLLABORATIONWITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSAND THE IMF

51.     The JAST calls for a rationalization of donor support, including a move towards
government's preferredaid modality, GBS, which is now being provided by 14 Development
Partners (DP)2. A Partnership Framework Memorandum spells out the objectives and
underlying principles for the provision of general budget support to Tanzania as well as the
responsibilities of government and development partner^.^ It defines the GBS facility as a
five-year program to support the implementation of Tanzania's MKUKUTA. The principles
set out in the memorandum seek to operationalize various international commitments,
including the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development (2002), the Rome
Declaration on Aid Harmonization (2003), the Marrakech Memorandum on Managing for
Results (2004), the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) and the Tanzania Joint
Assistance Strategy (JAST) aiming at providing more scope for government ownership, better
alignment and integration of donor support with government priorities and systems, and more
predictability of donor support.

52.     Decisions on GBS are based on a common Performance Assessment Framework and
Joint Annual Review processes, designed to engage the authorities at regular intervals during
the budget cycle on key development issues - such as energy, transport, and fiduciary reforms.
This dialogue culminates each year in DP commitments to the authorities regarding the
amount of their budget support, usedinpreparing the budget guidelines. The GBS dialogue is
ledby arotating Troika ofDP, andthe Bank as a permanentmember.

53.     The IMF Executive Board approved a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for
Tanzania in February 2007, supporting the goal of achieving sustainable broad-based high
growth, while maintaining macro-economic stability. A fourth review under this program was
satisfactorily completed inDecember 2008. The core objectives of the program are: enhancing
public resource mobilization and efficiency o f spending; increasing the financial sector
contribution to growth and effectiveness o f monetary policy; and improving the business and
investment environment. Periodic IMF's assessments of Tanzania's macro-economic
performance serve as a key input for dialogue and assessments on policies related to
macroeconomic stability. IDA and IMF staffs collaborate closely, notably on public
expenditure management, financial sector, debt sustainability, and PRS assessments.




 CIDA, KfW, and JICA provide parallel financing to the PRSC, reflected inharmonization of triggers and prior
actions. Under these partnership arrangements and within the broader context of the GBS framework, KfW,
CIDA, and the Bank collaborate closely on public expenditure and macro-economic issues, while the
collaboration with JICA centers on growth and infrastructure issues.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

54.     WBG engagement is aligned to the MKUKUTA and covers the main sectors of the
economy. It uses harmonized instruments such as development policy lending (DPL), SILs,
basket funds, and joint analytical and advisory services. The proposed PRSC 7 is the DPL
instrument and has two interactions with sector investments and reform priorities. First,
analytic work in support of the PRSC identifies policy and sectoral constraints that are best
handled by using the leverage provided by the PRSC. Second, sector investments, either
through SILs or basket funds, support PRSC objectives in many areas - notably in funding
progresstoward the MDGs -- incollaboration with other DPs.

LESSONSLEARNED

55.     The Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report of the first series of PRSC-
 1/3 was completed in June 2007, and reviewed by IEG. This evaluation stressed the need to
establish a clearer results framework for the operation, and correspondingly strengthening the
M&E system in country. It also stressed the importance of supporting the government in
achieving better efficiency and impact in public expenditures, and focusing on policies
helpingto re-balancethe growth pattern toward the rural areas. QAG has performed a Quality
at Entry assessment for PRSC-5 which found the operation to be Highly Satisfactory overall,
and commended it as a best practice example of how the new (post-Paris-Declaration) aid
architecture can function. It also highlighted areas for improvement includingbuilding greater
in-country demand for good governance, as well as encouraging more cost-effective
mechanisms for tracking performance in key public services, and a greater focus on the
drivers of growth inline with the ICR findings. On the broader budget support framework, the
current set up of the PAF and of GBS dialogue is the result of a profound restructuring of
harmonized budget support inTanzaniathat startedat the time o fthe MKUKUTA in2005/06,
and took stock of the experience of budget support under the first PRS, aiming at simplifying
andre-balancing the structure ofbudget support, and strengtheningthe quality ofthe dialogue.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

56.     The PRSC is supportedby a broad analytical program carried out by the Bank, often in
close collaboration with the authorities. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focusing
on economic growth was completed in 2007, done jointly with the Ministry of Planning,
Economy and Empowerment. Further analysis on specific policy issues in infrastructure,
trade, and agriculture are being carried out. The yearly Public Expenditure Review (PER)
cycle led by the Government, and open to all DP and to civil society representatives, reviews
key budget and financial management developments during the year, and supports the
production of a yearly Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review (PEFAR).
The quality of the PER process and dialogue had deteriorated inprevious years, undermining
its relevance but it i s showing improved quality in its analytical and capacity building
components, with an increased focus on achieving results and value for money. The Bank, in
collaboration with UNICEF and the government, has completed a nutrition report which has
placed malnutrition back on the development agenda in Tanzania. The Bank has also been
carrying out a number of PSIA on water, agriculture, and energy to analyze the social impact


                                               15

of some of the key government policies supportedby the Bank, inparticular on energy tariffs
and fertilizer subsidies. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) on LandReformis also
scheduledfor next year.

57.    An Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) report was completed in November 2008,
which provides a detailed picture of constraints facing Tanzanian firms of various sizes. A
Rapid Poverty Assessment was carried out in October 2008 as the 2007 Household Budget
Survey became available, and will be followed by a full poverty analysis, geared towards the
preparation of the next Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy. The poverty analysis and
complementary work will take a fresh look at the micro-economic functioning of various
agricultural markets, both from a regulatory and tax perspective, and other work will look
more broadly at the micro-economic constraints to growth. Additional work is also being
preparedon the determinantsof agricultural productivity. A large number of analytical works
on environmental issues have beencompleted inrecent years both by the Bank and other DP,
andare listedinAnnex 11.

58.     Overall, these studies aim to strengthenthe empirical evidencebase for a deeper policy
focus on these areas inthe last two PRSCsof the series.

  V.      THE PROPOSEDSEVENTHPOVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT CREDIT

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

59.     The proposed poverty reduction support credit (PRSC-7) would be the fourth in a
series of five annual operations (PRSC-4/8) supporting the implementation of Tanzania's
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (known as MKUKUTA). The Bank's
PRSC support i s provided withina harmonized framework for general budget support.

60.    The strategic focus ofthe PRSC-4/8 series is on supporting government with respectto
two broad sets of objectives: (i)sustaining high and shared economic growth; and (ii)
expanding the effective delivery of basic servicesthrough the government budget.

61.    Economic reforms to liberalize the economy have been ongoing inTanzania since the
mid-1980s, and with renewed vigor since 1995. Poverty reduction strategies have been
implemented since 2000. Tanzania is therefore at a mature stage in the implementation of
reforms and poverty reduction strategies. At the same time, the impact of these reforms in
terms of poverty reduction has been muted, and in a number o f areas, the country has become
more ambivalent with respect of some of the liberalization efforts. In this complex context,
the two PRSCstrategic objectives map out into a graduatedset of operational policy areas.

62.    The sharedgrowth objective is articulated inthe following policy areas:

    0  In infrastructure, the PRSC series objective is to address critical elements of the
       institutional set-up for transport and energy, such as electricity tariffs, the autonomy of
       the road agency, the efficiency at the port and the road maintenance budget. Across
       infrastructure sectors, the PRSC series i s supporting the emergence of a solid Public
       Private Partnerships (PPP) institutional framework, including the establishment of a



                                               16

        central agency, which could help Tanzania break the poor track record with such
       partnerships.

    0   Inthe area of business climate, the PRSC series is trying to pusha numberof discrete
        policy actions which are part of the government's overall plan under the BEST
        program, with a focus on business and licensing, registration and land management,
        identifiedinthe CoDB as critical for Tanzania.

        This PRCS series is re-engagingthe policy dialogue on the overall agricultural policy
        framework, which has had apoor track record interms of reforms, with sustained state
        interventions at various levels, and has suffered from low public investment. The
        PRSC i s used to leverage the dialogue in order to arrive at relevant policy options in
        the coming years. Inthe natural resources sector, PRSC is also usedto build a policy
        agenda to bring better transparency, to achieve poverty education and environmental
        sustainability.

63.     The objective of supporting service delivery of public goods through the budget i s
pursuedthrough the following interventions:

            Support the implementation of sector strategies and the strengthening of the
            monitoring and evaluation systems inselectedservice delivery sectors.

            Periodical reviews ofthe quality of budget preparationand execution.

            Strengthenthe integrity and soundness of the PFM system, focusing on audit and
            procurement.

            Improve the effectiveness of the public administration, focusing notably on civil
            service reformand wage bill management.

            Improve the institutional framework for anti-corruption and accountability of the
            State, notably by supporting the enforcement o f a more comprehensive anti-
            corruption bill and strengthening the oversight function of the procurement
            regulatory authority.

64.     The Government of Tanzania has sought additional financial and technical support
from the WBG inresponse to the global economic crisis, and i s also indiscussionswith other
developing partners, includingthe IMF, to identify additional resources to cushion the impact
.
of the crisis. Currently, the WBG responsei s articulated as follows:
     The proposed Accelerated Food Security Program (Board date of June 9, 2009) which
     would provide US$220 million (nearly 1 percent of projected FYlO GDP) to support
     three complementary operations: (i)US$160 million for an Accelerated Food Security
     Project to expand supply of fertilizer; (ii) US$30 million for an additional financing of
     the Tanzania Social Action FundI1to widenthe rural safetynet; and (iii) million
                                                                               US$30
     for additional finance to the Agricultural Sector Development Program to raise
     agricultural productivitythrough soil fertility management and small irrigation;




                                              17

.
   A Transport Sector Support Program ofUS$250 million, to be presentedto the Board in
   FY10. Part of this operation would make up for projected fiscal shortfalls due to the
   crisis by financing public investmentsinroad and other transport infrastructure.

     SUMMARY ASSESMENTOF OVERALL PROGRESS

66.      Although the country's leadership is still committed to pursuing a broad structural
reform agenda needed to modernize the economy, implementation of structural reforms has
weakened over the last few years, and, in some areas, reversals have occurred. Tanzania's
ranking on the Cost of Doing Business and on the World Competitiveness indicators has
slightly declined; the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment
and DFID Public Financial Management (PFM) risk assessment have downgraded Tanzania;
its ranking by Transparency International has fallen; and the 2008 Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating, though still relatively high at 3.8, has also been
revised downward by 0.1 points. Progress on the Government's main private sector
development (PSD) and PFM reform programs has been rated unsatisfactory by development
partners (DP), as have two other core

health sectors and noted the progress in
tackling cases of grand corruption. Progress was deemed insufficient in agriculture, energy,
infrastructure, the investment climate, and the core public sector reform programs (related to
public and financial management, local government, and legal sector). The business climate -
overall and more specifically in the agriculture sector - was singled out as the area where
more urgent anddetermined reformwas needed.

68.      The detailed review of the 2008 PAF concluded that 18 out of 31 Temporary Process
Actions (TPAs) had been achieved. In addition, 15 out o f the 26 annual targets for outcome
indicators assessed in2008 were on track, and that 18 of 23 sector and thematic reviews were
rated as satisfactory. The GBS review selected a number of issues to be discussed, which were
considered by both government and DP as key challenges to improve the effectiveness of
government action (see Text Box 1).

69.      Against the backdrop'of a lack-luster implementation o f policy reforms, the 2008
Annual Review of Budget Support for Tanzaniahas witnessedthe beginning of a constructive
dialogue on the need to re-energize the private sector development and agriculture sector
agendas. The government has acknowledged the need to renew the implementation of its
business environment reform program (BEST), and has included it in the core reforms to be

monitored from the President's Office. The leadership of the program inthe Prime Minister's
Office has been strengthened and clear lines of accountability established. The government
has also begun to recognize the need for a wide-ranging review of regulatory and tax
constraints in agricultural goods markets. The government has indicated a new resolve in
addressing bottlenecks inkey infrastructure sectors, includingthe port of Dar es Salaam.

70.     The PAF for the GBS 2009 cycle adoptedat the November 2009 Annual Review (see
Annex 1) includes measures that address some of the core private sector development,
governance, infrastructure, agriculture, and PFM issues, while the sector dialogue in some of
these key areas has also been intensified. Several o f these key agreed PAF actions are being
proposed as triggers for PRSC-8. There remain questions on the effectiveness of the
government's expressed policy choices in several sectors, such as agriculture, tourism and
ICT, where it appears to rely excessively on direct and extensive public intervention in the
economy, and/or heavy regulation of the private sector.                                         .
Review of progress againstPRSC-7 triggers and conversion to prior actions


71.     The specific assessment with respect to PRSC-7 reflects government's mixed track
record in policy implementation over the year, as this PRSC series has tried to strategically
align around a small set of critical reforms for the country. There has beengradual progress in
some infrastructure areas (Le. roads and energy), positive governance developments in the
natural resources sector, and some progress in PFM, but disappointing or slow developments
with regard to the business environment, civil service wage bill reform, and budget execution.
Six out of eleven triggers were fully or substantially completed, three others have been
delayed or partially completed, and two have not beenmet (Table 5). The three triggers which
have not been fully met on procurement, medium-term policy and PPP policy
                            -                                                          - have
registered good progress by the time of appraisal. Triggers on the implementation of the
Business RegistrationAct and on the execution ofthe budget have beenmissed.

72.     The failure to meet the budget execution trigger, reflects a broader worsening of
overall budget execution, but also disruption due to the implementation of a new government
structure during the year. It being addressed through the PER dialogue. Last year saw the
completion of a policy note on budget execution, and an agreement on more specific follow
up studies to address identifiedareas of concern, namelybasket funding mechanisms,dummy
exchequer reporting, cash management, and local government reporting and monitoring. A
cash management action has also beenincludedinthe 2009 PAF. Finally, the deterioration in
the key execution indicator comes after two years of consecutive progress. Overall, the team
recommends that no further action be taken with regard to non-achievement of this specific
trigger, butthat enhancedmonitoringand dialogue be carried out under PRSC-8.

   73.     The non-achievement of the trigger related to the implementation of the BARA
   reflects a broader setback of the government's policies to improve the already poor domestic
   investment climate. Although at the higher policy level, the government has pledged a series
   of measures to address the weakness of its investment climate policies, on the specific issues
   of business registration, the government current plans appear inconsistent with the policy

intentions, and will result in a system, which in the view of the Bank and other DPs, is
burdensome, prone to manipulation and corruption, complex to manage, and potentially
punitive, especially for smaller firms. The failure to meet this trigger, and to identify suitable
remedial measures, has led the Bank to apply a U S $ l0 million performance-related reduction
to the initial indicative amount of PRSC-7 of US$200 million.

74.     The status of the other three delayed or partially achieved triggers is the following. A
first draft of the background report for the civil service medium-termpay policy i s ready and
has been discussed with DP, but due to procurement delays in its preparation, the medium-
term policy will not be finalized and approved before appraisal. It is proposed to modify the
PRSC-7 prior action to register the preparation of the policy, and include follow-up steps for
approval and implementation under a PRSC-8 trigger. Concerning the procurement                      '

regulations, they have been prepared, and should be approved shortly after appraisal. Given
the progress inpreparation, it i s proposed to adjust the prior action accordingly. With respect
to the PPP policy, draft has beenunder preparation since early 2008, albeit further processing
of the policy for adoption has been delayed. The Prime Minister's Office is now responsible
for the PPP policy, and has taken concrete action to move towards Cabinet adoption by June
2009. A stakeholder meeting took place inearly April 2009 with representatives of the Private
Sector and of the Development Partners. Most of the comments made at that meeting, in
particularwith respectto oversight mechanisms,were incorporated inareviseddraft.

MONITORINGRESULTS
75.     The results framework (RF) covering the whole PRSC-4/8 series in support of
MKUKUTAis fully congruent with the PAF. Giventhe highlevel of harmonization, it is not
possible to distinguish the results supported by PRSC separately from the overall Poverty
Reduction Budget Support, although indications are given as to the PRSC specific policy
measures. The RF identifies a limited number of Project Development Objectives which will
measure over its full cycle the success of the PRSC series. The RF is organized around the
three MKUKUTA broad clusters of objectives, each of which has three main outcome areas,
resulting in a 3x3 overall structure with nine outcome areas (which maps closely the seven
mainpolicy areas of the PRSC series).

76.     The PRSC's RF integrates different information provided separately in earlier PRSC
documentation for Tanzania, in congruency with the new ICR formats to enhance the quality
and relevance of M&Efor the operation. The RF is basedon the full 5-year period interms of
overall development objectives, but focuses policy actions around the current PRSC
operation.

77.     The results since this second PRSC series was initiated in 2005 show steady
improvements in several outcome areas, but also a few setbacks. In particular, road
construction has increasedsubstantially, androad quality has also improved and is on track for
reaching its target, owing to higher funding for maintenance. Congestion at the port of Dar es
Salaam is, however, worsening after an initial improvement inthe early 2000s. Enrollment in
education has expanded significantly at all levels. Tanzania has expanded energy supply
capacity, and improved immunization coverage rates. The RF also shows improvements in
current budget execution and inthe timeliness of the Auditor General report.

78.       The modest results in reducing income-poverty present a challenge for the
achievement o f the broad development objectives o f this second PRSC series for Tanzania.
The PRSC-6 Program Document anticipated that, in case of an income-poverty reduction
scenario much below the MKUKUTA target, the PRSC's policy focus should increase in
those areas that have been identified as key for the poverty reduction impact, namely income
generation inrural areas and the overall business environment, while continuing to encourage
progress in solving key infrastructure constraints. Inthis context, the PRSC series' strategic
focus on higher shared-growth and expandedservice delivery through the government budget
i s still relevant, but, both in terms of assessment of PRSC-7 and in terms of future policy
dialogue under the forthcoming PRSC-8, more attention will need to be given to sustaining
high and shared economic growth, while continuing to improve the effectiveness of public
services delivery. This will be a gradual processthat i s likely to spill-over into the next PRSC
series, as the analytical work on the micro constraints to growth starts yielding results, and it
will also require broad coordination with other key operations inthe IDAprogram.

79.       Consistent with this strategic context and building on government's achievements
under PRSC-4 through 6, this operation will focus on supply side constraints to economic
growth, including infrastructure bottlenecks, investment climate, and income generation in
rural areas, while continuing to support the implementation o f governance and budget
reforms. With respect to the proposed PRSC-8, this implies an increase in the number of
triggers dealing with broad based-growth and income generation relative to triggers dealing
with social sectors, or governance.

80.      Areas of enhanced focus. Ininfrastructure, the PRSC will continue to support policy
and institutional reforms inthe energy andtransport sectors andpromote the establishmentof
a Public Private Partnership framework. It will also include a specific trigger to address
problems at the Dar es Salaamcontainer terminal, which i s a critical bottleneck. The operation
will also support government's plan to strengthen the autonomy and powers of the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority, notably with respect to enforcement o f procurement
regulations inlarge infrastructure contracts. Inthe area o f investment climate, it will focus on
land registration, which is not only an important issue on its own but is a good indicator of
government's ability to foster private sector development.

81.      Areas of continuedfocus. The PRSC will still monitor the completion of satisfactory
sector reviews in the three key social sectors, education, health, and water, and will monitor
the alignment and execution of the budget. On PFM, the trigger targets the implementation of
a new economic and functional classification as a stepping stone to improve the MTEF by
providing a clearer view of the budget composition. Finally, the PRSC-8 will see through the
implementation of the new medium-term pay policy, with the adoption of specific wage
targets.

82.      The rest of the section provides an assessment o f recent developments in the policy
areas supported by the PRSC, focusing particularly on the discussion of prior actions for




                                               30

PRSC-7 and triggers for PRSC-8, which are critical to the achievement of Tanzania's
MKUKUTAobjectives.

MKUKUTA Implementation:Cluster 1- GrowthandReductionof Poverty

83.     Cross-cutting issues. Sustaining and further increasing economic growth, while
making sure it is sufficiently pro-poor to have a tangible impact on the large majority of
Tanzanians, are critical to Tanzania's development. Major bottleneck in infrastructure, from
port to railways to energy, a still weak environment for the private sector, especially pervasive
regulatory impediments that are detrimental to smaller firms, and stagnant productivity in
agriculture are primary constrains to sustainable economic growth. Fostering income
generation in rural areas, promoting an enabling business environment, and addressing
infrastructure constraintswill be critical to poverty reduction.

84.     To enablethe agricultural sector to fully play its role inincome generation and poverty
reduction, the government has pledged to make agriculture its focus for the years to come. The
government is planning to scale up the provision of public goods and public investment in
agriculture andto sustain higher productivitythrough a voucher fertilizer subsidy scheme. The
government also agrees on the need to improve the business environment for the private
sector, although many of its plannedinitiatives in the sector rely heavily on public provision
of guarantees and price setting, which may prove contradictory with the stated intention to
improve the efficiency of the sector andthe income o fpoor farmers.

85.     Public spending in agriculture has remained relatively low at about 1percent of GDP
(lower than the allocated 1.5 percent of GDP due to poor execution). The acceleration of
agricultural growth consistent with government's economic development and poverty
reduction objectives will require a scaling-up of fiscal resources, particularly for core public
goods and for sustainable program aimed at improvement inthe productivity of small holding
farmers. The government should start implementing this year its rural roads program, which
had been lagging behind the main road program focused on major trunk and regional roads.
The government's fertilizer scheme, based on subsidized transportation of private input
suppliers, was found to be expensive and ineffective in reducing the costs of inputs or
significantly increasing production. It has beenphasedout andreplacedby anewAgricultural
InputVoucher Scheme. A rural road program has beenfinalized and should be implemented
next year.

86.     Indications from boththe HBS and sector studies are that inmany cash and staple crop
markets, a maze of regulations, taxes, interventions by local governments, crop boards, and
cooperatives create an unfavorable investment climate and low profitability. The
formalization into law o f the reforms o f Crop Boards have progressed very gradually in the
last year, during which new legislation on seven cash crop boards has been prepared after
widespread consultations (PRSC-6 prior action), but not yet approved by Cabinet for
submission to Parliament. Beyond crop board reform, the government acknowledged the need
for improvingthe business environment inthe sector. Although it remains hesitant to consider
any reforminthis field, itagreedduring the Annual Review to carry out a study on regulations




                                                31

and taxes affecting agriculture, and undertake consultations and adopt an action plan to
rationalize the regulations andlocal taxes affecting agriculture (PRSC-8 trigger).

PRSC-8 Trigger: Update FIAS study paying particular attention to regulations and local taxes affecting
agriculture and undertake consultations and agree to an action planbased on the fmdings andrecommendations
o f the study.
Objective: Engage dialogue with government, leadingto measures with respect to licensing and taxation in
agriculture.

87.       In the natural resources sector, the objective is to improve the overall institutional
environment, especially in terms o f transparency, to allow for a more sustainable and
profitable exploitation o f the resources for the local communities. The sector has registered
positive policy developments at the institutional level. Tanzania has applied formally to EITI,
paving the way for a more transparent framework in the sector. The Ministry o f Natural
Resources has achieved good progress in carrying out a review of the different licensing and
concession modalities related to forestry and wildlife (PRSC-7 trigger). The government
recognizes that improving the system o f allocation o f these resources, in terms o f
transparency, valuation, and openness i s a prerequisite for a more sustainable management o f
these resources, and greater opportunities for local communities. The government i s
committed to (a) streamline the various systems it uses to improve revenue collection and
allow economic access to these resources, while at the same time (b) strengthen predictability,
transparency, and valuation o f the systems for allocation, concession, and licensing (PRSC-8
trigger).

 PRSC-7 Prior Action: Information on transparency and accountability o f licenses/concession allocations
 systems collected inthe forestry, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and oil & gas sectors.
 PRSC-8 Trigger:      Approve and initiate implementation o f an action plan to improve accountability and
 transparency inallocating natural resource licenses and concessions.
 Objective: Reform o f the licensing and concession regimes innatural resources management

88.       Business Environment Strengthening inTanzania (or BEST) is the government's main
umbrella program for private sector development. The program is financed through a multi-
donor basket which now includes only IDA. PRSC support to BEST has been focusing on
discrete policy measures, in the area o f the business registration and licensing regime, which
were supposed to complement the effort to improve infrastructure access, but have not
experienced similar progress. Reforms under the BEST program have stalled over the last
year, due to a lack o f leadership linked to the reorganization o f the economic function among
central ministries, as well as wavering commitment to broad-based improvement o f the
overall business environment. Indicators o f Tanzania's PSD performance have slid
accordingly.

89.       In the field of business registration, the Government introduced new legislation in
2005, but then had to modify it further in the form o f a Business Activities Registration Act
(BARA) passed inJanuary2007 (PRSC-5 prior action). The authorities hadrecognizedthat to
be consistent with their objective o f a one-stop shop approach, regulations to implement the
Business Activities Registration Act (BARA) would require some selective legislative
amendments. However, the government in 2008 gave up the plan and decided to implement



                                                         32

BARA recast a way that would be burdensome, complex, and potentially punitive for firms.
The outcome i s that the implementation of this legislation will actually do very little to
improve the regulatory environment. Inthe areas of labor and landreforms a number of new
billshave beenpassed, albeit implementation is proceeding very gradually.

90.     Private investors as well as development partners have sent clear signals to the highest
levels of government on the need to give new impetusto investment climate reform, with the
objective of achieving a tangible contribution of the private sector to broad-based income-
generation and poverty reduction. The President, in his latest speeches, has signaled stronger
government commitment to the investment climate, announcing that an investor complaint
bureau would be set up in the President's Office. The government has also signaled in the
PAF that the Investmentand Private Sector Development Department inthe Prime Minister's
Office will mainstream regulatory impact assessments ingovernment systems, and improve its
capacity to effectively advise government on the impact on business of proposedpolicies and
legislation. The update of the FIAS study on taxation and regulation inagriculture should also
lead to a better environment for rural income generation, and help the authorities tackling red
tape and petty corruption. It remains to be seen whether the broader reforms, especially of the
licensing regimes, labor and landmarkets, are going to be implementedfast enough to invert
the trendover the nexttwo years.

91.     A key component of the BEST program is the land administration reform. This is a
long term reform which aims at establishing an effective, efficient and equitable land
administration, guaranteeing security of tenure and facilitating an efficient market land. Key
important achievements include: the adoption over the past five years of key land legislation
(Land Act and Village Land Act), preparation of regulations and bills to regulate the Real
Estate Agency and Valuation Professions; procurement of surveying and mapping equipment,
with mapping of 15 pilot district due to commence; preparation of an environmental
assessment framework and resettlement policy framework; and reduction of the backlog of
landrelated disputes.The Ministry of Land, Housing and Human Settlements Development is
in the process of implementing strategies and streamlining procedures to arrive at a
comprehensive, fast, and user-friendly land registry. Recently approved decentralization
measures have removed the need for transfers o f land titles to be approved by the
Commissioner for Lands, which will help streamline the process of landtransfer registration..
The Ministry is planning to issue 12,000 titles of occupancy in urban areas in 2009/10, and
around 40,000 customary titles of occupancy inrural areas. It is also launching an information
system needs assessment of the registry to identify the best options to manage the registry
more efficiently through the use of informationtechnology. (PRSC-8 trigger).

 PRSC-8Trigger: Progress incompletion oflandregistry.
 Objective: To issue 52,000 Certificates of Occupancy Rights (12,000 urban, 40,000 rural) by next year, while
 reducing time for registration by streamlining procedures.

92.     In the energy sector the government has successfully implemented the strategy
describedinPRSC-6, which should, by the end of the PRSC series, put the energy sector on a
sound institutional and financial footing, by: (i)        continuing to improve the management of the
State Utility Company (TANESCO); (ii)              approving a new Electricity Bill, which provides for
a broadly adequate institutional framework for the sector; (iii)overseeing progress in the


                                                       33

implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan, in particular progress on a cost of service
study (PRSC-7 trigger) to support a new tariff application in2009 (PRSC-8 trigger); and (iv)
the rolling out of an investment plan in generation and distribution with support from the
Bank andother DP.

93.      The draft Power Sector Reform Strategy is being updated to incorporate comments
received during the review of the Electricity Bill and the draft Power System Master Plan.
The revised strategy is scheduled for submission to Cabinet in the second half of 2009.
Expansion o f the installed grid generation capacity has been considerably constrained by the
expiration of lease contracts for the rental power plants, the legal problems with independent
private generators and delays in the implementation of new power projects. The better
financial standing of TANESCO has allowed a marked reduction inoutages, and the creation
of 60,000 new connections, which together with off grid electrification resultedin about 11
percent of the population with access to electricity by the end of 2008 (which remains largely
offtrack of the 2010 MKUKUTAtarget o f 20 percent).

94.      Installed capacity actually decreased in2007/08 (by close to 1percent). A major threat
to the energy system stems from on-going legal disputes concerning two private purchasing
agreements in generation, which have been tainted by corruption, and from slow preparation
of new power generation projects. The inability to solve these cases is withholding critical
generation capacity at a time where energy consumption is growing, while at the same time,
projects for new generation capacity are experiencing a number of delays. These
implementation problems threaten to create new vulnerabilities in the power sector, in the
short to mediumterm, especially inthe case o f a major drought.

  PRSC-7 Prior action: Further progress in implementation of the TANESCO financial recovery plan to
  strengthen TANESCO's revenuebase.
  PRSC-8 Trigger: Strengthening TANESCO's revenue collection to meet full operational cost recovery in

95.      Transport Sector. The government furthered its efforts to strengthenthe institutional
and policy framework for the transport sector and prioritize investment and maintenance
funding. Key achievements in roads include: (i)establishing a board of directors for
TANROADS as provided for by the Roads Act; (ii)                   full funding of the Transport Sector
InvestmentProgram allocation inthe 08/09 budget; and (iii)               continuous quasi full funding of
the road maintenance in the 08/09 budget. These measures have resulted in a marked
improvement in road conditions, with the percentage of trunk and regional roads network in
good and fair condition increasing from 72 to 90 percent from 2007 to 2008, while the percent
o f rural roads that are passable (good and fair) has increased from 55 to 57 percent. Looking
forward, the government has committed to implementa new program for the development of
rural roads, which is deemedkey for spurring agricultural development.

96.      Performance of the transport sector continues to be seriously hampered, however, by
the congestion of Dar es Salam Port. The average time for an import container from off-
loading to clearing from port has worsened from around 20 days to around 22.5 days, due to
pressing problems at the container terminal. The authorities have defined a port decongestion



                                                     34

strategy which will address infrastructure constraints, as well as revise the incentive
framework, notably with respect to tariffs for container storage (PRSC-8 trigger). The
revision o f the tariffs for container storage will seek to ensure that cost o f maintaining the
containers within the port area is higher than the storage cost outside the port, providing a
price incentive to move containers out o f the port area faster. TPA will submit a second tariff
request to SUMATRA for port storage tariffs consistent with this objective, and also plans to
request a reduction o f the free time storage period o f 7 days. Finally, the authorities are
looking for a rapid solution for impound containers, which are clogging the port area and
hampering efficient container movements. The authorities are committed to find a storage area
for the impounded containers, either inone o f the many under-utilized areas available near the
port belonging to other government entities, and arranging a temporary transfer o f such space
to TRA, or, incase no such solution can be quickly found, the government will seek to resolve
any regulatory or constraints that would prevent TR4 from using a storage facility for
impounded containers outside the port area. In the railways sector, developments have not
been very positive either, as the concession arrangements for Tanzania Railways Limited
(TRL) have run into a series o f problems that have delayed investment and improvement in
service.

 PRSC-8 Trigger: Government improves port congestion situation by three key measures: (i)Tanzania Ports
 Authority presents a time-bound action planfor moving to Landlord Status; (ii)TPA to submit a solidproposal
 to SUMATRA to approve increase inport storagetariffs and reduction infiee time; and (iii) Government
 establish own area for impounded containers.
 Objective: Reduce dwell time at the Dar es Salaamcontainer terminal.

97.      A PPP framework for the whole transport sector has been under preparation and has
been expanded to be a national PPP policy, which innow inadvanced draft form, but Cabinet
approval is still pending (PRSC-7 trigger). The proposed PPP framework would put Tanzania
on par with some o f the best institutional and regulatory regimes in developing countries. It
envisages a PPP bill (PRSC-8 trigger) that clarifies the legal framework, enshrining principles
o f transparency and competition. Under the Act, the draft policy also envisages a central PPP
agency set up under the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Affairs, which would be
responsible for PPPpromotion, packaging andnegotiations, separate fiom the routine function
o f the Ministry o f Finance to vet the fiscal and financial impact o f PPP proposals. The
development o f a modern framework for public private partnerships will also support
government's broader governance agenda by improving the transparency and accountability in
the delivery o fpublic sector infrastructures and services.

 PRSC-7 Prior Actions: National PPP policy, including the infrastructure sector, prepared, discussed with
 stakeholders, and being readied for Cabinet approval.
 PRSC-8 Trigger: Draft bill and regulatory fiamework for Private-Public Partnership submittedto Parliament.
 Objective: Establish a well-staffed centralized PPP agency and transparent rules for PPP transactions across
 all government departments.

MKUKUTAImplementation: Cluster 2 Quality ofLife and Social WellBeing
                                                  -

98.     Under this cluster, the PRSC focus is strictly on the monitoring and evaluation o f
effective service delivery, or on critical cross-cutting issues, such as civil service management,



                                                      35

 which link with other PRSC components. The operation does not deal directly with social
 sector-specific policy issues.
 99.     Monitoring o f the three sectors covered, namely education, health and water, i s done
 through harmonized annual sector review processes, which assess: (i)        whether budgets are
 aligned with strategies and implemented as agreed; (ii)  whether the implementedstrategies are
 having the anticipated results; and (iii)  when not, whether the strategies and implementation
 plans are being revised accordingly through appropriate policy actions. The rating of the
 review is a composite indicator which summarizes these assessments, together with the
 question o f whether the government i s enabling itself to be held accountable to a broad range
 o f stakeholders through an open review process. The 2008 reviews were satisfactory for all
 three sectors.

 100.    Cross-cuttingchallenges. Achievement o f MKUKUTA objectives under this cluster
 is reliant on service delivery capacity at the front line, particularly in local government
 authorities (LGA). Despite significant improvements in the conditions for LGA service
 delivery, accountability in delivering social services remains insufficient, in particular due to
 (i) inadequate information on procedures to access different social services; (ii)continuing
 shortages, especially in health and education, o f qualified staff, particularly in underserved
 areas; (iii)
            still problematic flows o f funds to service delivery units at the local levels, both in
terms o f timing and transparency.

 101.    The quality, frequency, and completeness o f performance information is key to
evaluate and, if necessary, adjust sector policies. The past year has witnessed progress, with
the establishment o f clear performance frameworks - including expected results, measurable
indicators, and targets   - for  Health and Education (PRSC-7 prior action). Timely and accurate
information for management decision-making continues to be a major challenge in the water
sector, where the newly agreed PAF envisages a comprehensive review o f the monitoring
framework. By the end o f the PRSC series, it is expected that monitoring and reporting on
results will be based on a higher-frequency and solid information system, and more tightly
integrated into the budgetprocess.

 102.    Education.The introduction o fthe PrimaryEducation Development Program(PEDP)
inJuly 2001 andthe abolition o fprimaryeducation school fees have ledto a rapid increase in
primary Enrollment Ratio. The government has continued its efforts to expand access and
improve the quality o f secondary education through the implementation o f the Secondary
Education Development Program (SEDP).

 103.    The sector review conducted in October 2008 was executed over several months
jointly by the Development Partners and concluded that progress was "satisfa~tory".~It
included field visits to directly assess progress on the ground; review o f the budget to assess
alignment o f allocations with priorities; review o f the key achievement o f targets; and
discussions and agreements on key policy actions to be undertaken for the coming year.

Progress in the sector was evident through key outputs, including continued increased in
enrollment at all education levels, although there is a lag in qualified teacher recruitment to
match the expansion, particularly at the secondary level. Albeit the share of education has
declined in total budgetary expenditures, there was an absolute nominal increase of 21
percent. O f concern is the fall in budget allocated to the rapidly expanding secondary level..
The Ministry of Education and Vocational Training has produced in 2008 a much improved
performance report, based on an agreed sector performance monitoring tool (PRSC 7 prior
action). This agreedperformance monitoring systemwill anchor the policy dialogue under the
sector reviews on a fact-basedplatform.

104.     The key issues agreed as central for the policy dialogue under the next sector review
cycle included: (i)  improving the inequality in distribution and inadequate teacher numbersto
match expansion and the need to conduct a Human Resources situational analysis; (ii)
addressing a declining budget share of education, especially at the secondary level and an
excessive increase instudent loans costs at the higher education level; (iii) needto prepare
                                                                              the
and reconcile ESDP with realistic sub-sector plans and budget forecasts; and (iv) the needto
better understand resource flow throughout the system through the forthcoming Public
ExpenditureTracking Survey (PETS).

105.     Health. The government's strategy for development of the health sector seeks to
improve the accessibility, delivery, and quality of health care services available inthe country,
with resulting improvements in health status and financial security. It is supported by far-
reachingreforms at all levels. The Joint Annual Health Sector Review (JASHR) mechanism is
well established and has been improving continually since its inception in 1999. These
reviews involve a critical look at the sector, including the monitoring of sector performance
and implementation of the Health Sector Strategic Plan, discussion ofkey sector policy issues,
a critical examination of the milestones established during the previous review and the
development ofnewmilestones for the coming year.

106.     The gthJAHSR was conducted on October 8-10, 2008, and included the presentation
of an updated health sector performance report (PRSC-7 trigger).6 Examples of areas of
improvement included total health expenditure per capita, which tripledbetween2000/01 and
2007/08, a decrease in HIV/AIDS prevalence (from 7.0 to 5.7 percent o f those aged 15-49
between 2003/04 and 2007/08, and an increase of about 70 percent in the ownership of bed
nets While no new data was available for maternal mortality, the consensus of the meeting
was that there was likely little or no improvement in this area and this it remained a critical
area inneedof attention. Data releasedafter the Sector review indicated a dramatic reduction
of under-5 mortality, from 112 in 2004 to 80 in 2008, although neo-natal mortality did not
improve as much.

107.     A number ofmeasures were includedinthe newHealth Sector StrategicPlanI11andin
the milestones for 2008/09. Areas receiving particular attention in the milestones include

health human resources, pay for performance and the development o f a health financing
strategy.   The review also stressed the importance o f the decentralization by devolution
process for a successful implementation o f health reforms, and noted that while the level o f
decentralizationup to council level i s encouraging, there is a need for further strengthening o f
the management functions, as well as continuing to decentralize decision making at lower
levels.

108.     The third bi-annual sector review for HIV/AIDS occurred on December 10 and 11,
2008. It showed that out o f a total o f 31 milestones established inthe March 2006 Joint Bi-
Annual Review for the period 2006-2008, only 13 were fully realized, 13 partially realized
and 5 were not realized. Specific milestones which were achieved included the development
o f a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system (TOMSHA), increasing numbers o f
LGA's and CSO's accessing available funds to deliver services, and significant increases in
the overall level o f funding; while important milestones yet to be achieved include initiatives
directed at the private sector and businesscoalitions. The review agreed on the key challenges
going forward, with a major focus on costing the NMSF, the development o f a national
prevention strategy, and increased attentionto impact mitigation.

109.     Water sector. The government pursued the implementation o f its Water Sector
Development Programme aimed at enhancing water resources management for socio-
economic development and sustainable environment, and ensuring that all social groups in
rural and urban areas have access to adequate, safe and clean water and sanitation services.
The third Joint Water Sector Review, which was held in September 2008, concluded that
reforms inthe sector were progressing satisfactorily, acknowledging, however, that given the
current trends o f water supply service coverage data inbothrural and urbanareas indicate that
meeting MKUKUTA targets remains a formidable challenge.' In2009, the Water Supply Act
and Water Resources Management Act have been approved by Parliament, consolidating the
legal and institutional framework for the sector.

110.     Interventions during 2007/08 focused on four areas: (i)  water resources management,
including the strengthening o f basin water offices and water quality          laboratories, and
developing water resource management infrastructure; (ii) water supply and sanitation
                                                              rural
services, including by helping Local Government Agencies with the implementation o f small

MKUKUTA Implementation:Cluster3 -Governanceand Accountability

112.    Tanzania's National Framework on Good Governance provides the overall framework
for reforms in this area. The implementation of five core reforms, the financial management
reform program (PFMRP), the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP), the Local
Government Reform Program (LGRP), the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACSAP),
and the Legal Sector ReformProgram (LSRP) are the government's main instrumentstowards
improving the governance environment. All reviews that were scheduled in the past year for
the cluster were undertakenas planned. The implementation of these core reforms has been
slow and uneven, with three out of five (PFM, LSRP and LGRP) rated unsatisfactory this
year. The DP and the Bank have sent an unequivocal signal that progress on anti-corruption is
key to continued high international support to Tanzania, and both the governance DP group,
and the anti-corruption DP group, chaired respectively by the UnitedKingdom and Sweden,
will monitor the situation closely.

113.    Cross-cuttingissues. The policy issues to be addressedinthis sector concernboththe
strengthening of the general environment for governance and the improvement in service
delivery. Stronger institutions of domestic accountability - particularly the parliament, the
oversight offices, and the media           -  are critical to improving governance throughout
government, and are also critical to making sure that reforms in this field become less
technocratic and formalistic in nature and have relevance with respect to the actual decision
mechanisms inthe country. Although there has been some good progress under this cluster in


                                                    39

some areas, such as grand corruption prosecution, other areas of concern remain, including
with respect to: pay and allowances policy; inter-governmental transfers of funds; the cross
linkages between reforms and the lack of progress to resolve the issues where one reform
program may hinder development in another reform program; and the alignment of
Constituency Development Fundwith existing government policy. Regarding alleged cases of
abuses of public resources,the government has made considerableprogress over the pastyear,
with the instruction of 14 cases of grand corruption for prosecution. Some ofthe next steps in
the anti-corruption agenda are to: (i) the Public Leadership Ethics Code Act to accord
                                                re-visit
with the President's announcements regarding conflict-of-interest and corruption inleadership
ranks; (ii)review the Political Parties Act and the Elections Act in order to control the
financing of politics and political campaigns; (iii)proceed with the preparation of the
Freedom of InformationBill and the Whistleblower Bill.

114.     Public Service Reform Program. The second phase of the PSRP one of the core       -
reform program aiming at improving performance of the public sector and services delivery                        -
was launched in January 2008. Under this new phase (2008-2012), the program will have a
greater focus on implementation of reforms by Ministries, Departments, and Agencies
(MDAs) and will also seek to enhance the coordination of core reforms at the center of
government (Office of the Chief Secretarymead of the Public Service). The program's
implementation modalities were redesignedbuilding on lessons from the previous phase, and
are now demand driven to strengthenthe ownership and sustainability of the program. This
should enable involvement of ministries at the various implementation stages and the
integration of PSRP I1activities inthe MDAsMedium-TermExpenditure Framework.

115.     Implementation of the program has suffereddelays due notably to late disbursement of
funds to ministries for implementation of MDAs ledinterventions. The plannedupdate of the
MediumTerm Pay Policy (MTPP) (PRSC-7 trigger) was delayed, due to slow procurement of
consultant services: a background report has been prepared and circulated for stakeholder
discussions, and the policy approval is now planned for July 2009. Low pay and incentives
continue to be raised throughout government as the main challenge to attract, retain, and
motivate key categories of employees inall sectors specifically inunderserved areas. A related
challenge is the need to establish a clear regime of allowances. The current system of
allowances is highly distortive of incentives for productive work in the civil service, and is
liable to easy manipulation for patronage and favors. The MTPP draft addresses issues related
to (i)  the excessive use of allowances to augment pay by public servants which distorts
incentives to service delivery; (ii)          pay and incentives for staff working in underserved and
remote areas; as well as (iii)          decompression of the salary structure that has in recent years
faced the pressure of increased employment of public servants, particularly in the social
sector. Next PRSCswill follow up on the implementation of this new medium-termpolicy.

 PRSC-7 Prior Action: Concrete steps takento prepare a revised Medium-TermPay Policy by Government as
 the basis for reformofpay andallowances.
 PRSC-8 Trigger: GOTapproves Targets related to the adopted Medium-Term Pay Policy, incorporating
 strategies to address (inter-district) inequity inhuman resource distribution.
 Objective: Hiring and remuneration inthe civil service are consistent with fiscal responsibility, incentives for
 performance, equity inservice provision, and enhanced capacity.

116.     Legal Sector Reform Program. The vision of the LSRP Medium-TermStrategy is
"timely justice for all". The reform program is being implementedwith the support of ajoint
donor basket. Although there has been substantial progress with respect to last year, the
program and the overarching legal sector are yet to reach satisfactory levels of performance.
Notable areas of progress in the past year include: (i)     operations of National Prosecution
Service and implementation of its Action Plan; (ii)   strengthening of the investigation system;
(iii) tojusticeforthepooranddisadvantage;(iv) establishmentoftheLawSchoolof
     access
Tanzania; (v) preparation of Legal Sector Policy; (vi) completion of the first LSRP review;
and (vii) restructuring ofthe Ministry of Constitutional Affairs andJustice. However, progress
of the LSRP as a whole remains slow. The capacity of all levels across the legal system
institutions to plan, budget for and implement activities in a coherent and transparent way
remains limited. Progress i s also hamperedby the absence of adequate monitoring tools and
indicators, which does not allow an objective and informed assessment with LSRP
implementation. The preparation, approval, and funding of the annual budgets and work plans
are not yet fully integrated in the government budget planning cycle. The government is
committed to improve the management and coordination of LSRP and is trying to address the
more pressing capacity gaps. As a first step, a study for the development of a system of
capacity development and technical assistance was commissioned.

117.     Local Government Reform Program. Encouraging progress has been registered in
the areas of fiscal decentralization and harmonization and integration of the Local
Government Capital Development Grants system into the national budget needed to ensure
sustainability, although further work is still needed. Areas of weak performance include:
limited progress in providing autonomy in human resources management at the LGA level;
transparency and accountability of use of funds is undermined by the existence of multi-
channels of funding at the local level; lack of clarity of the national budget on the amount of
funds flowing to LGA; and limitedprogressinallocating sufficient financing to LGA.

118.     Anti-Corruption A National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan (NACSAP 11)
was launched in December 2006. It encompasses a holistic anticorruption agenda covering
civil society, the private sector, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. The legal framework for
fighting corruption has been significantly strengthened with the enactment of the new anti-
corruption bill (PRSC 6 prior action). Some of the next steps inthe anti-corruption agenda are
to: (i)re-visit the Public Leadership Ethics Code Act to accord with the President's
announcements regarding conflict-of-interest and corruption in leadership ranks; (ii)      review
the Political Parties Act and the Elections Act in order to control the financing of politics and
political campaigns; (iii)proceed with the preparation of the Freedom of InformationBill and
the Whistleblower Bill.

119.     As mentioned earlier, the government has, over the last year, been able to bring to
court a number of grand corruption cases, demonstrating that the overall institutional
framework is being enforced, and starting to dent the culture of impunity. The PCCB has been
also active to investigate corruption allegations at the regional level. The Ethics Secretariat i s
finalizing plans to set up an Ethics Tribunal, which will deal with specific cases breaking
against ethical rules and provided with sanctions. The government has pledged inthe PAF to
continue to fight grand corruption, but it has also indicated that it wants to attack the problem


                                               41

at all levels, and to this effect it has committed itself in the PAF to carry out a National
Governance and Corruption Survey, as a monitoring tool to guide its fight also against petty
corruption. The government's plans to improve the regulatory environment for the private
sector will also contribute to reduce opportunities of petty corruption. The proposed new
policy framework for PPP transactions and the strengthening of the autonomy and power of
the Procurement Regulatory Authority (see below) will also contribute to strengthenthe anti-
corruption agenda. While the PRSC is focusing of these last two specific issues, other
partners are taking the lead in closely monitoring the other critical aspects of the anti-
corruption agenda.

120.      Public Finance Management. The GBS 2008 review concluded that the progress
with PFMRP has been unsatisfactory, as significant concerns remain about: leadershipof the
program; technical and managerial capacity of the Secretariat to manage such a large and
complex reform program; and remaining weaknesses in the IFMIS control environment,
which increase fiduciary risk. In response to these concerns the government has initiated a
number of measures to improve management of PFMRP including the appointment of a
DeputyPermanent Secretaryto deal with PFMissues, and the fast track recruitment ofexperts
for the Technical support and Coordination Unit.

121.      Noteworthy progress has been made in the areas of external audit, internal audit, and
procurement, with consistent support from previous PRSC operations. Followingthe enacting
of the Public Audit Act during the year (PRSC-6 prior action), and the third consecutive
timely releaseof the Audit Report of Government's Accounts, the NationalAudit Office is on
track to reachLevel 3 of the AAFROSAI Capability Model by the planneddate of 2010. The
new organizational structure of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs has been
approved and includes the establishmentof a separate internal audit department for the whole
government (PRSC-7 prior action). The recruitment of internal auditors to fill the gaps in
various MDAshas continued, with 43 additional auditors recruited in2007/08.

122.      The procurement audits conductedby the PPRA for financial year 2007/08 for seventy
Procurement Entities (PES) show little improvement in the average level of compliance
compared to the previous year. The average level of compliance was estimated at 43 percent
(MDAs having 45 percent compliance and LGAs 41 percent). These weaknesses point to the
need to strengthen procurement capacity in a systematic way, especially as the procurement
capacity has a large adverse effect on the budget execution o fpublic investment. The medium-
term objective is to have Procurement Management Units (PMU) established in all PESand
the full operationalization of scheme of service for procurement cadre by 2010. The adoption
of regulations under the Procurement and Supplies Professional Board Act (PRSC-7 trigger)
i s the first step in this direction. The regulations to implement the Procurement and Supplies
Professional Board Act have not been issued, albeit the draft i s ready and is to be submitted
for legal clearance. Another important measure is to improve the quality of procurement and
cash flow plans, which exist only nominally. The PAF include a measureto have the Ministry
of Finance and 5 key line ministries to agree on credible cash flow and procurement plans
ahead ofthe next budget.




                                                  42

123.    Procurement o f large infrastructure transactions has been problematic, and has had a
record o f being tainted by manipulation, lack o f transparency, and corruption, in violation o f
the existing Procurement Act. The Parliament has recommended, and the government
accepted, to amend legislation as to give PPRA more autonomy from the Ministryo f Finance,
and to have more power to enforce the procurement regulations ex-ante (PRSC-8 trigger). The
authorities are confident that these amendments will be presented to Parliament as scheduled.
With respect to the autonomy, the intention is to amend current provisions that state that
PPRA is established within the Ministry o f Finance, creating a possible conflict o f interest,
since PPRA mandate i s also to oversee procurement practices in the Ministry o f Finance.
Another proposed change to strengthen PPRA's autonomy is to create a specific vote in the
budget for this entity. The envisaged amendments with respect to strengthening PPRA's
powers would notably: (i)empower PPRA to issue directives rather than recommendations;
(ii)establish a specific time limit for compliance with these directives; (iii)     empower PPRA to
stop or to cancel procurement proceedings in case o f major breach o f the procurement
regulations. The mechanisms for appeal before the Public Procurement Appeals Authority
would also be streamlined, and PPAA's autonomy from the MoFEA will also be clarified.

 PRSC-7 Prior Action: Approval granted to create a new Department of Internal Audit in the Ministry of
 Finance and Economic Affairs, and regulations under the Procurement and Supplies ProfessionalBoard Act
 prepared.
 PRSC-8 Trigger: Presentationto Parliamentof amendments to Public ProcurementAct to increase autonomy
 ofPPRA andpowerto enforce procurementrules.
 Objective: Strengthenedlegalframework andcapacity inprocurementandaudit for improvedpublic
 expenditureperformance,andstronger anti-corruptionsafeguards.

BudgetConsistency andResourceAllocation

124.    The execution o f the past budgets shows good performance in domestic revenue
collections: actual domestic revenue performed at 111 percent, and 104 percent o f budget
estimates for 2006/07 and 2007/08 respectively. Onthe expenditure side, the data for FY07/08
show that recurrent budget execution continues to perform well, in timeliness and
completeness. This indicates that delivery o f routine services should be good, although two
important qualifications apply: (i)some important recurrent resources for service delivery,
such as drugs, are budgeted under the development budget; (ii)             at the LGA level, which
accounts for around 15 percent o f the budget, the execution actually measures releases from
the central government to LGA, andnot actual spending.

125.    InFY07/08, there was a worsening inthe overall execution rate and the timeliness of
development funds in the budget compared to FY06/07, with the execution rate for the
development budget (both regions and MDAs) falling below 50 percent. An analysis o f
individual votes indicates that the execution was best in Agriculture where total expenditure
was 92 percent o f the budget, followed by Education at 89 percent. On the other hand the
lowest execution rate was recorded by the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare (74%),
Infrastructure (63%), and water (61%). The recurrent budget average deviation at vote level,
which i s the measure tracked by PRSC trigger, as worsened slightly from 16.0 to 16.7 percent
compared to FY06/07, but i s still better than inFY2005/06.




                                                  43

126.     Overall, late and unpredictable expenditures are potentially prime drivers o f poor
policy implementation and inefficiency in the expenditure o f funds. The recent PER Policy
Note on budget execution recommended: (a) streamlining o f basket funding modalities; (b)
streamlining o f internal MDA procedures; (c) improvement to the cash management system;
(d) improvement in procurement capacity; (e) better reporting from the LGA level and from
the dummy exchequer funds. These findingswill nurture the continuous PER process.

 PRSC-8 Trigger: Expenditure outturn for FY08/09 consistent with approved budget and recurrent budget
 deviationreduced.

127.     Resource allocation continues to be driven by MKUKUTA objectives, with about
two-thirds o f the discretionary (non-wage, non debt service) resources allocated to
MKUKUTAinterventions. Giventhe weight ofhealthand education sectors inthe wage bill,
MKUKUTA allocations should be well above three quarters of the total budget. Further
efforts are underway to strengthen the effectiveness o f within cluster and within sector
allocations, and efficiency in budget execution. MKUKUTA-related sectors received around
62 percent of the budget allocations inboth inFY06/07 and FY07/08, and 56 percent o f actual
expenditures in FY06/07. The large increase in expenditures in FY07/08 i s directed by 62
percent to MKUKUTA related sectors and by the remaining 38 percent to other sectors. The
increase in actual spending between 05/06 and 06/07 was directed by 104 percent to
MKUKUTA related sectors and by -4 percent to non-MKUKUTA. Social sector were the
main recipient o f increased expenditures.

128.     The figures show the government's commitment to implement MKUKUTA, and its
ability to direct aid resources towards it, while sustaining an effort to raise domestic revenues.
Increases indevelopment assistance (excl. debt relief) have translated inmore than equivalent
increases in spending/allocations to MKUKUTA sectors. Against this backdrop, the quality o f
budget preparation i s still weak, inparticular with respect to linking sector strategic plans and
sector budgets, and achieving an overall strategic view o f budget priorities in the medium-
term. The government i s working, with support from the PER and PFMRP, to improve the
strategic orientation o f the budget preparation.

129.    PRSC will continue to monitoring budget alignment with MKUKUTA objectives. In
that respect, the introduction o f stronger sector performance frameworks for social sector
reviews will be an important tool for improving effective alignment o f spending and
MKUKUTA objectives. Inthis year budget preparation, it will also be important to monitor
hw the government will be able to accommodate the revenue (relative) shortfall and the
additional expenditures stemming from the impact o f the crisis, in particular the ability to
maintain a pro-poor andpro-growth orientation o f expenditures.

 PRSC-7 Prior Action: Approved FY08/09 budget in line with policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector
 policies).
 PRSC-8 Trigger: Approved FY09/10 budget broadly in line with policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector
 policies).
 Objective: Ensureconsistencybetweengrowthandpovertyreductionstrategy and annual budgets

                          VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

130.    Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) have allowed the government to analyze the
distributional impact o f policy reforms on the well-being o f different stakeholder groups, with
particular focus on the poor and vulnerable. A poverty and social assessment on crop board
reform was carried out by the Bank in2005 under PRSC-3 and i s still relevant for these reforms,
which are however no longer covered by this PRSC operation.

131.    Reforms inthe energy sector, including potential increases intariffs, are expected to have
an overall positive impact on the poor. At present, the poor have extremely limited access to
energy, which implies that the current subsidies benefit primarilyto the better off and potentially
drain resources from pro-poor spending. While the poor receive a negligible share o f the implicit
energy subsidy, the Bank has advised that the lifeline tariff should be exempted from the
proposed increase, through an appropriate combination o f budget financing and cross-
subsidization from higher brackets. Furthermore, as illustrated in the investment climate
assessment, the lack o f access and interruptions to the power supply are major constrains to
economic growth. Power sector reform supported under the PRSC series, including tariff
increases, should contribute to improve reliability and access to power supply, ultimately
contributing to Tanzania's economic and social development.

132.    A broad PSIA program is under way, with a focus on water, agriculture, landpolicy, and
the in-country institutionalization o f PSIA. In addition, most core diagnostic or sector work
addressesthese issues eventhough the final product i s not presented as a PSIA.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

133.    Monitoringarrangements. Theegovernment has issued two key reports to follow up on
MKUKUTA implementation. These are the Poverty and Human Development Report 2007
(PHDR), the third MKUKUTA Annual Implementation Report 2007/08 (MAIR). The PHDR,
which is published bi-annually, consolidates poverty measures from various sources, and
provides analysis o f poverty trends and underlying factors. Sector reviews are also key
monitoring mechanisms for developments at the sector level, and the PSI reviews, as well as the
monthly Bank o f Tanzania economic reports are the key sources for the assessment o f the
macroeconomic situation. Progress inpublic expenditure management covering improvements in
systems, enhanced allocative and operational efficiency inthe use o f inputs, and the consistency
o fthe budget andbudget execution with the MKUKUTAare tracked by the annual PEFARs.

134.    While the system Tanzania has put inplace for M&E o f MKUKUTA is elaborate, it has
remained mainly donor-oriented, producing M&E outputs o f uneven relevance. The underlying
M&E system is under revision to strengthen information quality, policy relevance, and
integration with the budget process, notably by (i)implementing a new National Statistical
master plan; (ii)carrying out the implementation o f an annual LSMS panel survey, starting 2009;
(iii)supportingthe strengthening ofthe internalreportingrequirements ofthe government, in
particular, the output and performance reports newly introduced in the latest budget guidelines;



                                               45

and (iv) better integrating MKUKUTA's M&E and the public service reform program, which in
its new phase puts much emphasis on results and accountability, hence better performance from
the public service.

135.      Results monitoring of budget support suffers from the unavailability or low frequency of
some of the critical outcomes indicators, such as poverty estimates, health outcomes, or learning
achievements. The availability of the poverty survey data in the third quarter of 2008, and
subsequentlythe results of the annualpanel survey, as well as the demographic and health survey
plannedfor 2009, will allow a muchtighter follow up on the impact of the government policies
and spending. An additional dimension of the monitoring framework covers the government-
donor relationship inmonitoringprogress on PRSC objectives, such as enhanced local ownership
of the development process, participation by all stakeholders, and efficiency of aid delivery
mechanisms. In particular, the PRSC team i s working with the PRBS partners to enhance the
capacity of, and informationflows with, Parliament, civil society andthe private sector.


                       Text Box 2. Good PracticePrinciplesinPolicy-based Lending
  Principle 1-Reinforceownership
  The government's home-grownPRS, the MKUKUTA, was developedthrough extensive national consultations,
  and i s broadly-sharedplatform for government action. Tanzania is at the forefiont of aid coordination through
  strong alignment of both the broader program and the budget support instrument to the MKUKUTA, though the
  Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST), which was completed in 2007. The Poverty Reduction Budget
  Support (PRBS) processmultiple fora, at the sector cluster and macro levels, are headedby government.
  Principle2  -Agree    in advance with the government and other financialpartners on a coordinated
  accountabilityframework
  Donor harmonization and alignment with Government priorities is well-advanced in Tanzania. The government
  and DP have subscribedto a PartnershipFrameworkMemorandum(PFM) which set the rules for thejoint PRBS
  process which underlies PRSC. Under the PFM, the government and development partners organize budget
  support around a joint annual implementationplan for the MKUKUTA, summarizedin a common Performance
  Assessment Framework(PAF).
  Principle3  -Customize      the accountability framework and modalities of Bank supportto country
  circumstances
  Policies supportedby the PRSC represent actions included inthe PAF that the government believes will leadto
  the desired MKUKUTA outcomes, and thus reflect country preferences. They are selected in consultationwith
  donors, including the Bank, from the larger PEAP policy matrix. The PRSC is structured so that financing is
  committed intime for the preparationofthe Budget Guidelines for the following fiscal year.
  Principle 4 -Chooseonly actions critical to achieve results as conditions for disbursement
  The PRSC triggers represent actions and outputs that are consideredcritical by the government to the success of
  its reforms. Several of the PRSC prior actions are basedon satisfactory completion of undertakings agreed to in
  existing sectoral review processes (e.g., in water), thus avoiding creation of new and overlapping review
  structures and indicators.However, the Bank continues to provide important input to the sector review process to
  improve prioritization and outcome-orientation.

  Principle 5 -Conducttransparent      progress reviews conduciveto predictableand performance-based
  financialsupport
  The Annual Review of PRBS is apublic event chairedby government.There is an establishedpreparation
  process, andthe PFM envisage that within six weeks ofthe Annual Review's conclusion, DP will make indicative
  financial commitment under PRBS, basedon their evaluationofthe outcomes ofthe annualreview

136.    Supervision. Supervision and preparation of subsequent credits will take place in close
collaboration with other donors and be consistent with the MKUKUTA review mechanism.For
most of the program areas, supervision and dialogue will be carried out on a continuous basis in
the context of sector or thematic programs.A joint GBS reviewwill be conductedannually for an
overall assessment of progress made in each of the program areas. In addition, the achievement
of PRSC targets will be assessed annually in the context of the MKUKUTA review that will
document the progress made in the MKUKUTA implementation and analyze the outcomes of
reforms. The reform program sets out clear quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for the
implementation period of the MKUKUTA. The PRSC targets are fully consistent with the
MKUKUTA.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

137.    A Special Audit of the Bank of Tanzania (BOT)EPA account for FY05/06 identified
serious occurrences of fraud, which affected the integrity of the BoT's control and audit systems,
and resulted in illicit payments. Following the strong government response, as detailed in the
PRSC-6 Program Document, the Authorities have continued to strengthen the fiduciary
environment at the Bank of Tanzaniaby: (i) continuing to implementthe recommendationsofthe
special audit, as summarized inthe Government's Action plan sharedwith the DPs; (ii)    including
many of the recommendations of the Voluntary Safeguard Assessment in the upcoming
Corporate Plan of the BOT,with ongoing monitoring from the IMF; (iii)        starting prosecution
against individuals involved in the fraud; (iv) refocusing the BOT on its core activities, and
preparing a new MoU with the Ministry of Finance. The 2009 PAF includes a specific action on
the implementation of the government's EPA Action Plan, and the DP and the Bank have
received inMarch 2009 an update of the Action Plan implementation status.

138.    An IMF Safeguards Assessment (SA) of BOTwas conducted in 2008. It updated the
earlier assessment of 2003. This assessment showed that BoT's financial statements for 2006/07
comply with International Financial Reporting Standardsand that recent steps have beentaken to
strengthen BoT's oversight framework, the internal audit function and the control system.
However the assessment found that risks remain and that BOTneeds to take steps for further
strengthening the mandate and independence of the Audit Committee, revamp the internal audit
function, implement an internationally recognized control framework and take measures to
improve transparency in accounting, audit and control functions. BOTis taking proactive action
to implementthe recommendationsofthe SA.

139.    The Bank has received a copy of the audited financial statements of BOTfor the year
endedJune 30th 2007. This audit was conducted by Ernst & Young Tanzania on behalf of CAG.
A clean audit report was issued with an Emphasis on Matter on the EPA fraud. The Bank has
also been regularly receiving the annual external audit report for PRSC, and quarterly internal
audit reports from BOT.To strengthen DP's confidence in the fiduciary management of budget
support funds, an external review of the mode of operation of the PRBS accounts at the BOT       -
where all funds of GBS partnersare disbursed was carried out last year The review confirmed
                                               -
the integrity of PRBS funds, and made recommendations on a number of improvements of the
mode of operations, which have resulted in new technical improvements to the related financial
operations. A comprehensive audit of budget resources is therefore carried out by the National


                                               47

Audit Office. In light of the above the fiduciary risk to Bank funds being disbursedto BOTfor
onwards credit to the exchequer account is rated as "Low".

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
140.     Borrower and credit amount. The borrower is the United Republic of Tanzania. A
single tranche credit of SDR 127.7million (US$190 million equivalent) would be made available
upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for August 2009. The closing date of the operation would
be November 30, 2010. It is envisagedthat there will be one further single-tranche annual PRSCs
to support the implementation of the MKUKUTAduring FY10/11,

141.     Disbursement,reporting, and auditingarrangements.The proposed credit will follow
the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Credit proceeds will be
disbursedagainst satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to
any specific purchases or be subject to procurement requirements.Once the credit i s approvedby
the Board andbecomeseffective, the proceedsofthe credit will be depositedat the request ofthe
Borrower by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower at the Bank of Tanzania and which
forms part of the country's official foreign exchange reserves. The Borrower shall ensure that
upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in local
currency to an account that is available to finance budgeted expenditures. The Borrower will
provide a written confirmation to the Bank when the amount has beencredited to an account that
i s available to finance budgetedexpenditures. Ifthe proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to,
promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA.
Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this
credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

142.     The following arrangements also support the requirementsrelated to fiduciary assurance:

     0   Foreign reserve account. The government will acknowledge to IDA receipt of the money
         into the foreign reserve account and the crediting of this amount in local currency to the
         Tanzania government Consolidated Fund Account. While no external audit will be
         required, it is expected that the confirmation of receipt will be countersigned by the
         Accountant Generaland the Controller andAuditor General.

         Public (government) accounts. The Controller and Auditor General i s required by law to
         produce his annual report to Parliament on the public accounts withinnine months of the
         financial year-end. IDA will have access to those reports.

     0   Bank of Tanzania. The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of Tanzania,
         audited in accordance with international auditing standards as promulgated by the
         International Accounting StandardBoard, are publiclyavailable.



ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS
143.     The PRSC contributes to the financing of the implementation o f Tanzania's MKUKUTA
across all three MKUKUTA clusters, but the policy dialogue focuses primarily on institutional



                                                  48

reforms in selected areas. This section thus discusses (a) the likely environmental effects of the
actions monitored under the PRSC performance assessment framework, and (b) the overall
capacity of government to monitor andmitigate environmental effects of budgetary expenditure.

 144.   With respect to policy reforms contained inthe PerformanceAssessment Framework and
supportedbythe operation, and given the potential negative environmental implications of policy
reforms and their implementation, several measures are taken to ensure that any negative
environmental effects of the various activities will be properly addressed by the government of
Tanzania in collaboration with its development partners. In line with the requirement of the
Environmental Management Act (EMA 2004), precautionary approaches need to be undertaken
by each sector to capture broader effects within and inother sectors. EMA requires each sector to
establish a sector environmental section that will undertake analysis of environmental impacts of
sectoral legislation, regulations, policies, plans, strategies and programs through strategic
environmental assessments. Some of the key sectors under the program (PRSC), such as
agriculture and water are already in the process of conducting Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA), as a precautionary approach. The main objective of SEA is to give particular
attention to supporting the incorporation of environmental and social concerns into policies and
long-term development and investment planning as well as safeguarding against potential
adverse environmental impacts. SEA is expected to be an important input in sector policy
formulation, strategy or planning for the water sector  - to strengthenenvironmental planning and
management capacity for the implementation of the National Water Policy (NAWAPO; and
irrigation under the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP) as part of preparation for
the National Irrigation Policy and Strategy, the draft of which has been submitted to the
parliament for review and approval.

145.    Among the policies supported by the operation that may raise concerns from an
environmental perspective is the rehabilitation of 15,000 kmof roads by 2010. The implementing
agency for road works on main roads in Tanzania, TANROADS, has established an
environmental unit and procedures for the environmental impact assessment of its road works.
Although Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) i s normally done by external consultants,
TANROADS i s responsible for reviewing and monitoring of the implementation of the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The preparation o f EM and EMP i s mandatory for all
upgrading works. Only very low impact road works are done on rural roads by the local
governments. The supervising agency at PMO-RALG needs to build up some EA capacity to
advise the LGaccordingly. Inthe rural sector, another area ofpotential environmental andnatural
resource concerns, supported country policies will promote a more sustainable use of natural
resources and minimize waste. Other sectors, which have prepared or are in the process of
preparing SEA as an input insector policy formulation, strategy or planning include: water sector
- to strengthenenvironmental planning and management capacity for the implementation of the
National Water Policy (NAWAPO); and irrigation under the Agriculture Sector Development
Program (ASDP) as part of preparation for the National IrrigationPolicy and Strategy, scheduled
to be finalized before June 2009.

146.    The impact of higher electricity tariffs on fuel wood is expectedto be very limitedtaking
into account that (a) only a relative small number of Tanzanians are connected to the grid (with
particular low connection rates in rural areas), and (b) electricity i s not commonly used for


                                                 49

cooking (mainly for affordability reasons). This said, it needs to be pointed out that there i s a
problem with the unsustainableproductionof fuel wood and charcoal, as the mainenergy sources
for poor households. The Bank is addressingthis together with GOT, through a Charcoal Policy
Note and subsequent piloting of a National FuelwoodCharcoa1 Action Plan under the Tanzania
Forest Management and Conservation Project.

 147.   Another policy supported by PRSC, enhanced transparency in the public allocation
mechanisms for the commercial exploitation of natural resources, should, in the medium-term,
allow a more sustainable economic management of these resources, as studies have shown that
the lack of transparency leads to both over-exploitation of resources and exclusion of local
populations from the economic benefits. The Bankwill assist the government inmaking sure that
the action plan for a more transparent allocation mechanism is consistent with the national
environmental policies.

 148.   In analyzing potential effects of supported country policies on the environment and the
government's environmental management capacity in the roads and rural sector, the Bank relies
on a variety o f analytic work undertaken over the past years. These include a Strategic
Environmental Assessment under previous PRSCs and analytic work underpinning
environmental aspects of investment projects, including Bank projects in the roads, water, and
energy sectors. In addition, the Bank supported studies on the interaction between poverty and
environment as well as growth and environment. As project support for some sectors i s being
shifted from specific sector operations to the PRSC, the PRSC draws on the environmental
managementsystems that governmenthas establishedwith the support ofthese projects.

 149.   Inaddition to the assessment of potential effects of policy actions directly supported by
the PRSC, the PRSC also supports government in its efforts to monitor and mitigate
environmental effects of public expenditures, financed from domestic resources and general
budget support provided under the GBS framework. The implementation of the National
Environmental Management Act will strengthen in-country capacity for screening, monitoring
investments for positive and negative environmental effects andthe ability at national anddistrict
level to identify mitigation measures for reducing effects. The Act is very comprehensiveand has
specific provisions for EA, SEA as well as conflict resolution and administrative processes for
pollution charges according to the `polluter pays' principle. The Vice President's Office and the
National Environmental Management Council have been supporting the development and
implementation of various sector-specific guidelines for EA (initially in roads and agriculture),
and have more recently pursuedprocedures for strategic and sector environmental assessment to
permit mitigation of any adverse environmental effects while taking advantage of potential
synergiesbetweenpoverty reduction and environmental protection efforts.

PARTICIPATORY ASPECTS
150.   The reform agenda supportedby the PRSC derives from Tanzania's MKUKUTA,which
has been developed through a consultative process in which government sought inputs and
feedback from a wide array of stakeholders representing all levels of society and all regions of
Tanzania. Similarly, Tanzania's MKUKUTA monitoring system also i s open to inputs fiom
inside and outside government.



                                                50

151.     Aside from the MKUKUTA, the government o f Tanzania carries out wide ranging
consultations on most policy reforms and many o f the policy areas covered by the PRSC are
underpinned by sector or thematic processes that are open to stakeholders from civil society,
NGOs, academic and research institutes, the private sector, and the donor community. This
includes the PER process as a regular forum for dialogue on public expenditure, financial, and
macro-economic management, the Investor Round Table and the Tanzania National Business
Council for government      - private sector dialogue, and the environment working group. In
addition, Tanzania has also put in place a process for an independent monitoring o f the
government-donor relationship, which also covers the PRSC. The design o f the GBS framework
seeks to encourage the further development o f participatory review processes in all areas, which
would then provide the main inputs to the overall GBS assessment.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
152.     There are two closely interrelated and overlapping sets o f risks for this operation. The
first set includes general risks that may interfere with the successful implementation o f the
MKUKUTA, foremost the vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to the international economic
crisis, the general direction o f economic and social reforms and a continued ownership o f the
core principles behind MKUKUTA, political risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid
dependence, decentralization, and capacity constraints. The second set o f risks could undermine
the overall credibility o f the GBS process - and PRSC - as an effective mean to channel
resources towards the achievement o f the MKUKUTA objectives. This set includes: corruption
and weak domestic accountability, the reliance on the domestic budget process, the transition to
sector review processes, and fiduciary risks.

    Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth in relation to the international crisis. Tanzania's
    growth performance remains vulnerable to external shocks which can be exacerbated by
    domestic structural weaknesses. Areas o f vulnerability to external shocks, which are
    particularly relevant given the current international economic situation, include tourism,
    which has become a leading source o f foreign exchange, and terms o f trade, especially with
    regard to the prices o f the leading export commodities including gold, coffee, tea, and fish,
    and import commodities, especially oil. The likely impact of the crisis has been described in
    Section I1o f this document. It i s important to recognize that considerable uncertainty remains
    with respect to boththe international economy, andthe impact on Tanzania, so that downside
    risk may evolve quickly, and will require constant monitoring, and rapid and flexible
    reaction. The ability o f Tanzania to quickly access the 25 percent o f its quota through the
    IMF ESF facility, due to its good standing PSI program, as well as access to the rest o f the
    quota represents an important defense against such uncertainty. Additional World Bank
    financing under the proposed Vulnerability Fund would also allow the World Bank group
    extra flexibility.

    Vulnerability of Tanzania's growth to domestic shocks. Recurrent droughts have
    significant impacts on agriculture and the power sector, which i s heavily dependent on hydro
    generation. A combination o f a severe drought with the international economic crisis could
    create very difficult social conditions, and mightrequire a shift towards emergency programs.
    The Bank i s discussing with the Authorities measures to strengthen agriculture production,
    and targeted social protection schemes. The planned expansion o f Tanzania's power


                                                  51

  generation capacity, which also includes diversification into thermal (gas, coal, and fuel)
  power sources, will be important to avoid recurrent energy crises, but has been proceeding
  slowly.

  Political risk. Since independence in 1961, Tanzania has developed one of the strongest
  track records of political stability in Africa, despite contentious election in Zanzibar.,
  Zanzibar's semiautonomous status and the presence of a strong opposition party have led to
  three contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite international
  observers' claims of voting irregularities. InOctober 2001,the ruling and the main opposition
  party reached a bilateral accord, which was hailed as a landmark achievement by an African
  country to solve its thorny political issues through internal dialogue. The main opposition
  party has as a result been represented in the Zanzibar Electoral Commission as part of the
  agreement. In2006, government and the main opposition party reaffirmed their commitment
  to revive the process for mutual political understanding in Zanzibar, popularly known as
  Muafaka, but recently aplannedpoliticalcompromise leading to some level of power-sharing
  has hit a stalemate.. The Government has approached the UNfor support with the fair and
  safe conduct of the 2010 general andpresidential elections.

0 Aid-dependence.Tanzania's dependence on external aid, which is about 12percent of GDP
  and finances around 35 percent of its budget, makes the country extremely vulnerable to
  changes in donor sentiment. With respect to general budget support, disbursements are
  subject to potentially more abrupt changes of donor's sentiment. The PFM underlying the
  PRSC recognizes these risks and contains a general commitment by all participating donors
  that, in case budget support is to be reduced, this should be done in a gradual manner. The
  Tanzania Assistance Strategy also recognizes the need to design aid modalities with a view
  towards minimizing the scope for abrupt changes. However, there is also a clear recognition
  that the authorities need to maintain an appropriate environment for sustaining relatively high
  levels of aid. The rapid increase inthe level of domestic revenues, which for the first time in
  FY08/09 will cover recurrent expenditures, i s a critical achievement to mitigate aid
  dependence.

  Decentralization.Another risk for the achievement of MKUKUTA objectives arises from
  the ongoing decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty reducing
  programs in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. The local
  government reform program focuses on strengthening the capacity of local authorities. As a
  result, there have been significant improvement in accountability processes at the local level
  and about 50 percent of local authorities now meet basic accountability standards, compared
  to an estimated 10 percent only a few years ago. The PRSC also supports actions to
  strengthen the watchdog role of beneficiaries at the community level through disclosure o f
  the flow of resourcesat the grassroots level and expenditure tracking o f financial flows from
  the central government through the annual PERs.

0 Capacity constraints. Limited human resources capacity to implement and manage the
  PRSC reform agenda represents another risk.A large number o f capacity-building efforts are
  inplace. Most reformprograms have capacity-building componentsembedded, includingthe
  PFMRP, the LGRP, and the PSRP. Similarly, sector programs and projects typically also
  contain capacity building components. The challenge for Tanzania i s to enhance the



                                               52

  effectiveness o f capacity-building efforts by shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven
  efforts and address capacity building in a holistic way, in which the incentive structure,
  education system, and specific capacity-building efforts are organized in a mutually
  reinforcing manner. Analytic work to address these issues is planned. Inthe medium term, it
  i s expected that the shift from project to budget support by the Bank and other donors will
  release staff that are currently tied up inproject management to play a greater role in overall
  public sector management.

  Corruption and weak domestic accountability. One o f the intentions of the redesigned
  GBS framework is to use domestic processes for the assessment o f progress and dialogue.
  This is intended to foster domestic accountability. However, as some o f the analytic work has
  shown, these processes are still weak, partly because o f weak incentives and capacity o f civil
  society organizations, NGOs, and the private sector to participate in these processes. Recent
  events, though, have shown a renewed vigor in the oversight role o f parliament and o f the
  media, and the initial prosecutions o f a number o f grand corruption cases, if carried
  uniformly, will help dent the culture o f impunity.

0 Reliance on domestic budget process. The utilization o f PRSC resources is determined by
  the domestic budget process with the possibility that resource allocation i s influenced by
  other factors than the pursuit o f the MKUKUTAMKUZA objectives. The principal
  mitigating measure derives from strengthening the role o f domestic stakeholders in budget
  formulation and budget review. Government's continued commitment to an open and
  participatory PER andbudget process is an important and well established tool to support and
  monitor consistency o f budget formulation and execution with the MKUKUTA. It is worth
  noting that due to fungibility o f resources, the allocative risk also exists for other aid
  modalities and the PRSC i s explicitly designed to address this risk.

0 Fiduciary risks. The 2006 and 2008 PEFA assessments suggest that Tanzania's financial
  management system i s still among the best inAfiica. Nonetheless, significant fiduciary risks
  inthe areas of financial management and procurement remain. Inrecent years, government
  has implemented measures to reduce fiduciary risks, including the approval and application
  o f new public finance and procurement acts, the operationalization o f the electronic Financial
  Management System (IFMIS), strengthening o f the National Audit Office, and reform o f the
  public procurement system. The PFMRP and actions monitored by the PRSC and PAF are
  designed to address weaknesses in government's financial management and procurement
  systems, with particular emphasis on the integrity o f IFMIS. Tight follow up o f the
  Government's action plan on the EPA account audit, and o f other government measures to
  assess eventual past fraudulent transactions at the Central Bank will also be part o f PRSC
  supervision.

                                    RE: Letter of DevelopmentPolicv

1.         On behalf of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, Iwould like
to request your approval for the Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-7)
in the amount of US$190 million (SDR equivalent). This credit will complement
Government's effort in the implementation of the National Strategy for Growth and
Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA) as well as ongoing Government reforms to foster
macroeconomic stability, infrastructure development in key sectors, private sector's
participation in the economy, enhance governance and accountability and
environmentalsustainability.

1.         BACKGROUNDAND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     A.         MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

2.         Tanzania has continued to experience good economic performance
underpinned by macroeconomic stability emanating mainly from steadfast
implementationof policy and structural reforms. Real GDP growth for 2008 was 7.4
percent compared to 7.1 percent recorded in 2007.

3.        The current global financial crisis has resulted in economic slowdown in the
developed world and is likely to feed into the Tanzania economy through various
ways including: reduced demand and prices for Tanzania's traditional exports like
cotton, coffee, cloves, cashew nuts and non-traditionalexports, such as horticulture
and tanzanite. Moreover, the credit crunch in developed countries may slow down
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to Tanzania. Furthermore, the decline in
household incomes in developed countries has started to show up in a reduction in

                                                   55

the number and levels of spending by tourists coming to Tanzania. Nevertheless,the
financial sector in Tanzania remains sound and safe as manifested by most key
financial indicators. The sector has not been significantly affected because of the low
level of integration with the internationalcapital and financial markets. Going forward,
the Government will take initiatives to mitigate the adverse impact of the global
financial crisis and stimulate the economy, including easing of the fiscal and
monetary stance for 2008/09 and in the medium term. In addition, the Government
has formed a Task Force, led by the Governor of the Bank of Tanzania, to assess
the impact of global economic slow down and propose appropriate measures. Some
measures will be included in the budget for 2009/10, while others will be
implemented in the medium term.

4.      In 2008, the economy experienced substantial inflationary pressure,
emanating mostly from high world oil and food prices as well as an increase in
electricity tariffs. Food inflation was exacerbated by food shortage in the
neighbouring countries. The annual average headline inflation increased to 10.3
percent in 2008 from 7.0 percent in 2007. The annual average food and non-food
inflation increased to 12.7 percent and 6.7 percent in 2008 from 7.1 percent each in
2007, respectively. Headline inflation reached a peak of 13.5 percent in December
2008, and slowed down to 13.0 percent in March 2009. Inflation is expected to
decline to 9.8 percent by June 2009 owing to the expected low and stable price of oil;
a fairly stable exchange rate; and the prudent monetary and fiscal policies.

5.      On the external sector, the import bill continued to rise substantially resulting
into widening of the current account deficit from USD 1,988 million registered in 2007
to USD 2,522 million in 2008. Nonetheless, foreign exchange reserves remained
buoyant at USD 2.89 billion at the end of December 2008, sufficient to cover about
4.3 months of imports of goods and services. During this period, the value of the
Shilling depreciated by 13.1 percent to an average of Tshs. 1,280.30 per USD, from
Tshs. 1, I32.09 recorded in 2007.

6.      Poverty reduction efforts have continued well. However, the modest results
revealed by the recent Household Budget Survey (HBS) 2007 imply that more effort
is needed to address MKUKUTA targets. Specifically, the marginal decline in food
poverty and basic needs poverty in urban and rural areas call for increased efforts to
accelarate growth, improve the wellbeing of our people and strengthen governance
and accountability. Measures will have to be taken to increase production, and
create more employment opportunities. This will partly be facilitated through
increased credit to private sector and promotion of investment in infrastructure
through the use of PPPs and promotion of SMEs. Under the social well being
cluster, more efforts will be placed on improving the quality of education, health and
water services.

B. BUDGET SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN
    REFORM PROCESS

7.     The Government has continued to advocate for the General Budget Support
(GBS) as the preferred aid modality in line with the objective of achieving full
integration with the Government budget, public financial management and

                                           56

accountability systems and strong Government control over resource allocation.
Other modalities (Project and basket funding) are also expected to be fully in line
with national priorities, strategies and programmes, and rely on Government
structures for implementation consistent with the JAST principles. The GBS review
provides the platform through which progress on the implementation of various
reform initiativesare assessedjointly by DPs and Government, and proposethe way
forward.

II.    REFORM PROGRAMMEUNDER THE PAF 2006107                  -2007/08
8.     The JAST adopts all of the existing national MKUKUTA and GBS processes
for monitoring and evaluation. The PAF is governed by the Partnership Framework
Memorandum, which is agreed jointly by the Government and Development
Partners. Under this memorandum, the Government is committed to promoting high
economic growth and reducing poverty through implementation of MKUKUTA, while
the Development Partners are committed to providing financial assistance to
compliment Government's efforts. Thus PAF consists of jointly agreed indicators
drawn from the MKUKUTA and other national processes and they are assessed
during the GBS Annual Review. The latest Annual Review was held in November
2008 and the following are the progress/ achievements of the PAF/PRSC-7 agreed
actions.

           C. INFRASTRUCTUREAND ENERGY

9.     The growth of the economy is very much dependant on adequate energy and
transport infrastructure.Progress made in implementing various prior actions agreed
in sectors under the growth cluster is as follows:

10.    Good progress has been made in implementing TANESCO'S Financial
Recovery Plan. The installation of TANESCO's own IOOMW gas-fired plant was
completed and the capacity became available to the national grid in September
2008. An additional 45MW gas-fired generation capacity is under construction.
These measures, together with the coming to end of the emergency power contracts
procured at the height of the drought in 2006, are expected to substantially
strengthen TANESCO's financial position in the medium term. In addition, the
ongoing cost of service study by TANESCO will allow assessing of the level of cost
recoveryconsistent with financial viability of TANESCO.

    PRSC- 7Prior Action:
    Furfher progress in implementation of the TANESCO financial recovery plan to
    strengthen TANESCO'srevenue base.

11.    The Government recognises the need to scale up growth by strongly
addressing constraints of growth, including resource availability. The Government
understandsthat additional concessionalfinancing sources are not sufficient to cope
with demand. Thus, one of the alternative options of financing is through promotion
of PPPs. This will increase participationof the private sector in the implementationof
infrastructure projects, while ensuring a fair sharing of risks associated with such
projects. Government Departments are generally expected to drive the process in

                                           57

their respective sectors, having regard to centrally established guidelines on the
process, and requisite control mechanisms from the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Affairs. Following agreement on a broad policy framework for PPPs in
early 2008, the PPP policy is scheduled to be approved by end June 2009 and
thereby meetthe respective prior action.

     PRSC- 7 Prior Action:
     Finalize a National PPP Policy to facilitate PPP in infrastructure sector among
     others.
12.     The Government recognizes the necessity of improving the business
environment to promote investment as the prerequisite for accelerated and
sustainable growth in a stable macroeconomic environment. Emphasis has been
placed on improving the regulatory and institutional environment through the
Business Environment Strengthening for Tanzania (BEST) programme. The BEST
programme aims to attract informal businesses into the formal economy, creating
possibilities for the private sector to grow, as well as creating more jobs and higher
income.     The Government has been undertaking a number of reforms which
culminated into the promulgation of the Business Activities RegistrationAct (BARA)
in 2007. The Government has prepared Regulations in line with BARA.
Implementationof the Act will be piloted in 24 LGAs and will reduce cost and time of
starting business. Substantive revisions and amendments to the Act and Regulations
will be made where necessary, based on legal, administrative and operational
lessons drawn from the pilot.

            D. NATURAL RESOURCES

13.     The Government has requested assistance from the World Bank on the
collection, and reporting of information on transparent and accountable systems of
allocations of licenses/concessionand how this meets market values in the Forestry,
Fisheries, Wildlife and Minerals. Once this work is completed, the Government will
initiate implementationof an action plan to improve accountability and transparency
in managing natural resource licenses and concessions, if any. The informationwill
include total value of revenue received from concessions and licenses for forestry,
fishing, wildlife and minerals.

PRSC 7      -   Prior action: Information on transparency and accountability of
licenses/concession allocations systems collected in the forestty, fisheries', wildlife,
minerals and oil & gas sectors.

           E. MACROECONOMICSTABILITY

14.     The prospects in the medium term suggests that GDP growth will be around 5
percent during 2009, a downward revision of projections mainly on account of the
likely impact of the global financial crisis on export of goods and services.A rebound
is projected in the outer years whereby 5.7 percent, 7.2 percent and 7.5 percent
have been projected for 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. On the other hand, the
following projections have been made for the medium term: To contain inflation at

* TheGovernment requestedassistance from the World Bank in this area.

                                             58

around 9.8 percent by end June, 2009, and bring it down to 5 percent by 2011/12.
On the money supply front, the Government intends to contain the growth rate of M2
at 27.1 percent in 2008/09, 28.1 percent in 2009/10, 29.0 in 2010/11 and 31.I
percent in 2011/12 in line with the projected GDP growth and inflation targets.
Further, the Government will maintain adequate official reserves to cover at least five
months worth of imports of goods and non-factor services; and continue to maintain
a market determined exchange rate, with Bank of Tanzania's interventions
exclusively limited to smoothing wide fluctuations and/or for liquidity management
purposes.

15.    The Government will continue to improve domestic revenue collections in the
medium term. Possible measures could include introductionof legislative changes to
the fiscal regime for the mining sector; review of the structure of non tax revenue;
and revisiting all principal and subsidiary legislations on tax exemptions with a view
to reduce the levels of exemptions, which are already relatively high compared to
those in the region. However,the revenue growth is projectedto slow down in light of
the global economic downturn and its negative impact on corporate income taxes,
PAYE and import duties due to reduced sales, layoff of workers and slowdown in the
growth of value of imports. Inthe mediumterm, the revenueto GDP ratio is projected
to edge upwards from the projected 15.7 percent in 2008/09 to 16.2 percent in
2009/10 and thereafter 18.3 percent in 2011/12.

           F. IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DELIVERY OF
              PUBLIC SERVICES

16.    The Government reaffirms its commitment to sustain macroeconomic stability,
improving the quality of budget formulation and implementation as well as ensuring
overall expenditure discipline. The underlying processes for this area include the
Budget Guidelines, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Review
(PEFAR), Policy Support Instrument (PSI), Annual MKUKUTA Progress Report, and
quarterly Budget ExecutionReports.


17.    Budget execution for 2007/08 was broadly in line with the approved budget.
There has been significant progress in reducing recurrent expenditure deviation over
several years. However, the changes in the Government structure which occurred in
early February 2008 resulted into budget adjustments for a number of MDAs to
provide for their new mandates. Thus the average recurrent deviation was 16.7% in
2008, a slight deterioration from 16% reported in 2007. Efforts are being made to
enhance the capacity of the Cash Management Unit and MDAs so as to improve the
forecasts, expenditure planning and implementation. The analysis indicated that
execution of the recurrent budget is much more in line with plans, whereas
development expenditure continues to suffer from slow procurement, disbursement
delays for foreign funded baskets and projects (including inadequate reporting of
disbursements), and slow physicalimplementationin some cases.

18.    The Government has continued to strategically allocate resources to MDAs,
Regions and LGAs. The Strategic Budget Allocation System (SBAS) is a tool used to
allocate resources between votes and cross cutting MKUKUTA cluster strategies for

                                          59

MDAs and Regions,while LGAs have continuedto receive their allocations under the
formula based approach. In principle, the target is to allocate 40%, 40%, and 20%
MKUKUTA resources to interventions under Cluster I, Cluster II, and Cluster Ill
respectively. The approved Budget for 2008/2009 was broadly prepared in line with
MKUKUTA priorities and other national priorities, with well above two thirds of the
budget allocated for MKUKUTA interventions.

19.    The 2008/09 budget cycle began with the evaluation of the previous year
budget process and SBAS training and provision of indicative ceilings for MDAs,
Regions and LGAs. The indicative ceilings facilitated the process of prioritisationand
sequencing of interventions as well as a significant reduction in deviations between
the requests and final allocations by the Committee. The first draft of the Guidelines
was produced in January 2008. However, the approval process was interrupted
following changes in the Government structure which occurred in early February
2008, thus delaying the issuance of Guidelines up to April 2008. To ensure a
streamlined calendar for 2008/09 annual budget cycle, MDAs, Regions and LGAs
were given provisional PBG with respective ceilings to facilitate the finalising of their
MTEFs.

20.    The emphasis was placed on priorities identified in 2007/08 cycle, ensuring
adequate funding for the ongoing initiatives and those initiatives aiming at
accelerating growth, improving delivery of social services, and promoting good
governance.Thus, overallthe following action was achieved.

    PRSC-7 Prior Action
    Approved budget for FY 2008/09 broadly in line with policy objectives
    (MKUKUTA,sectorpolicies)

          G. IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE
             OVERALL INCENTIVE ENVIRONMENT

21.    The Government has continued to emphasise on efficiency in public service
delivery. The current Public Service Reform Programme Phase II (PSRP II) is a
result of Government's long term efforts in an attempt to improve public service
delivery. The initial efforts include the implementation of Civil Service Reform
Programme (CSRP, 1991-1 999), which was followed by implementation of PSRP
Phase I (2000-2007). Overall, these initiatives showed positive and significant
improvement in the performance of public sector institutions in delivering services.
PSRP II is a five year programme (2008-2012) with major focus on enhancing
performance and accountability. The design and implementation approaches of
PSRP Phase II took into account lessons and experience gained from the past
reforms. PSRP II therefore aims among others to have: a more explicit focus on
reforming and improving policy and regulatory processes; promote demand driven
accountabilitythrough working with civil society organisations; pursue an approach to
leadership development which goes beyond leadership training; and the creation of
Human Resource(HR) planningsystems and processes.

22.    The fiscal year 2007/08 was used primarily as a preparatory phase.
Implementation procedures were finalised, internal capacity assessed, designed a

                                          60

demand-driven process and trained internal facilitators. The demand-driven
approach aims to strengthen ownership and sustainability by having MDAs plan,
implement, monitor and evaluate their own reform programmes. A total of 25
Ministries were identified and tasked to prioritise key areas for PSRP II support. This
participatoryprocess included awareness creation for the MDAs' management teams
to enhance PO-PSM individualised delivery of services to MDAs and to manage
MDA administration's expectationsfrom the reform. Key reform areas were identified
and activities have been designed and integrated into MDAs respective MTEFs.

23.     Overall the implementation of the demand driven approach proceeded
smoothly. MDAs management was enthusiastic about this and are currently
implementing their self articulated reforms. Going forward, PSRP II interventionswill
take a broader outlook involving a wider range of public institutions and reviewing
and enhancing ongoing interventionsin the Ministries.

24.     To further sustain reform initiativesin a more coordinated approach, a Reform
Coordination Unit (RCU) has been established under the President's Office State
House, and is charged with oversight functions. This will enable the Chief Secretary
to monitor the aggregate performance and oversee coordination of the core reform
programmes.

25.     The Government continues to implement the Medium Term Pay Policy
(MTPP) and plans are underway to update the Policy. A study was to be
commissioned and was expected to be completed by October 2008. However,
delays were experienced in the procurement of the consultancy until February 2009.
The MTPP update is expected to address the following: allocation and retention of
professional and managerial cadres; maintaining salary levels consistent with fiscal
stability; rationalisationof llowancesto augment pay of public servants which distorts
incentives to service delivery; and recognition of incentive packages to improve
staffing level in underserved areas. The revised MTPP is expected to be approved in
July 2009, thus substantially meetingthe following prior action.

   PRSC-7 Prior Action
   Concrete steps taken to prepare a revised Medium-Term Pay Policy by
   Governmentas the basis for reform of pay and allowances

            H. STRENGTHENING           OF      FINANCIAL      MANAGEMENT          AND
               ACCOUNTABILITY

26.     Progress has been made in strengthening public financial management
systems in order to improve management of public resources and enhance
accountability at all levels. This involved the establishment of oversight units for
procurement and audit in all MDAs; strengthening of the three Parliamentary public
accounts committees; creating a Public Procurement Policy Unit at the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs; and introducing audit committees in MDAs and LGAs.
A separate independent internal audit department covering the entire Government,
which reports directly to the Paymaster General, is in the process of being
established in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs with the aim of
enhancing independence and accountability.

                                            61

27.    The roadmap for reaching InternalAudit Standards will be prepared following
the completion of review of the Public Finance Act; developing the scheme of
service; merging the Internal Audit related activities like Technical Audit Unit and
inspection of Stocks into one multidisciplinary InternalAudit function; and appointing
the head of the new InternalAudit Department. As for the preparationof Regulations
under the Procurement and Professional Board Act, the Regulationswere prepared
and are expectedto be gazzeted by June 2009. Hence, the following prior action has
been substantiallyachieved.

    PRSC-7 Prior Action
    Approval granted to create a new Department of Internal Audit in the Ministry of
    Finance, and Regulations under the Procurement and Supplies Professional
    Board Act prepared.
28.    The implementationof NACSAP II is progressingwell with an increased level
of involvement of different stakeholders namely DPs, the private sector, civil society,
the media, LGAs and politicians. Public awareness building among citizens and
dissemination of anti-corruption information by the PCCB through TV and radio
programmes as well as through newspapers has improved significantly. A lively and
constructive debate on governance, accountability, transparency, integrity and on
best strategies to combat corruption has widened the scope of participation in the
war against both, grand and petty corruption. The progress has been made on
investigations and prosecutions on corruption with a number of cases brought to
court. Further, the amendments on Public Procurement Act will empower PPRA to
intervene and if necessary, cancel or stop procurement proceedings which breach
major procurementregulations.

           1. SECTOR REVIEWS

Health
29.    The health sector review was conducted in September-October 2008 and
rated as satisfactory. The Health Sector Performance Report for 2007108 was
produced and disseminated to stakeholders. Good progress was observed in the
areas of child survival, tuberculosis, malaria as well as major policy developments
and service delivery in general. However challenges have been identifiedsuch as the
understaffing especially in the most underserved areas; inadequate infrastructure;
and weak routine annual information on performance. A way forward to addressing
such challenges has been established,including the implementationof MMAM 2007-
2017; Definition of Health Financing Strategy and Monitoring and Evaluation
Strategy; agree on a set of key Health Sector indicators and targets that are relevant
to daily implementation and to the various levels of the health system and progress
on these indicatorswill be reflected in the Annual Health Sector Performance Profile
report; Strengthening of HMlS so that timely and accurate data is available;
production of an annual sector performance report to review annual progress and
identify challenges; and introduction of incentives for HRH to work in underserved
areas. In view of the above, the prior action below has been achieved.

       PRSC-7 Prior Action:



                                           62

    Updating the 2006/07 Health Sector Performance Report by January 31, 2008
   and Health Sector Performance Report for 2007/08 produced and disseminated.

Education
30.     The Education Sector Performance report was developed and agreed upon
based on the agreed Monitoring Tool. The template for preparing the education
sector performance report was jointly prepared and agreed upon by educationsector
representativesand stakeholders. The template was distributed as per the roadmap
schedule, and filled in to come up with the education sector performance report,
which included the sector monitoring tool indicators. The performance report for
2007/08 is more analytical and informative comparedwith that in 2006/07.

31.     A number of findings are detailed in the annual performance report. However
a summary of key achievements in the sub sectors is outlined here, while the
Government' effort is underway to address the challenges identified in the review
process.

32.     Basic education sub-sector comprises pre-primary, primary, secondary and
teacher education, and key achievements in 2007/08 included increased Pre-primary
enrolment, increased OVC enrolment, decreased pupil classroom ratio at primary
level as well as an increase in the number of qualified primary school teachers. At
secondary level, the NER increased in both lower and upper secondary, as well as
increased completion rates for forms 1-4, and a decrease in secondary drop out
rates.

33.     Key achievements in Higher education included an increase in GER with an
increase of female enrolments over last year, a draft rehabilitation plan for public
universities is under review for finalization in 2008/9, and Loan Management
Software system has been put in place to enhance performance of HELSB in
processing loans. The Tanzania Commission for Universities (TCU) has been active
with six more universities and university colleges being registered in 2007/08, for a
total of 32 universities and university colleges.

34.     Key achievements in technical and vocational education sub-sector include
the finalisation of technical education and training policy draft document;Auditing the
qualifications of teaching staff for technical institutions was conducted and 328
teachers were awarded with full registration status while with 150 teachers were
awarded provisional registration. A database on information of qualified teaching
staff has been established at NACTE.

        PRSC-7 Prior Action:
   Education Sector Performance Report for 2007/08 prepared on the basis of an
   agreed sector monitoring tool.

Water
35.     Among the outcomes of water sector review was the agreed priorities that
facilitated effectively planning for 2009/2010 budget. The Government continues to
ensure good performance through supporting capacity building, monitoring and

                                            63

quality assurance, policy formulation and provision of guidelines and regulation
through various legal instruments. The institutional framework for water resources
management has been streamlined to meet the challenges of effective integrated
water resources management at basin level. The Government recognises its central
role in ensuring availability of clean and safe water to the community. However, the
success of this role resides in the recognition of the role played by other
stakeholders in the process. To this end, the Government will put effort to address
practical impediments identifiedduring the review such as: the need for consolidation
of the sector performance monitoring including data accuracy and consistency; the
need for a speedy enactment process of water legislations; the issue of
geographical, social, gender and financial equity; sustainability of water schemes
versus community affordability; disaggregated gender data in decision making
organs at all levels; and the need for clustering of various utilities to benefit from
economies of scale. In this regard,the following prior action was achieved.

PRSC-7 PriorAction: Satisfactory water secfor review carried out.

           J. THE PRSC 8 TRIGGERS

36.    The PRSC 8 triggers will emphasise on issues related to broad based income
generation and privatesector environment. The following is the list of the triggers:

   i.  Strengthening TANESCO's revenue collection by October 2009 to meet full
       operationalcost recovery in 2010.

 x.   Approved budget broadly in line with policy objectives (MKUKUTA, sector
       policies).
xi.    Expenditure outturn consistent with approved budget and recurrent budget
      deviation reduced.


CONCLUSION

37.   The Government will continue to maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policy
necessary to sustaining the macroeconomicstability. Caution will be taken in dealing
with possible impacts of the global financial crisis and economic slowdown. In
additional, the achievements realised so far in various reform initiatives will be
sustained in the medium term, while addressing the challenges encountered in the
process. In this regard, the focus will be placed on developing infrastructure in key
sectors to promote economic growth, and improve quality of life and social wellbeing
while upholding good governance and accountability in all Government units. In light
of this, the Government requests the International Development Association to
approve the provision of US$190 million to compliment Government's efforts in
MKUKUTA and reforms thereby fostering and sustainig macroeconomicstability.

                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




                                     73

The Annual Review o f General Budget Support (GBS) for 2008 was held from 24th - 27th
November 2008 at the Blue Pearl Hotel, Ubungo Plaza; concluding the dialogue organized around
Cluster Working Group meetings that was launched inApril 2008.

The GBS Annual Review assesses the Government and Development Partners"             performance
against the jointly agreed Partnership Framework Memorandum (PFM) signed in 2006, in
particular the Government" s commitment to promote higheconomic growth and reduce poverty
through implementation o f MKUKUTA, and the Development Partners"         commitment to provide
financial assistance to that end. The assessment also includes the jointly agreed Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF Matrix), which draws indicators from the MKUKUTA and other
national processes.

The Annual Review facilitated completion o f the 2008 PAF Matrix assessmentswhich led to the
 selection o f Key Issues that were discussed at the Review meeting.

An assessment o f the implementation o f the PAF for 2008 showed, that 19 out o f 24 sector and
thematic reviews were assessed as satisfactory and that 17 out o f 31 Temporary Process Actions
 (TPAs) had been achieved. In addition, 15 out of the 26 annual targets for outcome indicators
assessed in 2008 were assessed to be on track. The assessment o f the PAF matrix concluded that
Tanzania has made good progress in achieving its education and health targets, although there i s
room for improvement in the quality o f education and health services. The Review also noted
positive recent progress in tackling cases o f grand corruption. However, progress on agriculture,
energy, infrastructure, the investment climate, and the core reforms (PFMRP, LGRP and LSRP)
has not been sufficient, and the Household Budget Survey 2007 gave clear indications that there
has not been a significant reduction in income poverty over the past six years. The business
climate - for the agriculture sector and for businesses more generally -was singled out as an area
where more urgent and determined reform was needed. Lack o f progress on public financial
management reform was also a very significant concern for Development Partners and
Government launched the next phase o f its PFMReform Programme duringthe Annual Review.

Challenges identified during the assessment o f the implementation o f the 2008 PAF, led to the
identification o f the following four key issues: The Budget Strategy in a changing
Macroeconomic Framework; Enabling Investment Climate with a special focus on Agriculture;
Equity and Efficiency in Service Delivery, and Challenges in Combating Corruption.
Constructive discussions were held on each o fthese key issues.

Through the discussion o f these key issues, the GBS Review has been concluded by a joint
agreement on the PAF for 2009, which aims to address key challenges to further strengthen
growth and poverty reduction. In addition, the discussion on the key issues led to the following
jointly agreed messageswhich will also serve as inputto the FY08/09MKUKUTA dialogue:




                                                  74

and poverty reduction. Reforms that have been implemented, have not been sufficient to make a
big impact onpoverty reduction especially income poverty".

Budgetstrategyin a changing macro-economic framework
1. Strengthen dialogue in the PER process. Concrete action plan to be approved by PER Main by
January 2009.

                                                  75

Equity and efficiencyinservice delivery
1. Agreed that there i s a significant need for local level incentive packages to ensure that new
staff are attracted and retained. This could be funded via additional transfers to underserved
districts.
2. The government has identifiedthe review o f the Medium Term Pay Policy as an entry point to
addressing inequity inthe distribution o f human resources in Tanzania.
3. MoFEA and Po-PSM has agreed to work together to eliminate delays in the payment o f new

Challenges in combating corruption
1. Increased transparency and the right to information are crucial. GOTshall look into ways for
further developing transparency through legislation, including Public Leadership Code o f Ethics
Act, Political Parties Financing Act and Rightto Information Act.
2. Corruption is a worldwide phenomenon requiringjoint action. While Government has the main
responsibility, Development Partners should be supportive and also provide timely mutual legal
assistance when requested.
3. GOTcontinues to process and formally join EITI but need to customize to reflect Tanzania
conditions.
4. Need to further strengthenthe capacity o f key anti-corruption institutions.
5. An M & E framework for anti-corruption activities i s developed by GOTin collaboration with
key stakeholders. A dialogue framework for strengthened dialogue between Government and
Development Partners on anti-corruption to be developed.

Based on the review o f the implementation o f the PAF for 2008, and on the agreements on the
way forward, the joint assessment i s that overall the 2008 GBS Annual Review was moderately
satisfactory. Government and Budget Support Partners recognize that a rapid acceleration in 7
implementation o f the MKUKUTA and the PAF i s needed if Tanzania i s to achieve its objectives
inthe three clusters o fthe MKUKUTA:growth, social well-beingand governance.

Press Release No. 09/145
April 26, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the International Monetaiy Fund (IMF). issued
the following statement on Tanzania today:
"In the context ofthe ongoing dialogue underthe Policy Support Instrument, an IMF staff mission and
the Tanzanian authorities have reached broad agreement on policies that will help Tanzania address
the impact of the global financial crisis. These policies aim at bolstering the Tanzanian economy,
which has been affected by declining receipts from traditional exports and tourism, and protecting the
most vulnerable segmentsofthe population.
"In support of these policies. and to help mitigate the exogenous shock stemming from the global
economic downturn. Tanzania has requestedfinancial support under the high-accesscomponentof the
Exogenous Shocks Facility. It is expectedthat the request will be considered by the IMF's Executive
Board beforethe end of May," Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.



IMFExecutiveBoard Completes the FourthReviewUnder thePolicySupportInstrument (PSI)
for Tanzania
Press Release No. 08/337
December22,2008
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the fourth review
under the three-year Policy Support Instrument(PSI) for Tanmnia.
The PSI was approved on February 16, 2007 (see Press Release no. 07/26)and is aimed at sustaining
broad-basedhigh growth and acceleratingprogress in poverty reduction. To that end. the PSI supports
enhancingpublic resourcemobilization and efficiency of spending; bolstering financial sector reforms
and the effectiveness of monetary policy; and improving the business climate to stimulate private
sector-led growtli.
On completing the review. the Executive Board also approved waivers for the nonobservanceof two
assessment criteria: the end-June ceiling on aweragereserve money, and the signing of a memorandum
of understanding between the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA) and the Bank of
Tanzania (BOT) delineating responsibilities in the areas of liquidity management and financial
operations, which was implementedwith a delay.
Following the Board's discussion on Tanzania, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:
"The Tanzanian authorities continue to implement sound macroeconomic policies. Strong
fiiiidaiiientals-iiicluding low public debt and ample international reserves-will help Tanzania cope
with the current global economic downturii and volatile commodity prices. Nevertheless, downside
risks remain, and the authorities must remain vigilant. developing contingency plans.
"The fiscal stance for 3008/09 provides an appropriate modest stimulus, d i i l e retaining the target of
zero net domestic financing. which is supportive of monetary policy. The revenue target is ambitious,
and the authorities will need to exerciseexpenditure restraint in the event ofa revenueshortfall.
"While the recent drop in global commodity prices will help bring inflation down, monetary contcol
needs to be strengthened to return inflation to the authorities' medium-term objective. In this regard,
the recent agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Bank of
Tanzania on their respective roles and responsibilities will help improve liquidity forecasting and
management.
"The bankingsector has fared well, but prudential regulation and supervision need to be strengthened,
especially in the context of plans to gradually liberalize the capital account of the balance of
payments.Strengtheningoversight over the rapidly-growing pension fimds is particularly important.



                                                   77

"Recent improvements in goveriiance and public accountability are welcome, including the decisive
actions taken to investigate and prosecute wrong-doers in the external payments arrears fraud case.
The Dank of Tanzania should continue to iniprove its interiial control mechanisms, drawing on the
recomiiiendatioiis of the 1MF's safeguards assessment report. The Rank o f Tanzania's plans to re-focus
its attention on its core tasks o f monetary policy and financial supervision are important.
"Maintaining high economic growth is critical to accelerate poverty reduction in Tanzania and make
decisive progress toward the Millennium Developnient Goals. Higher infrastructure investment is
needed to support growth, but care should be taken to achieve value for money and avoid a re-
acciumulation of unsustainable public debt." Mr.Portugal said.
