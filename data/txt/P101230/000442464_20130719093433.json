Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC) Project for Tanzania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was significant, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and monitoring and evaluation was negligible.\n            Some lessons learned included: direct and sustained focus\n            and clarity of vision over the entire course of\n            implementation of PRSC programs that cover many years is\n            required to facilitate lasting reforms particularly with\n            regard to public sector governance. PRSCs can make little\n            progress without a foundation of trust between the Bank and\n            the government, and among development partners at the\n            institutional and individual levels. The mechanisms for\n            dialogue also need to evolve so that the program can\n            continue to support and influence policy decisions at the\n            highest strategic level. To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank\n            and government can plan in advance to recalibrate the\n            program at a set point during implementation. The lack of\n            well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed\n            results framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances\n            difficult. Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is\n            essential so that data can drive adjustments to the PRSC\n            program. Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary\n            instrument for resource transfer is only likely to be\n            successful in rare circumstances, when strong central\n            ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue\n            representing the perspectives of key players throughout\n            government. Elevating to the national dialogue\n            sector-specific structural reforms that stalled at the\n            sector level does not guarantee implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
