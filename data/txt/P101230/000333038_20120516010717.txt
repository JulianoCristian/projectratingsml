F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
This PRSC series supports the implementation of the Country Assistance Strategy and
contributes to the achievement of Tanzania’s Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(MKUKUTA) objectives in several ways: by funding MKUKUTA implementation; by
fostering policy reform and institutional changes in the outcome areas; and by supporting
the development of government systems for the implementation and monitoring of
MKUKUTA. The PRSC focuses on the following development objectives: (i) reduce
income poverty, (ii) improve key human development objectives, and (iii) improve the
capacity of the Government to design and implement development policies in a
transparent and efficient manner.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Summary of Economic and Structural Sector Background

Starting in the late 1980s, but implemented with vigor mainly since the mid-l990s.
Tanzania carried out a broad structural and social reform agenda. After the initial
macroeconomic stabilization and the removal of key distortions in the economy, reforms
focused on improving economic governance, providing an enabling environment for
private sector activities, and enhancing public service delivery. As a consequence of its
strong performance, Tanzania gained access to irreversible debt relief by reaching the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2001 and additional
debt relief from bilateral donors in 2007. In present value (PV) terms, the public sector
debt stood at about 12 percent of GDP at end-June 2009, or 53.5 percent of exports, both
eminently sustainable. As a result of these reforms and policy measures, Tanzania’s GDP
growth accelerated over time, reaching an average of almost 4 percent per annum in the
second half of the 1990s, and has been consistently in the 6-7 % range since then (Table
1).

Thus, the appraisal of PRSC 4 in early 2006, the first in a planned program of five
PRSCs, took place in an environment of strong economic growth that had some

                                                              1
momentum behind it. Inflation, though still too variable, was in the single digit range.
Foreign exchange reserves were comfortable, although current account balance was
growing due to an import growth rate that far exceeded the rate of growth of exports.
Domestic revenue to GDP ratio was improving, although from a low level, and overall
budget deficit (after grants) was in a range that did not require domestic borrowing at a
level that would crowd out the private sector. Credit to the private sector was rising
rapidly, both in absolute terms as well as relative to GDP.

While data on income-poverty incidence at the time of appraisal of the first operation of
the series (PRSC-4) were somewhat old (the latest available year was 2001 - see Table 2
below), the trends observed from 1991-2001 were not particularly encouraging. The
increasingly strong GDP growth performance during the 1990s, had not led to a major
reduction in income poverty, except in Dar-es-Salaam. In other urban areas, and
particularly in the countryside where the vast majority of the poor lived, the declines
were within the margin of sampling error (i.e. not statistically significant). Little poverty
reduction in the countryside should have been an early sign that more attention had to be
paid to the rural sector. Still, there was hope that strong growth in the almost five years
that had elapsed between the last set of data on poverty and the appraisal of PRSC 4,
would have lifted many additional people out of poverty.

In the event, the Household Budget Survey (HBS) of 2007, showed a poverty picture that
was disappointing (but see caveats below). The disconnect between growth and poverty
reduction during 2001-07 was even stronger than in the preceding period. This was
attributed to four main factors. First, GDP growth was driven by sectors that were
predominantly urban or were in other ways weakly linked to the rural sector
(construction, telecommunications, financial intermediation, and mining). Second, almost
three quarters of the higher growth in the 1990s and well into the 2000s was driven by
higher foreign aid inflows feeding into the government budget. As a result, public
consumption strongly outpaced private consumption, and it is the latter that forms the
basis for measuring income poverty (WB CEM 2007). Third, the rate of growth of
agriculture did not far outpace the rate of growth of population. Fourth, the rate of growth
of agriculture may have been overestimated. If the overestimate is significant, it would
contribute to stagnation in poverty reduction in the countryside (as well as pull down the
overall rate of growth of GDP). In addition, some of the consumption increase occurred
in consumer durables over the year which are not included in the consumption basket of
the Household Budget Survey (HBS).



                                                                 2
Recent re-examinations of the 2007 HBS data, embellished by data from other surveys,
show that in dimensions other than just the reduction of income poverty, Tanzania fared
better over the same period (2001-2007). Public spending was clearly pro-poor, with
affordable services benefitting the lower quintiles of the income distribution. Urban
areas realized important gains in access to non-farm employment, and earnings increased
substantially. Real gains in wealth were made by all quintiles as measured by increased
possession of consumer durables and better housing. The picture in the countryside
remained less encouraging, although there were areas that had benefitted by higher prices
of their produce or better roads. Further work is being done on improving the
methodology and processes of the HBS.

The situation in other aspects of people’s well-being was more encouraging at the time of
appraisal. Between years 2000 and 2005, net primary school enrollment increased from
57 to 95 percent. Life expectancy increased from 49 years in 1988 to 55 years in 2002.
Infant mortality dropped from 115 per 1000 in 1988 to 68 per 1000 in 2004.1 The fraction
of chronically undernourished or stunted children declined from 44 percent in 1999 to 38
percent in 2004.2 Other indicators recorded less progress. Maternal mortality which was
529 per 100,000 births in 1996 had not changed, nor had fertility which averaged 5.7
children per woman.3 The proportion of the population with access to piped or protected
water as their main source of drinking water remains very low, especially in rural areas
where, depending on the source, between 46 (census) and 52 (HBS 2007) percent had
access.

In terms of governance, the first series of PRSCs (PRSC 1-3) supported the development
of annual plans and performance budgets and service delivery surveys. Based on these,
the government published the first ―State of the Public Service‖ report. The report
showed that citizens were increasingly satisfied with a number of key public services
(like primary education). However, it also indicated that levels of dissatisfaction were
still alarmingly high. Around 25 percent of all clients were dissatisfied with central
government services and 50-75 percent with local government services. Service delivery
was still perceived as being riddled with bureaucracy and needed to improve in terms of
timeliness. There were issues with resource leakages and public financial management.
Efforts to reduce corruption were perceived as moving slowly.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

The Bank’s PRSC support to Tanzania is provided within a harmonized framework for
general budget support (GBS) with 13 other development partners (DPs), comprising a
Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership Framework Memorandum
(PFM) for GBS for the implementation of MKUKUTA, and a joint review process which
culminates in a joint Annual Review (AR) in October/November. The framework is

  Later, the number for infant mortality has declined further to 51 per 1000 in 2009 based on 2009/10
Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (TDHS) 2009/10.
2
  Based on TDHS 2009/10, it further dropped to 454.
3
  The more recent number from 2009/10 TDHS is 454 per 100,000 live births in 2009.

                                                     3
designed to support domestic accountability, reduce transaction costs in the process, and
encourage the further development and use of Tanzania’s own systems.

The CAS approved by the Board on June 15, 2000, which covered PRSC-4, foresaw
quick-disbursing policy-based lending operations in support o f overall and sector
reforms, and a shift to budget support contingent on sufficient progress in the areas of
public expenditure management and governance. Based on these provisions in the CAS,
the Bank launched its first PRSC series in 2003. The World Bank strategy foresaw a
gradual increase in the amount of World Bank resources provided in the form of PRSC
support from the initial amount of US$ 132 million for PRSC-1 in FY04 to US$ 200
million for PRSC-4 in FY07. IDA debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative as well
as under the MDRI facility were projected to amount initially to about US$ 100 million,
but increased subsequently reflecting Tanzania’s debt profile.

The CAS, which was approved by the Board jointly with PRSC-5 and has been covering
up to PRSC-8, consists of the government’s Joint Assistance Strategy (JAST), the multi-
donor Joint Programming Document (JPD), and a World Bank Group-specific
supplement, with details on the WBG strategy, progress under the previous CAS, FY06-
FY 10 programs and projects, IDA financing, and a WBG-specific results matrix. The
results WBG results matrix is fully aligned and supportive of MKUKUTA objectives.
The JAST clearly identifies GBS as the preferred aid modality, as it allows for full
integration of donor support into government systems and alignment with MKUKUTA
implementation. The JPD also recognizes the benefits of GBS in terms of strengthening
ownership and domestic systems for the management and implementation o f the
MKUKUTA. The CAS thus envisaged an increase in budget support from about US$190
million in 2006/07 to as much as US$400 million in 2009/10.



1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

MKUKUTA Clusters and Program Development Objectives

The program was designed to support the Government’s reform program named
MKUKUTA (and a similar program specifically for Zanzibar called MKUZA) over the
period 2005-2010. Its proposed policy actions target cross-cutting issues that would be
difficult to address solely within the context of investment lending. The financial part of
the program is in the form of budget support through a series of five PRSCs (PRSC 4-8)
and is done jointly with 13 donors (AfDB, Canada, Denmark, European Commission,
Finland, Ireland, Japan, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK).
The budget support is carried out in coordination with a number of complementary
investment projects, most of which also contain elements of Technical Assistance and
Capacity Building. Various analytical studies are designed to provide the basis (evidence)
for the proposed policy actions.

The General Budget Support (GBS) framework (also called Poverty Reduction Budget
Support or PRBS), set up at the beginning of the PRSC program, includes a Partnership
                                            4
Framework Memorandum (PFM), a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and an
agreed Joint Review Process. The PFM operationalizes a series of international
commitments that aim to provide more scope for government ownership, better alignment
and integration of donor support with government priorities and systems, and greater
predictability of donor support.

The PAF, a framework agreed between the Government and the DPs, is basically a
matrix of commitments consisting of three categories that are monitored in the Cluster
Working Groups throughout the year: (i) Underlying Process; (ii) Temporary Process
Actions; and (iii) Outcome Indicators. The initial PAF covered six focus areas --- the
three clusters of MKUKUTA (―Growth for Reduction of Income Poverty‖ cluster,
―Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Well-being‖ cluster, and ―Governance and
Accountability‖ cluster) , plus macroeconomic stability, resource allocation and budget
consistency, and public financial management. As the PRSC series proceeded, the last
three focus areas became folded into one, called the ―quality of the budget cluster‖. This
fourth cluster has been set up as a part of the dialogue structure between the Government
and the DPs in implementing GBS. The PAF outcome indicators are generally a subset
of a much wider set of indicators used by MKUKUTA. In turn, the PRSC series, while
using many of the PAF indicators, added a few of its own for its Results Matrix in order
to sharpen the focus on Program Development Outcomes (PDOs) agreed under the PRSC
program.

The Joint Review Process consists of one joint GBS Annual Review, typically held in
October. It is aligned with Tanzania’s budget process. The whole chain starts with Sector
and Thematic Reviews from March through September of each year, followed by
MKUKUTA and GBS Annual Reviews in October, Budget Guidelines preparation
during November through January, and ending with Budget and MTEF preparations
between February and June. The GBS dialogue is led by a rotating troika of DPs, with the
Bank as a permanent member (together referred to as Troika plus).

The set of PDOs under the PRSC series mirrors the Clusters of policies in the
Government’s MKUKUTA program with the additional cluster on public financial
management and quality of budget. Cluster 1 contains policy measures that would lead
to high growth and (income) poverty reduction. Cluster 2 groups policies targeted at
improving the quality of life and social well-being. The focus of Cluster 3, are policies
that would lead to an improvement of governance and accountability.

      PDO 1: Reduce income poverty (MKUKUTA Cluster 1: ―Growth for Reduction
       of Income Poverty‖)
      PDO2: Improve key human development objectives (MKUKUTA Cluster 2:
       ―Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Well-being)
      PDO 3: Improve the capacity of the Government to design and implement
       development policies in a transparent and efficient manner (MKUKUTA
       Cluster 3: ―Governance and Accountability‖)

                                            5
Broad progress towards PDOs was to be measured with the following PDO Indicators:

It should be noted that ―Targets‖ always refer to targets under the PRSC program. The
targets in MKUKUTA were at times (substantially) different, usually in the direction of
greater optimism. The PDOs as well as PDO Indicators are taken from the PRSC 4-8
Results Framework (Annex 4).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There was no revision to PDO or key indicators within each operation of the series. For
the series as a whole, the three PDOs, which directly correspond to MKUKUTA clusters,
were not revised.


                                          8
However, the structure of the Results Framework (RF) linked to the PAF was firmed up
as part of PRSC-6. More specifically, the new structure introduced the two-level
structure, consisting of PDOs and PDO indicators at a high level, which were then
supported by the program outcomes and intermediate/subsidiary indicators at a lower
level. Prior to this RF structure, PDOs were measured by a set of indicators that measure
only progress in specific areas which do not have as much comprehensiveness as PDOs
have. The introduction of this new RF structure was to allow PDO indicators to measure
progress toward such comprehensive development objectives, and at the same time to
specify program outcomes that contribute to achievements of PDOs. As a result, the high-
order PDO indicators were introduced while original indicators were converted into
intermediate/subsidiary indicators including new indicators introduced with the occasion
of the new RF so as to better aligned to PAF. The new indicators introduced were taken
from the Government’s MKUKUTA outcome indicators as well as indicators to measure
the Government’s anti-corruption effort related to governance reflecting the set of grand
corruption cases from FY2005/06. The revised RF presented in Annex 4 (a)-(c) has been
in use since PRSC-6 (see more discussion 2.3 in the monitoring and evaluation section).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

As is now fairly customary, the policy actions supported under this PRSC series were
overwhelmingly ―Prior Actions‖ in the sense that they were carried out prior to the Board
date. However, they were always a part of the Government’s broader reform program, the
MKUKUTA (MKUZA for Zanzibar), so there was some coherence to them both in terms
of covering important areas within any year,         as well as in how they built up a
momentum towards the achievement of the PDOs over time. Prior Actions were typically
signaled in the preceding operation (and were at that stage often labeled as ―triggers‖).
Most of them were implemented as expected, but each year a few of the triggers were
replaced with other actions when the time came, depending on the changes ―on the
ground‖ (relevance, political considerations, delays, etc.). The list of Prior Actions
actually taken under the program series as well as actions that were dropped or amended,
along with reasons for the changes, is presented in Annex 2.

Table 3 summarizes the key policy achievements over the full cycle of the series. These
represent only a fraction of the over 50 Prior Actions taken across the entire MKUKUTA
reform program (for the full set see Annex 2). Early on in the program series there was
emphasis on: (i) reducing impediments to small businesses and farmers (new Bills on
Business Activities, operationalization of the Land Act and the Village Land Act, and
rationalization of the roles, functions, financing and accountability of the Crop Boards);
(ii) fixing a number of budget issues (timeliness, alignment of budget with policies,
deviations between budgeted amounts and outcomes, and auditing of the books); (iii)
integrating donor funding and tracking into the government cycles and processes; (iv)
annual sectoral reviews of health, education and water; and (v) a variety of issues in
governance and accountability. Later, emphasis was added on policies to remove
infrastructure constraints.

Table 3 also shows the numbers of triggers fully met, partially met or not met. There is a
clear trend from PRSC-4, when all triggers were met, to PRSC-8, when only 7 of the 11
triggers were fully met. As a result, the amounts allocated under the PRSCs also declined
over time (CAS projection was 190 million, 250 million, 300 million, and 400 million for
PRSC-5 to -8 respectively, with total US$ 1.14 billion, which is larger than the actual
total amount of US$ 825 million for PRSC5-8). Although, the ―shortfalls‖ from the
initially programmed totals to be disbursed under the PRSC 4-8 series were pretty much
made up through PRSC-7 supplemental financing, which supported the Government’s
stimulus package during FY2009/10 to mitigate negative impacts from the global
financial crisis. The impact was not as severe as initially anticipated because of the
Government’s effective interventions both in fiscal and monetary policies.

Note: This table does not include $170 million supplemental financing to PRSC-7 in November of 2009, in
order to help mitigate the effects of the global crisis. The supplemental financing had the exactly same
program as PRSC-7.

In terms of individual PRSC operations, PRSC-4 successfully met all triggers. Prior
Actions under the growth and poverty reduction cluster of PRSC 4 focused promisingly
on rationalizing the functions, financing and accountability of the Crop Boards,
operationalizing the Land and Village Land Acts in order to enable titling of land, and
speeding up the business registration process. Under Cluster 2, there was a satisfactory
health sector review. Under Cluster 3, the National Audit Office was trained, and
procurement and installation of computer equipment completed. The organization of the
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was approved and appropriate
budgetary resources allocated. In order to improve the performance of public sector
employees, which was very important for successful implementation of the reform
program, there were pay increases consistent with the budget approved for that year and
with the overall thrust of the pay reform. A process was also agreed for reforming the
incentive-distorting effects of the public sector allowances regime. Finally, in Cluster 4

                                                         11
(improving the quality of the budget), the budget approved was deemed as supportive of
MKUKUTA’s goals and the expenditure outturn for FY04/05 (the year previous to
PRSC-4) had been consistent with the approved budget.

Under PRSC 5, the trigger of Crop Boards was not completed. Instead the government
decided to conduct consultations for all four crop Boards and sign an MOU, and amend
the crop board legislation later for all four boards simultaneously. Perhaps this was an
early indication that reforms in agriculture were not proceeding at a pace consistent with
the GoT’s stated goals for agricultural growth (MKUKUTA target was 10% annual
growth in agriculture). There was progress in the reform of the Business Activities
Registration and in the Business Regulatory Licensing Regime. On roads, the Roads Bill
was not submitted to Parliament as earlier agreed. Since rapid improvement in
infrastructure was considered very important, and in order to maintain the credibility of
the PRSC instrument, the Bank reduced the amount to be disbursed under this PRSC by
$10 million. Under Cluster 2, there were satisfactory reviews of the health, education and
water sectors. Under Cluster 3, the NAO General Report for FY04/05 was issued, as
agreed, by April 2006. The approved budget for FY06/07 was in line with the policy
objectives of MKUKUTA, and expenditure outturns for FY05/06 were consistent with
the approved budget.

There was progress across the Board in reform actions under Cluster 1 of PRSC 6. Draft
amendments to crop board legislation were submitted for stakeholder consultations and
strategic plans for all crop boards were finalized. There was progress in the
implementation of the TANESCO financial recovery plan and in the regulation of the
power sector. The Road Bill was submitted to Parliament. A prioritized Transport Sector
Investment Plan was finalized, with adequate provision for maintenance and a framework
for Public Private Partnerships (PPP). Sector reviews of health, education and water
under Cluster 2 were found to be fairly satisfactory which resulted in a ―partially
completed‖ rating of the three triggers in this area. However, the amount of the credit was
not reduced. Under Cluster 3, the Anti-Corruption an Audit bills were submitted to
Parliament. The approved budget for FY07/08 was in line with the policy objectives of
MKUKUTA, and expenditure outturns for FY06/07 were consistent with the approved
budget.

It is perhaps worth mentioning that because of concerns raised in fiduciary governance at
the Bank of Tanzania (BOT), and other allegations of corruption, specific conditions
were set by IDA prior to negotiations of the PRSC 6 Credit. In fulfillment of these
conditions, the Recipient provided the following: (a) the Government shared with the
IDA a time bound action plan describing current investigations and audit related to
potential cases of fraud involving the BOT; (b) IDA received from the BOT copies of the
audited accounts of the BOT for the FY 06/07, and IDA was made privy to the
management letter accompanying the audit; and (c) a Voluntary Country Safeguards
Assessment of the BOT was been completed, and BOT was to incorporate key
recommendations of the Voluntary Safeguard Assessment in its action plan. IDA and the
Government agreed to continue to monitor progress in the control environment in the
BOT with the PRSC and General Budget Support dialogue.


                                            12
Progress under PRSC 7 was mixed. In Cluster 1 the Business Activities Registration Act
(BARA) trigger, which was to make regulations consistent with one-stop shop good
practice was not completed and the trigger was dropped. This was a setback to GoT’s
declared high level policy intentions to improve the relatively weak investment climate.
Instead, moving away from the one-stop shop concept was, in the opinion of Bank and
other DP experts in this area, likely to result in a system that was burdensome, prone to
manipulation and corruption, complex to manage, and potentially punitive, especially for
the smaller firms (which generate over 90 percent of all jobs). It would also represent one
more demand on the government’s management capacities that were already under strain.
The failure to meet this trigger, and to identify suitable remedial measures, led the Bank
to reduce the credit by US$10 million.

There was progress on other triggers in Cluster 1. TANESCO’s financial recovery plan
moved forward. A national PPP policy, including the infrastructure sector was prepared,
discussed with stakeholders and was on the way to obtaining Cabinet approval.

In Cluster 2, in the education sector, a performance report for 2007/08 was prepared on
the basis of an agreed sector monitoring tool. Health sector performance report for
2006/07 was updated and the one for 2007/08 produced and disseminated. Finally, a
satisfactory water sector review was carried out.

In Cluster 3, a revised Medium-Term Pay Policy was not adopted as expected. Instead the
Prior Action was watered down to ―concrete steps to be taken to prepare a revised
Medium-Term Pay policy by the government as the basis for reform of pay and
allowances‖. The trigger, in the area of managing licenses and/or concession allocations
in the natural resources area, was substantially completed. New procurement regulations
were prepared but not yet gazetted. Approval was granted to create a new Department of
Internal Audit.

In cluster 4, the expenditure outturn report for FY07/08 consistent with the approved
budget and recurrent budget deviations was not completed which reflected a broader
worsening of overall budget execution. Further actions in this area would in the future be
addressed through the PER dialogue. On the other hand, the budget for FY08/09 was
deemed to be in line with the policy objectives of MKUKUTA and was approved.

PRSC 8 was designed in an environment of flagging commitment to reforms by the GoT.
The loss of momentum had been evident for some time, but was probably accelerated by
the elections scheduled for the Fall of 2010. It was therefore no surprise that actions on
the reform front were even weaker than for PRSC 7 and that the amount of the credit was
reduced to US$115 million

Under Cluster 1, the FIAS study that was to pay particular action to regulations and local
taxes affecting agriculture was not completed and the trigger was dropped from those that
were converted to prior actions. An action plan to improve accountability and
transparency in allocating natural resource licenses and concessions was approved and
implementation initiated. There was some progress on completing the land registry. An
Energy Tariff application was successfully submitted by TANESCO to the regulator to

                                            13
finally allow for revenue collection to meet full operational costs in 2011 and full cost
recovery by 2013. The government managed to reduce port congestion through three key
measures (i) Tanzania Ports Authority prepared a preliminary version of a time-bound
action plan for moving to Landlord Status; (ii) SUMATRA approved an increase in port
storage tariffs and a reduction in free time; and (iii) the GoT established its own area for
impounded containers. Finally, the PPP bill was approved by Parliament.

In Cluster 2, satisfactory education, health and water sector reviews were carried out,
based on an assessment of progress against agreed outcome targets, adequacy of resource
allocation, achievement of sector milestones, and adequacy of stakeholder consultations.

In Cluster 3, the trigger covering further progress on Medium-Term Pay reform for public
sector workers was not completed. The new Public Procurement Act that increases the
autonomy of PPRA and its power to enforce procurement rule, was passed by the
Parliament.

In Cluster 4, expenditure outturn for FY08/09 was found to be consistent with the
approved budget and recurrent budget deviation was reduced. The trigger was deemed
completed. However, the budget approved for FY09/10 was not found to be in line with
the policy objectives of MKUKUTA and the trigger was only partially achieved.

A full list of Triggers and Prior Actions, covering each of the PRSCs 4 through 8, is
provided in Annex 2.



2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Government’s ownership of the program at the high policy level and its commitment to
the joint donor budget support process have by and large been strong, and have resulted
in a number of visible improvements.

As one looks at the implementation level, however, the record is much more patchy. In
some areas, like putting a school and a clinic in every ward, increasing the number of
teachers and providing more medical attendants, and in improving the trunk roads, there
are notable successes. In most areas, however, the GoT’s capacity to implement seems to
have reached its limits. In reforming the infrastructure sector, except for successes in
ports and roads, there were failures in the electricity sector, railroads, and air transport.
The investment climate has hardly improved in the past five years and reform progress in
agriculture was too slow to keep up with rapid population growth, much less to develop
Tanzania’s undoubted export potential in a number of crops. Most ICRs of the Bank’s
investment lending projects mention implementation capacity as a constraint, in some
cases to the point of giving them unsatisfactory ratings. And having one of the lowest
tertiary education graduating rates in the world, must have implications for how rapidly
complex implementation problems can be attended to. It is also possible that slow
progress in the areas of accountability and anti-corruption were hampered by increasing
government ineffectiveness. Slow implementation of pay and promotions reform in the

                                             14
public sector, did little to resolve the implementation constraints. Last but perhaps not
least, interviews with Bank and DP staff suggested (albeit anecdotally) that powerful
vested interests may have played a role in undermining the successful implementation of
many of the high level policy pronouncements and commitments.

In retrospect it seems that the Bank’s assessment of GOT capacities was in many
instances too optimistic. Yet there were successes, and on an ex ante view it would have
been difficult to predict which of the proposed interventions were most likely to succeed.
On balance, the Bank and the cofinanciers, while aware that the reforms being
undertaken were ambitious and that the risks of underperformance in many areas were
substantial, made a reasonable judgment that progress (even if highly variable across
sectors) was likely be made.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The overarching arrangements for cooperation between DPs and the GoT were described
in section 1.2 above. The design, implementation and utilization of the Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) processes are governed by those arrangements. Specifically, the Joint
Review Process that has been established for the M&E process consists of one joint GBS
Annual Review, typically held in October. It is aligned with Tanzania’s budget process.
The whole chain starts with Sector and Thematic Reviews from March through
September of each year, followed by an MKUKUTA and GBS Annual Reviews in
October, Budget Guidelines preparation during November through January, and ending
with Budget and MTEF preparations between February and June.

Decisions about the level of GBS to be provided, are based on the progress assessed
under the PAF. The PAF is basically a matrix of commitments consisting of three
categories that are monitored by the Cluster Working Groups throughout the year: (i)
Underlying Process; (ii) Temporary Process Actions; and (iii) Outcome Indicators. The
assessment of performance under the 2009 PAF that preceded the approval of PRSC 8,
for example, showed that 15 out of 20 Underlying Processes were assessed as satisfactory
during the year, 13 out of 25 Temporary Processes were achieved, and 18 out of 34
Outcome Indicators were on track.

Outcome, output, and input indicators provide direct information on all aspects of the
reform programs supported by the PRSCs. Monitoring of these indicators is based on a
broad range of surveys and administrative data systems identified in the MKUKUTA
monitoring master plan. The Poverty and Human Development Report (PHDR), which is
published bi-annually, consolidates poverty measures from various sources, and provides
analysis of poverty trends and underlying factors. Sector reviews are key monitoring
mechanisms for outputs at the sectoral level. IMF’s PRGF and, later, PSI reviews and the
quarterly macro-financial developments report are the key sources for the assessment of
the macroeconomic situation. Progress in public expenditure management covering both



                                           15
improvements in systems and enhanced allocative and operational efficiency in the use of
inputs is tracked by the annual PERs/PEFARs.

The choice of indicators to track PDOs was sound. The various indicators under each
PDO were mostly also sensible, although in a few cases such as for example the target for
agricultural growth, or the percentage of births attended by a skilled health worker, they
became increasingly unrealistic. Perhaps that should have been an early warning that
rural poverty and maternal mortality are not likely to decline in line with expectations and
hence a signal for more intense interventions in these areas. The Doing Business ranking
as an indicator, adopted by PAF, was slightly problematic as a time-series measure as the
Doing Business report for any specific year publishes not only rankings for the latest year
but also adjusts the previous year’s rankings reflecting new countries joins the assessment
and the methodology evolves. Therefore, the team monitored whether Tanzania made an
improvement or not based on the adjusted rankings.

As mentioned earlier (section 1.3), the comprehensive results framework (RF) for the
series was firmly set during PRSC-6 and was congruent to the PAF which was then
integrated with MKUKUTA M&E framework. The set of outcome indicators chosen in
the RF from PRSC-6 built upon the set of indicators chosen from earlier operations in the
series, introducing two levels of . The outcome indicators in the PAF were subsequently
modified every year both in terms of type of indicators as well as target values. For
example, for the case of revenue collected from concessions and licenses for forestry, the
PAF switched from an actual amount of revenue collected in Tanzanian Schilling (TSh)
from the initial indicator which is collected revenue as percentage of their estimated
value. The PAF also added two new indicators (port dwell time and primary school
completion rate) to reflect new developmental concerns in the country and dropped some
indicators based on discussion between GoT and DPs. The target values in the PAF were
also updated annually. On the other hand, to maintain consistency of the programmatic
framework in the series, the modification made to the indicators for PRSCs (after PRSC-
6) included only the two new indicators and limited number of target modifications by
setting PRSC-specific program targets where the initial target values were found
unrealistic (e.g., Doing Business ranking).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Program Development Objectives of the PRSC 4-8 series corresponded closely to those
of MKUKUTA, the Government’s overarching reform program. The PRSC support
program followed MKUKUTA in supporting policy actions in its three main clusters: (i)
Growth and Reduction of Poverty; (ii) Quality of Life and Social Well-being; and (iii)
Governance and Accountability.

At the same time the PRSC series were an integral part of the Bank’s CAS which, in
support of the main objectives of MKUKUTA, designed and implemented a mix of
budget support, sector investment, TA and analytical instruments. The Bank’s CAS was
also coordinated with the DP’s Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST). The JAST
clearly identifies GBS as the preferred aid modality, as it allows for a fuller integration o
f donor support into government systems and alignment with MKUKUTA
implementation.

The design of the PRSC operations followed established good practice principles in
policy-based lending. PRSC operations tended to reinforce government ownership by
supporting rather than duplicating government processes (aid harmonization among
donors, alignment of aid with the budget cycle, use of government procurement processes,
etc.). There was an accountability framework that guided both government and donors,
including the use of continuously updated result matrices. Prior Actions (as conditions of
disbursement) were few (around 10 in each operation) and were relevant to the
achievement of agreed results. Progress reviews were transparent and conducive to
performance-based, predictable budget support.

Implementation, however, often fell short of intentions expressed in the design of both
budget support and sector investment operations. Major factors affecting implementation
were discussed in Section 2.2 above. Achievement or non-achievement of agreed results
and the extent to which they were due to weaknesses in implementation are discussed in
the next section.



3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

While there was clear progress towards the program development objectives (see Results
Framework in Annex 4), the PRSC program fell short of fully achieving the targets under
PDO indicators in almost all categories.

In Cluster 1 (Growth and reduction of poverty), despite strong growth in GDP over the
period of the PRSC program (2005-10), rural poverty in the 2007 HBS stood at 37% and
was unlikely to meet the program target of 34% based on the measured trend between
2001 and 2007. And it would surely not meet the MKUKUTA target of 24%. However,

                                             17
as discussed in Section 1.1 above, there are methodological and measurement issues that
call for caution in making this judgment.

In Cluster 2 (Quality of life and social well-being) the under 5 mortality PDO of 79 is
likely to be met. On the other hand, the literacy of 15+ age group PDO target of 80% is
unlikely to be met.

In Cluster 3 (Governance and Accountability), the PDOs for accountability, corruption
and government effectiveness, as measured by the World Governance Indicators (WGI),
all remained far from the program targets, with government effectiveness actually getting
worse over the period 2005-09. These indicators may not be fully comparable across
time, but interviews with team members involved in the PRSC series and complementary
projects aimed at improving governance, corroborate that progress in these areas has been
disappointing..

It is difficult to attribute success or failure in the attainment of specific PDOs to any one
or even a group of policy actions taken under the PRSC program. Nevertheless, it would
be hard to believe that the improvements in many of the subsidiary outcome indicators
(sub-indicators) used to track progress of the reform program (see Results Framework in
Annex 4), were unrelated to policy changes.

In the macroeconomic area, for example, strong GDP growth is typically unlikely to be
sustained if the macroeconomic environment is not sound. Tanzania’s was certainly
sound, as has been documented in the IMF’s PRGF, and later PSI, reports over time.

In the area of agriculture, growth averaged 4% per year, short of the PRSC program
target of 6% and far short of the MKUKUTA target of 10%. Also, there is a considerable
doubt that the data are correct, with most knowledgeable observers arguing that the 4%
rate is too high. Even if correct, it is barely ahead of population growth, and seems
mainly to have been due to continued extension of cultivated areas rather than increases
in yields. Still, some crops and some geographic areas did much better than the average
and may hold lessons for the future. There was some progress in important policy areas
such as land registration, reduction of local government ―nuisance‖ taxes, and slow
reform of the crop boards towards regulation and away from marketing. On the other
hand, there was little progress in building all-weather rural roads which are essential for
market access, the system for getting farmers to adopt approaches known to yield results
is broken, and programs to improve access to better seeds and fertilizer are just getting
underway. On the whole, though, the progress was too slow to make a dent in rural
poverty and far too slow if Tanzania wishes to make use of its large agriculture export
potential (see Binswanger-Mkhize and Gautam, 2010).

Actions to improve accountability and transparency in allocating natural resources and
governing concessions should help ensure that growth does not undermine environmental
sustainability.




                                             18
Tanzania’s ranking in Doing Business has declined consecutively for the past three years.
The business environment did not improve enough to make the small and medium
enterprise sector another engine of growth. One can point to some improvements, such as
the removal of various licenses, some streamlining in bureaucratic procedures, and
improvements in some areas of infrastructure (trunk roads, efficiency of port operations).
One can also point to the failure to establish one-stop-shop procedures or to follow up on
studies that suggested specific barriers that should be removed or actions taken to
improve the business environment. It is hard to say at which point a ―critical mass‖ of
policy measures will add up to conditions that would lead to faster formalization of small
informal enterprises and more rapid growth of the entire sector in the future. Nevertheless,
results suggest that much more needs to be done if income poverty is to start declining
more rapidly.

Policy actions aimed at improving trunk roads, establishing a well-functioning road fund,
increasing the quantity and quality of electric power supply, decongesting ports and
improving the framework for private public partnerships, and strong increases in credit to
the private sector, probably contributed to the strong growth in some sectors of the
economy (e.g. construction, telecoms and mining) and will be even more important in the
future. Intermediate indicators in these areas all showed improvements (see Annex 4).

In the area of health, education and better access to clean water, sectoral plans helped
formulate more effective interventions. These plans were over time, increasingly geared
to results, rather than being mostly process oriented. Larger and better targeted budget
resources also helped. Along with better policies, they allowed improvements in the
(qualified) teacher/pupil ratios, almost reaching the net enrollment targets in primary
schools, higher completion rates at primary school level, greater numbers of students at
the tertiary level, increasing the number of health workers (with the percentage of births
attended by skilled health workers increasing from 41% to 51%), better facilities,
resources for medicines, books and other needed materials and equipment, and greater
access to potable water. These are the sectors in which one can safely attribute better
outcomes to better policies. Still, the rate of improvement does not seem to be rapid
enough to make Tanzania more competitive relative to its neighbors (assuming that better
human capital makes a country a better prospect for investment). Tanzania’s HDI ranking
has not budged from its 148th place in 10 years (UN HDR 2010). It improved absolutely,
but not relatively. It is puzzling that the issue of Tanzania’s high population growth
received scant attention, since in a poor country like Tanzania, greater fertility has
negative implications for human development and poverty.

In the areas of government accountability, anti-corruption and government effectiveness,
slow progress in the PDO indicators (and actual reversal in the effectiveness indicator)
might suggest that the policies enacted were ineffective. The number of measures
implemented in this area, however, has been quite large and the sub-indicators mostly
point in the right direction. It is thus likely, that the impact of the measures taken and yet
to be taken will cumulate over time and the policies will prove to have been more
effective than they now seem. Reforms of the incentives of public employees are difficult
and take a long time to implement. Yet over time many countries have had some success

                                             19
in this area. Perceived corruption may be increasing, but an anti-corruption bill was
enacted. Actions have been taken to improve auditing, procurement, legal procedures,
and budgeting. And a decentralization of finances is underway that should in time better
align service delivery with people’s preferences. It is to be hoped that the combination of
all these will ―jell‖ at some point and that the WGI indicators will eventually show much
stronger progress which, in good part, will have been due to the measures that have been
put in place in the last 5 years.



3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: The Overall Outcome Rating is Moderately Satisfactory

The rating is an average both of the PRSC operations through time and across the wide
scope of each operation.

In terms of relevance, the PRSC 4-8 series were consistent with the objectives of
MKUKUTA which in turn were reflected in the Bank’s CAS and the Joint Assistance
Strategy for Tanzania. Most of the Bank resources (combining budget support, sector
investment lending, TA and AAA) were allocated to the growth and poverty reduction
cluster. This made sense as the hope was that it would result in shared growth which
would alleviate income poverty. It also marked a shift from the first series of PRSCs 1-3
which concentrated more on Cluster 2 (Improvement of Quality of Life and Social Well-
being). In every area of reform, PRSC Prior Actions and resources were supported by
complementary sector investment operations of either the Bank or other DPs (often
through ―baskets‖ to leverage the resources). Attention was also paid to cross-links
among clusters. For example, spatial inequalities in the development of human resources
(Cluster 2) were in part to be addressed through pay policies for remote areas (Cluster 3).
And, when unexpectedly poor (income) poverty results emerged in 2007/08, the Bank
and other DPs reacted quickly, refocused their analysis and tried to figure out what can be
done to spread the benefits of strong GDP growth more widely. The urgency of
improving the performance of agriculture and the environment for doing business was
ratcheted up. At the same time the push continued to improve social well-being as well
as putting in place an apparatus needed for more accountable, more transparent and more
effective governance. The relevance rating is Satisfactory.

Achievements of the PDOs, however, were mixed. Most PDO indicators were not fully
achieved, but overwhelmingly the improvements were in the right direction. Looking at
sub-indicators, the glass is more than half full. There seemed to be some loss of reform
momentum towards the end of the series. On the other hand, the earlier operations may
have benefited from the reforms of the early 2000s. There is also some evidence that in a
number of areas (e.g. PEFA indicators and perhaps some aspects of CPIA) Tanzania may
have been over-rated at the start of the second PRSC series. This may have biased the
initial expectations upward and made subsequent progress look slower than it actually
was. On balance, the achievement of PDOs and other outcome indicators is rated as

                                            20
Moderately Satisfactory, resulting in an Overall Outcome Rating of the PRSC 4-8
program for Tanzania as Moderately Satisfactory.



3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Covered elsewhere

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Covered elsewhere

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The global financial crisis, as well as the food price shock that preceded it, were two
impacts that could not have been foreseen. The Bank (as well as other DPs and the IMF)
reacted in a coherent fashion to offset the impact of the crises. The Bank quickly
processed a financing operation for $170 million, supplemental to PRSC 7 to provide
additional budget support as the Government implemented a rescue package during
FY09/10 to counter the negative macroeconomic shock from the financial crisis.
Specifically, PRSC-7 supplemental financing was provided to contribute to maintaining
the overall reform program on track and ensuring the FY09/10 budget contributions in
support of MKUKUTA can be financed and implemented during the time of the crisis.
Compared with the macroeconomic and budgetary projections at the time of PRSC-7
Negotiations, FY09/10 budget was significant higher due to additional expenditures
related to the rescue package.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Ratings: The risk to Development Outcomes is Moderate

If the problems of the rural and small business sectors are not addressed with more
urgency and determination, they will continue to undermine progress towards shared
GDP growth and the reduction of income poverty. The links between demography,
growth, social well-being and poverty should probably be added to the equation.

Tanzania is very aid dependent and the government is prone to slippages in its
control of the budget. Despite the increasing ratio of revenues to GDP over the past five
years, the revenues do not cover rapidly growing recurrent expenditures (a gap of 2-4%
of GDP). The overall expenditure to GDP ratio which recently reached almost 30% is
probably too high for a country at Tanzania’s level of development. One of the things
driving it up is the wage bill, which when one includes various allowances is in the range
of 9-10% of GDP. Someone has to be taxed to pay for that which almost surely
negatively affects incentives for effort. Finally, there is a risk that the donors for a variety
of reasons freeze or even cut back on budget support, forcing the government to either
curb the expenditures or raise taxes. This could disrupt both recurrent and public
investment expenditures of the government and lead to a negative impact on growth and
poverty reduction

Limited human resource capacity to implement and manage the PRSC reform agenda
represents a significant risk. It was noted earlier that the government may already be
overstretched because of the wide-ranging scope of the development agenda. A large
number of capacity-building efforts are in place. Most reform programs have capacity-
building components embedded, including the PFMRP, the LGRP, and the PSRP.
Similarly, sector programs and projects typically also contain capacity-building
components. The challenge for Tanzania is to enhance the effectiveness of capacity-
building efforts by shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven efforts and address
capacity building in a holistic way, in which the incentive structure, the education system,
and specific capacity-building efforts are organized in a mutually reinforcing manner.

One of the intentions of the redesigned GBS framework is to use domestic processes for
the assessment of progress and dialogue. This is intended to foster domestic
accountability. However, as some of the analytic work has shown, these processes are
still weak, partly because of weak incentives and capacity of civil society organizations,
NGOs, and the private sector to participate in these processes. Recent events, though,
have shown a renewed vigor in the oversight role of Parliament and of the media, and the
initial prosecutions of a number of grand corruption cases, if carried uniformly, should
make a dent in the ―culture of impunity‖. On the other hand, few of the grand corruption
cases have ended with the perpetrators being punished, and that increases the risk that
other scams may occur.

Another risk for the achievement of MKUKUTA objectives arises from the ongoing
decentralization process, which shifts responsibility for key poverty-reducing programs

                                              22
in education, health, the water sector, and agriculture to the districts. The local
government reform program focuses on strengthening the capacity of local authorities. As
a result, there have been significant improvements in accountability processes at the local
level, and about 50 percent of local authorities now meet basic accountability standards,
compared to an estimated 10 percent only a few years ago. This should make it possible
to implement financing reforms now under way that would put greater funds in the local
hands. But this may also increase the risk of misuse or ineffective use of funds. The
PRSC program also supports actions to strengthen the watchdog role of beneficiaries at
the community level through disclosure of the flow of resources at the grassroots level
and expenditure tracking of financial flows from the central government.

The 2006 and 2008 PEFA assessments suggest that Tanzania’s financial management
system is still among the best in Africa. Nonetheless, fiduciary risks in the areas of
financial management and procurement remain. There is also the issue of arrears from
road contracts during PRSC-7 Supplementary Financing which raised a question about
the quality of the commitment control system. In recent years, the Government has
implemented measures to reduce fiduciary risks, including the approval and application
of new public finance and procurement acts, the operationalization of the electronic
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), strengthening of the
National Audit Office, and reform of the public procurement system. The PFMRP and
actions monitored by the PRSC and PAF are designed to address weaknesses in the
Government’s financial management and procurement systems, with particular emphasis
on the integrity of IFMIS. Tight follow up of the Government’s action plan on the EPA
account audit, and of other government measures to assess eventual past fraudulent
transactions at the Central Bank are also underway.

Finally, there are some risks that come from Tanzania’s external environment. With the
global economic recovery now well underway, food and fuel prices have again increased
and are likely to worsen Tanzania’s terms of trade. Similarly, domestic shocks such as
recurrent droughts may occur. This may affect both agricultural output and hydroelectric
power generation. However, in terms of containing the fallout from such events on
development outcomes, determined actions in improving agriculture and business
environment as well as continued efforts to develop power generation that is not
dependent on the vicissitudes of weather, would go a long way towards making the
economy more flexible and thus better able to withstand shocks of various kinds.

While those risks exist, there is momentum that has not been lost. There have been
positive outcomes in all broad areas of reform including crop boards reform, road, anti-
corruption, PPP, and PFM. While progress toward achieving some PDOs had slowed
down, some momentum has been built and the chance that such momentum gets
reversed would be very small. In addition, the next series of PRSCs is likely to try to
consolidate the gains achieved from this series, while pushing into new areas of reform
and ensuring macro-fiscal stability and help the Government scale up domestic revenue
mobilization. Overall, thus, the risk that the development outcomes will not be achieved
is Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Ratings: Bank Performance at Ensuring Quality at Entry was Satisfactory

The design of the PRSC series followed the best practice guidelines for PRSC operations.
PRSC 5 received a Highly Satisfactory rating for QAE and was commended for best
practice in how it went about designing the mechanisms for harmonizing aid from the
DPs. The operations focused on strategically relevant issues. As problems arose, they
were addressed in a subsequent operation. For example, when the results of the 2007
HBS only marginal improvements in rural poverty, the issue was addressed more
vigorously in the subsequent PRSC and more emphasis was put on measures that would
speed up growth in the countryside. The macroeconomic environment was always
conducive to reforms. Environmental aspects and other safeguards were covered.
Fiduciary aspects were attended to and under PRSC 6 the handling of potential fiduciary
problems stemming from alleged corruption at the BOT was made a condition of
negotiations. M&E aspects were a bit weak at the start of the series but improved over
time. Risk assessments were realistic. And Bank inputs and processes were adhered to,
including seeking advice from a wide circle of people. Quality at entry was Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Quality of Supervision has been Satisfactory

While the system Tanzania has put in place for M&E of MKUKUTA is elaborate, it has
remained mainly donor oriented, producing M&E outputs of uneven relevance. The
underlying M&E system is under revision to strengthen information quality, policy
relevance, and integration with the budget process, notably by (i) implementing a new
national statistical master plan; (ii) carrying out the implementation of an annual Living
Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) panel survey, started in 2009; (iii) supporting the
strengthening of the internal reporting requirements of the Government, in particular, the
output and performance reports newly introduced in the latest budget guidelines; and (iv)
better aligning MKUKUTA’s M&E process with what the NBS and other providers of
statistics provide with some reliability on a regular basis.

Results monitoring of budget support suffers from the unavailability or low frequency of
some of the critical outcome indicators, such as poverty estimates, health outcomes, or
learning achievements. The poverty survey data in the third quarter of 2008, and
subsequently the results of the annual panel survey as well as the demographic and health
survey planned for 2009, allow a much tighter follow up on the impact of the government
policies and spending. An additional dimension of the monitoring framework covers the

                                           24
Government-donor relationship in monitoring progress on PRSC objectives, such as
enhanced local ownership of the development process, participation by all stakeholders,
and efficiency of aid delivery mechanisms. In particular, the PRSC team has been
working with the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) partners to enhance the
capacity of, and information flows with, Parliament, civil society, and the private sector.
In February 2010, a PER parliamentary forum was organized by the Finance and
Economic Committee of the Parliament, and the Bank was asked to contribute
extensively by presenting the results of the PER analytical work.

Under these circumstances, the DPs participating in GBS had to develop some of their
own ways of monitoring progress, which supplemented the indicators available under
MKUKUTA’s M&E system. Further, the PRSC series had to narrow the range of
indicators further and adapt them to follow the policy actions supported by the PRSC
series.

The PRSC implementation was conducted largely by field-based staff on the ground, who
were in very close touch with the Authorities bilaterally as well as through GBS cluster
working groups and sector working groups. While the harmonized GBS system has
helped the Government reduce transaction cost with DPs, coordination process within
DPs has become very complex as the system evolves with more comprehensive PAF and
the M&E framework. In such an environment, the team took leadership in formulating
directions in PAF rather than simply passively following the outcomes from the GBS
consultation process in preparing and implementing the PRSC operations. The closeness
to the client made seamless supervision possible in implementing the operations under
the series. Also, The team’s careful supervision of the program allowed the team
promptly react to the request for a supplemental financing of US$170 million to PRSC-7
to finance the Government provide a fiscal stimulus package to counter negative impacts
from the global financial crisis. The supplemental financing had contributed to
maintaining the overall reform program on track and ensuring the FY09/10 budget
contributions in support of MKUKUTA can be financed and implemented.

The rating for supervision is assessed to have been Satisfactory

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: The Overall Bank Performance was Satisfactory

Overall, the Bank performance was satisfactory, based on its sound design of the program
at the entry, as shown in the ―highly satisfactory‖ QAG rating for quality at the entry for
PRSC-5, as well as high quality of supervision supported by the solid field-presence of
the team members. The rating simply follows the ICR guidelines. The lower of the two
scores for Bank Performance determines the average rating.




                                            25
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Government Performance was Moderately Unsatisfactory

Note that government performance is for the overall government including sector
ministries in implementing various reforms under MKUKUTA.

Government ownership and commitment to achieving PDOs was strong throughout the
program. The language of high level policy documents, as well as the statements of
senior officials, was unequivocally in favor of continuing reforms across a broad front
with the aim of fostering rapid, broadly shared economic growth.

However, there is, on average, a wide gap between the language used in the documents
such as MKUKUTA and its implementation. As pointed out earlier in this evaluation,
there have been undeniable successes is several areas of reform, most notably in health,
education and access to potable water. Nevertheless, the movement in a number of other
areas was not strong enough to make decisive turns for the better in rural development, or
in the environment for doing business, areas in which the overwhelming majority of
Tanzanians make their living. There was also, on balance, lack of clear success in
improving the performance of entities that play critical roles in the functioning of
Tanzania’s infrastructure --- energy, transportation (road, rail, air), communications, and
ports. Some progress, yes, but slow compared to the needs. This point is supported by
ICRs of WB investment loans that in some way supported reforms in these areas, except
for the progress in improving the major road network, including the road fund, which has
been a success. Towards the end of the PRSC program period there was also progress in
the functioning of the ports, but questions were also raised about the transparency of the
deals made with the port operators. The process also continued to waste substantial public
resources, including large opportunity costs of tying up financial and human resources
that could have been put to better use elsewhere. And scandals due to corruption in the
power sector were not only damaging in terms of reputation, but more importantly,
significantly slowed down the much needed increases in power supplies. Lack of power
is now perceived as a major constraint by over 80% of Tanzania’s businesses.

Similarly, progress in the areas of accountability, anti-corruption and effectiveness of
government was too slow compared to the needs. In addition, reforms that came slowly to
begin with (triggers were in a number of significant cases watered down or delayed from
one PRSC to the next), were later eroded through amendments or delays in
implementation. This seemed to happen in some way in almost all areas of the
governance and accountability cluster. The government did try to improve its
effectiveness through various measures, including importantly its Medium-Term Pay
reform. But at the end of the day, while the wage bill had increased by several percentage
points of GDP (becoming as a proportion of GDP one of the larger ones in Africa, to the
point of threatening to undermine fiscal discipline), the pay scales were still compressed
in the middle, the spatial inequalities in the allocation of personnel were not substantially

                                             26
reduced, and the incentive-distorting allowances continued (if by another name). The
World Governance Indicator measuring effectiveness of government was one of the few
PDO indicators that actually worsened during the period covered by PRSC 4-8.

Typically, when the reform program is broad and complex, and some of the reforms are
politically difficult to implement, there needs to be very strong coordination from the
center. In the case of Tanzania this was to come from the Prime Minister’s and/or the
President’s Office. In a number of important cases, the response was not sufficiently
aggressive. Government performance was therefore assessed as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: Performance of the Implementing Agency was Moderately Satisfactory

Note that implementing agency is Ministry of Finance only in the narrow sense of
managing the GoT implementation of PRSC operations.

Ministry of Finance was the Bank’s main counterpart throughout the PRSC 4-8 program.
The view of the people interviewed is that its performance has been Moderately
Satisfactory. The Ministry of Finance, as the organizer of the MKUKUTA review
process, successfully managed the process of conducting the annual MKUKUTA national
policy dialogue, ensuring the process is also participatory for the civil society. It also
successfully managed the deliberations of the complex GBS annual review process,
starting from the sector review including interactions with GBS donor group (14 DPs) to
agree on assessment outcomes of current PAFs and jointly formulate contents of future
PAFs. However, due to capacity constraint, the management of the process became
slightly weak, as illustrated by a few cases of delays in completing the review process as
well as PRSC appraisal process.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Overall Borrower Performance was Moderately Satisfactory

ICR Guidelines suggest that when the ratings of Government Performance and
Implementing/Coordinating Agency Performance differ, the rating of Overall Outcome
Performance of the program should be taken into account. Since the Overall Performance
was Satisfactory, the Overall Performance of the Borrower has been Moderately
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

There are both specific and general lessons to be learned from the PRSC 4-8 series.

Specifically, looking at the outcomes in the three clusters of MKUKUTA, the biggest
challenge is how to convert Tanzania’s relatively strong GDP growth into reduction of
(income) poverty. What stands out at the end of the second series of PRSCs is that (i)
agriculture has barely outpaced the rate of growth of population; and (ii) business
environment, particularly for small entrepreneurs, remains inadequate, with the result that
more than half of Tanzania’s GDP continues to be generated by the informal sector. And
the links between demography, growth, poverty and social well-being should not be
forgotten. Until this area is fixed, the vast majority of Tanzanians will not be able to
enjoy the fruits of rapid growth. This observation has been made repeatedly in various
donor and government documents, but has not led to convincing action. An in-depth re-
examination of the causes of this failure is in order and it should encompass everything
from the analytical findings (of which there are many), to how precisely the problems
will be handled at the technical and, most importantly, political levels.

The way forward in the other two clusters seems easier. There has been clear success in
improving the well-being of ordinary Tanzanians. Various health, education and clean,
accessible water indicators have improved, some substantially.4 One of the weaker ones
has been continued stagnation in high maternal mortality. The key ingredients to
lowering that, according to UNFPA, are attendance of qualified medical personnel at
birth, good emergency obstetrics care and family planning. The last one is crucial not
just in order to lower maternal mortality, but also because of the correlation between
slower population growth and faster GDP growth, a correlation that is likely to be
stronger in the large rural and small business segment of the population.

In the governance and accountability cluster the way forward is to build on the existing
momentum in public financial management, budgeting, anti-corruption and the reform of
the public service. Perhaps the key areas are bringing to justice the perpetrators of cases
of grand corruption (which may have positive spill-over effects on the presence of
corruption in general) and continued reform in the incentive framework as well as the
overall size of the public service. Public employees should have the incentives to ―be in
the right places doing the desirable things‖.

The coordination function at the highest level should be strengthened. When reforms flag
for whatever reason, it is only a group at the top that has the Prime Minister’s and the
President’s backing that can untangle the problems.

The GBS process which at one time was hailed as ―state of the art‖, may have become
too cumbersome at this point. A number of DPs and Bank Staff suggested that there are

 The main problem in the education sector today is poor outcomes at primary and secondary levels.
Increases in enrollment combined with supply-side constraints (failing infrastructure, inequitable staff
allocation, and a shortage of skilled teachers and educational materials) have caused declines in quality.

too many groups, that the various levels do not communicate sufficiently with one
another (information coming from the DP troika to the lower levels ―gets lost‖) and that
the costs of so much coordination may outweigh the benefits. There is a sense that when
things are going well, the mechanism works, but when reforms are flagging, as seems to
be the DP view at the moment, disagreements on the way forward increase and the
harmonization mechanism becomes a constraint.

A number of general lessons also apply to the Tanzania PRSC (and DPLs in low income
countries in general). They have become generic but, if policy loans to Tanzania are to
continue, should be observed and perhaps honed.

First, there is no avoiding conditionality. Good Practice Principles of Policy-based
Lending are now routinely stated in almost every operation and have become second
nature in designing policy-based operations. Donors should reinforce government
ownership by supporting rather than duplicating government processes (aid
harmonization among donors, alignment of aid with the budget cycle, use of government
procurement processes, etc.). There should be an accountability framework that guides
both government and donors. Prior Actions (as conditions of disbursement) should be
few but critical to the achievement of agreed results. Progress reviews should be
transparent and conducive to performance-based, predictable budget support.

Second, unlike investment lending operations, PRSCs are able, in principle, to deal with
complex cross-cutting issues when the Government has the requisite technical and
coordination capacities and the operations are supplemented by sector ILs, TA and
competent analytical work. If the coordination and technical capacities are limited,
interventions in complex cross-cutting areas have to be prioritized and sequenced. Over
time, as capacities get stronger, the number of complex interventions can be increased.
This is an area in which wishful thinking often replaces hard-nosed realism, and results in
less than acceptable outcomes.

Third, committed political leadership makes a difference. Yet, even the best leadership
can only accomplish so much in a given time period. It must overcome ever-present
vested interests, old mind-sets and ingrained behaviors, even assuming that technical and
organizational capacities are adequate. This is a tricky area. There are often AAA
products (as was the case with a string of policy notes in Tanzania) that identify aspects
of these issues and there is anecdotal evidence. But the job of transforming that
knowledge into successful interventions ultimately falls to the government. The donors
can at best figure out what actions are likely to succeed and back them, or decide that the
government is unlikely to follow through and back off. It is extremely difficult to get that
balance right. Tanzania has been no exception.

Finally, measuring outcomes is important in order to increase focus and accountability.
Realistic, focused monitoring frameworks that track progress over time towards ultimate
objectives, concentrate the mind of government as well as the donors.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners


Several DPs that provide financing through the GBS said that the Bank’s leading role in
the GBS process, from analytical work to financing, is important and should continue.
They acknowledged that the slow-down in the reform process in the last few years, as
well as weakening of Tanzania’s budgetary discipline last year, have been frustrating but
were hopeful that the differences between the Government and the DPs could be bridged.
