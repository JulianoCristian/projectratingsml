Reduction Support\n            Credit Program (PRSC-7) for Tanzania focuses on two\n            overarching objectives: (1) sustaining high and shared\n            economic growth; and (2) expanding the effective delivery of\n            basic public services through the government budget. The\n            Bank's PRSC support to Tanzania is provided within a\n            harmonized framework for general budget support (GBS) with\n            thirteen other development partners (DP), comprising a\n            Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a Partnership\n            Framework Memorandum (PFM) for GBS for the implementation of\n            Tanzania's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy\n            (MKUKUTA), and a joint review process, culminating in a\n            joint Annual Review (AR) in October/November. The framework\n            is designed to support domestic accountability, reduce\n            transaction costs (especially for the government), and\n            encourage the further development and use of Tanzania's\n            own systems. The program structure follows the three pillars\n            of MKUKUTA, namely growth and reduction of income poverty,\n            social well-being, and governance. Given the advanced stage\n            of reforms in Tanzania, these two main strategic areas map\n            out into seven operational policy areas for the PRSC series:\n            agriculture and natural resources; infrastructure;\n            environment for private sector development; monitoring of\n            service delivery in social sectors; public expenditure and\n            financial management; effectiveness of public\n            administration; and anti-corruption and accountability of\n            the state which is receiving heightened attention from the\n            government, domestic stakeholders and development partners."}, "docdt": "2009-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
