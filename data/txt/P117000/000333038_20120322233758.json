for the Economic and Social\n            Development Policy Loan/Credit Project for Grenada were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            a programmatic approach, which supports a multi-stage\n            program with a longer term horizon, is superior to a\n            stand-alone one year program. At the Regional Operations\n            Committee meeting of this Development Policy Loan (DPL)/DPL\n            held in December 2009, both peer reviewers of this operation\n            as well as comments by other participants strongly supported\n            a programmatic approach. Eventually, a stand-alone operation\n            was favored because of the high uncertainty and debt risk of\n            Grenada at that point in time. With hindsight, a\n            programmatic operation could have had stronger development\n            impact and, by presenting a schedule of possible future\n            financial support. In small states, policy based programs\n            need to be relatively simple and straightforward. Since\n            generally only one policy based operation is prepared in a\n            multi-year period, both the Government and the Bank tend to\n            include many activities in the program. However,\n            implementation capacity is usually not strong in these\n            countries. Thus, in order to increase the likelihood that\n            programs are fully implemented, it would be useful to design\n            highly selective and relatively simple programs. In\n            addition, following up with intensive technical assistance\n            and country dialogue that builds local capacity would help\n            during implementation and also enhance sustainability of the\n            reform program in the medium term. The Program Policy Matrix\n            needs to be concise, with few measures and outcome\n            indicators that are clearly defined, critical for the\n            performance of the Program, and that are within control of\n            the government."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
