                          insurance companies and annuity definitions are tightened to ensure that products offered are
                          clearly covered as insurance products and that they are also covered under the relevant
                          regulations (Baseline: no capital requirements and annuity products included deposit type

Objectives and                increase the efficiency of tax collection, improve public service delivery, enhance debt
Contribution to CAS:          management, reduce waste in the provision of public services, and help cope with the
                              adverse consequences of the global economic downturn.
                              Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by supporting efforts to

                                                        6
                       develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent targeting mechanisms and
                       prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.
                        Promote financial sector stability and improve the business environment, through measures
                        aimed at strengthening the financial sector regulatory environment, mitigating regional
                        contagion risks, promoting investments, and substantially lowering the existing barriers to
                        registering companies and properties.
                   Given the decline in fiscal revenues under the current global environment, the impact of the
                   global crisis particularly on vulnerable groups, and financial sector risks from the regional inter-
                   linkages; these efforts are particularly important for maintaining macroeconomic stability,
                   improving fiscal balances to create space for social protection and productive expenditures as
                   well as for fostering growth in the medium term.
                   Contribution to the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS): The proposed ES DPL/DPC is viewed
                   as the beginning of a multi-year engagement as envisaged under the OECS RPS FY2010-14,
                   scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3, 2010. It also aims to create a policy platform
                   for medium-term reforms to be supported by the Bank or other donors in the future.
                   There are three main risks to the program supported by the proposed ES DPL/DPC:
                   Economic: Strong financial sector linkages in the region create contagion risks, as demonstrated
                   by the recent BAICO/CLICO collapse. A deeper and more protracted global slowdown and
                   further retrenchment of capital flows could deepen the impact of the global crisis on the country.
                   Grenada is also susceptible to other external shocks such as an increase in oil prices, specific
                   shocks to the tourism sector. Mitigation: So far, the impact of the BAICO/CLICO collapse has
                   been contained and national authorities and the ECCB are strengthening regulation and
                   supervision of the nonbank financial sector. The government is implementing a sound economic
                   program with the support of the IMF and the WB. The program seeks to further reduce
                   vulnerabilities and improve diversification. To mitigate liquidity risks and ease financing
                   constraints, the government has also sought additional budget support from the World Bank,
                   CDB and EU and a new three-year ECF program from the IMF as a follow up to the PRGF
                   program which expired on April 16, 2010.
                   Natural Disasters: Grenada is vulnerable to natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical
                   storms. Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 damaged around 50 percent of Grenada's housing
                   stock and its agriculture and tourism industries, and real GDP contracted by 5.7 percent. In
                   addition, Hurricane Ivan damaged a considerable amount of the country's environmental assets
                   and the provision of livelihoods for the population, especially the most vulnerable and poor.
Risks and Risk     Natural disasters tend to increase indebtedness in the Caribbean region and to redirect public
Mitigation:        resources away from long-run development plans. Mitigation: While it is difficult to fully
                   mitigate natural disaster shocks, damage to the major private sector enterprises would be partly
                   covered by their own insurance. Grenada participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
                   Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant
                   disaster. The Bank is also assisting Grenada through the Hurricane Ivan Emergency Project,
                   which was approved in November 2004. The project supports Grenada's recovery efforts
                   through the financing of critical imports and rehabilitation activities in key social sectors.
                   Political: Although the actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC have already been achieved
                   as prior actions, including enactment of laws by Parliament, continued implementation of the
                   reform program may be opposed by special interests. For example, the development of objective
                   and transparent criteria for social assistance may be challenged by groups who may find
                   themselves no longer eligible for benefits. Mitigation: The political risk is reduced by the
                   National Democratic Congress government's large majority in Parliament (11 seats out of 15 in
                   the House of Representatives), the fact that new elections are not scheduled for another three
                   years, and the government's strong commitment to the reform program as evidenced by bold
                   policy actions soon after coming to power. This risk is reduced further by the government's
                   consultative approach to reform implementation and its commitment to dialogue among all
                   stakeholders, as demonstrated, inter alia, by extensive consultations on the recent Poverty
                   Assessment.

        ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN/CREDIT

                                              TO
                                        GRENADA

  I.   INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document describes the proposed Economic and Social Development
Policy Loan/Credit (ES DPL/DPC) for US$8 million (IBRD US$4.5 million and IDA
SDR2.3 million) to Grenada. The proposed ES DPL/DPC would provide timely financial
support to the Government of Grenada for (i) managing the impact of the global economic crisis;
and (ii) maintaining and reinforcing the implementation of the government's long-term structural
reform agenda. The Grenadian Government developed a well articulated economic program in
2006 and has been implementing this program since then with necessary extensions and
modifications as required by the changing economic environment. The macroeconomic
performance remained strong up to the global economic crisis when the macroeconomic
environment deteriorated sharply. Given the high level of debt and limited fiscal space, Grenada
is significantly constrained in adopting countercyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the
global economic crisis and needs financial support while it adjusts to the deteriorated global
environment and sustains the implementation of the longer term reform agenda. The ES
DPL/DPC will help the government in maintaining macroeconomic stability and protecting the
poor while enhancing economic and institutional foundations for faster development. To this
end, the ES DPL/DPC supports specific actions to (i) improve public sector governance,
economic management, and debt management; (ii) strengthen social safety nets; and (iii)
improve the business environment and financial sector stability.

2.      Although Grenada has been hit hard by the global crisis, the Government has
remained committed to its long term reform agenda. Economic activity contracted
significantly in 2009 as tourist arrivals and FDI-financed construction fell sharply. Real GDP is
estimated to have declined by 7.7 percent in 2009 and is projected to increase merely by 0.8
percent in 2010. The unemployment rate was 24.9 percent in 2008 and the authorities estimate
that it has further increased to about 30 percent in 2009. Poverty rate is high at 37.7 percent
according to the latest estimates available (2009 Country Poverty Assessment). The Government
is fiscally constrained and has no room for implementing countercyclical policies. The
government has responded by prioritizing public investment projects with the highest expected
employment effects and extending support to the poor. In the meantime, the government has also
advanced longer term reform agenda through major legislative and institutional changes as
evidenced by, for instance, the introduction of a VAT in February 2010, enactment of an
Investment Promotion Act and Insurance Act, establishment of a Debt Management Unit and
completion of a social safety net assessment and a Country Poverty Assessment to improve
targeting of social safety net programs.

3.    The Government recognizes the importance of achieving and maintaining medium
and long term macroeconomic sustainability under an uncertain global environment. The
Government has revised its well articulated medium-term economic program to reflect the

                                               8
impact of the global crisis on the economy and adapt itself to these changing conditions. The
main objectives of the program remain improving fiscal sustainability, reducing the debt
overhang and putting the economy on a high growth path, while maintaining and even expanding
social spending to protect the most vulnerable groups. The Government's medium term
economic program lays the ground for donor support and coordination.

4.      The Government has agreed with the IMF on a new three-year Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement following the successful completion of the previous ECF
program between April 2006 and April 2010. The authorities have requested a follow up
program from the IMF to manage short term difficulties and further advance its long term reform
agenda. In this context, the authorities and the IMF have reached an agreement on a set of policy
measures to reduce fiscal deficits and the debt burden, improve debt sustainability and strengthen
regulations and supervision of financial sectors. The new ECF, in the amount of SDR8.8 million
(about US$13.3 million), was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the IMF on April
2, 2010, and will cover 2010-2013.

5.      The proposed operation is rooted in the Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) FY10-
14 of the OECS and the World Bank, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3,
2010. The FY10-14 RPS rests on two pillars (i) Building Resilience; and (ii) Enhancing
Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth. In this context, the FY10-14 RPS seeks to
contribute to improving fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing efficiency and transparency of
public spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic and financial stability,
strengthening policy coordination and economic management, and rationalizing social safety net
programs and improving targeting systems. These achievements will be critical in strengthening
the ability of the OECS to respond to exogenous shocks and in laying the foundation for growth
in the medium term. This ES DPL/DPC is envisaged in the FY10-14 RPS as a single tranche
operation and is viewed as the beginning of a multi-year engagement.

 II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

6.      Grenada is a small, highly vulnerable open economy. Grenada has a population of
110,000 inhabitants and a per capita national income of US$5,710 (Atlas method, PPP, 2008).
The economy mostly relies on remittances, tourism, financial and educational services and FDI.
Grenada like most small Caribbean economies is limited in its capacity to diversify and hence is
highly vulnerable to economic and natural disaster shocks. First, Grenada suffers from the
myriad disadvantages of limited scale. Second and related, Grenada has a strong degree of
openness and is subject to commodity booms and busts, which compound the challenges of
macroeconomic management and create uncertain growth paths. Third, Grenada along with its
five OECS neighbors consistently rank in the top ten in the world in terms of their exposure to
natural disasters. Fourth, Grenada has accumulated high debt overhang and is amongst the most
indebted countries in the world. Fifth, Grenada has not benefited much from international aid for
years, in part due to its middle-income status. Overall, due to a combination of high exposure to
natural disasters, a small size and limited diversification, Grenada is much more sensitive to
external shocks than most other countries in the world and faces increasingly difficult policy
choices in an interdependent world, especially in the wake of the current global financial crisis.

7.     Up to 2005, the public debt escalated very rapidly, making it necessary to initiate a
period of adjustment and restructuring of the economy. The total public debt to GDP ratio
doubled between 2000 and 2002, reaching 102 percent, and further increased to 120.9 percent by
the end of 2004. With the 2006 Budget, Grenada launched a home-grown medium term reform
program to address growing vulnerabilities with emphasis on sharply reducing public debt,
reinvigorating growth through structural reforms and advancing the nation's social development
agenda. This medium term economic program also laid the ground for an IMF supported PRGF
program, which was successfully completed by the Government between April 2006 and April
2010.

8.      The new government, which took office in July 2008, faced a difficult situation,
which it addressed with prompt and determined actions. The National Democratic Congress
(NDC), led by Tillman Thomas, returned to office in a general election on July 8 2008, winning
11 of the 15 seats in Parliament. The government presented an annual budget for 2009 focused
primarily on poverty-reduction, strengthening economic management, and improving healthcare.
In the process, it has to curtail capital expenditures, as high debt service and wages and salaries
expenditures narrow the fiscal space.

9.      In its 2010 Budget, the government presented to Parliament in mid-January 2010 a
revised medium term strategy and requested IMF financial support under a successor ECF
arrangement. The government's strategy focuses on resuming sustainable growth, reducing
high unemployment and poverty, and restoring fiscal and debt sustainability. To support its
strategy, the government of Grenada requested IMF financial support under a successor ECF
arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.775 million (75 percent of quota) following the
expiration of the PRGF on April 16, 2010.

10.      The process of transformation of the Grenadian economy has been proceeding,
though various exogenous shocks are testing the capacity of the authorities to respond
while staying the course on its reform program. The Government has made significant
progress in its reform program under the IMF supported PRGF, although progress has slowed
during the recent global crisis. The debt to GDP ratio declined to 102.2 percent by end-2008
before rising again in 2009 due to the severe impact of the global recession. First, the rise of food
and energy prices in 2007 and 2008 contributed to a rise in inflation and affected adversely the
poor. Second, the global crisis that deepened during the last quarter of 2008 has hit Grenada hard
like all other small states of the Caribbean. The fiscal deficit caused by large revenue short falls
in the presence of tight liquidity created significant challenges for the authorities.

III.   ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

Economic Context

11.    Grenada has benefitted from exchange rate stability as a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU). The union has a common Central Bank (the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar), which has been pegged to
the US dollar at EC$2.70/US$1 since July 1976.

12.     Following robust performance in the 1990s, growth decelerated and volatility
increased in the 2000s due to exogenous shocks. Between 1993 and 2000, Grenada grew at an
average annual rate of 6.0 percent, breaching the upper middle income threshold in 1997.
However, a series of adverse shocks in the 2000s--September 11, 2001, 2002 Tropical Storm
Lili, 2004 Hurricane Ivan, 2005 Hurricane Emily, and the global crises in 2008-09--lowered the
2000-2009 average growth to 1.3 percent per year and increased volatility (Figure 1).

13.     Most of Grenada's export earnings and an important share of its national income
derive from tourism. Export diversification, which has been declining as a result of preference
erosion in agriculture, fell further due to the extensive damage to the sector from Hurricane Ivan.
The hurricane destroyed the nutmeg and mace crops, of which Grenada was the world's second-
largest producer after Indonesia. Bananas are grown on a small scale and are no longer exported.
Consequently, the share of agriculture in GDP has fallen from around 8 percent in 2002 to 4
percent in 2007. The manufacturing sector is small, comprising food-processing, beverages,
garments and electronics assembly industries.

14.    While the current account deficit nearly doubled between 2000 and 2008, FDI
inflows have not kept pace (Figure 2). The widening financing gap has led to increasingly large
portions of the deficit being financed by borrowing.

15.     The public sector debt--already substantial at 54 percent of GDP in 2000--more
than doubled over the course of the decade in the aftermath of external shocks.
Expansionary fiscal policy to offset the adverse impacts of sharp falls in tourist arrivals in 2001
and 2002--due to the terrorist attacks in 2001 in the US and tropical storm Lili in 2002--more
than tripled the fiscal deficit and drove the public debt to 102 percent of GDP by end-2002. Most
of the increase was due to the accumulation of external commercial debt, which also raised debt
service costs in later years. At the end of 2004--following Hurricane Ivan--total public debt
stood at nearly 121 percent of GDP, with external debt at 89 percent. Although the government
was successful in bringing the public debt back to pre-Hurricane Ivan levels by end-2008, public
debt remains well above the ECCB benchmark of 60 percent. Most of the debt--88 and 83
percent of external and domestic debt, respectively--is held by the central government (Annex
5).


                                                                                    11
16.     In September 2005, the government launched a successful commercial debt
exchange offer for half of the total public debt. Grenada's five Paris Club creditors also agreed
to a restructuring of US$16 million of the country's debt due to be paid between January 2006 to
June 2009. The restructuring provided for medium and long term claims to be repaid over 12
years with a five-year grace period. Following the restructuring, Grenada's new bonds (20-year
maturity) were upgraded to B-minus from the 2004 default status by Standard and Poor's.

17.     Grenada meets several requirements for effective debt management but needs
improvements in audit capacity, governance, and strategy development. The 2009 Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) gave Grenada strong scores on policies and
procedures related to Regional Governments Securities Market (RGSM) borrowing, storage of
debt records, and staff capacity and HR management. In addition, the country meets the
minimum requirements for an adequate legal framework and effective coordination with fiscal
and monetary policy. However, scored less well in other areas, including frail governance and
strategy development aspect of debt management, weak role of audit, weak analytical capacity to
undertake debt sustainability analysis (DSA), weak cash flow forecasting and operational risk
management, incomplete guarantee records, and lack of transparency in debt operations.

18.    Since 2004, the government has tried to keep the fiscal deficits under control, which
has proven difficult. Bold fiscal policy measures in 2006 included the National Reconstruction
Levy (albeit at 3 percent rather than at the originally planned 5 percent) and an automatic pricing
mechanism to protect fiscal revenues from fluctuations in oil prices. However, important

                                                                      12
setbacks included fiscal slippages during 2006-07 and the first half of 2008, difficulties
prioritizing capital spending, and delays in improving the business climate and reforming
investment incentives. The overall fiscal balance for the total public sector deteriorated from a
small surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of 8.1 percent in 2007 before declining
to 6.6 percent in 2009. Various forces have pressured the fiscal balance, including drops in
external financing (grants), increased transfers to vulnerable groups in order to mitigate high
food and energy prices, and secular pressures on the wage bill. The government has financed
these deficits with arrears, a drawdown of deposits, and new debt.

19.    The wage bill absorbs over half of the recurrent public sector expenditures. The
public sector is among the largest employers in Grenada, providing work for approximately 5
percent of the population. The wage bill increased from 11 percent of GDP in 2006, in line with
the average for small states and slightly lower than the Caribbean average, to 13 percent in 2008
(Figure 3).1 This was primarily an outcome of a retroactive payment to public servants, increases
in expenditures on contracted personnel and allowances, and lower economic growth.

20.     A zero-growth policy for public employment, in place since September 2002, has not
been effective and has had negative effects on the effectiveness of public service delivery.
The policy has not been applied consistently and has prompted the government to employ
contractual workers to carry out its core functions. The contractual positions offer greater
benefits and higher potential salary, thus encouraging a number of technical staff to choose
contractual appointments rather than joining the public service. The government has also made
retroactive staff payments and pension increases: in 2008, such payments put substantial pressure
on the fiscal balances. Finally, the mismatch between available positions and the need to deliver
services continues. Key core public sector areas, such as the health and agriculture sectors, do
not have sufficient staff to deliver adequate services.

21.     Grenada's efforts to increase the efficiency of taxation and customs are limited by
disconnected and outdated management systems. Tax revenues are estimated to have
dropped to 22.9 percent of GDP in 2009 from 24.4 percent in 2007, with international
transactions accounting for the bulk of the revenues. Management systems in the Inland Revenue

Department are not connected to the systems used in the Customs and Excise Department, which
severely limits revenue collection control and could weaken the benefits of the VAT that the
government introduced on February 1, 2010. In addition, the government does not have a
valuation module for property tax assessments.

22.     The business environment in Grenada ranks low among the Caribbean countries.
According to the 2010 Doing Business Report, Grenada (91st) lags Antigua and Barbuda (50th),
St. Vincent and the Grenadines (70th), Jamaica (75th), St. Kitts and Nevis (76th) and Dominica
(83rd), with particular difficulties in the areas of closing a business, enforcing contracts,
registering property, getting credit, paying taxes, and trading across borders. Compared to many
of its neighbors, the time to start a business is particularly long. The bulk of the delay occurs at
the Registrar of the High Court; such delays account for almost three quarters of the 77 days it
takes to register property in Grenada. Additionally, long delays for clearing exports and imports
as well as relatively high costs of transportation provide disincentives for firms in Grenada to
export and to collaborate across the OECS to achieve economies of scale.

23.     Similar to other OECS members, Grenada's investment regime is not well defined.
Decisions on concessions of investment incentives have been a responsibility of the Cabinet, and
the procedures lacked the transparency and simplicity that are best practice around the world.
The complex and often opaque incentives regime, besides reducing transparency and distorting
economic incentives, have allowed for discretionary tax concessions and complicated tax policy
by shifting the tax burden to other areas, including corporate taxes.

24.     Grenada has a large offshore financial sector with 1,580 registered international
companies in 2007 and a strong presence of foreign bank branches. The presence of financial
conglomerates and complicated ownership structures increases the contagion risks across
different types of financial institutions as well across the Caribbean borders.

25.     In October 2008, the CARIFORUM countries (CARICOM and the Dominican
Republic) signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union, the
first among African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) regions. The EPA replaced unilateral preferential
access with phased-in reciprocal free trade. This comprehensive agreement will require
improvements in the trade policy framework and accelerating regional integration initiatives.

26.    The two percent average per capita growth between 1998 and 2008 did not translate
into a reduction in poverty. While indigent rates dropped significantly from 1998 to 2008, the
percentage of poor people increased from 32 percent in 1998/99 to 37.7 percent in 2007/08


                                                   14
(Table 2). An additional one-sixth of the population is at risk of falling into poverty should an
unanticipated event--such as natural disaster or an economic shock--occur.

27.     Unemployment rates have grown and are of serious concern. Unemployment rates
reached 25 percent in 2007/2008 compared to 13 percent in 2005 and unemployment is
particularly high among poor and most vulnerable. Unemployment rates among youth are
already high, particularly for females, and are expected to increase further.

28.     Past efforts to help the poor have produced a highly fragmented social assistance
system that poses efficiency and effectiveness challenges. Similarly to other OECS countries,
Grenada has a wide range of social programs including income support, education and health-
based, labor market, housing, disabled-population support, and community programs (Box 1).
At the same time, social assistance is characterized by: (i) lack of clear eligibility criteria for
many of the programs; (ii) uncoordinated programs managed by different offices and agencies;
(iii) lack of a single beneficiary registry; and (iv) inadequate monitoring and evaluation.
Grenada does not have unemployment insurance or a national public employment program.

29.     The implementation of social assistance programs has been substantially weakened
by such fragmented structure. Eligibility criteria differ for the various cash transfer programs.
Each ministry uses different targeting methods, application procedures, payment mechanisms,
implementation arrangements and has limited information systems to monitor and evaluate the
programs. Moreover, existing cash transfer programs are not flexible enough to respond quickly
and efficiently in emergency situations. Some of the same constraints are applicable to the in
kind transfer programs.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

30.    The new government came into office in July 2008 and took immediate measures to
address the fiscal challenges it inherited. The temporary suspension of fuel price adjustments,
presidential elections spending, and unbudgeted retroactive wage payments weakened public
finances in the first half of 2008. In response, the government issued a finance circular to
sharply reduce capital expenditure (September 2008), brought forward the date after which no
new commitment for nonessential expenditure items could be made (September 2008), reinstated
the EC$3 per gallon fuel tax and full pass-through of global oil prices to domestic fuel prices
(October 2008), and committed to resolving Capital Bank with limited direct fiscal costs. The
government also committed itself to wage moderation and began negotiating with labor unions
and social partners on maintaining a sustainable wage bill.

31.      However, starting in the last quarter of 2008, the global crisis severely affected
Grenada. In 2008, tourist stop-over arrivals fell by nearly five percent, although this was
somewhat offset by an eight percent increase in cruise ship arrivals (Annex 7). This trend
continued in 2009, with stop-over traffic declining by more than 8 percent, while cruise
passenger arrivals grew by 16 percent for the whole year. Almost all FDI-financed tourism
investment projects were put on hold in 2009. Consequently, real GDP growth slowed from 4.9
percent in 2007 to 2.2 percent in 2008 and real GDP contracted by 7.7 percent in 2009. Even
though official employment statistics are not available, the government projects that
unemployment--estimated at 25 percent in June 2008--rose to 30 percent in 2009 due to lay-
offs in tourism, construction and telecommunications.

32.     In response to the global crisis, the government took measures both on the revenue
and expenditure side. To support employment and tourism, the government granted tax relief to
hotels and guest houses. This measure is estimated to have cost just 0.2 percent of GDP, partly
because not all potential recipients met eligibility conditions such as no dismissal of staff. The
government also cut capital spending by 27 percent and wage expenditure by 5 percent while
protecting social spending to mitigate the impact on the poor. As a result, primary deficit
excluding grants widened by just 1 percent (0.9 percent of GDP) in 2009.

33.   The government has successfully completed the IMF Supported ECF program
between April 2006 and April 20102. The last review (fifth) under the program was approved

  The three-year PRGF arrangement with Grenada was originally approved for a total amount of US$16 million in
April 2006. However, in July 2008, the Fund approved a one-year extension of the PRGF arrangement to 2010 and
boosted the amount covered by the PRGF facility by US$2.2m to help mitigate the impact of food and fuel price
shocks. In June 2009, the Fund further increased the financial assistance under the arrangement by an amount

                                                     16
by the Board of Executive Directors of the IMF on April 2, 2010. All but two quantitative
performance criteria for end-November 2009 were met. The primary balance excluding grants
target was missed by 3.3 percent of GDP due primarily to higher-than-expected external
disbursements on donor-financed capital projects and some overruns on current spending. The
target on accumulation of external official arrears was breached in several cases due to the late
arrival of external budgetary support, systems upgrades, and procedural weaknesses. The
structural benchmark on introducing a Value Added Tax (VAT) was met, but establishing a
Public Procurement Authority is being delayed until September 2010 to allow time to revise the
Public Procurement Act in line with international best practices, with TA from the OECD.

34.     The government also agreed with the IMF on successor ECF Arrangement covering
2010-13. The authorities have requested a successor arrangement (ECF) to continue their
comprehensive economic reforms, reduce vulnerabilities, and foster economic growth, paving
the way for poverty reduction. Access to financial resources under the new ECF arrangement is
SDR 8.775 million (75 percent of quota). The new ECF was approved by the IMF Board on
April 2, 2010.

35.     Inflation, which peaked at 8.2 percent in September 2008, has turned negative amid
slowing economic activity and falling import prices. The increase in consumer prices was
fueled during the first three quarters of 2008 by the rise in international food and energy prices
(Figure 4 4). However, consumer prices began falling in the last quarter of 2008 and continued
during 2009, having declined by 2.4 percent by year-end.

36.     The banking system has so far remained resilient. The yearly growth of credit to the
private sector slowed to 4.1 percent in December 2009 compared to 10.2 percent at end-2008,
reflecting weaker economic activity. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans worsened
from 3.5 percent at end-2008 to 5.9 percent at the end-2009. Capital adequacy ratios have
remained strong at 15.9 percent as of December 2009, well above the minimum requirement
ratio of 8 percent. However liquidity conditions have tightened.

equivalent to SDR 4.39 million (about US$6.8 million) to a total of SDR 16.38 million (about US$25.4 million) to
help Grenada cope with the adverse effects of the global slowdown and financial turmoil.

                                                                                 17
37.    In addition to the current global crisis, Grenada has also been exposed to severe
financial distress due to troubles at the CL Financial Group. CL Financial Group, a large
insurance, banking, energy, agriculture, and real estate conglomerate, has run into trouble with
two of its subsidiaries in the life insurance business: Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO)
and British American Insurance Company (BAICO). Both companies used term deposits taken
from policyholders to invest in real estate in the United States. As a result of the US real estate
market downturn, BAICO is under judicial management and CLICO assets were been seized by
the government of Trinidad and Tobago on January 30, 2009. The deficiency of BAICO is
estimated at USD 287 million as of June 2009 in the Judicial Managers' report, which would
represent about 6.5% of the ECCU's combined GDP. The deficiency of CLICO Barbados to
which the Eastern Caribbean countries are exposed is not known precisely but is expected to be
sizeable.

38.     The CLICO/BAICO collapse has revealed substantial weakness in the financial
regulatory regimes of Grenada and the Caribbean at large. The CL Financial Group is based
in Trinidad and Tobago and its policies were sold throughout the Caribbean through subsidiaries.
However, the exposed countries had limited legal recourse to mitigate the financial impacts of
CLICO and BAICO because the existing financial regulations are restricted to each island's
jurisdictions. Moreover, existing legislation does not prevent the occurrence of a similar event in
the future, and significant improvements need to be made to the regulation of insurance
companies, including adding minimum solvency requirements for long term insurance and
increasing minimum capital requirements.

39.    The regional response to CLICO/BAICO is under development. Emergency meetings
involving the ECCB, Central Banks of Trinidad & Tobago and Barbados, and the Monetary
Council of the ECCU convened to discuss how to mitigate and resolve the issue. In July 2009,
the Monetary Council agreed that KPMG, an international advisory services company, will
perform the technical work required to bring a new company to take over the operations of
BAICO. In August 2009, regulators in the ECCU and the Bahamas intervened in the operations
of BAICO and appointed Judicial Managers in all ECCU countries with branches of BAICO
except Dominica. The judicial managers have endorsed the solution put forward by the
governments of the ECCU to establish a new entity to take over BAICO. The Monetary council
also appointed a Ministerial sub-committee on insurance which is supported by a core technical
team to progress with the resolution of BAICO. The core team has met with a potential strategic
investor to discuss participation in the new company. As for CLICO, the Monetary Council has
agreed to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Barbados,
which will outline the commitment of Barbados to the CLICO policyholders.

40.     In 2009, the current account deficit contracted sharply to 26 percent of GDP. In
2008 the current account deficit widened to 39 percent of GDP due to rising fuel and food prices
and declining tourism receipts and exports, which were only partially compensated by increasing
official grants. However, the current account started to narrow in late 2008, reflecting lower
commodity prices and slower economic activity. The contraction was due to a large extent to the
decline in FDI, which halved from its 2008 level and fell to 11 percent of GDP.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

41.     The outlook for Grenadian economy has deteriorated along with the global
economy. The reduced availability of FDI in the near term is likely to continue depressing
activity in the construction sector, which has been a significant driver of growth in recent years.
Tourism arrivals and remittances (the latter comprised 13 percent of GDP in 2008) are also
expected to recover slowly. Consequently, the real GDP is expected to grow by just 0.8 percent
in 2010 (Table 3). Residential, tourism-related, public-sector and private commercial activity are
expected to pick up slowly starting in 2011, with growth reaching 4.0 percent only by 2014. The
main near- and medium-term risks include a deeper and more protracted global slowdown,
increased financial stress and larger retrenchment of capital inflows, and damage from natural
disasters.

42.     Although recent price growth has been negative, inflation is expected to accelerate
to 4.7 percent by the end of 2010 as the recovery in the second half of the year supports pent-up
consumer demand. Onwards, inflation pressures are likely to moderate to 2.0 percent per year.

43.    The current account deficit is expected to remain near its current level in the
medium term. Following the drastic reduction in the current account deficit in 2009, the balance
on the current account is expected to grow in line with nominal GDP, reflecting a moderate
growth in imports due to the slow pace of Grenada's recovery, muted FDI inflows, constrained
reserves, and limited capacity to take on additional debt.

44.    Fiscal balances are expected to strengthen substantially. Due to prudent
macroeconomic management and the recovery of economic activity, the primary deficit
excluding grants is expected to halve from its 2009 value in 2010. With the inclusion of grants--
which are forecasted to remain at their 2009 level in 2010--the primary balance is expected to
reach a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010. Fiscal balances are expected to continue
improving in the medium term, with the overall balance reaching a 1.4 percent of GDP surplus
by 2015.

45.     Although Grenada remains at high risk of debt distress, it could reach the ECCU
target of a 60 percent public debt-to-GDP ratio 2020 if prudent fiscal policy persists.
According to the recent IMF Debt Sustainability analysis, Grenada's public debt could decline to
60.1 percent of GDP by 2020 with sound fiscal management supported by the successor ECF
program. However, this projection is sensitive to any combination of a delay in the global
recovery, a new downturn or natural disaster, or fiscal slippages which prevent a continuation of
strong primary surpluses. As in the earlier DSAs, the baseline is likely to exceed thresholds for
the ratio of the present value (PV) of external debt to GDP, to exports, and the debt service-to-
exports ratio, prompting the continued assessment of high risk of debt distress (Figure 5).
Furthermore, permanently lower GDP growth could put the debt ratios on an explosive path.

46.     A proposed large loan to finance a luxury hotel from the Export-Import Bank of
China in 2010­12 could slow debt reduction in the near term but could also boost growth.
Although the size and terms of the loan have yet to be fully finalized, the IMF debt sustainability
analysis for a loan of US$107 million shows that the PV of the public debt would shift by about
7-10 percent of GDP in 2010-12 but would exhibit a declining path similar to baseline after 2012
(Figure 6). Although the 60 percent of GDP target would not be reached by 2020 as in the
baseline, debt sustainability would not be adversely affected. However, if the project generates
growth spillovers, the target could be reached one year earlier than in the baseline. In order to
maximize the benefits from the project and avoid increasing public debt, the government is
seeking majority private sector participation in the project. The government also agreed with the
IFIs including the IMF and the Bank that if the government were to get involved in the project, it
would be critical to: (i) seek an objective assessment of the economic and financial returns of this
project from an internationally reputed third party; (ii) secure concessional financing; and (iii)
obtain majority private sector participation to ensure that the prospective benefits would more
than offset the associated additional debt servicing burden. The government will also be
consulting with the IFC in this regard.

47.     The government remains committed to reducing debt and has taken steps to
enhance its debt management capacity with support from the Commonwealth Secretariat
and the ECCB. The government is working with the IFIs to develop sound debt management
practices and strong policy actions to fundamentally reduce the debt ratios. A Debt Management
Unit has been established in the Ministry of Finance to improve debt recording, evaluate
proposed external and domestic borrowing, develop a debt management strategy and undertake
debt sustainability analysis. The World Bank has supported these efforts through technical
assistance including a DeMPA study in 2009. Under strong policy actions and commitment to
sound economic policies, the target debt ratio of 60 percent could be achieved even before 2020.

48.     Notwithstanding the significant challenges posed by the global economic crisis, the
macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the purposes of the proposed
Economic and Social Development Policy Loan/Credit. The proposed ES DPL/DPC supports
adequate economic policies to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and to strengthen
the framework for sustainable economic recovery and growth. Bank staff has used projections of
Grenada' macroeconomic outlook to assess the sustainability of its fiscal program, balance of
payments, and associated debt dynamics. Bank staff has also taken into consideration the views
of the IMF and regard the completion in April 2010 of the IMF supported PRGF program--in

                                                               21
place since April 2006--and the approval of the new three-year ECF from the IMF as additional
elements to conclude that Grenada's macroeconomic situation is adequate and that government
policies are likely to be sustainable over the medium term. With the 2010 Budget the government
reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing vulnerabilities in
the financial sector, generating high and sustained growth and reducing poverty. The fiscal
framework for 2010 envisages a significant adjustment: the primary deficit excluding grants is
expected to improve from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.6 percent in 2010. Over the medium
term the government program targets a primary surplus excluding grants in the range of 2-2.5
percent of GDP, which would enable the debt-to-GDP ratio to decline gradually to the target of
60percent by 2020. At the same time the government's fiscal framework allows for spending
aimed at reducing poverty to support the authorities social development agenda. For reducing
vulnerabilities in the financial sector the authorities are continuing their effort to strengthen
nonbank regulation to avoid repeating the experience with the CL Financial Group. The
authorities are committed to continue implementing structural reforms for improving the
business and investment climate in favor of stronger private sector participation. The ES
DPL/DPC financing from the Bank, jointly with resources from the Caribbean Development
Bank and the IMF, will help assure full financing of the budget and external financing needs,
given the current assessment of the situation.

IV.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

49.    In 2006, the authorities launched a comprehensive medium-term economic reform
program, developed in consultation with civil society groups. Its key objectives were to
sharply reduce public debt; to reinvigorate growth through structural reforms; to reduce
vulnerabilities; and to further the nation's social development agenda. This program remains in
place and important achievements have been made under the IMF supported PRGF facility.

50.     The government has recently articulated an updated policy framework to address
the global crisis. Central documents that lay out the Government's program are the 2009 Budget
Speech, The PM Speech at the Townhall Meeting of March 31st 2009, and the IMF PRGF Letter
of Intent for the Third Review.

51.     Grenada's economic strategy is focused on two pillars: (i) coping with external
shocks; and (ii) laying the groundwork for broad-based economic growth. To achieve these
goals the priority areas for the medium-term development will be: implementing policies to
address the impact of the global economic slowdown and financial spillovers; improving public
service delivery and effectiveness while putting public finances and debt on a sustainable
trajectory; creating a business environment conducive to economic growth and private sector
development; reducing vulnerabilities; and alleviating poverty through more effective social
safety nets. 3


3
 The reform policy areas are articulated in more detail in the 2009 Budget Speech of the Government of Grenada:
Strengthening Economic Management; Improving the Business Climate; Fostering a genuine Multipartite
Partnership; Accelerating Tourism Development; Revitalizing Agriculture and Fisheries; Pursuing Energy potential
and Energy Efficiency; Improving access to quality health care; Re-positioning Education and Human Resource
Development; Fast Tracking Youth Empowerment; Tackling Cost of Living.

                                                      22
52.     The annual budget for 2009 presented in December 2008 included preventive
measures to address the impact of the crisis while protecting fiscal sustainability. The
government will undertake targeted spending to mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown
on employment and income of vulnerable groups, with attention to increasing targeting
effectiveness. The authorities will accelerate projects that have the greater economic stimulus
and employment generation potential. Additional measures may include temporary assistance to
the tourism sector, as supported by a recent communiqué of the Organizational of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS) and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Monetary Council.

53.     The government has taken measures during 2008 to maintain a healthy fiscal
position and further consolidate the fiscal adjustment, which should help weathering the
current challenges. After taking office in July 2008, the government made significant fiscal
adjustments by reducing capital expenditures by 3 percentage points of GDP in the second half
of the year. Further efforts were made to lower expenditure arrears from 1.9 percent of GDP at
end-June 2008 to 0.6 percent of GDP by the end of the year. The government took additional
measures in its 2009 budget and targeted 2.6 percentage points reduction in the central
government budget deficit to GDP ratio (reduction in fiscal deficit would be 0.8 percentage
points when grants are included). To achieve this target, the government is maintaining a fuel
tax of EC$3 per gallon and tightening tax enforcement on the revenue side. On the expenditure
side, capital spending was reduced to 8.9 percent of GDP from 10.6 percent. Capital spending,
which accounts for one-third of total spending, has been difficult to control. The government is
also negotiating wage moderation for public sector workers and cutting on waste, with the
support of the new Waste Reduction Unit.

54.     The Government faces increasing pressure to contain the fiscal deficit while
ensuring core public services are delivered. The country's Social Protocol for 2009-2011,
currently under negotiation between representatives of the Government of Grenada, the private
sector, non-governmental organizations and labor unions, outlines the necessity to maintain
fiscal discipline while preserving staffing levels and salaries. This poses a challenge for
Government to make sound policy decisions and balance various interests against competing
pressures. It will be crucial that the Government contains personnel expenditures in the next
years, with achieving a sustainable and predictable wage bill agreed with the unions for the
broader public service.

55.     The Government is moving forward with the strengthening of regulation and
supervision of the nonbanking financial sector, while also working to bring an orderly
resolution to the CLICO/BAICO collapse. The failure of Trinidad and Tobago's CL Financial
Group is increasing financial sector uncertainty, as this group has a number of linkages to the
Grenadian economy, including two insurance subsidiaries (CLICO Barbados and British
American/BAICO) and majority ownership of Republic Bank Limited4. The Grenada Authority
for the Regulation of Financial Institutions (GARFIN) has prohibited these two insurance
subsidiaries from offering deposit-like products with high interest rates. The resolution of the
two companies is currently pending but progress has been made. The ECCU islands are aiming
to create a new company to take over from BAICO and are working with the judicial managers

 There was a mini-run on Republic Bank's Carriacou branch after Trinidad and Tobago announced the intervention
of the CL Financial Group but the situation has stabilized.

                                                     23
towards an orderly resolution. The government of Barbados is trying to facilitate the sale of
CLICO Barbados to a third party. Nonetheless, risks remain as financial stress could further
dampen economic activity in the country and the region, given the presence of financial
conglomerates and complicated ownership structures within the Caribbean.

IMPROVING PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNANCE AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

56.     Grenada has identified improvements in governance and public expenditure
management as critical to ensure better public service delivery and enhanced economic
growth. The Government of Grenada is committed to improve its use of public resources and
increase efficiency in revenue generating institutions. Three main challenges that affect public
sector efficiency and performance in Grenada are: (i) managing a sustainable wage bill with
increased fiscal pressures while ensuring adequate public services coverage and high quality; (ii)
improving the efficiency of revenue generating institutions, such as tax and customs
departments; and (iii) addressing capacity constraints rooted in outdated management practices
that negatively affect public sector performance.

57.     The government program seeks to strengthen revenue generation and to shift the
pattern of incidence. The authorities will be undertaking a comprehensive reform of the
taxation framework over the next two years. This initiative includes: the introduction of the value
added tax (VAT) scheduled for February 2010; introducing a market-based property tax,
improvement in tax administration; and improvement in the predictability and transparency of
tax concessions, including the introduction of a new Investment Code (see below).
Modernization of tax and customs administrations will be a priority for the government in order
to increase overall effectiveness of public resources.

58.     The Government enacted a VAT Act in July 2009 and introduced the VAT on
February 1, 2010, reflecting its strong commitment to reforms. The VAT was introduced
despite strong rallying from the business community and the opposition to delay the introduction
of VAT given the difficult economic environment. Before the introduction of the VAT, the
Government made in advance preparations and used a transition period to allow time for the
business community and the consumers to prepare themselves to the new system. The
recruitment and training of VAT staff began on schedule in May 2009, and transitional
procedures for bonded warehouses were finalized in September 2009. The authorities also
launched a public education program including advisory trips to the business sector. The VAT
was levied at a standard rate of 15 percent, with some exempted or zero rated items, and with
rates for mobile telephone and tourism services at 20 and 10 percent respectively.

59.      The VAT has superseded multiple existing tax instruments, limited exemptions,
broadened the tax base, and is expected to improve the efficiency of tax administration. The
previous indirect taxes in Grenada--consisting of the General Consumption Tax (GCT), the
airline ticket tax, and the motor vehicle purchase tax--were levied at different rates and, without
a facility to allow for credit or refund of taxes paid on inputs, resulted in tax compounding and
cascading. Historically, this led to low compliance and high cost of doing business in a number
of sectors. The new VAT addresses these difficulties while also minimizing the burden on poor
households and small businesses by exempting basic food items, small purchases of water and


                                                24
electricity, and only charging the tax on businesses and activities with turnover above
EC$120,000.

60.     The Government is in process of upgrading the computerized customs management
system. The government is in the process of upgrading from ASYCUDA ++ to ASYCUDA
World. These additional functionalities will increase customs control capabilities (e.g. risk
management), increase accounting, post-clearance audit, statistics and information management
capabilities, and will contribute to more efficient decision-making by customs officials. Further,
Government is committed to improving the organizational aspects of customs, such as
establishing a technical committee to oversee the functional capacities of the institution. The
technical committee will also be the interface with the Inland Revenue Department, and will
ensure that customs officers contribute to the implementation of VAT by facilitating public
education and training on the customs side of VAT.

61.     To improve the effectiveness of debt management, the government has recently
established a Debt Management Unit (DMU) as part of an overall institutional reform of
the MoF. The DMU centralizes back and middle office debt management functions and is
expected to contribute to reduce fragmentation, increase efficiency, and contribute to stronger
public debt management. Other concurrent reforms include strengthening the front office
function. The Government has also completed a DeMPA study with a view to identify the areas
for improvement in debt management and to design an appropriate action plan for reform
implementation.

62.     Improvement of public service efficiency and effectiveness is one of the strategic
priorities. Government actions in this area include short-term and medium-term policy reforms.
In the short-term, the Government has committed itself to negotiate with labor unions and social
partners on maintaining the wage bill under the Social Protocol. The Protocol is expected to
provide strong guidance on salary levels for the next three years, and will also have an objective
of preserving public sector jobs. Further, in the medium term, the Government also plans to
address existing anomalies in the public service's job classification, building on the findings
from a 2008 pay and grading study financed by the Caribbean Development Bank.

63.     The Government is committed to conducting a staffing and expenditure review, also
called an HR audit. The review is proposed to be a policy-oriented analysis of public
expenditures of established positions in the public service, including unestablished5 and
contractual services, and shall cover: (i) the division of labor and responsibilities of the
established, unestablished and contractual positions; (ii) examination of whether the contract
staff perform at a higher level of efficiency in delivery of public services; (iii) analysis of the
number of public sector staff necessary to carry out core service delivery functions; (iv)
recommendations on reforming those policies and institutions for improving the allocation and
use of available public resources; and (v) an action plan for carrying out the recommendations.
The review will also consider the budgetary implications of reducing contractual staff versus

    Unestablished positions are contract based temporary positions without any limit on the years of contract.

                                                           25
increasing the number of established positions. It is envisioned to be first piloted in the health
sector.6

64.      The Government is also aiming at strengthening its core functions. The Cabinet
Office, for example, will be strengthened by a proposed monitoring and evaluation unit, and will
initiate the Management Accountability Framework (MAF) in January, 2010 to be first piloted in
the Ministry of Finance. An integrity unit, created by the Integrity in Public Life Act (2007), is
also proposed to set procedures and guidelines on ethics and conflict of interest activities. The
head of the Integrity Unit has been identified, and an Ombudsman has been appointed. The
Prevention of corruption Act (2007) and the Ombudsman Act (2007) also represent important
steps towards stronger accountability of the public service.

65.     The government has put systems in place to substantially reduce waste and
introduce cost cutting measures in respect of non essential goods and services. The
government has targeted a 10 percent reduction in selected areas such as fuel consumption and
maintenance of government vehicles. The purchase of new vehicles will be guided by function
and fuel economy not personal tastes and preferences; The log books of vehicles will be
inspected regularly by auditors to verify their use on legitimate government business; The
Ministerial Complex will organize a pool of vehicles to minimize the number of vehicles making
trips between the Ministerial Complex, Financial Complex and the Post Office in particular; and
a hotline will be established to which the public can call to lodge complaints about the abuse of
government vehicles and other forms of abuse. The Division of Energy and Sustainable
Development Division in the Ministry of Finance will also undertake energy audits to introduce
low cost and no cost conservation practices.

66.     The government is undertaking a major reform of the Ministry of Finance aimed at
improving the capacity for economic management. In addition to the new Debt Management
Unit and the Waste reduction Unit, the authorities have also created a Division of Economic
Management and Planning to sharpen the analytical underpinnings of the policy framework. The
recently established new Private Sector Development Office has reinvigorated efforts to improve
the business environment. Plans are also underway to create a Public Procurement Authority to
enhance the quality, integrity, and transparency of public procurement.

67.     Recent PFM assessments have concluded that the existing systems largely support
the maintenance of aggregate fiscal discipline and strategic resource allocation, but also
singled out key institutional issues for further attention. Grenada PFM systems were
reviewed in the course of the PEFA assessment (October 2006), and more recently, in the course
of the fiduciary review, focused on the financial management and procurement of the capital
projects (2007-2008).7 Additional interviews with the government were conducted in the
summer of 2009, in the course of the project preparation. The main areas of strength identified

6
  The staffing and expenditure review will build upon previous work conducted by the Government of Grenada, in
particular the report, "A New Shape for the Machinery of Government: Report on the 2005-2006 Functional
Review." The report recommends that the health policy and planning functions be strengthened, as well as the
regularization of the excessive number of Category 340 officers currently in post, and the harmonization of their
terms and conditions of service. It was also recommended that a regular cycle of review be set up so that the
functions, organization and staffing of two or three Ministries are examined each year on a rolling schedule.
7
  Policy Note on Project Fiduciary Management was published as a result of this exercise.

                                                       26
in assessments included credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency of the government's
budget, as well as functioning financial management system. The areas of weaknesses included
public procurement process, compliance with internal controls and follow-up on the findings of
the external auditor.

68.     The government is able to prepare a relatively comprehensive and credible annual,
"line-item" budget, informed by the government's policies. The long-term policies and
priorities of the government are summarized in the National Strategic Development Plan
(prepared in 2007). These policies are supposed to be further explained and costed in the
Medium-Term Economic Strategic Paper (MTESP) and PSIP. There is, however, no up-to-date
MTESP. As part of the strategic planning exercise, some of the key ministries are required to
prepare annual corporate plans. While this requirement is generally followed, there is limited
linkage between the submitted plans, which are used mainly for the information purposes, and
actual budget requests. Notwithstanding certain challenges associated with the long-term
strategic planning and budgeting process, the annual government budgets are relatively
comprehensive and detailed. However, there is an increasing realization on part of the
government that the existing systems may need to be reformed for improving efficiency of the
public sector.

69.      The government recognizes the need for budget reform and plans to introduce a
multi-year perspective into the budgeting process in the medium to long term. It also
intends to review and reform the existing budget structure, gradually adopting some elements of
the program-based budgeting. While at present financial challenges faced by the country do not
allow it to embark on a comprehensive, full-scale budget reform, the government has launched a
number of important initiatives aiming to enhance performance of PFM systems, and help
bringing about envisioned changes.

70.     Along with the other OECS countries, Grenada actively collaborates with
CARTAC, and has benefited from a number of training courses focused on the strategic
budgeting and revenue forecasting. It used acquired knowledge to prepare a three-year (2010-
2012) projection of fiscal aggregates based on the economic classification. While at present these
projections are expected to be used primarily for the information and high-level planning
purposes, this effort may pave a way for the introduction of a multi-year budgeting process.

71.      As part of a broader PFM reform, the new Public Finance Management Act was
passed in 2007. While this document still conforms to most of the existing budgeting processes,
it has introduced a number of changes. Most notably, the new Act capped the amounts of special
warrants and introduced the position of the accounting officer for each expenditure vote and head
of revenue approved by the parliament.8

72.    While the government should be commended for the timeliness in preparation of the
financial statements, problems associated with the efficient and effective cash management

8
  Article 32(b) of the Act states that the aggregate of the amounts authorized by special warrants shall not exceed ten
percent of the annual estimates for the current year. With regards to the accounting officer position, the Act states
that the accounting officer shall be accountable as a public officer to the House of Representatives, through the
Public Accounts Committee for the prompt collection and receipt of revenue and the control of and accurate
accounting for expenditure.

                                                         27
remain to be one of the main challenges.9 The government accounts are prepared using the
automated financial managements system (SMARTSTREAM). The government funds are held
in a number of bank accounts some of which are redundant. In the course of examination, the
Director of Auditor noted the improper accounting of the issued advances, significant differences
between some of the bank balances as per records maintained by the ministries and records kept
by the Accountant General, and non-compliance with the financial rules by imprest holders. To
some extent these challenges are posed by the fact that the SMARTSTREAM system is still not
being used at its full capacity. The situation is further complicated by the absence of clearly
defined underlying business processes and procedures and staff turnover in the department of the
Accountant General.

73.    The Government is aware of these challenges and is aiming at resolving some of the
existing issues during the implementation of the World Bank-financed E-Government
project. Additional assistance related to the business processes reorganization may be received
from the planned CIDA initiative entitled "Supporting Economic Management in the
Caribbean."

74.     The new Audit Act was passed in 2007, granting the Director of Audit right to
conduct special audits (e.g., value for money audit) and to audit statutory bodies.10 It also
established the requirement for the department of the Director of Audit to be audited by the
private sector audit firms appointed by the Parliament.

75.    The Director of Audit complies with the requirements established by the law. The
Director of Audit is now in the process of auditing the government's accounts for 2008. The
audited accounts are expected to be tabled in the Parliament and discussed by the Public
Accounts Committee (PAC), which is chaired by the leader of the opposition. Up until now it
has not been functioning as expected, the backlog of un-reviewed audited accounts dates back to
2000. The current chair of the PAC plans to resolve this issue and a number of meetings with the
Director of Audit were held. Adequate external oversight over the budget execution is critical to
a successful implementation of government policies.

76.    The updated Public Procurement and Contract Administration Act was passed in
2007 to streamline public administration and increase the efficiency of public spending.
Public procurement represents an important share of total government expenditures; accordingly,
the Government has prioritized procurement reform. Some of the most important changes
introduced by the Act include establishment of the Public Procurement Authority, clarification of
the procurement methodology and introduction of the complaints procedures.

77.    The government is working on the implementation of changes recommended by the
Act. The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer is expected to become fully functional in the
next few months. The government uses assistance of the OECD Partnership for Democratic
Governance and the World Bank-financed IDF grant to design and implement a broader
procurement framework including manuals, regulations and training materials. As this work
progresses, it is expected that significant clarifications, further aligning Grenadian legislation

  The latest audited financial statements are dated December 31, 2007; the 2008 accounts are now being audited.
10
   The Director of Audit has the right to delegate this responsibility to the private sector auditors. He is, however,
responsible for collecting the issued audit reports and presenting them to the Parliament.

                                                         28
with the best international practices, may be added to the Procurement Act. The government
also intends to eventually move to the e-procurement, most likely as part of the broader sub-
regional initiative.

IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

78.     The Government of Grenada is trying to mitigate the poverty impact of the global
economic crisis through immediate policy action. In December 2008, the Government
introduced a duty free barrel program at Christmas time, which will continue through December
2009. This essentially lifts the duties imposed on traditional "barrels" of gifts that households
receive from family members living and working abroad. The Government also increased the
benefit amount for cash assistance programs. In addition, Government expanded labor intensive
programs to stimulate the economy and provide income support to vulnerable groups. Those
programs include a de-bushing initiative that employed 1,750 people (as of December, 2008) and
a road maintenance programs that employs 750 people per month (started in March, 2009).

79.    On the 28th of July, 2009 the Cabinet took a decision to set up an Inter-Ministerial
Task Force to review all social safety net programs and develop recommendations for
improving the system. The task force included the Ministries of Social Development,
Education, Health and Finance. Following the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Task
Force, the Government moved two cash assistance programs targeted to students from poor
households to the MOE, which already had responsibility for implementation of fee waivers for
school meals. However, the Public Assistance program, Grenada's other cash transfer program,
remained under the auspices of the Ministry of Social Development.

80.      The Inter-Ministerial Task Force then developed a broader set of policy actions. The
recommendations of the Task Force included: (i) clarification of eligibility criteria for programs
with no room for misinterpretation and manipulation; (ii) periodic appraisal of programs to
facilitate timely improvement; (iii) establishment of a systematic method of communication
between Ministries, NGOs and other agencies to obtain timely crucial information; and (iv)
minimization of duplications leading to provision of similar assistance targeted to possibly the
same clientele in order to prevent abuse by persons who might be aware of what is available and
how to access it. These recommendations are expected to be reflected in the Government's
reform action plan.

81.    A Country Poverty Assessment (CPA) is completed in 2009. The initial draft of the
CPA was shared with the World Bank and it is expected to be publicized in the next months. The
CPA should provide information to help improve targeting of social programs, and develop a
comprehensive poverty reduction strategy that will be reflected in a full Poverty Reduction
Strategy Program (PRSP) report.

82.     In addition to these actions, Grenada, with support from the Bank, UNICEF, and
UNIFEM, completed a social safety net assessment (SSNA) in July 2009. The purpose of the
assessment was to rapidly identify weaknesses in the social safety net (SSN) and offer
recommendations to improve its response to the crisis, as well as to strengthen its overall
effectiveness in the medium- and long-term. The analysis found that Grenada has a number of
social assistance programs but there is considerable scope for strengthening the social safety net.

                                                29
Recommendations to improve the SSN, both its crisis response capacity and overall
effectiveness, include the following:

     Create a strategic framework:
        Formulate a social protection strategy. The government of Grenada does not have yet
        a clearly articulated social protection strategy; the social safety net is comprised of a set
        of uncoordinated programs with no clear articulation of safety net priorities and no clear
        guidelines for fiscal prioritization of programs. This is reflected in the budget process in
        which new programs or increases in existing benefits are announced, but without any
        clear coherence or synergies between programs.
        Incorporate the basic principles of good practice safety nets in order to adequately
        respond to vulnerability. Requirements include:11
            o   Transparency in design and implementation
            o   Explicit and public objectives, eligibility criteria, rules of operation
            o   Stringent reporting and budgeting
            o   Periodic evaluation
            o   Mechanisms for accountability and conflict resolution
            o   Safeguards to prevent moral hazard and dependency
            o   Quick response time and timely benefit disbursements
     Improve effectiveness of the SSN:
        Rationalize and consolidate social safety net programs. There is considerable overlap
        in existing programs and beneficiary groups. The number of programs increases
        administrative costs and means that scarce resources are spread so thinly that programs
        do not have adequate resources to accomplish their objectives. It also means that clients
        can access services at multiple entry points and thus increases possibility for abuse. On
        the other hand, multiple application requirements can increase the stigma and discourage
        needy persons from applying. There is no efficient mechanism to ascertain whether
        households are in receipt of benefits from more than one program. Institutional capacity
        to implement social safety net programs is limited. At the same time, the large number of
        programs, each with its own administrative systems and procedures, strain an already
        overburdened public sector. Consolidation of at least the cash transfer programs should
        immediately improve the SSN's coverage of the poor.
        Improve information systems. Data on social assistance programs and beneficiaries are
        essentially non-existent in Grenada. Accounting systems for key programs need to be
        upgraded. Grenada does not implement program based budgeting and, as a result, it is
        virtually impossible to determine what programs really cost. The Director of Audit audits
        selected safety net programs annually, including Public Assistance, student transportation
        program, burial assistance and water initiatives. However, the multiplicity of payment
        mechanisms and lack of automated financial management systems, make virtually
        impossible to maintain adequate controls over the system.
        Establish and document accountability and control mechanisms. There is no system
        for complaints and appeals to the SSN system. Policies and procedures are typically not

       articulated in operational manuals, and as a result program implementation is subject to
       wide discretion. Social safety net programs are vulnerable to political interference in
       large part because they lack such documentation, as well as the information systems
       described above.
   Improve equity and coherence of safety net programs
       Target key groups and establish appropriate benefit levels. Coverage and level of
       cash benefits are inconsistent between major programs. The Public Assistance Program
       serves a greater number of persons than targeted student assistance programs, despite the
       fact that there are more children than senior citizens in Grenada. Moreover, the social
       assistance budgetary allocation for children is significantly less than for the elderly.
       Many programs lack an objective targeting mechanism, and as a result, beneficiary
       selection, as noted earlier, is subject to the discretion of public employees, resulting in
       errors of inclusion and exclusion.
83.     The government also provides a sizeable and increasing subsidy for school meals.
Primary students (who represent the vast majority of program beneficiaries) pay $1.00, or about
20% of actual costs. The fee for primary students has not been increased since 2001. This
means that the contribution by students has declined in real terms by 20% since 2001, and
represents a significant subsidy for non-poor students. Reducing general subsidies and refraining
from ad hoc duty waivers (which tend to benefit the wealthy more than the poor) and reallocation
of these resources to targeted programs should also be considered.

PROMOTING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY AND IMPROVING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

84.     In the Financial Sector, Grenada is undertaking proactive steps to provide a
resolution for BAICO activities in the country. To combat further contagion in the sector,
ECCB authorities issued a notice of intervention that was effective on June 29, 2009 to BAICO.
This measure was taken in order to deter any further business activities as well as to act as a
protective mechanism on behalf of its current policyholders.

85.     A Judicial Manager was appointed on August 4, 2009. The Grenada High Court
ordered the appointment of Mr. Reuben M. John of KPMG Eastern Caribbean as Judicial
Manager of the branch of British American Insurance Company in Grenada. The Order followed
a Petition to the Court by the Grenada Authority for the Regulation of Financial Institutions
(GARFIN). The Judicial Manager has the mandate to conduct a thorough financial investigation
into the assets and liabilities of BAICO. In July 2009, the ECCU member countries decided to
establish a new company to take over certain portfolios from BAICO. KPMG was hired to
clarify the financial position of BAICO, prepare a feasibility study on the establishment of the
company and execute the strategy. The judicial managers have endorsed the solution put forward
by the governments of the ECCU to establish a new entity to take over BAICO. The Monetary
council also appointed a Ministerial sub-committee on insurance which is supported by a core
technical team to progress with the resolution of BAICO. The core team has met with a potential
strategic investor discuss participation in the new company.

86.    Grenada is actively participating in the regional efforts to develop a broader,
region-wide solution to the financial activities of CL Financial Group. A Ministerial Sub-
Committee on Insurance has been appointed to provide oversight on the resolution of the

                                               31
CLICO/BAICO matter. Minister Nazim Burke of Grenada is part of that committee, which is
working closely with the Regulators in each country.

87.      The government strengthened regulation of the insurance sector with the enactment
of the new Insurance Act. GARFIN, the Regulatory Agency for non-banking financial
institutions, is driving an effort, in conjunction with the other ECCU countries, to modernize
regulatory legislation which in many cases is decades old. These reforms entail new legislation
in the areas of insurance, money services businesses and cooperatives, with the goal of
increasing compliance by strengthening sanctions against non-compliant institutions, promoting
proper licensing of all supervised entities and increased reporting of financial data. In this
context, the Government prepared a new Insurance Act with the help of ECCB and the World
Bank. The new Insurance Act was made effective on March 26, 2010.

88.     The Government is revising and updating the Investment Code and modernizing
investment promotion activities. An Investment Planning and Policy Review Committee
advised the authorities in the draft of an Investment Promotion Act, which was passed in the
House of Representatives on July 14th 2009 and gazetted on August 14, 2009. This Act seeks to:
provide an efficient and transparent system for the granting of investment incentives and
registering investors; enhance and modernize the legal framework for investment; and promote
the development of international best practices regarding investments. The Act will be
reinforced by 3 pieces of legislation, which will constitute amendments to Grenada's tax laws: (i)
Income Tax Act; (ii) Property Transfer Tax Act; and (iii) Customs Act. The Government is
currently working on drafting these three pieces of legislation. Moreover, the government is also
committed to modernizing its investment promotion activities, including the preparation and
implementation of an Investment Promotion Strategy for Grenada, establishment of an
Investment Facilitation Network, development and installation of integrated IT system to
improve the processing of investment applications, and finally institutional strengthening of the
Inland Revenue Department and the Grenada Customs Department to enhance their abilities to
process investment allowances.

89.     An important reform carried out by the Government has been the creation of
separate company and intellectual property and deeds and land registries. Both registries
were housed in the Registrar of the High Court. The Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property
Act and the Deeds and Lands Registry (Amendment) Act were both passed in the House of
Representatives on July 14, 2009. The separation of Registries results in an increase in the
numbers employed in these departments by 14. This includes the two Registrars and their
deputies, as well as an additional 5 persons in each department to fill varying administrative
roles. It is expected that the creation of these two registries will expedite the process of
registering companies and land in Grenada. Work is also being done to introduce electronic
registration which will allow for improved entering, updating, retrieving and closing of business
records.

90.     The recently established Office for Private Sector Development has the mandate to
work with the private sector to improve the business environment. This office is the focal
point in Grenada for Doing Business reforms, and for engagement between the government and
the private sector, as well as to engage in a dialogue with the wider society. The Office is
developing an Action Plan for Doing Business reforms with emphasis on reducing the cost in

                                               32
trading across borders. A Competitiveness Review and Benchmarking Study for Grenada is
underway, with funding from USAID and local management based in GIDC.

91.     The government program seeks to create a new environment for Small Business
Development. The authorities plan to transform a policy statement document prepared in 2009,
into a Small Business Development Act. A Small Business Development Centre has been
established within the GIDC to serve as the main focal point in entrepreneurial training and
provision of information and business services in general. The center is charged with enhanced
assistance to SMEs on issues such as product development, marketing, costing and pricing,
productivity and financial tools.

92.     The Government program foresees continuing with export facilitation efforts. A
National Export Strategy was prepared in 2006, and among its main recommendations was the
creation of a National Export Council to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the
export strategy. The government is now drafting legislation to create such a Council. The
implementation of this National Export Strategy will also include the establishment of a trade
information network to provide timely and relevant information on trade opportunities and
markets for Grenadian firms interested in exporting. The Bureau of Standards is being
strengthened by building capacity in certification and testing.

 V.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO THE CAS

93.     The RPS FY2010-14 for the OECS and the World Bank, scheduled to be discussed
by the Board on June 3 2010, supports Grenada's development agenda through two main
pillars: (i) building resilience; and (ii) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating
sustainable growth. The OECS governments have identified these two areas as the main
challenges which are impacting or likely to have an impact on Grenada's development agenda in
the short, medium and long term. The selected pillars were also determined taking into account
the crippling effects of the crises and the need for urgent remedial measures as well as the areas
of focus of other development partners throughout the period of the RPS. In this context, the RPS
FY10-14 will contribute to achieving improved fiscal and debt sustainability, increasing
efficiency and transparency of public spending and service delivery, sustaining macroeconomic
and financial stability, strengthening policy coordination and economic management,
rationalizing social safety net programs and improving the targeting system. These achievements
will be critical in strengthening the ability of Grenada to respond to exogenous shocks and laying
the foundation for growth in the medium term.

94.     The focus of the proposed ES DPL/DPC is fully consistent with the objectives of
Bank engagement under the RPS FY10-14. The proposed ES DPL/DPC is aligned with the
two main pillars of the RPS as outlined above. Specifically, the proposed ES DPL/DPC supports
reforms actions to maintain an enabling macroeconomic framework, improve governance and
public expenditure management, strengthen social safety nets, improve competitiveness and
financial sector stability, and reinforce policy coordination and economic management. The
proposed ES DPL/DPC also aims to create a policy platform for medium-term reforms which
could be supported by the Bank or other donors in the future. Finally, the proposed ES DPL/DPC

                                               33
contributes to the government's objectives as set forth in the 2010 Budget Speech presented by
the Honourable V. Nazim Burke, Minister of Finance to the House of Representatives on January
15,2010.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

95.     The OECS is well served by bilateral and multilateral agencies. Main multilateral
donors include the IMF, Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) which in addition to its own
resources onlends IDB funds, EU, OAS, PAHO, and the UN. The main bilateral donors are
CIDA, DFID, USAID, China, Japan, Kuwait, France, Taiwan, China, and Venezuela. The
Bank's contribution is relatively small at around 10 percent of total reported disbursements.
Together with the EU, CIDA, DFID, USAID, PAHO, and the CDB, the Bank is an active
participant in the Eastern Caribbean Donor Group, which aims to improve donor coordination.

96.     The context of the ES DPLIDPC is aligned with the programs of the active donors in
the region in order to provide complementary support to ongoing reforms. The Bank and
the government are keen on donor coordination and are aware of the importance of creating
synergies for reforms. This is also important for efficient use of institutional capacity as such
capacities are limited in small island economies.

97.      The IMF, the EU, CIDA, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the CDB have been
most active in the areas of the Government's program supported by the ES DPLIDPC. 12
The Bank and the IMF have been collaborating closely in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
(ECCU) on financial sector monitoring, medium-term structural reform agenda, and provision of
technical assistance on macroeconomic management. In areas such as improving ECCU capacity
to manage debt, consultations with the government are conducted on a trilateral basis. Both the
Bank and the IMF provided technical assistance to the ECCB to determine effective responses to
the near 'collapse of BAICO and CLlCO, two distressed life insurers in ECCU. The European
Union has been the largest donor to the OECS. The EU programs focus on regional integration,
increasing agricultural competitiveness and promoting diversification, and supporting banana
exports. Within the last 5 years, the EU has 'funded investment promotion and business
facilitation, small and medium enterprise development, and trade facilitation and macroeconomic
reform. The Caribbean Development Bank is the second largest donor to the OECS, and Grenada
accounts for 16.5 percent of total resources allocated to the sub-region. The main focus of the
CDB portfolio is the development of physical infrastructure, but grants have also been provided
for institutional strengthening at the Ministry of Communications and improving private sector
capabilities. CIDA has focused its efforts to improve capacity in four sectors: trade and private
sector development, public sector strengthening, governance, and environmental management.
The recently initiated Eastern Caribbean Economic Management Program focuses on supporting
macroeconomic governance and fiscal reform, and a new initiative on improved public revenue
collection and management (taxation and customs) and budget preparation and execution (public
expenditure management) is in planning. CIDA is also contributing to the implementation of a
Management Accountability Framework (MAF) at the Ministry of Finance in 2010.



12 The Com Sec has been involved in the reform of the public service through technical assistance, the specific
information on the amount and type of intervention has been requested from the government.

                                                      34
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

98.     The proposed ES DPL/DPC is well linked with many other investment projects:
Grenada Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit aims to improve service
delivery in Executive Agencies, introduce modern human resource management principles, and
strengthen the enabling environment for small and micro businesses. Grenada Technical
Assistance Credit aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Customs and tax
administration and modernize investment promotion. OECS (Grenada) Skills for Inclusive
Growth supports the Government's efforts to increase the employability of youth through
public/private sector partnerships for technical and life skills training. E-Government for
Regional Integration Project promotes the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public
services through the delivery of regionally integrated e-government applications.

99.     The existing grant and technical assistance programs also support the
implementation of the policy reforms envisaged by the ES DPL/DPC program. IDF Grant
on Strengthening of Institutional Capacity for Project Implementation supports the Governments'
efforts to develop and sustain the institutional capacity in financial management, procurement
and project management. A second IDF Grant on Strengthening Personnel Expenditures
Management aims to build capacity at the Department of Public Administration (DPA) and the
Cabinet Office by assisting the government in: (i) conducting a human resource staffing and
expenditure review to determine the right staffing of public sector agencies based on services
delivered to citizens and preparing an action plan to implement these recommendations; and (ii)
enhancing the efficiency of public expenditures by designing and implementing a program
monitoring and evaluation sub-unit. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the OECS
governments through its Non-Lending Technical Assistance program for improving social safety
nets.

LESSONS LEARNED

100. The design of the proposed ES DPL/DPC has benefitted from the lessons learned
from the previous Bank operations in Grenada. The Bank has been active in Grenada since
1985 and since then the operations have spanned the following sectors: agriculture; disaster
management; education; climate change and environment; health and the public sector. Since
the start of Bank engagement in Grenada, portfolio performance has generally been satisfactory.
Major operation reviews include the project specific evaluations of operations in the Grenada
portfolio, evaluations of portfolio performance of the sub-region as a whole, the OECS Country
Program Quality Enhancement Review completed by the Banks' Quality Assurance Group
(December 2004) and CAS Completion Report annexed to the OECS CAS FY06-FY09 (Report
No. 33118-LAC), discussed by the Board on September 13, 2005.

101. The OECS CAS Completion Report recognizes that while the Bank's technical
expertise in project design has made a significant contribution to the sub-region's
development, project implementation has not always gone smoothly. Overly complex project
designs have led to lengthy delays in effectiveness and a sense that the project timetable was
more Bank-driven than client-led. So, greater attention to client preparedness has been a
significant factor during preparation of this operation.


                                              35
102. The CAS Completion Report also highlights that the Bank's lending has had the
greatest impact in two areas that are key in the proposed ES DPL/DPC: (i) interventions for
policy reform, such as the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority project to restore
fiscal balance, encourage growth, and dismantle a crippling telecommunications monopoly while
establishing a regulatory framework; and (ii) interventions which responded to unforeseen crises,
such as the post 9-11 Emergency Recovery Loans and the Hurricane Ivan contingency facility.
The Bank's work in such situations has been broadly recognized as demonstrating the Bank's
ability to bring its global knowledge and to work flexibly and swiftly with both clients and
donors. The ES DPL/DPC instrument by its nature focuses on policy reform and this proposed
operation has been designed to mitigate the significant negative impact of the global economic
and financial crisis.

103. The best results were achieved when Bank staff worked closely with country
counterparts during design and implementation and exploited synergies between analytical
work and operation design. The preparation of this operation has entailed consultations with a
broad cross section of civil servants and a number of private sector representatives. It is
grounded in analytical work on the Caribbean, the OECS, and Grenada specifically (see the
section below). Further, as noted in the preceding section, there are a number of active
investment loans and trust funds that target areas within the scope of the proposed operation and
the team has obtained additional grants to support critical institutional development activities to
ensure the success of this operation.

104. The proposed ES DPL/DPC includes only critical actions needed for the
achievement of development objectives, consistent with the 2005 Review of World Bank
Conditionality which indicates that disbursement conditions should be few and focused on
actions critical for achieving the results sought under a program.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

evidence. Selected findings from the relevant analytical studies--organized by ES DPL/DPC

      Grenada    Social    Safety   Net Consolidate and strengthen public cash-
      Assessment (July 2009)            transfer programs. Grenada would benefit from
                                        merging cash transfer programs into one unified
                                        cash transfer program and making this cash
                                        transfer more child and gender sensitive. To
                                        implement the cash transfer program, Grenada
                                        should consider establishing a cash grant unit.
                                           Introduce an objective and transparent
                                           targeting mechanism. Existing targeting
                                           systems absorb considerable staff resources and
                                           beneficiary selection is subject to political
                                           influence. Alternative targeting mechanisms,
                                           such as proxy means, should be considered.
                                           Establish a Central Beneficiary Registry,
                                           which would provide important monitoring and
                                           planning information and could help to reduce

VI.    THE PROPOSED OPERATION

106. The ES DPL/DPC supports policies and reforms for improving macroeconomic
and social conditions in Grenada. The overall goal of the program is to help the country
manage the global crisis, while accelerating the structural transformation of the economy to
improve public service delivery, enhance the country's competitive position and better
manage the inherent vulnerability of a small and open economy. It is organized around four
pillars, consistent with the Government Program as outlined in the previous section.
Consequently, the program supports core measures to help (i) improve public sector
governance and economic management; (ii) strengthen social safety nets; and (iii) promote
financial sector stability and improve business environment.

107. The development objectives of the proposed ES DPL/DPC are fully consistent
with the government strategy. The government's current program aims at promoting
sustained high economic growth, restoring fiscal and debt sustainability, reducing vulnerabilities,
alleviating poverty and advancing the nation's social development agenda. The reform policies
supported under this ES DPL/DPC are selective critical policy actions that contribute to the
achievement of longer term development objectives.



                                                39
108. Accordingly, the ES DPL/DPC supports important initial implementation
achievements within the government's program. All actions supported by the ES
DPL/DPC are included in Grenada's broader economic policy and reform program. The
following are the core policy actions supported by the loan/credit (Box 3). All of them have
been successfully met before the presentation of this loan/credit to the Board. The ES
DPL/DPC program also recognizes many other government reforms which constitute
milestones for the reform implementations and are not bolded in the program matrix.

                                  Box 3: Core Policy Actions
        Component I. Improving Public Sector Governance and Economic Management
    The Borrower: (i) through its Parliament, has enacted the Value Added Tax Act, and said
   Act is in full force and effect; (ii) has made the VAT Unit functional with adequate staffing
   and resources; and (iii) has issued the regulations to the Value Added Tax Act.
    The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance, has: (i) restructured said Ministry's
   Department of Economic Affairs and created, as a result of said restructuring the Economic
   Management and Planning Division, which structure includes: (a) a budget unit; (b) a macro
   policy unit; and (c) a debt management unit, to sharpen analytical underpinnings of policy
   framework and to improve economic management as part of the institutional reform of said
   Ministry; and (ii) allocated in the Borrower's annual budgets for FY 2009 and FY 2010
   adequate financial resources to support the function of said Division.
    The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance, has: (i) established a waste reduction unit
   to improve efficiency and introduce cost cutting measures with respect to regular monitoring
   of use of fuel consumption, and government vehicles and other potential sources of waste; and
   (ii) allocated in the Borrower's annual budget FY 2010 adequate financial resources to
   support the function of the said unit.

          Component II. Improving Effectiveness and Efficiency of Social Safety Nets
    The Borrower has: (i) completed a Social Safety Net Assessment; and (ii) conducted
   subsequent stakeholder consultations on the results of said assessment.
    The Borrower has established a social safety net committee to spearhead reform efforts of
   its Social Safety Net System.

   Component III. Promoting Financial Sector Stability and Improving Business Environment
    The Borrower, through its High Court, has appointed a judicial manager to perform a
   review of BAICO within the Borrower's territory, with a view to recommending an orderly
   resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.
    The Borrower, through its Parliament, has enacted the Insurance Act, and said Act is in
   full force and effect.
       The Borrower, through its Parliament, has enacted the Investment Promotion Act.
    The Borrower has: (i) amended the Deeds and Land Registry Act (CAP 79) through the
   enactment of the Deeds and Land Registry (Amendment) Act No. 21 of 2009; and (ii) enacted
   the Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Act No. 21 of 2009, to establish a separate
   deeds and land registry, and a separate corporate affairs and intellectual property office,
   respectively from the office of the Registrar of the High Court.


                                               40
109. The ES DPL/DPC contributes to Grenada's longer term development objectives
in four main ways. First, support to Government's budget and external financing needs is
critical for maintaining macroeconomic stability under the heavy turmoil of the global
economic crisis and keeping the Government's program intact for a quicker recovery. A
satisfactory macroeconomic framework, especially one financed on concessional terms, is
fundamental not only to support the flow economic activity, but to lower gradually the ratio
of the public debt to GDP towards the regionally mandated target of 60 percent. In addition,
the operation's support of a swift but fiscally prudent resolution of the CLICO/BAICO
collapse will help to limit the impacts of these events. Better regulation of the banking and
insurance sectors also supports a sounder financial sector, enabling the country to better
manage the contagion risks associated with both the current and future crisis. The ES
DPL/DPC supported the preparation and submission to Parliament of a new Insurance Act
that aims at strengthening the regulatory environment for the insurance business in Grenada.

110. Second, given the volatility of growth and the recent slowdown in economic
activity, the ES DPL/DPC supports the government's efforts to promote investment.
Improvements in business environment contribute to promoting domestic and foreign
investment--which is most needed for accelerated growth and increased diversification of
economic activity. Specifically, the ES DPL/DPC supports the preparation and approval of a
new Investment Promotion Law that would increase Grenada's attractiveness in all sectors.
The ES DPL/DPC also supports the creation of self-standing company and land registries in
order to facilitate business creation and land registration. In addition, customs
modernization, including the introduction of ASYCUDA-World, will contribute to improve
the business environment through trade facilitation, an area where Grenada is lagging. The
actions supported by the ES DPL/DPC are part of the broader effort undertaken by the
authorities to open new areas of opportunities, including for small and medium firms, and to
enable the country to compete with the forthcoming Caribbean Single Market Economy.

111. Third, the government of Grenada faces difficult choices in the management of
its public sector. The drop in public revenues and the pressure to maintain or even increase
expenditures are forcing expansion of the fiscal deficit, in a situation where the public debt
to GDP ratio exceeds 100 percent. Moreover, the government has limited fiscal space given
that the wage bill and the service of the debt take a large share of current expenditures. The
ES DPL/DPC accompanies the government in the short-term handling of this situation as
well as in introducing the necessary structural reforms to decrease the fiscal risks and
improve the efficiency of the public expenditure over the medium to long-term. Specifically,
the ES DPL/DPC supports focus on debt management first through creation of a Debt
Management Unit and then through implementation of the recommendations of the DEMPA
study that was conducted in June 2009. To increase tax revenues by simplifying taxes,
broadening tax base and improving tax compliance, the ES DPL/DPC supports the
government's efforts for introducing a VAT that replaced many fragmented taxes. To
control expenditures and open space for emergency needs arising from the crisis, the ES
DPL/DPC supports implementation of a fiscally responsible wage bill. To begin civil
service reform proper, the ES DPL/DPC program covers a Human Resources staffing and
expenditure review, followed by an updating of the job classification and a decision on a
civil service reform strategy. Improvements in governance and public sector service delivery


                                             41
contribute to reinforcing fiscal and debt sustainability and laying the ground for enhanced
competitiveness and growth.

112. Lastly, the government is responding the crisis by extending assistance for the
poor and less fortunate as well by prioritizing capital expenditures with the highest
potential employment impact. Increased short term public assistance contributes to
lessening the impact of the crisis on the poor and preventing a potential rise in poverty as a
significant portion of Grenada's population is vulnerable to fall in poverty if a shock were to
occur. The ES DPL/DPC also supports government's efforts to improve the efficacy of
social assistance, through program integration and better targeting. A new social safety net
is expected to be designed and implemented as a result of the government reforms in this
area.

                          Box 4: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
   Principle 1: Ownership: The government's program is described in a number of separate
   but consistent documents. In particular, the PRGF program supported by the IMF, the
   2009 Budget Speech delivered in December 2008 and the Townhall Meeting Speech
   delivered in end-March 2009 are the key government policy documents. The new RPS for
   the OECS, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3 2010, is aligned directly by
   the development challenges in the OECS including Grenada and it aims at contributing to
   two main development pillars: (i) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; (ii)
   reducing vulnerability and promoting social inclusion. The Bank has supported the
   program through analytic work in the area of public expenditure, economic management,
   poverty and social protection. The loan recognizes implementation of actions already
   completed by the authorities.

   Principle 2: Harmonization: The program document defines the actions agreed with the
   government and summarizes expected outcomes in a program matrix. The program matrix
   has been harmonized with the IMF, CDB and EU which also support policy actions in key
   program areas; such as macroeconomic stability, public sector and debt management, and
   social assistance reforms.

   Principle 3: Customization: The program document supports a substantial portion of the
   authorities' development strategy in the areas of efficient provision of high quality public
   services, enhancement of business environment and financial sector and improvement of
   efficiency and effectiveness of social safety nets. The ES DPL/DPC has been designed
   around four program areas critical to achieving the objectives of the government's
   program. These program areas are (i) sustaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) improving
   public sector governance and economic management; (iii) improving effectiveness and
   efficiency of social safety nets; and (iv) improving business environment and financial
   sector.




                                               42
   Principle 4: Criticality: The program matrix contains only 9 prior actions considered to
   be the most critical policies to achieve the program's objectives. The loan contains no
   further benchmarks.

   Principle 5: Transparency and Predictability: The program matrix clearly states
   expected outcomes and indicators in a transparent manner. Progress towards meeting the
   long term goals of the program will be monitored under the RPS FY2010-14 for the
   OECS.


113.    Under the RPS FY2010-14, scheduled to be discussed by the Board on June 3 2010,
the Bank will remain engaged as the government implements its medium term strategy. It
is envisioned that further progress towards improved economic and social conditions in Grenada
will be a key theme of the RPS. Accordingly, it is expected that future Bank support will focus
on maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic framework and reform agenda that will
include improved fiscal and debt sustainability, public sector modernization, effective debt
management, improved business environment and investment climate, and effective targeting
and increased efficiency of social safety net programs.

COMPONENT 1: IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR EFFICIENCY

114. The proposed ES DPL/DPC seeks to help the government (i) exercise a sound fiscal
policy; and (ii) set the basis of a more efficient public sector. The government is taking
important steps to improve revenue collection by replacing the current indirect tax system with
the VAT introduced in February 2010. Although designed to be revenue neutral, the VAT will be
broader and more efficient than the current system, helping to stabilize and increase government
revenue. The government is also taking major steps for improving debt management, which
include the establishment of the Debt Management Unit in January 2009 and strengthening the
front office debt management function. The new unit is expected to improve the quality of debt
management and capacity to critically assess borrowing proposals and associated risks. The
establishment of the DMU addresses one of the weaknesses in debt management identified in the
recently completed DeMPA study, and the government is committed to undertaking further
reform to address other deficiencies. The government has also established a Waste Reduction
Unit to curb wasteful spending and a Division of Economic Management and Planning to
sharpen the analytical underpinnings of the policy framework. Finally, the government is
committed to prudent fiscal policy and considers wage moderation as an important step for
keeping the wage bill sustainable and conducive to stable macroeconomic environment. To this
end, the government has confirmed through a Cabinet Decision that a staffing and expenditure
review for analyzing the public employment in established, unestablished and contractual
positions and assessing the number of public sector staff necessary to carry out core service
delivery functions with the ultimate objective of improving service delivery and the allocation
and use of available public resources. The reform of the public administration and the civil
service requires a long term effort. This ES DPL/DPC focuses on the early steps of this process.
The prior actions under this component are the following (core actions in bold):



                                              43
 a) The Borrower: (i) through its Parliament, has enacted the Value Added Tax Act,
    and said Act is in full force and effect; (ii) has made the VAT Unit functional with
    adequate staffing and resources; and (iii) has issued the regulations to the Value
    Added Tax Act.
 b) Cabinet Decision has been made to initiate a staffing and expenditure review (HR
    Audit), under TORs satisfactory to the World Bank.
 c) Head of Integrity Unit has been appointed and office space allocated for the Integrity
    Unit. Ombudsman appointed.
 d) The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance, has: (i) restructured said

    unit, to sharpen analytical underpinnings of policy framework and to improve
    economic management as part of the institutional reform of said Ministry; and (ii)
    allocated in the Borrower's annual budgets for FY 2009 and FY 2010 adequate
    financial resources to support the function of said Division.
 e) The Borrower, through its Ministry of Finance, has: (i) established a waste
    reduction unit to improve efficiency and introduce cost cutting measures with
    respect to regular monitoring of use of fuel consumption, and government vehicles
    and other potential sources of waste; and (ii) allocated in the Borrower's annual
    budget FY 2010 adequate financial resources to support the function of the said
    unit.

COMPONENT 2: IMPROVING SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

115. The prior actions supported under this component are based on the results of the
Grenada Social Safety Nets Assessment and on the best practices in the Caribbean region.
The carrying out of a SSNA, the building of a constituency to promote and guide reform, and the
agreement on initial actions to start the process, have proven highly successful in Jamaica's
reform process. More concrete actions (establishment of management information systems,
creation of central beneficiary registries, etc.) are appropriate only after there is an assessment of
gaps in the system, a clear understanding of the need to fill those gaps and to strengthen existing
programs, and ownership of the actions needed to undertake reform.

116. The proposed ES DPL/DPC will improve the social safety nets' response capacity in
times of crisis and strengthen the outcomes of social assistance programs over the longer
term. Specifically, the ES DPL/DPC would support Government efforts to improve the social
safety nets through consolidation of the three cash transfers programs in the country, which are
key social safety net interventions. In the medium-term, the social safety nets actions supported
under this ES DPL/DPC are expected to contribute to the creation of a safety net system with
clearly defined selection criteria for beneficiaries and effective functional targeting mechanisms.
In coordination with the implementation of the ES DPL/DPC, the Bank is providing Non-lending
Technical Assistance (NLTA) to the Government of Grenada and other OECS countries in social
safety net reform.




                                                 44
117. The prior actions in this ES DPL/DPC represent critical first steps for reforming the
social safety nets in Grenada. The prior actions under this component are the following (core
actions in bold):

 a) The Borrower has: (i) completed a Social Safety Net Assessment; and (ii)
    conducted subsequent stakeholder consultations on the results of said assessment.
 b) The government has elaborated an Action Plan for Reform, including the consolidation
    of the cash transfer system and the establishment of a cash grant unit.
 c) The Borrower has established a social safety net committee to spearhead reform
    efforts of its Social Safety Net System.
 d) Within a tighter budget envelope, the government has selected a list of priority projects
    taking into account employment generation potential and geographic distribution in
    order to provide the greatest economic stimulus and mitigate the impact of the crisis on
    the poorest and most vulnerable.

              Box 5: Jamaica's Social Safety Net Reform Process: Lessons Learned

   The actions described under the Improving Social Safety Nets Component are similar to the steps
   followed by Jamaica in its social safety net reform process. In 2000, Jamaica began
   implementation of reforms recommended in a Social Safety Net Assessment. A steering
   committee of key stakeholders has guided the reform since its planning stage and, in 2009,
   continues to provide oversight of the social protection reform agenda. Following presentation of
   the SSNA, the steering committee elaborated an action plan for social protection reform.

   The agenda included merging existing cash transfer programs into a new conditional cash transfer
   program, introduction of objective and transparent targeting mechanism (a proxy means test) and
   capacity building with respect to information management and accountability and control. The
   agenda also included upgrading of the school feeding program, support for early childhood
   interventions for vulnerable children, and other activities.
   This action plan was approved by Cabinet and the Government signed a Letter of Policy
   Intent addressed to the President of the IDB (which partnered with the World Bank and
   provided grant financing for the completion of studies and development of the proxy
   means test). Jamaica and the World Bank are now partnering on a second social
   protection project, which includes further strengthening of the conditional cash transfer
   through introduction of differentiated benefits, piloting of welfare to work initiatives, and
   support to strengthen civil service pension administration. Jamaica's social safety net
   reform process has become a model for other countries.



COMPONENT 3: PROMOTING FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY AND IMPROVING BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT

118. Support under this component helps to (i) provide a fiscally prudent resolution to
the BAICO collapse, while at the same time establishing a sounder regulatory environment
for the insurance sector; (ii) put in place a transparent set of rules for new investments that
provide a level playing field; and (iii) create separate registries for companies and
property. The new rules for investment are complementary with other actions, such as the

                                                 45
introduction of the VAT, which shift the burden of taxation towards consumption. Ease in
creation and registration of new enterprises is complementary to customs reforms and trade
facilitation. These actions are also complementary with other efforts of the government to
facilitate the creation of new firms, develop valuate chains and improve standards. Consistent
with these objectives, the ES DPL/DPC prior actions under this component are the following
(core actions in bold):

  a) The Borrower, through its High Court, has appointed a judicial manager to
     perform a review of BAICO within the Borrower's territory, with a view to
     recommending an orderly resolution in connection with the insolvency of BAICO.
  b) The Borrower, through its Parliament, has enacted the Insurance Act, and said
     Act is in full force and effect.
  c) The Borrower, through its Parliament, has enacted the Investment Promotion Act.
  d) The Borrower has: (i) amended the Deeds and Land Registry Act (CAP 79)
     through the enactment of the Deeds and Land Registry (Amendment) Act No. 21
     of 2009; and (ii) enacted the Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Act No.
     21 of 2009, to establish a separate deeds and land registry, and a separate
     corporate affairs and intellectual property office, respectively from the office of
     the Registrar of the High Court.


VII.   OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

119. The prior actions and government policies supported under this ES DPL/DPC are
expected to have positive distributional impacts. The measures supported under the
governance and public sector efficiency component are expected to enhance macro stability,
lower inflation, reduce the debt burden, improve prioritization and efficiency of public
expenditures, and enhance the efficiency and fairness of the tax system. In doing so, they will
expand the envelope for available social spending and allow the government to deliver more and
better services to the vulnerable groups, while minimizing macroeconomic volatility and
inflation which affect the poor disproportionately. The measures supported under financial sector
stability and business environment component are likely to attract more domestic and foreign
investment--which would benefit growth and employment and therefore contribute to poverty
reduction--and mitigate the adverse effects of the BAICO/CLICO collapse, therefore
minimizing the impacts on small investors who would otherwise be the most vulnerable.

120. The introduction of the VAT on February 1, 2010, is expected to increase public
revenues while reducing the tax burden of the poor. The VAT has eliminated tax cascading
which disproportionately affected small businesses under the previous GCT. The VAT is also
assessed at a lower rate than the GCT, which benefits the poor more because the poor people
consume a larger portion of their income. In addition, the VAT includes a number of poverty-
relevant exemptions, such as flour, sugar, rice, milk, and infant preparations. The VAT also
exempts--up to a certain usage threshold--water supplied to residences or for agricultural uses
and electricity for residential use. This policy ensures that needy families and farmers have
cheaper access to water and electricity services, while at the same time taxing large users.

                                               46
121.     The reform of the social safety nets supported under this ES DPL/DPC is expected
to benefit the poor by increasing the efficiency and targeting of social spending. While
comprehensive reform will take time, the completion of the SSNA and the priorities identified
therein will improve the quantity and quality of the overall assistance the poor and vulnerable
receive. The first actions agreed upon during the consultation process--and supported under this
ES DPL/DPC--are expected to have an immediate and substantial positive effects on the poor:
consolidation and rationalization of cash transfer programs should enable Government to use
scarce resources more effectively, and the establishment of a cash grant unit will streamline
payment systems and improve the efficiency of these programs. Other recommendations in the
SSNA, which will follow later, will continue having positive impacts: transparent targeting
mechanisms will ensure that the poor are more likely to receive assistance and will minimize
leakages; the establishment of a central beneficiary registry will improve the monitoring and
evaluation of programs; improving monitoring and information systems will allow the
Government to track beneficiaries, ensuring that the poor are receiving appropriate benefits and
making it easier to measure the performance and impact of social assistance programs;
documenting policies and procedures decreases discretionary implementation of programs and
increases transparency. Finally, establishing accountability and control mechanisms, including a
system for appeals and complaints, will help to ensure that errors of inclusion and exclusion are
minimized. The formation of the social safety net committee to spearhead reforms, supported
under this ES DPL/DPC, will help ensure that the recommendations of the SSNA continue to be
implemented and the above benefits are realized.

COUNTRY CONSULTATION

122. The ES DPL/DPC has been prepared within the framework of the Government's
Medium Term Economic Program and has therefore benefitted from extensive
consultations with various stakeholders. The preparations of the specific policy actions
benefited from wide consultation within the country. Specific laws, institutional reforms and
actions supported by the loan were discussed with different groups, including non-governmental
organizations, the private sector. The government has consulted intensively with country
stakeholders, including the cabinet and members of Parliament, and these consultations resulted
in important changes to aspects of certain legislation. For example, during the national
consultations on the VAT and the budget process, the VAT was deferred for six months on
inputs in the manufacturing sector to allow the sector additional adjustment time, while a higher
than initially envisaged VAT rate was imposed on the use of mobile telephone services. The
preparation of the Country Poverty Assessment--the findings of which are expected to provide
analytical support to the continued implementation of social safety nets reforms supported under
this ES DPL/DPC--has benefitted from national consultation.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

123. Monitoring, Evaluation and Results Framework. The Ministry of Finance, Planning,
Economic Development, Energy and Foreign Trade will be will be responsible for coordinating
actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved
in the implementation of the reform program being supported by this ES DPL/DPC, including
Ministry of Social Development, Ecclesiastical Affairs & Labor, Ministry of Education &
Human Resources, Customs Administration and GARFIN. As part of the preparation process,

                                               47
the Bank has discussed with all relevant institutions the development of M&E process to ensure
adequate feedback to policy-makers. M&E is traditionally a weak area in the small island
economies including Grenada but there is strong understanding of the need to strengthen such
mechanisms. The Bank will maintain a dialog with counterparts in the Ministry of Finance. The
government and the Bank have agreed on a results framework with a number of process, output
and outcomes indicators to be assessed at the end of the program supported by this ES
DPL/DPC. These indicators are described in the Policy Matrix in Annex 2 and represent,
therefore, the agreed benchmarks for future evaluation of the program supported by the ES
DPL/DPC. Policies and reforms described in the Government Program are not benchmarks for
the evaluation of the ES DPL/DPC.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

124. Public financial management (PFM) and procurement systems. In general, the public
financial management and public procurement systems are adequate for this operation. Detailed
description of the existing Public Financial Management systems can be found under the
Government's Program section of the ES DPL/DPC. While challenges remain, the government is
taking actions to strengthen its public fiduciary control framework. As is evident from the policy
matrix in Annex 2, these actions are supported by the current ES DPL/DPC.

125. Foreign exchange system. The IMF conducted the Safeguard assessment of the ECCB
in 2007 and found that the ECCB control environment is satisfactory. ECCB has well established
procedures that ensure the integrity of its operation and there is a well functioning internal audit
department, external auditors who regularly audit the accounts, and an Audit sub-committee of
the Board.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

126. Loan Disbursement. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures
for development policy support. Loan proceeds will be disbursed once evidence of fulfillment
with prior actions (Annex 2) has been accepted and the necessary approvals by the World Bank
and Grenada have been obtained. Once such approvals are received, the Bank would make a
single loan disbursement into the Grenada Ministry of Finance treasury account denominated in
US dollars and located in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. These funds will be immediately
converted to the EC$, and thus will become available to finance budgeted expenditures. They
will be disbursed according to the regular government's budget procedures. Within a week of
this funds transfer, the Ministry will provide the Bank with a written confirmation of the
described transaction.

127. Accounting and Auditing. The administration of this program will be under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. The Government uses the integrated financial
management system (Smartstream) to produce its accounts, which are prepared on the modified
cash basis. The loan funds will be accounted for and audited as part of the general government
accounts.




                                                48
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

128. The specific policies supported by this ES DPL/DPC operation are not expected to
entail significant impacts on the environment, forests, or other natural resources. The
supported reforms aim primarily at strengthening public financial management and budgetary
discipline, improving private sector competitiveness, and protecting the poor. At the same time,
Government has devised programs and policies to assess and manage potential adverse effects on
the environment. Internationally, the government has committed to the Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD), and regionally it has committed to the Cartagena Convention and the St.
George's Declaration of Principles for Environmental Sustainability revised in 2006. Following
the principles of this declaration, the OECS Natural Resources Management Unit (NRMU)
prepared an "OECS Charter for Environmental Management" and developed the OECS
Environmental Management Strategy in March 2002. The Government has also prepared a
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) and has recognized the importance of
Protected Areas (PAs) as a means to conserve biodiversity. In 2008, along with other countries in
the region and their international partners, the OECS countries launched the Caribbean
Challenge which aims to protect and ensure the effective management of PAs. Several projects
and activities aiming to conserve the key ecosystems are being implemented, including the
GEF/UNDP supported Sustainable Management of the Shared Marine Resources of the
Caribbean Large Marine Ecosystem and Adjacent Regions Project (CLME), the GEF/UNEP
supported Integrating Watershed and Coastal Area Management Project (IWCAM), and the
GEF/World Bank supported OECS Protected Areas and Associated Sustainable Livelihoods
Project (OPAAL).

129. Like other OECS countries, Grenada's institutional capacity to effectively enforce the
exiting environmental protection laws and regulations is inadequate due to various factors such
as lack of human and financial resources, and poor coordination between various line agencies.
While climate change and natural disasters present key threats, various man-made threats to the
environment include: (i) development projects (e.g. construction and operation of marinas in
critical fish habitat); (ii) recreation activities (e.g. anchor damage, beach erosion, accidental
damage to corals); (iii) non-point source pollution; (iv) overuse of resources (e.g. trail erosion);
(v) fire; (vi) exploitation of resources (e.g. sand mining, wildlife capture); (vii) oil spills; and
(viii) impact of tourism on the environment. In order to address this challenge, and under the St.
George's Declaration of Principles for Environmental Sustainability, Grenada has committed to
strengthening of national agencies with environmental responsibilities and full integration of
national environmental priorities into institutional and legal frameworks that include specific
provisions for enforcement and financing their implementation. In addition, the World
Bank/GEF OECS Sustainable Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine
Ecosystems Project (currently under preparation) would, inter alia, establish a system of long-
term financing mechanisms to sustainably fund protected areas in Grenada and also support
efforts to harmonize policy, legal and institutional frameworks in Grenada and other OECS
participating states.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

130. The government reform program, supported by this ES DPL/DPC, faces three types
of significant risks: economic, natural disaster, and political.

                                                49
131. Economic: Strong financial sector linkages in the region create contagion risks, though
the banking system has so far remained resilient. The recent CL Financial and Stanford Group
events demonstrated that external financial shocks can be quickly transmitted to the region
through such financial institutions. The presence of financial conglomerates and complicated
ownership structures within the Caribbean increases the contagion risks across different types of
financial institutions as well across borders. Mitigation: Grenada appears not to have any
direct exposure to the Stanford Financial Group. The impact of the CL Financial group has
so far been contained. Still, the risk remains that financial stress could further dampen
economic activity in the country and the region, given the presence of financial
conglomerates and complicated ownership structures within the Caribbean. The national
authorities and the ECCB are moving forward with strengthening regulation and supervision
of the nonbank financial sector. Grenada has established a single regulatory unit (SRU) for
nonbanks. At the request of the government, the High Court appointed a judicial manager of
BAICO's operations in Grenada in early August 2009 to perform a financial review and
feasibility study to facilitate an orderly resolution to the BAICO failure. A similar
coordinated action was undertaken in other ECCU members as the resolution to the
CL/BAICO case requires a regional approach.

132. A second near-term risk includes a deeper and more protracted global slowdown,
increasing financial stress and, large retrenchment of capital inflows. A further deterioration
of global economic situation could deepen the impact on the Grenadian economy and cause
severe hardship. Mitigation: The government is implementing a sound economic program
and is taking further measures to manage the crisis. The IMF, World Bank, EU and other
donors have active dialogue with Grenada. The government has been implementing a PRGF
program under the support of the IMF and has successfully completed the third review with
the IMF under the PRGF programs on June 4, 2009 and the fourth review on November 25,
2009. The ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans remained low at 3.5 percent at the
end of 2008 and liquidity and capital adequacy ratios were also adequate. Nonetheless, banks
report increases in NPL ratios in the first quarter of 2009, as some nonresident and resident
borrowers are experiencing repayment difficulties.

133. Given strong reliance on the rest of the world, particularly for commodities and service
industries such as tourism, Grenada is also susceptible to other external shocks such as an
increase in oil prices, specific shocks to tourism sector, or a further expansion of the tourism
sector in other competing destinations. Mitigation: While difficult to mitigate, the government
seeks to manage these risks through its main focus on reducing vulnerabilities and support for
economic diversification and fiscal prudence.

134. Natural Disaster: Another major risk is Grenada's vulnerability to natural disasters such
as hurricanes and tropical storms. Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 damaged around 50 percent
of Grenada's housing stock and its vital agriculture and tourism industries. As a result, real GDP
contracted by 5.7 percent in 2004. In addition, Hurricane Ivan devastated a considerable amount
of the country's environmental assets with about 90 percent of the forest lands and watersheds
being deforested. Many of the country's watersheds which once supported an ecosystem where
much flora and fauna benefited directly and indirectly were stripped bare of their vegetation, thus
reducing their ability to perform vital ecosystem functions such as of water availability and
quality and, more importantly, the provision of livelihoods for the population, especially the

                                                50
most vulnerable and poor. Natural disasters increase indebtedness in the Caribbean region and
redirect public resources away from long-run development plans. Mitigation: While difficult to
mitigate natural disaster shocks, damage to the major private sector enterprises would be partly
covered by their own insurance. Grenada participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk
Insurance Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant
disaster. The Bank is also assisting Grenada through the Hurricane Ivan Emergency Project,
which was approved in November 2004. The project supports Grenada's recovery efforts
through the financing of critical imports and rehabilitation activities in key social sectors.

135. Political: Although most of the actions supported under this ES DPL/DPC have already
been implemented, including enactment of laws by Parliament, there exists a risk that the
continued implementation of the reform program may be opposed by special interests. For
example, the process of rationalization of public sector employment and reassigning staff to core
tasks may face some resistance. Finally, the development of objective and transparent criteria for
social assistance may be challenged by groups who may find themselves no longer eligible for
benefits. Mitigation: The political risk is reduced by the NDC government's large majority in
Parliament (11 seats out of 15 in the House of Representatives), the fact that new elections are
not scheduled for another three years, and the government's strong commitment to the reform
program as evidenced by their bold actions soon after coming to power. The risk is reduced
further by the government's consultative approach to reform implementation and the
government's commitment to dialogue among all stakeholders, as demonstrated, inter alia, by
extensive consultations on the recent Poverty Assessment. Furthermore, the IFIs and other
donors are also heavily focused on building consensus for the government's reform program.

1.     On April 17, 2006, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a PRGF Arrangement for
90 percent of quota. The completion of the fifth and last review of Grenada's economic
performance under the ECF approved in 2006 allowed for the immediate disbursement of an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.68 million (about US$2.6 million), bringing total disbursements to
SDR 16.38 million (about US$24.9 million) under the program.

2.     The Government has agreed with the IMF on a new three-year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement following the successful completion of the previous ECF program between
April 2006 and April 2010. In this context, the authorities and the IMF have reached an
agreement on a set of policy measures to reduce fiscal deficits and debt burden, improve debt
sustainability and strengthen regulations and supervision in financial sectors. The new ECF, in
the amount of SDR8.8 million (about US$13.3 million), was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors of the IMF on April 2, 2010, and will cover 2010-2013. The following press release
was issued after the Board approval of the new ECF and the fifth review under the previous
ECF:

                                 Annex 5: OECS DEBT PROFILE

1.      OECS countries are among the most highly indebted in the world. Total public debt
ratio averages around 90 percent of GDP in the OECS with a wide variation among the member
states. St. Kitts and Nevis holds the highest debt to GDP ratio by far --177 percent at the end of
2008. St. Vincent and Grenadines has the lowest ratio of 68 percent. The other member states
ranges between 70 percent and 109 percent.

2.     The level of indebtedness in the OECS often raises concerns about debt
sustainability and many member states restructured their debt in the recent past. Dominica
and Grenada completed debt restructurings under PRGF supported programs in 2005. Antigua
and Barbuda has been working on a debt strategy to approach creditors. Antigua and Barbuda
also benefited from some debt write-downs along with St. Vincent and Grenadines. St. Kitts and
Nevis has recently engaged advisors for a possible restructuring.

3.      External debt is the biggest component of public debt in many countries. Although
there are significant variations among the countries, external debt is higher than 50 percent of the
total in most member states. This renders the OECS economies highly vulnerable to external
shocks

4.      A significant part of the external debt is multilateral and bilateral. Central
governments hold about 80 percent of the external debt and more than one-half of it is owed to
multilateral and bilateral creditors. The only exception is Antigua and Barbuda where 53 percent
of the central government's external debt is with commercial creditors.

5.      Many countries are under the heavy burden of high public debt service. Although
some countries (Dominica and Grenada) managed to reduce their debt service through debt
restructurings, the debt service burden is heavy in most countries in the region. Only the external
debt amortization averages about 22 percent of the current revenues, --crowding out other public
and private expenditures. The current global economic crisis has further increased the challenges
for the governments as it led to higher interest rates and greater difficulties in rolling over
existing debts.

6.      There is no data available on private sector external debt in the OECS either via
local sources (ECCB), international sources (WB, IMF, BIS), or databases (EIU). The only
information available is the consolidated balance sheet of the commercial banks in each member
states; this gives a partial indication of the external exposure of the financial system in the
absence of financial information on insurance companies.

7.       The net foreign position is generally favorable in the OECS with foreign assets of
commercial banks outweighing foreign liabilities, except in St Lucia where the position is
negative as of February 2009. It has been negative since September 2006 (the start of the series)
but the gap has significantly widened. Antigua and Anguilla also have higher vulnerability as the
ratio of foreign liabilities to ECCB imputed foreign reserves is above 1.5. In other words,
reserves fall short of covering commercial banks' foreign liabilities. Considering foreign
liabilities and foreign deposits in proportion of total banking liabilities, it appears that Anguilla,
Antigua, St Kitts and St Lucia are the most exposed ones, with a ratio exceeding 17 percent.

                        Annex 6: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.      This annex presents a public debt sustainability analysis for Grenada using both a
deterministic model and stochastic simulations. The baseline public debt to GDP ratio
projections are based on the macroeconomic assumptions that are consistent with the medium
term macroeconomic framework envisaged in the IMF Staff Report dated November 2009.

2.      The baseline scenario assumes an average annual real GDP growth of 2.9 percent over
the period 2010-2015. The Grenadian economy is estimated to have contracted by 7.7 percent in
2009 in the wake of global economic downturn. The government budget is expected to generate
a primary surplus of 3.1 percentage points of GDP on average during 2010-2015. Under the
baseline scenario, the annual inflation rate is assumed to average 2.8 percent in 2010-2015.
Finally, the interest rate on public debt is expected to average 3.4 percent over the projection
period.

3.      The Grenadian public debt increased from 59.7 percent in 2001 to 102.2 percent in 2008,
in part reflecting high cost of borrowing which accounted for 17.4 percent of government's
current expenditures in 2008. The indebtedness of Grenada raises concerns about its
sustainability over the medium to long term. Grenada has been undergoing a debt restructuring
with advice and assistance offered by the IMF. The government has been taking measures to
strengthen the fiscal and debt management capacity, and to this end established a Debt
Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance in January, 2009.

4.      Under the baseline scenario, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to have increased
to 122.3 percent in 2009 after declining by almost 9 percentage points in 2008. The projected
increase in the public debt ratio in 2009 is partly driven by an estimated 7.7 percent economic
contraction. The Grenadian public debt ratio is projected to decrease to 120.3 percent in 2010
under the successful implementation of the government's fiscal consolidation program and
steadily decline thereafter, reaching 91.1 percent of GDP in 2015.

5.      Under the assumption that real GDP growth and average real interest rates are at their
historical averages (A1), the public debt
to GDP ratio will still show a declining Figure 7: Public Debt to GDP Ratio (Baseline Scenario)
path, but the decline will be much slower      140
relative to the baseline. This is explained
                                               120
by lower GDP growth and higher interest
rates relative to the baseline. In contrast,   100

under a second alternative scenario             80
which keeps the primary deficit at 2009         60
level but returns other variables to their
                                                40
baseline levels (A2), debt to GDP ratio
increases marginally over time This             20
implies reversing the baseline trend of an       0
average primary surplus of nearly 3                2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015
percent of GDP over 2010-2015 to an
annual deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP. Therefore, these scenarios demonstrate the critical
importance of fiscal discipline for achieving a declining path in the debt to GDP ratio.

6.      Sensitivity analysis indicates that Grenada remains vulnerable to shocks in external and
policy variables. A two standard deviation shock to GDP in 2010 and 2011 (B2) could raise the
debt ratio to over 150 percent of GDP by end 2011, but afterwards the debt to GDP ratio will
assume a declining path and nearly return to its 2009 levels by 2015. With the share of external
debt in total public debt above 70 percent, successive 30 percent devaluations in 2010 and 2011
could raise the public debt ratio to 187.5 percent by end-2011, compared to 116.6 percent under
the baseline scenario. Thereafter, debt to GDP ratio will decline but will remain substantially
above both the baseline and the base year levels. This shock is the most extreme scenario
considered in this DSA.

7.      Stochastic simulations assign low probabilities to extreme scenarios for Grenada.
Stochastic simulations assign low probabilities to extreme scenarios for Grenada. A more recent
approach to fiscal sustainability is utilizing a stochastic simulation tool. This framework takes
the interactions among key variables into account, contrary to the deterministic approach. The
common practice is to estimate a VAR model in order to obtain the correlation matrix of the key
macroeconomic variables that are assumed to have an impact on debt ratio. These are: (i)
domestic interest rates; (ii) the growth rate; (iii) the exchange rate; and (iv) the foreign interest
rate. The next step is to use these correlations to carry out Monte Carlo simulations with an aim
to generating large sample of bound tests. As a result, frequency distributions of the debt ratio
can be derived for each year of projection, which provides a probabilistic assessment of debt
sustainability. Simulation results for Grenada show that the 95 percent confidence interval is the

                            Annex 7: TOURISM SECTOR PERFORMANCE

1.      Tourism is a key employer and a major source of foreign exchange revenue in
Grenada. Recognizing the importance of this sector to the overall performance of the economy,
the following annex presents a brief summary of the tourism sector in Grenada by discussing
recent trends in tourism to Grenada and comparing them with the performance of tourism in
other OECS states and the wider Caribbean market.

2.      Tourism revenues in Grenada--measured as a share of GDP--are moderate
compared to other countries in the Caribbean. Between 2006 and 2007, income from tourism
amounted to 18 percent of GDP and labor and capital employed in tourism contributed to nearly
6 percent of total value added. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan inflicted substantial damage to Grenada's
tourism infrastructure as evidenced by more than halving of the available hotel rooms. However,
the sector recovered rapidly, partly to satisfy anticipated demand during the Cricket World Cup
in 2007 which Grenada co-hosted.

3.      Between 2003 and 2009, Grenada saw a marked expansion in cruise passenger
arrivals. Cruise passenger arrivals more than doubled in this period, substantially outpacing the
OECS average growth of 75 percent and dwarfing the average Caribbean growth of 8 percent
(Table 8). By contrast, Grenada's stay-over arrivals fell by 20 percent. Over the period 2003-
2008, stay-over arrivals in Grenada decreased by 13 percent, compared to a 27 percent increase
in the OECS and a 17 percent increase in the Caribbean over the same period.

4.      The global recession has had a mixed impact, with stay-over tourism arrivals down
by 4.9 percent and 8.4 percent respectively in 2008 and 2009, while cruise passenger
arrivals increased by 8.3 percent and 16.1 percent. Although the availability of Caribbean-
wide data is limited, stay-over arrivals in Grenada have been impacted similarly to the rest of the
OECS, which has been particularly hard struck in the Caribbean as a whole. During January-
October 2009, stay-over arrivals fell by 8.6 percent (y-o-y) in Grenada, compared to 10.2 percent
for the entire OECS (excluding St. Kitts & Nevis). Grenada has, however, experienced among
the greatest expansions of cruise passenger arrivals in the Caribbean.

  Annex 8: SOCIAL SAFETY NET ASSESSMENT: FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1.     Grenada has made significant investments in social development; however,
Grenadians face a number of risks and, in most cases, the poor are most vulnerable. The
country faces significant challenges in ensuring an adequate safety net in the face of economic
and environmental pressures and the changing social landscape.

2.      Expenditures on the safety net: Analyzing social assistance spending is difficult as
expenditures cross ministries and programs, and, in most cases, program level expenditure data is
not available. However, based on available data, it is estimated that expenditures on social
assistance equaled EC$55.7 million (US$ 20.6 million) in 2008. This represents approximately
3.2% of GDP and 9.2% of central government expenditures. Between 2004 and 2008,
expenditures increased in both nominal and real terms. Public Assistance, school feeding,
housing and skills training absorb the largest share of social protection expenditures.
Approximately two-thirds of social assistance expenditures are funded from the capital budget,
mostly by donor funding. This raises increasing concerns about the sustainability of social
protection initiatives.

3.      Implementation arrangements and constraints: Although social assistance programs
support the same target groups, each program requires completion of a separate application and
investigation by relevant staff. Information collected is generally the same for all programs and
the multiple targeting mechanisms increase significantly the cost of administrating programs.
The main issues include:
       Errors of exclusion (who is not in the program that should be) are significant and a large
       share of the target groups for key programs remains uncovered.
       Benefit levels differ between programs. Public Assistance provides a cash benefit equal
       to $200 per month or 41% of the poverty line, while Necessitous Fund benefits for
       primary and secondary students are equal to EC$100 per month or 21% of the poverty
       line.
       Benefits for the different programs are paid via different mechanisms and this increases
       administrative costs, makes accounting more difficult, and increases opportunities for
       leakage.
       Sound monitoring mechanisms are absent; therefore, it is not possible to accurately assess
       whether the rights of children, men, and women regarding social protection is being
       fulfilled.
       Accountability and control mechanisms are weak, as evidenced by the fact that policies
       and procedures are not fully documented, programs lack formal appeals mechanisms,
       process and impact evaluations are virtually absent, and not all programs are audited
       annually.

4.     While Grenada has a number of social assistance programs that serve, or could
serve, a risk management function, there is considerable scope for strengthening its social
safety net. The challenges for enhancing access to and quality of social safety net include:
       The Government does not yet have a clearly articulated social protection strategy;


                                               77
       The social safety net does not adequately protect children, single parents (who are
       predominantly women) or the working age poor (whether they have children or not);
       There are gender differences in access and eligibility to safety net programs and, as a
       result, the safety net does not adequately protect women;
       The safety net does not incorporate the basic principles of effective risk management;
       State financial intervention does not sufficiently enhance equity for all;
       The social safety net could benefit from rationalization of programs;
       Safety net implementation is subject to political interference and this makes it even more
       difficult to serve the poor;
       Institutional capacity to implement social safety net programs is limited; and
       The safety net is not sustainable given the heavy reliance on external funding.

5.      In addition, the safety net is not flexible enough to respond efficiently in emergency
situations (either financial crises or natural disasters). The Government implements a
number of small emergency-specific assistance schemes, including burial assistance, disaster
fund and emergency assistance that respond to idiosyncratic shocks, but these programs (which
served only about 120 households in 2008) are not well positioned to respond to covariate
shocks. They lack the critical requirements for an effective emergency response, such as being
timely, targeted and temporary.

6.     Recommendations for reforming the social safety nets: Grenada's safety net strategy
should focus on reducing vulnerability via the following:
   Safety Net Programming:
       Consolidate and strengthen public cash-transfer programs, with a focus on making the
       unified cash transfer program more child and gender sensitive, promoting human capital
       development among children, keeping adolescents in school, and facilitating the welfare-
       to-work transition among beneficiaries;
       Reformulate public works programming to increase access among the poor, particularly
       single mothers;
       Increase the pro-poor focus of the School Feeding Program;
       Expand access to services among vulnerable infants and young children; and
       Promote the school-to-work transition among adolescents and youth.
   Cross Cutting Issues:
       Articulate a Social Protection Strategy;
       Introduce an objective and transparent targeting mechanism;
       Establish a Central Beneficiary Registry;
       Enhance accountability and control for social assistance programs;
       Develop capacity for monitoring and evaluation;
       Establish emergency response capacity;
       Develop implementation capacity.
