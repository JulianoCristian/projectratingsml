                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         1) Improve public sector governance and economic management, by supporting reforms to increase the efficiency of tax collection, improve public service
                         delivery, enhance debt management, reduce waste in the provision of public services, and help cope with the adverse consequences of the global economic
                         downturn.

                          2) Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social safety nets, by supporting efforts to develop objective beneficiary selection criteria and transparent
                         targeting mechanisms and prioritize social spending to vulnerable groups.

                          3) Promote financial sector stability and improve the business environment, through measures aimed at strengthening the financial sector regulatory
                         environment, mitigating regional contagion risks, promoting investments, and substantially lowering the existing barriers to registering companies and
                         properties.
