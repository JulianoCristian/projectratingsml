1. 
Country and Sector Background
 
The strategy proposed addresses critical sector issues, the most important of which are the following:   
·
The competitiveness of the Mexican economy is declining.  
·
A
well-educated labor force is one of several factors that could improve competitiveness.  
·
Enrollment in tertiary education in Mexico is low relative to its level of income.  
·
The enrollment gap takes place against a backdrop of high and increasing demand for graduates from 
tertiary education. 
·
Broad availability of student loans would facilitate increased private investment into tertiary 
education. 
·
Access to tertiary education in Mexico is highly unequal.  
·
The unequal access is caused by a combination of inequalities in secondary education, insufficient 
financial aid, and lack of academic support to disadvantaged students in tertiary education.  
·
The national tertiary education policy lacks the instruments to inform student decisions concerning 
their choice of academic program and the linkages between programs and labor market prospects.   
 
2. Objectives 
 
The proposed program supports the Government’s strategy to expand access and completion of tertiary 
education in a sustainable, equitable and efficient manner. This will be pursued through the development 
of a coherent student assistance system consisting of student loan and grant programs, compensatory 
interventions to improve access for disadvantaged students, and the development of the national tertiary 
education policy.  
Page  2
In the first phase of the APL, this objective will be pursued through support for: (i) PRONABES national 
scholarship program and development of the regulatory framework for tertiary education student 
assistance; (ii) the development of a program of student loans in the state of Quintana Roo; (iii) academic 
and social assistance to disadvantaged groups through (a) design and test of an early interventions 
program to expand the pool of talented low-income upper-secondary students able to enroll in tertiary 
education, and (b) assistance to tertiary education indigenous students; and (iv) development of the 
national tertiary education policy framework.  
 
3. 
Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 
The proposed program fits the overall objectives of the Bank’s Mexico Country Partnership Strategy 
(Report No. 28141) of assistance to the Government’s efforts to enhance the competitiveness of the 
Mexican economy and reduce poverty. Two out of four pillars in the Bank’s partnership strategy with the 
government of Mexico. The proposed program is complementary to other Bank interventions in these two 
pillars, as indicated in more detail in Section 3. 
 
The Bank is in a favorable position to offer technical assistance to the Government for the program due to 
its previous and on-going investments in the sector. Since 1998, the Bank has invested in Mexico’s 
tertiary education sector through the Higher Education Financing Project (Loan 4332-ME)—performance 
and lessons learned summarized in Section B and Annex 21 and the Knowledge and Innovation Project 
(Loan 4349-ME). The experience of these projects and that of other tertiary education projects in Latin 
America were valuable assets for developing the proposed program. The proposed program introduces a 
broader approach to tertiary student assistance that could generate important lessons for other projects.  
 
The proposed program assists the government in the implementation of policies recommended by Bank 
analytical work, notably: “Closing the Gap in Education and Technology”, “Inequality in LAC: Breaking 
with History”, the Bank’s strategic approach to tertiary education: “Creating Knowledge Societies,”, 
“Mexico Public Expenditure Review”, “Mexico Poverty Assessment” and “Mexico’s Challenge of 
Knowledge-based Competitiveness: Toward a Second-Generation NAFTA Agenda”. 
 
4. Description 
 
Component 1: Support for PRONABES national scholarship program and for the development of the 
national regulatory framework for tertiary education student assistance (US$ 280.0 million or 94.4 
percent of total project cost without contingencies).  This component aims to promote the equitable 
expansion of tertiary education by supporting PRONABES scholarship program for academic qualified 
tertiary education students demonstrating financial need, and to support the development of a national 
regulatory framework for assistance to tertiary education students.   
 
Component 2: Support for state-level student loan programs (US$ 9.0 million or 3.0 percent of total 
project cost without contingencies).  The objective of this component is to support state student loan 
programs that are consistent with the national tertiary education policy.  The component will be 
implemented by state student loan agencies with financing from BANOBRAS.  
 
Component 3: Support for disadvantaged students (US$ 5.72 million or 1.9 percent of total project cost 
without contingencies).  This component aims to promote more equitable access to, and completion of, 
tertiary education through improved academic outcomes of disadvantaged students. This objective will be 
achieved through two subcomponents. 
 
Page  3
(a) Early Interventions to Assist Talented Low-income Students (US$ 0.3 million with 
contingencies). This subcomponent aims to test programs that seek to improve the opportunities 
for lower-income, upper-secondary students to enroll in tertiary education  
 
(b) Expansion of the Pathways Indigenous Students Assistance Program (US$ 5.4 million without 
contingencies): This subcomponent aims to improve the education outcomes for indigenous 
students who are enrolled in tertiary education institutions, through the development and 
expansion of the existing Pathways program, currently financed by the Ford Foundation and 
implemented through the National Association of Universities and Tertiary Education Institutions 
(
Asociación Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educación Superior
—ANUIES).  
 
Component 4: Promotion of private investments in student loans. This component is planned for phase II 
of the APL.  Its objective is to stimulate the mobilization of private capital for financing student loans, 
contributing to the expansion of private student loan agencies and leveraging the resources of public 
student loan agencies. 
 
Component 5: Policy analysis and institutional strengthening (US$ 1.8 million or 0.6 percent of total 
project cost without contingencies): This component aims to promote the development of tertiary 
education policy and strengthen sector institutions through studies, dissemination of information, and 
monitoring and evaluation activities.

6. Implementation 
Implementation arrangements are divided between two implementation agencies: 
 
SEP through its student assistance unit, PRONABES, will be responsible for implementation of 
Component 1, 3, and 5.  
 
BANOBRAS will be responsible for implementation of component 2 and component 4. For component 2, 
BANOBRAS will on-lend the funds to state student loan agencies. In phase I only the Student loan 
agency of the state of Quintana Roo, ICEEQROO, will participate.  The federal government has received 
formal communication of interest in participating in phase II from 5 other states.  Phase II is expected to 
be approved in FY07. The state student loan agencies will on-lend to students in tertiary education that 
after graduation will repay their loans. 
 
7. Sustainability 
 
·
Political sustainability for the proposed comprehensive student assistance program will be 
enhanced at federal level through the support given by state governments, rigorous program 
evaluation, and the systematic dissemination of program outcomes.  At state level, political 
sustainability will be similarly enhanced through broad consultations carried out with all 
stakeholders prior to the launching of the program, as well as by the expected ample participation 
and support given by tertiary education institutions and the continuous dissemination of program 
operations and results planned through websites and mass media.

·
Financial sustainability of student loan programs will be fostered through the hiring of competent 
staff, the establishing of efficient loan repayment collection mechanisms, and the adequate 
capitalization of the student loan agency commensurate with the scope of its lending operations.  
 
8. 
Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
 
University education is clearly a good investment for many secondary school graduates. One might 
therefore expect the private sector to offer student loans. But information asymmetries between the lender 
and borrower limit private sector provision in the absence of some government intervention.  This has 
resulted in provision by the public sector, or substantial involvement, in almost all countries in the world. 
There is considerable interest among policymakers in designing a student loan system that provides cost-
effective, easy-accessible, un-subsidized student loans that keep public expenditures at a minimum, while 
still fostering the maximum enrolment into tertiary education. This is especially true in low and middle 
income countries. 
 
This project builds upon a large set of experience from tertiary education projects, in particular from the 
Latin America and the Caribbean region and from OECD countries.  Key elements considered are: 
 
·
Access to tertiary education is not only limited by lack of student financing, but also by missing 
academic student support, insufficient prior academic preparation, low student expectations and 
little awareness of existing opportunities.   
·
Importance of investing in scholarships; and facilitate the combined provision of scholarship and 
unsubsidized loans in order to improve equity  
·
Need to include resources for public information campaigns targeting areas with a high density of 
low-income and marginalized households.  
·
A
reimbursable grant program is a highly desirable financial aid instrument.  
·
Ensure a well-defined and strictly enforced set of rules to achieve a financially sustainability 
student loan organization.
