To this end, the project\n            components will: 1) Support the National Scholarship Program\n            for Higher Education - PRONABES - and the development of the\n            national regulatory framework for tertiary education student\n            assistance. This component will promote the equitable\n            expansion of tertiary education, through the PRONABES\n            scholarship program for academic qualified tertiary\n            education students demonstrating financial need, and,\n            through the development of a national regulatory framework\n            for assistance to tertiary education students. 2) Support\n            the analysis of, and tertiary education institutional\n            strengthening, through studies, dissemination of\n            information, and monitoring and evaluation activities. 3)\n            Support disadvantaged students, through the promotion of\n            equitable access to, and completion of, tertiary education,\n            through interventions designed to compensate for academic,\n            social, and informational disadvantages faced by poor,\n            talented students. 4) Support state-level student loan\n            programs, in compliance with the national tertiary education\n            policy, and, in the long term, build an effective, tertiary\n            education student loan system. The component will be\n            implemented by state, student loan agencies with financing\n            from the national development bank - BANOBRAS. 5) Promote\n            private investments within student loans, implemented\n            through BANOBRAS, to stimulate the mobilization of private\n            capital for financing student loans, contributing to the\n            expansion of private student, loan agencies, and leveraging\n            the resources of public student loan agencies. The design of\n            this component will be based on a study on alternative\n            financing for higher education, to be undertaken under this\n            Component, and shall examine how best to attract private\n            investment in student loans, and, explore alternative\n            institutional arrangements for student loans agencies,\n            including ways to reduce political risk, and engage the\n            private banking sector."}, "docdt": "2005-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
