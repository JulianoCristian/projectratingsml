A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

The competitiveness of the Mexican economy is declining. The decline inMexico's competitiveness takes
place against a backdrop o f strong benefits o f integrationinto the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) inthe last half o f the 1990s. Growth inMexico was driven by labor force growth and capital
accumulation, with limited contribution from total factor productivity growth (0.12% in the period 1991     -
2000). As the global economy continued to open, the weak competitiveness o f the Mexicaneconomy was
exposed. This was manifested in several ways: (i)    in2003, China surpassed Mexico as the United States'
second largest trading partner after Canada; (ii)  inthe World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness
Report, Mexico slid from a position o f 34 in 1998 to 48 in2004 (out o f a total o f 104 countries); and (iii)
there i s a limited industrial productionwith highvalue-added and highresearch and development (R&D)
intensity. On the positive side, the government deserves credit for the achievement o f a credible macro-
economic framework with low inflation, stable long-term fiscal management and a declining country risk
premium. Also, the pichng up o f economic activity inthe United States in2004 spilled over to improved
economic growth in Mexico. Consequently, economic growth inthe short term i s expected to be slightly
above average for the 1990s. However without sustained improvements in the competitiveness of the
Mexican firms, medium and long-term growth rates will remain significant below the potential o f the
Mexicaneconomy.

A well-educated labor force is one of several factors that could improve competitiveness. Provision o f
better infrastructure would reduce logistic costs. Relaxing the labor code would encourage firms to
swiftly adapt to market conditions through hires and lay-offs. Simplification o f bureaucratic procedures
and better access to credit would spur entrepreneurs to start up new companies. Increased investments in
science, technology and innovation combined with better linkages between science and business would
bring additional technological and scientific know-how to firms. Lastly, a well-educated workforce i s an
essential condition for a productiGe and innovative labor force in the future. To improve the level o f
education in the workforce, the quality o f primary and secondary education i s essential, so i s the
establishment o f a lifelong learning system. Progress has been achieved in several of these factors o f
competitiveness. Nevertheless, the pace o f advance could be accelerated.' Increasing the availability o f
workers with tertiary education represents a key opportunity to improve labor force productivity. Further,
it would improve the potential impact o f other reforms o f education system and be complementary to
improvements in the innovation system, labor market regulation and the strengthening o f the financial
sector. T o increase the availability o f workers with tertiary education, the following sector issues are
critical:                             3

Enrollment in tertiary education in Mexico is low relative to the income level of the country. Compared
to countries with similar GDP per capita, the gross enrollment rate in tertiary education in Mexico i s
around 10 percentage points lower. In2003, 2.2 million students attend tertiary education corresponding
to 21 percent o f the 18-24 year-old Mexicans. The average enrollment rate for a country with a similar
income level i s 31 percent. The tertiary education gap costs the country roughly US$6.5 billion or more
per year in foregone income, equivalent to 1percent o f GDP. Without a highly skilled labor force it will
be impossible for Mexico to shift its development path into a more knowledge-based, high productivity
economy. For example, in the 2005 Global Information Technology fi-om the World Economic Forum,
Mexico's poor ranking as number 89 out o f 104 counties in availability o f engineers and scientists was a

 ' The recently approved Mexico Innovation for Competitiveness Project, the proposed Mexico School Based
Management and the Mexico Competitiveness Development Policy Lending program under preparation provide
 assistance to the Mexican government incomprehensively improving the competitiveness o f the Mexican economy.

significant factor for Mexico's lowbrankingintechnology capacity and network readiness (ranked 60 out
o f 104). This i s but one indication o f the lack o f availability o f workers with tertiary education.

The enrollment gap takesplace against a backdrop of high demandfor graduatesfrom tertiary education.
The private rate o f return to tertiary education i s estimated to be 16 percent, twice the prevailing rate in
high-income countries. Research shows that a combination o f several interrelated trends in the global
economy-introduction        o f new technologies, increased value o f innovation, increased integration, and
fiercer national competition-caused the demand for workers with tertiary education to increase. As a
consequence, the wage o f workers with tertiary education increasedby more than 90 percent from 1987 to
1999 relative to workers with secondary education (de Ferranti et al, 2003). This reflects faster growth in
demand than in supply, which indicates that market failures prevent the supply o f graduates from
adjusting to the growing demand in the labor market. The primary reason for this failure i s lack o f
financing to expand tertiary education. Expansion o f the tertiary education sector can be financed from
either public or private sources:

     0   Expansion through increased public financing is unsustainable. In 2001, public investment in
         tertiary education in Mexico was 0.7 percent o f GDP. This corresponds to 15 percent o f public
         investment in education. It would be fiscally unsustainable to expand tertiary education through
         further public investment, since Mexico's recovers only 11percent o f GDP intaxes. Inaddition,
         it would be inequitable, since public expenditures in education should prioritize efforts to
         improve quality o f basic education and expand access to upper-secondary education to low-
         income groups.

     0   Expansion through increased private financing is only taking place slowly. Non-governmental
         .tertiary education institutions accoynted for 21 percent o f the student population in 1992 and 33
         percent in 2003. Private soyrces invest yearly 0.2 percent o f GDP in tertiary education, which i s
          significantly below the level incounties like the U S (1.8 percent), Korea (1.9 percent) and Chile
          (1.7 percent). However, only a minority o f families can afford to pay for a five-year private
          tertiary education degree. Average yearly private tuition fee i s MX$ 34,200 (US$ 3,000), the
          equivalent o f 40 percent o fthe average householdincome.

Broad availability of student loans would facilitate increased private investment in tertiary education.
However, there exists very limited access to student loans in Mexico. Only an estimated 50,000 students
per year have access to student loans (2 percent o f the Mexican student population). This compares to 71
percent in the US, 59 percent in .UK and 58 percent in Sweden. Given the high returns to tertiary
education, the majority o f the beneficiaries would be able to repay the entire cost o f the education. The
establishment o f a marginally subsidized student loan system would therefore significantly contribute to a
financially sustainable expansion o f tertiary education in Mexico. The challenge i s to establish a large
scale system of high-capacity and efficient student loan institutions that, together with the federal and
state governments, education institutions and families, are able to assist students to enter and complete a
tertiary level degree program that subsequently will allow the graduate to find gainful employment and
repay the student loan.

Access to tertiary education in Mexico is highly unequal. In 2002, less than 2 percent o f the 18-24 year
olds fiom the poorest quintile o f households attended tertiary education. In contrast, 26 percent from the
wealthiest quintile enroll in a tertiary education. The indigenous population also has a low degree o f
participation in tertiary education. Only 3.5 percent enroll in tertiary education. The unequal access
inhibitstalented, poor students inrealizingtheir potential, andthereby reduces the efficiency o fthe sector.
Further, social mobility decreases, which contributes to exacerbate and perpetuate existing inequalities in
Mexican society. The Mexican society is, like other Latin American societies, highly unequal. Lastly, the



                                                            2

                                     ,
unequal access prevents poor and marginalizedgroups from participating in the intellectual leadership o f
Mexico.

The unequal access is caused by a combination of inequalities in secondary education, insufficient
financial aid, and lack of academic support to disadvantaged students in tertiary education.Two thirds o f
the inequality intertiary education inMexico i s inheritedfrom inequality in the completion o f secondary
education. Expanding coverage and improving quality at the upper-secondary education level i s therefore
essential for more equal access to tcrtiary education. The last third o f inequality i s due to lower transition
rates from secondary to tertiary education among low-income youth compared to students from higher
income families. This difference i s expected to grow in the future due to: (i)   the growing role o f private
institutions in meeting the demand for tertiary education; and (ii)      the recent expansion o f secondary
education in Mexico. In order to provide more opportunities for tertiary education for low-income and
indigenous youth:


    0    There is a needfor a coherentfinancial aid program that includes a scholarship program. The
         lack o f a coordinated program contributes to high drop-out and repetition rates among low and
         middle-income students. A-recently initiated government program, Programa Nacional de Becas
         para Educacidn Superior (PRONABES), provides scholarships to poor students. Evaluations
         show that this program decreases drop-out and improves academic outcome o f its target group.
         However, the program i s fiscally expensive and could be more consistently implemented.
         Nevertheless, provision o f scholarships i s necessary in order to spur enrollment o f lower income
         students into tertiary education. Lessons learned from previous projects show that lower income
         families are unable and/or reluctant to assume student loan debt, because o f at least two reasons:
         (i)requirements for collateral; and(ii) ofdefaulting onthe loans due to either potential
                                                    fear
         adverse labor market conditions in the future, or uncertainty o f academic abilities and
         unfamiliarity with credit in general. The challenge i s to enlarge the scope o f the current
         scholarship program to form a more coherent and effective financial aid system that combines
         scholarship and loans. An expanded and improved program would provide the student with an
         individually-determined financial aid package that will allow the student to study while
         maintainingpublic subsidies at a minimum.


     0   There is a need for additional support to studentsfrom disadvantaged student groups to assist
         them in accessing and completing a.tertiary education degree.

             o To improve access for disadvantaged groups, there is a need for early interventions
                  programs that prepare poor and highly talented students in secondary education to access
                  tertiary education. A poor and highly talented student in secondary education has a slim
                  chance o f continuing to the tertiary level due to low quality o f secondary education,
                  unawareness o f support programs, and family and social environments that lack
                  experience and expectations o f tertiary education. Inhigh-income countries, such as the
                  US, UK and Canada, early intervention programs in secondary education provide this
                  group o f talented student with opportunities to prepare for tertiary education. Programs
                  range from tutoring, advanced placement courses, student and parental guidance
                  programs, summer classes, part-time universities classes, and vouchers to private schools.
                  These programs have been shown to improve transition rates. The challenge i s to pilot
                  early interventions programs in Mexico and systematically evaluate whether such
                  strategic programs improve access to tertiary for disadvantaged poor and talentedyouth.
             o To improve completion of disadvantaged groups, there i s a need for academic and social
                  support to indigenous students in tertiary education that will help them complete their
                  degree. Given that the vast majority o f indigenous students i s the first family member to
                  attend tertiary education and in many instances the first member o f the local indigenous


                                                       3

                  community, there i s a greater need to bring additional, targeted support to this group o f
                  students. There exists only one pilot program inMexico that assists indigenous students
                  coping with greater academic challenges and a new social environment. The challenge i s
                  to scale up the program into institutions with the highest density o f indigenous students in
                  a sustainable manner that will maintain the positive impact that the pilot program has had
                   so far.

The national tertiary education policy lacks the instruments to inform student decisions concerning their
choice of academic program and the linkages betweenprograms and labor market prospects. Only a few
tertiary education institutions collect information from the labor market regarding the performance o f
their graduates. This limits the ability o f institutions and policymakers to ensure quality standards and
adjust courses to the needs o f the economy. Most importantly, students and their families are limited in
their ability to make good choices by the lack o f information on labor market outcomes. The challenge i s
to strengthen the existing information collection and dissemination system to provide accurate and
relevant information to students, families, institutions and policymakers that will allow them to make the
right decisions for themselves.

Government Strategy

The Government policy for education i s articulated in the National Education Program 2001-2006
(Programa Nacional de Educacidn, PNE), which i s an integral part o f the National Development Plan
2001-2006 (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo, PND). The PNE defines three strategic objectives for tertiary
education in Mexico: (i)     increase coverage with equity; (ii) increase quality; and (iii) promote improved
integration, coordination and govewance o f the tertiary education system. In order to increase coverage
with equity, the program proposes the expansion o f tertiary education based on active participation o f all
actors:   federal government, state government, tertiary education institutions, private sector and the
students and their families. It would also establish, in cooperation with the states, a national scholarship
program for low-income students which, combined with state level student loan programs, would foster
equity and help mobilize private resources for tertiary education. Furthermore, the program supports
measures to increase the transition rate between upper secondary and tertiary education.

The Government's long-term vision for the sector expects to have by 2025 a national education system
that i s pertinent, inclusive, and comprehensive, and that promotes quality and equity. This system would
be the fundamental base for the cultural, scientific, technological, economic and social development o f
Mexico inthe 21Stcentury. The proposed APL would support both, the short and the long-term goals o f
the government's strategy.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The proposed program fits the overall objectives o f the Bank's Mexico Country Partnership Strategy
(Report No. 28141) to assist the Government's efforts to enhance the competitiveness o f the Mexican
economy and reduce poverty. These are two out o f four pillars inthe Bank's partnership strategy with the
government o f Mexico. The proposedprogram complements other Bank interventions inthese two areas,
as indicated inmore detail inSection 3.

The Bank i s in a favorable position to offer technical assistance to the Government for tertiary education
 development due to its previous and on-going investments in the sector. Since 1998, the Bank has
invested in Mexico's tertiary education sector through the Higher Education Financing Project (Loan
4332-ME) and the Knowledge and Innovation Project (Loan 4349-ME) whose performance and lessons
learned are summarized in Section,B and h n e x 20. The experience o f these projects and that o f other
tertiary education projects in Latin America and the Caribbean were valuable assets for developing the


                                                        4

proposed program. The broader approach to tertiary student assistance introduced by the proposed
program could potentially generate important lessons for other projects.

The proposed program assists the government in the implementation o f policies recommended by Bank
analytical work, notably: "Closing the Gap in Education and Technology," "Inequality inLAC: Breaking
with History," "Creating Knowledge Societies," "Mexico Public ExpenditureReview," "Mexico Poverty
Assessment,"    and "Mexico's Challenge o f Knowledge-based Competitiveness: Toward a Second-
Generation NAFTA Agenda."

3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes

The program would contribute to improve competitiveness of the Mexican economy and reducedpoverty.
Through its impact on expanding tertiary education coverage, the program aims to improve the
productivity o f the future Mexican workforce. The program would create synergies with other education
sector interventions, notably the proposed Mexico School Based Management (ME-P088728) and the
Mexico Lifelong Learning (ME-P086058) projects. In particular, the program would increase the
possibilities to continue from secondary education to tertiary level studies, thereby raising the returns to
secondary education. Further, greater availability o f highly skilled labor would also enhance the return to
other Bank efforts under the competitiveness pillar, such as the Mexico Competitiveness Development
Policy Lending program that aims to improve infrastructure, promote better investment climate, and
strengthen the financial sector. Moreover, the proposed program would have important synergies with the
Mexico Innovation for Competitiveness project (ME-P089865) that seeks to improve the national
innovation system in Mexico. Lasily, by providing additional tertiary education opportunities to youth
from lower-income families, the program would significantly raise their earning power, increase their
social mobility and contribute to a more equal distribution o f income, ultimately contributing to poverty
reduction.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

There are three reasons why the Adaptable Program Loan (APL)instrumenti s especially well suited for
achieving the objectives o f the proposed program:

Responding to demand: The program aims to establish the essential pieces o f a comprehensive student
assistance program, but the relative balance between grants, loans, private sector participation, and
compensatory interventions cannot be fully predicted at the present time. Most likely the balance will
change according to demand and impact o f the programs carried out in the first phase. The APL provides
the Bank with the instrument to respondto demand through sequential as well as overlapping phases. For
example, phase one will support the development o f a student loan program in one Mexican state:
Quintana Roo. The expectation is'that at least three Mexican states will be ready to join the program in
2006, the year when phase I1i s plannedto begin. Possibly another five states would be ready by 2009, at
the inception o f phase 111. These are preliminary demand estimates that may under or overestimate the
actual demand from the states. The APL instrument allows the program to accommodate in a fairly
flexibly manner the inclusion o f additional states should demand increase.        It also permits shifts in
emphasis betweencomponents that may occur as a result o f the findings from impact evaluations.

Long run focus: Considering the long term goal o f building an effective tertiary education student
assistance system, international experience shows that a sound student loan system takes at least 10 to 15
years to establish, and requires continuity, systematic feedback and rigorous evaluation. Similarly, the
development o f tertiary education policy reform i s typically a lengthy process.        In both cases the


                                                       5

continuity afforded by the use of the APL contributes to ensure that program expansion i s efficient and
consistent with the national policy framework.

Learning-by-doing: The proposed APL includes pilots in phase Iwith concurrent evaluation studies.
Distilling lessons learned from these pilot programs to inform subsequent adjustments and scaling up
constitutes a process o f learning-by-doing in which the federal and state governments, families, students,
education institutions and the Bank team would be involved. The APL instrument i s conducive to this
learningprocess.

2. Programobjective andphases

The proposed APL would support the Government's tertiary education strategy by strengthening the
Government's student assistance program to foster the sustainable, equitable and efficient expansion of
tertiary education. This would be achieved through the consolidation and expansion o f a coordinated
public and private student loan and grant system, the introduction o f compensatory interventions at the
secondary education level to improve access for disadvantaged students to tertiary education, the
expansion o f support to indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education, and the strengthening o f the
national policy framework for tertiary education. The student assistance system would be coordinated by
the Secretariat o f Education (Secretaria de Educacidn Pliblica, SEP) and provide for financial aid, and
academic and social support, as described below:

     Thepnancial assistance interventions would be consolidated into a system where the student would
     receive an individualized financial aid package consisting o f varying elements o f marginally
     subsidized loans and grants, according to their need. Students, who lack sufficient means to enter or
     continue tertiary level studies, would be offered a modest grant and access to student loans. Overall,
     the availability of student loans would be increased substantially.     When system consolidation i s
     complete at least two types o f student loans would be available:           student loans provided by
     participating Mexican states which would tend to be o f modest amounts, and supplementary loans
     offeredby private lenders on a commercial basis.

     The academic and social assistance programs would support:           (i) talented and poor students in
     secondary education by preparing them to qualify academically for tertiary education, and (ii)
     indigenous students in tertiary education, helping them to succeed in their tertiary level studies.
     Students in the academic and social support programs would receive financial aid either from
     PRONABES or other scholarship programs.

The strengthening of the student assistance program would be pursued through a gradual program
expansion along two axes.         First, geographical expansion: Mexican states that are interested in
participating in the student loan system and that comply with the normative guidelines o f the program
would be invited to join; and the academic and social assistance to indigenous students would be
expanded to other states. Second, introduction o f new interventions; for example, the program foresees
the gradual development through feasibility studies, piloting and possible scaling-up o f two new student
assistance programs: (a) early interventions program for talented students in secondary education and (b)
reimbursable grant scheme for low-income students.           This gradual expansion will take place in
partnership with the states, education institutions, the private sector, families and other stakeholders in a
manner that i s sustainable and consistent with the national policy framework. The APL i s expected to
have three phases implemented over an estimated ten-year period. Each phase would span three to four
years with the first and second phase partially overlapping.
                                      i
The first phase o f the APL would support: (a) the strengthening o f PRONABES national scholarship
program together with the development o f a regulatory framework that coordinates tertiary education



                                                      6

student assistance; (b) policy studies including a feasibility study o f a novel reimbursable-grant scheme, a
program to improve the diffusion o f information regarding tertiary education opportunities and labor
market outcomes, and support to analytical and evaluation-based policy malung intertiary education; (c)
support to disadvantaged students through: (i)    the design and field testing o f academic support programs
to increase the qualifications and expectations o f poor upper-secondary students for tertiary education;
and (ii)  the scaling-up o f a pilot program to assist indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education; and
(d) the state-level student loanprogram o f BANOBRAS, where the first state to benefit is expected to be
the state o f Quintana Roo.

The Government and the Bank would jointly review the progress achieved inphase Ibased on the triggers
below to decide whether or not to proceed to phase 11. It i s anticipated that the second phase of the APL,
would partly overlap with phase I, expand state-level student loan programs according to the interest
                                       and
and readiness o f states to participate. Thus far, the federal government has received formal expressions o f
interest fiom nine states (Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Guanajuato, Nuevo L e h , Tamaulipas,
Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Hidalgo and Veracruz). Other states could also join the BANOBRAS student
loan program. Phase I1could additionally support the promotion o f private investments in student loans
should the need arise.

3.       Project development objective and key indicators

The proposed program supports the Government strategy to foster the sustainable and equitable expansion
of tertiary education through student assistance. This would be pursued through the development o f a
coherent student assistance system consisting o f student loan and grant programs, compensatory
interventions for disadvantaged students, and the development o f the national tertiary education policy.

In the first phase o f the APL, this objective would be achieved through support for: (a) PRONABES
national scholarship program and development o f the regulatory framework for tertiary education student
assistance; (b) development o f the national tertiary education policy framework; (c) academic and social
assistance to disadvantaged groups through (i)     design and test o f an early interventions program to expand
the pool o f talented low-income upper-secondary students able to enroll in tertiary education, and (ii)
assistance to tertiary education indigenous students; and (d) the piloting o f a state-level student loans
program inone Mexican state (expected to be Quintana Roo inphase I).




                                                          8

The overall success o f the APL would bejudged on its impact on the following key indicators:

a) Expansion o f tertiary education measured by the number o f graduates from tertiary education in
    Mexico. The baseline i s 297,000 in2003 to a target o f 529,000 by the end o f phase 111.

b) Equity o f tertiary education measured by the share of 18-24 year-old students in tertiary education
    from households classified at the two lowest quintiles o f income distribution. The baseline i s 5.5
    percent in2004 to a target o f 10 percent by the end o f phase 111.

The program i s expected to improve these key indicators in the medium to long run. In the short run,
understood to be the first phase, the programi s expected to influence the following key indicators

    Equity o f the PRONABES scholarship program measured by the distribution o f beneficiaries by
    family income. The baseline in 2004 for 1 minimum salary i s 17 percent, for 2 minimumsalaries i s
    42.5 percent, for 3 minimum salaries i s 33.5 percent and for 4 minimumsalaries i s 7 percent; and the
    respective targets are 20,40, 33 and 7 percent by the end o f phase 111;

    Coverage o f the state-level student loan programs measured by the share o f the tertiary education
    student population in the state that i s financed by the program. For the State o f Quintana Roo the
    baseline i s 0 percent and the target by end o f phase Ii s 13 percent.

Further, the project would bejudged on its timely implementation. The Results Framework with specific
definition o f each indicator i s presented in Annex 3. Annex 18 describes the planned methodology and
data collection for the program's impact evaluations.

4.      Projectcomponents

Component 1: Support for PRONABES national scholarship program and for the development of
the national regulatory framework for tertiary education student assistance (US$ 281.24 million or
93.7 percent o f total project).    This component aims to promote the equitable expansion o f tertiary
education by supporting PRONABES scholarship program for academic qualified tertiary education
students demonstrating financial need, and to support the development o f a national regulatory framework
for assistance to tertiary education students.          This would be achieved through the following
subcomponents:

Subcomponent 1.I Supportfor PRONABES national tertiary education scholarshipprogram (US$278.88
million): The Bank loan would finance approximately 58 percent o f the federal share o f PRONABES
scholarships budget, or the equivalent o f 29 percent o f the total budget tahng into account the
contribution o f the states.     PRONABES scholarships would benefit an estimated 400,000 tertiary
education students from poor families.       See Annex 12 for a detailed description o f the PRONABES
scholarship program.

Subcomponent 1.2 Development of the regulatory and supervisory framework for the national financial
aidprogram (US$2.36 million). This subcomponent aims to buildregulatory and supervisory capacity at
the federal level to: (i)   enhance 'the management and effectiveness o f the PRONABES scholarship
program, (ii)  coordinate the provision o f student loans and scholarships, which i s particularly critical ina
federal government system where state-level programs need to be articulated with each other to promote
economies o f scale and ensure overall system coherence and efficiency, and (iii)contribute to the
establishment o f a financially sustainable student loan system. These interventions would contribute to a
more financially sustainable and equitable tertiary education system. Financing would cover technical
assistance, consultants' services and incremental operational costs.

Component 2: Analysis and institutional strengthening (US$ 1.73 million or 0.6 percent of total
project cost). This component aims to support tertiary education policy and strengthen sector institutions
through studies, dissemination o f information, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The activities
planned would be carried out by SEP through the Under-Secretariat for Higher Education under the
following subcomponents:

Subcomponent 2.1 Promotion and information dissemination (US$ 0.76 million). This subcomponent
aims to create a reliable information database on the labor market performance o f tertiary education
graduates and on nationally accredited tertiary education programs, and to disseminate this information to
students, tertiary education institutions, and the public at large. The instrument would strengthen an
already developed Labor Market Observatory in the Secretariat o f Labor (Secretaria de Trabajo y
Previsidn Social-STPS).

Subcomponent 2.2 Analysis and regulatoryframework (US$ 0.82 million). This subcomponent aims to
provide the analytical base to strengthen tertiary education policy. The studies are planned: (i)   Feasibility
study for the creation o f an income-contingent reimbursable grant program; (ii)   Financing alternatives for
tertiary education, (iii)
                        Means to enhance tertiary education equity; (iv) Quality assurance mechanisms for
tertiary education; (v) Means to enhance the links between tertiary education and the productive sector.
The topic for these studies might be modified should the incoming Administration in 2007 set different
priorities.

Subcomponent 2.3 Evaluation of student assistanceprograms (US$ 0.15 million). This subcomponent
aims to consolidate the results o f the evaluation o f student assistance programs carried out under
Components 1, 3 and 4 and disseminate the evaluation results.            Financing would be provided for
consultants' services to design the mechanisms to aggregate evaluation data, for preliminary analysis and
for dissemination o f the information.

Component 3: Support for disadvantaged students (US$5.91 million or 2.0 percent of total project
cost). This component aims to promote more equitable access to, and completion of, tertiary education
through interventions designed to compensate for academic, social and informational disadvantages faced
bypoor talented students. This objective wouldbe achieved through two subcomponents.

Subcomponent 3.1 Early interventions to assist talented low-income students (US$ 1.22 million). This
 subcomponent aims to test interventions that seek to improve the opportunities to enroll in tertiary
 education for talented lower-income, upper-secondary students. The program would design and pilot
 interventions inup to two states. Possible interventions include counseling, advanced placement courses,
 tutoring, remedial courses, summer andor weekend classes, scholarships to enroll private schools, role
 modeling, preparation o f students for the admission tests, student and parental guidance, and measures to
promote higher expectations among students and their parents. The interventions would be targeted to
 high school students from low-income families that are financially supported by the Jdvenes con
 Oportunidades program.        The subcomponent would be implemented by SEP through the Under-
 Secretariat for Upper Secondary Education (Sub-secretaria de Educacidn Media Superior-SEMS).                 A
 key integral element o f this intervention i s the design o f program evaluations, collection o f baseline data
 and dissemination o f evaluation findings, which will allow policymakers to decide whether to scale up the
 program based on rigorous evaluation. Financing would be provided for consultants' services and
 training. Participationby the selected states inthe form o f cost sharing would be expected.

 Subcomponent 3.2 Expansion of the Indigenous Students Assistance Program (US$ 4.69 million): This
 subcomponent aims to improve the education outcomes for indigenous students enrolled in tertiary
 education, through the strengthening and elipansion o f the existing Pathways program, currently financed

by the Ford Foundation and implemented through the National Association o f Universities and Tertiary
Education Institutions (Asociacidn Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educacidn Superior-
ANUIES). The expandedprogram would finance Academic Support Units(ASU) in universities selected
on a competitive basis.       These ASUs would provide tutoring, academic support, remedial courses,
community outreach and information on available financial aid programs to indigenous students through
institution-based coordinators and tutors. Thus far, program evaluations show that beneficiaries have
higher completion rates and improvements in academic performance. During phase I,the program i s
expected to incorporate eight to ten additional institutions with a high percentage o f indigenous
                                      .
population, expending program coverage to approximately 3,000 new indigenous students. This
subcomponent would be implemented by PRONABES through ANUIES, and in accordance with the
IndigenousPeoples DevelopmentPlan (IPDP) described inAnnex 10. Activities to be financed include:
technical assistance for high priority tertiary education institutions to develop competitive proposals for
program participation, implementation o f the selected proposals, support for coordinators and tutors,
university extension courses, national and regional workshops, external program evaluation, and program
administration.

Component 4: Support for state-level student loan programs (US$ 10.58 million or 3.5 percent of
total project cost). The objective o f this component i s to support financially sustainable state student loan
programs that are consistent with the national tertiary education policy, and in the long term to build an
effective tertiary education student loan system. The component would be implemented by state student
loan agencies with financing from a national development bank, BANOBRAS. This objective would be
achieved through the following subcomponent:

Subcomponent 4.1 Support for state-level gtudent loan programs (US$ 10.58 million). In phase I,the
sub-component would be implemented by the Student Loan Institute o f the State o f Quintana Roo
(Instituto de Cre'dito Educativo del Estado de Quintana Roo-ICEEQROO).            Specific activities would be
carried out in accordance with the BANOBRAS and the ICEEQROO Operations Manual, and include
student loans and institutional strengthening. The ICEEQROO would be financed through on-lending by
BANOBRAS, with the guarantee o f the state, supporting student loans, and goods and services aimed at
institutional strengthening and program evaluation. Operating costs would be financed with state funds.
To ensure sustainability, the Institute would be capitalized with funds to constitute a Reserve Fund
sufficient to cover losses associated with non-performing loans.

T o promote a financially sustainable, transparent and efficient student loan system, a set o f national rules
would be developed, continually enhanced and enforced by BANOBRAS and PRONABES with the
assistance o f external consultants (financed in component 1). The criteria for the development o f the
national rules are: (i)   financial soundness; (ii)  independent and professional governance, (iii) term
                                                                                                     long
 capitalization strategy, (iv) policy consistency, (v) transparent and sound operating procedures, (vii)
normative compliance and external supervision, and (viii) clear, rigorous and published monitoring and
 evaluation fkamework. Annex 4 specifies the criteria in more detail. The design o f these criteria draws
heavily upon the Bank's experience from the on-going Mexico Financing Higher Education and
 Colombia Higher Education projects. C o m h m e n t to comply with the national rules on the part o f a state
 would be a requirement for program participation. It i s expected that this component would be expanded
 to at least three states inphase I1o f the program.

 Component 5: Promotionof privateinvestmentsinstudent loans (US$0.12 millionor 0.04 percent of
 total project cost. This component i s planned for later phases o f the APL. The component would be
 implemented by BANOBRAS.             I t s objective i s to stimulate the mobilization o f private capital for
 financing student loans, contributing to the expansion o f private student loan agencies and leveraging the
 resources o f public student loan agencies. ,The design o f this component would be based on a study on
 alternative financing for higher edqcation that would be undertaken in phase Iunder Component 5. The

study would, among others, examine how best to attract private investment in student loans, and explore
alternative institutional arrangements for student loans agencies, including ways to reduce political risk
and engage the private bankingsector.

5. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

This project builds upon a large set of experience from tertiary education projects, inparticular from the
Latin America and the Caribbean region and from OECD countries. The main lessons learned and
reflected inthe design are:

Access and completion of tertiary education depend upon a series of interrelated factors. Several
programs and initiatives in OECD and L A C countries show that access i s not only limited by lack o f
student financing, but also by missingacademic student support, insufficient prior academic preparation,
low student expectations, little awareness o f existing opportunities, and unintended effects o f policies in
vigor. Promoting an equitable and sustainable expansion o f a tertiary education therefore requires a
holistic approach that encompasses and coordinates these elements.

Scholarships combined with marginally subsidized student loans is a cost-effective way to improve equity.
The Mexico Higher Education FinancingProject shows that unsubsidized loans awarded on a commercial
basis i s a powerful instrument to increase enrolment ina sustainable manner among highand high-middle
income groups and save fiscal resources. However, it i s not effective in improving access for low-income
students to tertiary education. Students from low and middle-income families are reluctant to borrow for
their studies, because o f the requirement of collateral and fear o f defaulting due to lack o f academic and
social support and uncertainty o f aFademic abilities and future labor market conditions. The Colombia
Higher EducationImproving Access project, which provides a mix o f scholarship and unsubsidized loans,
has proven successful in attractingpoor and talented students into tertiary education. The proposed APL
would support scholarships and loan programs, and facilitate the combined provision o f both forms o f
financial aid inorder to improve equity.

Awareness of the assistanceprogram is necessary to reach target groups. The Venezuela Student Loan
Reform project (ICR report No.20064) substantially improved targeting towards low-income and rural
students by launching a public awareness campaign. The campaign increased applications more than
three fold, and financing to students from rural areas increased by a factor o f ten over two years. The
proposed APL would include additional resources for public information campaigns targeting areas with a
highdensity o flow-income andmarginalized groups.

Ensure a well-defined and strictly enforced set of rules to achievefinancial sustainability of student loan
organizations.     Student loan programs have in the past proven difficult to implement and sustain
successfully. Both the Jamaica Student Loan project (Ln. 4070-JM) and the Venezuela Student Loan
Reform project (Ln. 3494-VE) were rated unsatisfactory to a large extent because o f low recovery o f
student loans and serious doubts abLoutthe financial sustainability o f the program. The on-going Mexico
Higher EducationFinancingproject shows that it i s possible to establish an efficient student loan program
with highrepayment rates. The lessons learned from these operations were used as base for the federal
policy guidelines for the proposedprogram. Specifically, the following is relevant:


     0    Ensure strong financial incentives to recover the student loans;
     0    Enforce penalties for non-repayment and design incentives for repayment, such as the use o f
          credit rating bureaus;
     0    Include commercial banking experience inthe management o f the program;
     0    Create external oversight of the student loanprovider according to commercial bankingpractices;



                                                      12

    0  Exclude political interference (such as political appointees involved inthe day-to-day operations);
    0  Ensure transparent communication o f the costs o f defaults to the public and policymakers;
    0  Encourage a design with risk-sharing among participants;
    0  Develop a long-term capitalization strategy to offset losses and foster financial sustainability, and
    0  Ensure that borrowed funds for student loanprogramhave at least the same maturity as that o f the
        loans offered student loans.,

A reimbursable grant program is a highly desirable Jinancial aid instrument. The Australian tertiary
education system expanded in a financially sustainable way without deteriorating equity by relying on
income-contingent student loans. Income contingent loans eliminate the risks associated with default o f
student loans, since the loan becomes a grant for graduates that earn below a certain threshold. The
proposedprogram would investigate the feasibility o f developing a reimbursable grant-scheme inMexico.

Annex 2 describes the objectives and rating o f related projects and Annex 20 summarizes the
performance and lessons learned from the on-going Mexico FinancingHigher Educationproject.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection.

The strategy for the equitable expansion o f tertiary education in Mexico, embodied in the proposed
program, was chosen taking into account four alternatives. The first alternative would be to do nothing.
This option was rejected, because there is evidence o fmarket failure under current conditions that has led
to high losses o f economic benefits. Given a decision to intervene, the following three alternatives were
considered:                         3


     0   The first intervention alternative considered was to expand the supply of public tertiary
         education. This option was rejected basically on account o f budgetary constraints. Moreover,
         given the budget constraints, the available public resources should not be diverted from
         expanding and improving basic education.


     0   The second alternative contemplated was to increase public institutional funding to tertiary
         education and charge tuition fees for well-off students. This approach i s not feasible at present
         due to the tight fiscal constraint and political opposition to charging tuition fees. Moreover,
         simply increasing spending for public tertiary education institutions could be inefficient and
         inequitable, given current institutional arrangements. The challenge therefore becomes one o f
         finding a strategy leading to the equitable expansion o f tertiary education without adding to the
         federal fiscal burden. The basic characteristic o f such strategy i s the mobilization o f private
         resources, particularly through financing by the students themselves through repayment o f
         student loans.


     0   The third alternative contepplated was to develop a financial assistance system based on student
         loans and targeted incomekontingent reimbursable grants. Inthis case interventions would be
         limited to the provision o f student loans and grants for tertiary education. This option was
         rejected because it leaves the majority o f the lower-income but talented students without access
         to tertiary education and disregards the need for academic support to disadvantaged students
         already enrolled in tertiary education. This option would therefore be insufficient to meet the
         equity goal o f the program. To address the equity problem it i s important not only to provide a
         proper mix o f financial assistance products including grants and loadgrant combinations, but at
         the same time to increase the pipeline o f lower-income and indigenous students who successfully
         complete upper secondary education and are ready and motivated to enter tertiary education.




                                                      13

                                    J




The strategy adopted in the proposed program meets the condition o f promoting the equitable expansion
o f tertiary education without significantly increasing current federal budget allocations for the sector. It
consists o f a comprehensive student assistance program that includes non-reimbursable grants that are co-
financed in equal parts by the federal and state budgets, a feasibility study for a program with
reimbursable grants to be repaid by students contingent upon the level o f their future earnings, fully
repayable non-subsidized student loans provided by state and private agencies, compensatory
interventions to assist lower-income and indigenous students both prior and after their enrollment in
tertiary education institutions and, in subsequent phases o f the APL, measures to mobilize additional
private financing for student loans. These interventions would be articulated by and be consistent with
the national education policy and the regulatory framework for tertiary education student assistance.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Formal co-financing i s not contemplated in the proposed APL. Program implementation involves the
active participation o f tertiary education students and their families, tertiary education institutions,
ANUIES, the Ford Foundation, and upper-secondary education institutions. Financial cost-sharing
involves participating states providing financing for their share o f the PRONABES scholarship program,
and for counterpart fundingfor the BANOBRAS student loan program.

2. Institutionalandimplementafionarrangements

The government has requested two loans to implement the proposed program. One loan would support
the activities implemented by SEP, components 1, 2 and 3. For this loan the Borrower would be the
UnitedMexican States. The Borrower for the second loan, for component 4 and 5, would be the National
Bank o f Public Services and Works (Banco Nacionalde Obras y Sewicios Pziblicos-BANOBRAS)                 who
would on-lend to Mexican states for state level student loans (expected to be Quintana Roo inphase I).
For the loan to UnitedMexican States, BANOBRAS would act as financial agent.

Regarding the implementation agencies, at the federal level, the project would be implemented by SEP
through PRONABES, a program under the Directorate General for Higher University Education
(Direccidn General de Educacidn Superior Universitaria-DGESU)             o f the Under-Secretariat for Higher
Education (Sub-Secretaria de Educacidn Superior-SES)               and by the Under-Secretariat for Upper
Secondary Education (Sub-Secretaria de Educacidn Media Superior - SEMS). Further support would be
provided by the Directorate General for Legal Affairs (Direccidn General de Asuntos Juridicos-DGAJ)
and the Directorate General for Budget Administration and Financial Resources (Direccidn General de
Administracidn Presupuestal y Recursos Financieros-DGAPRF)                at SEP. PRONABES would have
direct responsibility for the execution o f component 1, 2 and 3 as follows: Under Component 1, the
scholarship program and the establishing o f the regulatory framework for tertiary education student
assistance programs; under Component 2, the policy and institutional strengthening activities. Lastly,
under Component 3, SEP would be responsible for (a) the carrying out, together with SEMS and one or
two interested states, the design and field test o f the early interventions program for disadvantaged upper
secondary students, and (b) with the collaboration o f ANUIES the expansion o f the Program for
Assistance to Indigenous Students inTertiary Education.

At state level, BANOBRAS would be responsible for the implementation o f the loan for component 4.
BANOBRAS would enter into contracts with state student loan agencies that would execute the activities.
Inphase I, agency is expectedto be ICEEQROO. As other states express interest inparticipatingand
             that
demonstrate readiness for implementation, their respective student loan agencies would be incorporated
as project executing agencies in subsequent phases o f the APL.


                                                       14

For the transfer o f funds from the Bank to the executing agencies under the two loans, the following
arrangements would be used: (a) For the loan supporting SEP a mandate contract (Contrato de Mandato)
would be signed between the Secretariat o f Finance (Secretaria de Hacienday Crddito Pziblico-SHCP),
SEP and BANOBRAS; (b) For the loan supporting ICEEQROO, arrangements for the transfer o f funds
would be based on a loan contract between BANOBRAS and the ICEEQROO. Further, there will be a
guarantee agreement for the BANOBRAS loan between SHCP and the Bank. Project Operations Manuals
have been developed by the ICEEQROO, SEP and BANOBRAS.                     SEP and ICEEQROO would be
responsible for the financial management o f the project with the support o f BANOBRAS. Annex 6
presents the detailed implementation arrangements and Annex 7 details the financial management and
disbursement arrangements.

The proposed program does not fall under the Bank's guidelines and recently established quality
assurance system for projects involving a Line o f Credit. A line o f credit i s defined as funds passing
through an intermediary financial institutionthat bears the risk o f default and where the final end-user has
to repay. The guidelines do not apply to the proposed program for two reasons. First, the definition o f a
Line o f Credit excludes projects where a government agency lends funds to a government implementation
agency which i s required to repay the sub-loan. This i s the case inthis program, where BANOBRAS, a
governmental development bank on-lends to a publicly decentralized institution, the state student loan
institute (expected to be the ICEEQROO o f Quintana Roo for Phase I).         Second, the guidelines also do
not apply to projects where the end use o f funds i s identified in detail at appraisal. In the proposed
program the end use o f funds was detailed at appraisal as being educational expenditures and living costs
to sustain student enrollment intertiary education.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The proposed program would utilize evaluation instruments specifically designed to measure the impact
o f the mainprogram interventions and to maximize the learning opportunities affordedby the APL.
                                     \
Evaluation Arrangements. The PRONABES scholarship program would be evaluated at the national
level to verify the equity impact o f the program as measured by the actual percentage o f beneficiaries
coming from its targeted population. To this end a verification o f the income level o f beneficiary students
would be carried-out in phase Iand would constitute the baseline for the evaluation analysis o f the
program when compared with a second measurement to be carried out in phase 111. The expected
outcome i s an improvement in the targeting o f the program over the life o f the APL, leading to a larger
share o f tertiary education students coming from the two lowest quintiles o f the income distribution.
Responsibility for this evaluation lies with PRONABES.

The policy impact o f the proposed program would be assessed through periodic qualitative analyses, the
results o f which would be discussed yearly through national workshops on the development o f tertiary
education and the national student assistance program. Responsibility for this evaluation lies with SES.

The expected impacts o f the assistance for disadvantaged students include: (a) increased tertiary
education enrollment for talented lower-income upper-secondary students who receive compensatory
assistance, and (b) improved academic performance and graduation rates o f indigenous students in their
tertiary education careers.   Student performance would be measured by the grade-point average for
participating students and by tertiary education terminal efficiency rate at participating universities. The
baseline for this evaluation already exists inthe Pathways program for indigenous students and would be
compared with yearly measurestaken duringthe three phases o f the proposedAPL. The evaluation o f the
early interventions program would measure the extent to which lower-income high school graduates from
participating schools enroll in tertiary education, Le. the absorption rate o f the target population. The



                                             I      15
                                     a

baseline for this evaluation would be completed inphase Iand yearly measures would be taken thereafter
for comparative purposes. Responsjbility for these evaluations lies with SEP through SES and SEMS.

For the state-level student loan programs, evaluations would be conducted at state level, expected to start
with the state o f Quintana Roo. Further evaluation could be planned for joining states. Inall cases, the
expected program impact would be an increase in the share o f the states' tertiary student population
receiving student loans. Other expected outcomes o f the program are detailed in Annex 3. For purposes
o f the evaluation, a control group would be established on the basis of differential program-promotional
strategies, as described inAnnex 18.

MonitoringArrangements. The implementationo f the proposedprogram would be monitored through
specific output and process indicators described inAnnex 3. The state-level student loan agencies, such as
ICEEQROO, would have an operational monitoring system, satisfactory to the Bank. This system would
cover, inter alia, information about borrowers, loans, transactions, participating educational institutions,
and contextual information pertaining to each borrower. System design would permit the tracking o f
beneficiary students over time, during loan disbursements and thereafter, the record o f student
qualifications in standardized E M - I and EXANI-I1examinations and their grade-point average for
each semester during the life o f the loan. Inaddition the system would record the operational cost o f the
student loan agency in financial terms and as a percentage o f the value o f the loan portfolio. At the
federal level, PRONABES would develop a national monitoring system for student loans and grants
duringphase I.This system would aggregate and benchmark state-level data on grant and loan programs
and issue bi-annual performance reports, to ensure continued compliance by participating states with the
national guidelines.

4. Sustainability

     0   Financial sustainability o f student loan programs would be fostered through the hiring o f
         competent staff, the establishing o f efficient loan repayment collection mechanisms, and the
         adequate capitalization o f the student loan agency commensurate with the scope o f its lending
         operations. Further, the project would support the development o f financial mechanisms to gain
         access to private capital for well functioning student loan agencies. Each participating state
         would provide evidence o f financial capacity to assume the debt corresponding to the
         BANOBRAS loan and accept to act as guarantor for such loan, as a condition for participation in
         the program.


     0   Financial sustainability o f student grant programs would be enhanced by the continued one-to-
         one participationbetween federal and state governments inthe financing o f all grants and by the
         possible introduction o f a reimbursable grant scheme.


     0   Political sustainability for the proposed comprehensive student assistance program would be
         enhanced at federal level through the support given by state governments, rigorous program
         evaluation, and the systematic dissemination o f program outcomes.        At state level, political
         sustainability would be similarly enhanced through broad consultations carried out with all
         stakeholders prior to the launching o f the program, as well as by the expected ample participation
         and support given by tertiary education institutions and the continuous dissemination o f program
         operations and results plannedthrough websites and mass media.

                                                      The program i s amply disseminated and there
support at national and/or state level                is wide political consensus that it deserves high
                                                      priority in all participating states and at the
                                                      federal level. A policy letter issued by SEP
                                                      confirms this commitment. Rigorous program
                                                      implementation and evaluation would together
                                                      with seminars and conferences contribute to

                                                      state loan agencies. Inaddition, PRONABES'
                                                      external evaluations would be strengthened.

                                                      disadvantaged students would build upon the

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analysis

The economic annex provides summary information o f tertiary education in Mexico, estimation o f the
private and social rates o f return to tertiary education, and a cost benefit analysis o f the main component
inphase 1, the PRONABESscholarship fund.

In Mexico, the private rate of return to tertiary education is high, 16 percent. Takmg into account the
direct costs related to education, such as tuition fees, study material, transportation and the like, the
private return remains comparatively high: 10 percent. Including the cost o f public education in the
estimationreduces the return to 7 percent, which still makes the investment profitable inthe longrun.The
relatively high returns to tertiary education in Mexico combined with the relatively low enrollment rate
suggest the presence o f significant constraints in accessing and financing tertiary education. In addition,
these estimations do not take into account the positive externalities from investment intertiary education,
such as improved technology absorption.

A preliminary cost-benefit analysis for the main component inphase 1, support to PRONABES, finds a
favorable economic rate o f return o f 10 percent to the project's investment in the scholarship program.
With less conservative assumptions this return increases. The finding shows that improving equity o f
tertiary education i s both equitable and economically desirable.

2. Technical

The various elements o f the proposed tertiary student assistance program to be financed by the proposed
program have been assessed from educational and financial perspectives and correspond to best
internationalpractice. Rigorous evaluation techniques would be used to demonstrate the effectiveness o f
the program in improving coverage, equity and efficiency o f tertiary education inMexico. The scope and
quality o f the Operation Manuals adopted by SEP, BANOBRAS and ICEEQROO i s considered adequate,
and no technical problems are anticipated.

3. Fiduciary

Procurement: The Bank carried out a procurement capacity assessment o f ICEEQROO and SEP for the
Program (see Annex 8). The proc&ement implementing capacity i s low, but the procurement under the
Program i s not complex. With the measures agreed in an action plan, the Institute and SEP shall be able
to comply with Bank's rules. The Action Plan would improve the procurement planning tools and the
inventory management systems, retaining a procurement specialist, drafting a chapter on the operations
manual, and improving facilities. In addition to the prior review supervision, the capacity assessment o f
the institution recommended: (a) one full annual supervision mission, and (b) based on the overall high
risk assessment, the post-review field analysis should cover a sample o f not less than 1 in 5 contracts
signed. AS capacity o f the implementing agencies increases, the overall risk can be lowered to "average".
This would reduce the post-review field analysis to not lessthan 1in 10 contracts.

Financial management: The Bank carried out a Financial Management Assessment (FMA), which
reviewed whether the project design correctly balanced the need for transparency and oversight o f
financial aspects with the need for facilitating smooth implementation.         The main conclusion i s that
current financial management arrangements for the proposed Bank-financed project are adequate and
operational. The FMrisk i s considered Moderate for both executing agencies (with tendency to turn into
Substantial for ICEEQROO). Yet certain weaknesses have been identified.                These were taken into
account in the design o f the FM arrangements. The arrangements include specific agreed measures to


                                                        18

mitigate the FM risk. Therefore, project implementation should be accompanied by a close supervision
that allows early detection o f financial management issues and ensures the proper use o f funds. The risk
i s moderate based on the FMA of the proposed project, specifically the risk associated to flow o f funds
for decentralized operations involving state trust funds, universities and the ANUIES association.
Additional information i s provided inAnnex 7.

4. Social

The program builds on the social assessments and IPDP developed by the government o f Mexico during
the preparation phase. These included consultations with a large cross-sector o f stakeholders carried out
by SEP and by the ICEEQROO covering the state-level student loan program and the program for
assistance to indigenous students. The recommendations assembled through these consultations and
assessments were incorporated into the design o f the program and measures are in place to ensure that
they are carried out during implementation. Annex 10 gives details on the extent o f the consultations and
the specific conclusions o f the social assessment and presents the IPDP.

The competitiveness of the Mexican economy is declining. The decline inMexico's competitiveness takes
place against a backdrop of strong benefits o f integration into the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) in the last half o f the 1990s. Growth in Mexico was driven by labor force growth and capital
accumulation, with limited contribution from total factor productivity growth (0.12% in the period 1991-
2000). As the global economy continued to open, the weak competitiveness o f the Mexican economy was
exposed. This was manifested in several ways: (i)    in2003, China surpassed Mexico as the UnitedStates'
second largest trading partner after Canada; (ii)  inthe WorldEconomic Forum's Global Competitiveness
Report, Mexico slid from a position o f 34 in 1998 to 48 in 2004 (out o f a total o f 104 countries); and (iii)
there i s a limited industrial production with highvalue-added and highresearch and development (R&D)
intensity. On the positive side, the government deserves credit for the achievement o f a credible macro-
economic framework with low inflation, stable long-term fiscal management and a declining country risk
premium. Also, the picking up o f economic activity inthe United States in 2004 spilled over to improved
economic growth inMexico. Consequently, economic growth in the short term i s expected to be slightly
above average for the 1990s. However without sustained improvements in the competitiveness o f the
Mexican firms, medium and long-term growth rates will remain significant below the potential o f the
Mexican economy.

A well-educated labor force is on; of several factors that could improve competitiveness. Provision o f
better infrastructure would reduce logistic costs. Relaxing the labor code would encourage firms to
swiftly adapt to market conditions through hires and lay-offs. Simplification of bureaucratic procedures
and better access to credit would spur entrepreneurs to start up new companies. Increased investments in
science, technology and innovation combined with better linkages between science and business would
bringadditional technological and scientific know-how to firms. Lastly, a well-educated workforce is an
essential condition for a productive and innovative labor force in the future. T o improve the level o f
education jn the workforce, the quality o f primary and secondary education i s key, so i s the establishment
o f a lifelong learning system. And increasing the availability o f workers with tertiary education would in
itself increase the productivity of the labor force. Further, it would improve the potential impact o f other
reforms o f education system and be complementary to improvements in the innovation system, labor
market regulation and the strengthening o f the financial sector. To increase the availability o f workers
with tertiary education, the following sector issues are critical:

Enrollment in tertiary education in Mexico is low relative to the income level of the country. Compared
to countries with similar GDP per capita, the gross enrollment rate in tertiary education in Mexico i s
around 10 percentage points lower. In2003, 2.2 million students attend tertiary education corresponding
to 21 percent o f the 18-24 year-old Mexicans. The average enrollment rate for a country with a similar
income level, such as Thailand, i s 31 percent, Figure 1. Therefore, there i s not only a gap in enrollment
compared to high-income countries, but also a gap relative to other countries o f its same level. This
suggests that lack o f graduates o f tertiary education i s a binding constraint on the Mexican economy, in
particular for Mexican companies seeking to grow and compete on a global market. For example, inthe
2005 Global Information Technology from the World Economic Forum, Mexico's poor ranking as
number 89 out o f 104 countries in availability o f engineers and scientists was a significant factor for
Mexico's low ranking in technology capacity and network readiness (ranked 60 out o f 104). This i s but
two indications o f the lack o f availability o f workers with tertiary education. The tertiary education gap
costs the country roughly US$6.5 billion or more per year in foregone income, equivalent to 1percent o f

GDP. Without a highly skilled labor force it will be impossible for Mexico to shift its development path
into a more knowledge-based, highproductivity economy.

The enrollment gap takesplace against a backdrop of high demandfor graduatesfrom tertiay education.
The private real rate o freturn to tertiary education i s estimated to be 16 percent, twice the prevailing rate
in high-income countries. A real rate of return to investment in any asset of around 8-10 percent per
annum would be considered to be healthy. For most other developing countries internal rates o f return to
tertiary education of 12-13 percent are considered typical. Hence, a large share o f Mexican youth misses
out on the high and increasing return to tertiary education. Research shows that a combination o f several
interrelated trends in the global economy-introduction               o f new technologies, increased value o f
innovation, increased integration, and fiercer national competition-caused the demand for workers with
tertiary education to increase. As a consequence, the wage o f workers with tertiary education increased
by more than 90 percent from 1987 to 1999 relative to workers with secondary education (de Ferranti et
al, 2003). This reflects faster growth in demand than in supply, which indicates that market failures
prevent the supply o f graduates from adjusting to the growing demand inthe labor market. The primary
reason for this failure i s lack o f financing to expand tertiary education. Expansion o f the tertiary education
sector can be financed from either public or private sources:

Expansion through increased public Jinancing is unsustainable. In 2001, public investment in tertiary
education in Mexico was 0.7 percent of GDP. This corresponds to 15 percent o f public investment in
education. It would be fiscally unsustainable to expand tertiary education through further public
investment, since Mexico's recovers only 11percent of GDP intaxes. Inaddition, it would be inequitable,
since public expenditures in education should prioritize efforts to improve quality o f basic education and
expand access to upper-secondary education to low-income groups. Public investments in tertiary
education should therefore increasingly focus on expanding accessibility to tertiary education for low-
income and disadvantaged groups.

Broad availability of student loans wouldfacilitate increasedprivate investment in tertiary education.
However, there exists very limited access to student loans in Mexico. Only an estimated 50,000 students
per year have access to student loans (2 percent o f the Mexican student population). This compares to 71
percent in the US, 59 percent in UK and 58 percent in Sweden. Given the high returns to tertiary
education, the majority o f the beneficiaries would be able to repay the entire cost o f the education. The
establishment o f a marginally subsidized student loan system would therefore significantly contribute to a
financially sustainable expansion o f tertiary education in Mexico. The challenge is to establish a large
scale system o f high-capacity and efficient student loan institutions that, together with the federal and
state governments, education institutions and families, are able to assist students to enter and complete a
tertiary level degree program that subsequently will allow the graduate to find gainful employment and
repay the student loan.

Access to tertiary education in Mexico is highly unequal.       Figure3 Studentpopulationby income
In2002, less than 2 percent of the 18-24 year olds from            100%
the poorest quintile o f households attended tertiary
education. In contrast, 26 percent from the wealthiest              sG%

quintile enroll in a tertiary education. This implies that          80%

the composition o f the Mexican student population i s              10%
more unequal than in other L A C countries. For example             60%
in Mexico 18 percent of the student population comes                50%
from the three lowest income quintiles.This compares to             40%
28 percent inColombia, a country with a similar level o f
enrolment, Figure 3. The indigenous population also has             30%

a low degree o f participation in tertiary education. Only          20%

3.5 percent enroll in tertiary education. The exclusion             10%

leads to the inability o f a large share o f the populationto        0%

earn higher incomes needed to overcome poverty,
causing those excluded to be trapped in a low-income,
low-asset condition throughout their lives. Further, the
unequal access inhibits talented, poor students in               Source: World Bank (2002), D e l Bello (2002) and
realizing their potential, and thereby reduces the               Delannoy (2000)
efficiency o f the sector. Further, social mobility
decreases, which contributes to exacerbate and perpetuate existing inequalities in Mexican society. The
Mexican society is, like other Latin American societies, highly unequal. Lastly, the unequal access
prevents poor and marginalized groups from participating in the intellectual leadership o f Mexico.
Clearly, tertiary education provides a unique opportunity for social mobility and for the expansion o f the
country's elite.

The unequal access is caused by a combination of inequalities in secondary education, insuflcient
financial aid, and lack of academic support to disadvantaged students in tertiary education. Although
Mexico has achieved nearly universal coverage in primary education and 58 percent coverage in lower
secondary education, only a small pool o f academically well-prepared children from poor and indigenous
families graduate from highschool. Indeed, two thirds o f the inequality in tertiary education inMexico i s
inherited from inequality in the completion o f secondary education. Expanding coverage and improving
quality at the upper-secondary education level i s therefore essential for more equal access to tertiary
education. The last third o f inequality i s due to lower transition rates from secondary to tertiary education
 among low-income youth compared to students from higher income families. This difference i s expected
to grow in the future due to (i)   the growing,role o f private institutions inmeeting the demand for tertiary
 education; and (ii)  the recent expqnsion o f secondary education in Mexico. In order to provide more
 opportunities for tertiary education 'for low-income and indigenous youth:

         There is a needfor a coherentfinancial aid program that includes a scholarship program. The
         lack o f a coordinated program causes high drop-out and repetition rates among l o w and middle-
         income students. A recently initiated government program, Programa Nacional de Becas para
         Educacidn Superior (PRONABES), provides scholarships to poor students. Evaluations show
         that this program decreases drop-out and improves academic outcome o f its target group.
         However, the program i s fiscally expensive and could be more consistently implemented.
         Nevertheless, provision o f scholarships i s necessary in order to spur enrollment o f lower income
         students into tertiary education. Lessons learned from previous projects show that lower income
         families are unable and/or reluctant to assume student loan debt, because o f at least two reasons:
         (i)requirements for collateral; and(ii)fear ofdefaultingonthe loans due to either potential
         adverse labor market conditions in the future, or uncertainty o f academic abilities and
         unfamiliarity with credit in general. The challenge i s to enlarge the scope o f the current


                                                         23

        scholarship program to form a more coherent and effective financial aid system that combines
        scholarship and loans. Ari.expanded and improved program would provide the student with an
        individually-determined financial aid package that will allow the student to study while
        maintaining public subsidies at a minimum.

    e   There is a needfor additional support to studentsfrom disadvantaged student groups to assist
        them access and complete a tertiary education degree.
             o To improve access for disadvantaged groups, there is a need for early interventions
                 programs that prepare poor and highly talented students in secondary education to access
                 tertiary education. A poor and highly talented student in secondary education has a slim
                 chance o f continuing education at the tertiary level due to l o w quality o f secondary
                 education, unawareness o f support programs, and family and social environments that
                 lack experience and expectations o f tertiary education. Inhigh-income countries, such as
                 the US, UK and Canada, early interventionprograms in secondary education provide this
                 group o f talented student with opportunities to prepare for tertiary education. Programs
                 range from tutoring, advanced placement courses, student and parental guidance
                 programs, summer classes, part-time universities classes, and vouchers to private schools.
                 These programs have been shown to improve transition rates. The challenge i s to pilot
                 early interventions programs in Mexico and systematically evaluate whether such
                 strategic programs improve access to tertiary for disadvantaged poor and talented youth.
             o To improve completion of disadvantaged groups, there i s a need for academic and social
                 support to indigenous students in tertiary education that will help them complete their
                 degree. Given that the vast majority o f indigenous students i s the first family member to
                 attend tertiary education and in many instances the first member o f the local indigenous
                 community, there i s a greater need to bring additional, targeted support to this group o f
                 students. There exists only one pilot program inMexico that assists indigenous students
                 coping with greater academic challenges and a new social environment. The challenge i s
                 to scale up the program into institutionswith the highest density o f indigenous students in
                 a sustainable manner that will maintain the positive impact that the pilot program has had
                 so far.

The national tertiary education policy lacks the instruments to inform student decisions concerning their
choice of academicprogram and the linkages betweenprograms and labor market prospects. Only a few
tertiary education institutions collect information fiom the labor market regarding the performance of
their graduates. This limits the ability o f institutions and policymakers to ensure quality standards and
adjust courses to the needs o f the economy. Most importantly, students and their families are limited in
their ability to make good choices by the lack o f information on labor market outcomes. This i s becoming
increasingly important, since the increasing demand for tertiary education i s met by heterogeneous
providers. As in other countries, there are legitimate concerns that low-quality and low-relevance careers
offered by private fly-by-nightinstitutions could seriously indebt students, harm financial sustainability o f
student loan lenders and decrease the credibility o f tertiary education. Providing objective and reliable
information as well as strengthening monitoring and evaluation activities would empower consumers
(students), improve the market functioning and enhance sector governance. The challenge i s to strengthen
the existing information collection 8nd dissemination system to provide accurate and relevant information
to students, families, institutions and policymakers that will allow them to make the right decisions for
themselves.

                                   Annex 4: DetailedProjectDescription


Project components:

Component 1: Support for PRONABES nationalscholarship program and for the development of
the nationalregulatory framework for tertiary education student assistance (US$ 281.24 million or
93.7 percent o f total project cost). This component aims to promote the equitable expansion o f tertiary
education by supporting PRONABES scholarship program for academically qualified tertiary education
students demonstrating financial need, and to support the development o f a national regulatory framework
for assistance to tertiary education students.          This would be achieved through the following
subcomponents:

Subcomponent 1.1Supportfor PRONABESnational tertiary education scholarshipprogram (US$278.88
million). The Bank loan would finance approximately 58 percent o f the federal share o f PRONABES
scholarships budget, or the equivalent o f 29 percent of the total budget taking into account the
contribution o f the states. PRONABES scholarship would benefit an estimated 400,000 lower-income
tertiary education students inthe four years o f implementation. See Annex 16 for a detailed descriptiono f
the PRONABES scholarship program.

Subcomponent 1.2 Development of the regulatoy and supervisory framework for the national financial
aidprogram (US$2.36 million). This subcomponent aims to buildregulatory and supervisory capacity at
the federal level to (i)enhance the management and effectiveness o f the PRONABES scholarship
program, (ii)   coordinate the joint provision o f student loan and scholarship, which i s particularly critical
in a federal government system where state-level programs need to be articulated with each other to
promote economies o f scale and ensure overall system coherence and efficiency, and (iii)          ensure the
establishment o f a financially sustainable student loan system. These would contribute to both a more
financially   sustainable expansion o f tertiary education and a more equitable access. Financing would be
provided for technical assistance, consultants' services and incremental operational costs. The activities
plannedinclude:

a) Rigorous verification o f the applicatiop o f the PRONABES targeting criteria, including evaluation
     design, field test of evaluation instruments, baseline data collection through surveys o f household and
     institutions, and the analysis o fthe baseline data.

b) Enhancement o f PRONABES management information system (MIS) to include modules
     corresponding to the different types o f tertiary student assistance programs (scholarships, loans, and
     compensatory interventions for disadvantaged students), an administrative module, and instruments
     for the public dissemination o f the information;

c)   Strengthening o f PRONABES scholarship program through technical assistance for the supervision
     o f state-level program implementation;

d) Issuance o f national guidelines for state-level student loan programs in collaboration with
     BANOBRAS, and technical assistance to facilitate the creation and development o f student loan
     programs in other interested states.      This technical assistance would be provided through three
     national workshops per year;




                                                       32

e) Technical assistance for the supervision o f state-level student loan program implementation;

f ) Feasibility study o f a reimbursable grant scheme whereby students pay a share o f their future market-
    earnings into a national scholarship fund to be used in the financing o f future student grants. If
    implemented, this would increase the sustainability o f the PRONABES scholarship program.

g) Program administration would be strengthened through the contracting o f four (4) long term
    consultants specialized in financial management and procurement, management information system,
    program evaluation, and technical assistance to improve efficiency o f state level programs. Financing
    would also be provided for operating costs.

Component 2: Analysis and institutional strengthening (US$ 1.73 million or 0.6 percent of total
project cost). This component aims to support tertiary education policy and strengthen sector institutions
through studies, dissemination o f information, and monitoring and evaluation activities. The activities
planned would be carried out by SEP through the Under-Secretariat for Higher Education under the
following subcomponents:

Subcomponent 2.1 Promotion and information dissemination (US$ 0.76 million). This subcomponent
aims to create a reliable information database on the labor market performance o f tertiary education
graduates and on nationally accredited tertiary education programs, and to disseminate this information to
students, tertiary education institutions, and the public at large. The instrument would build on an already
developed Labor Market Observatory in the Secretariat o f Labor (Secretaria de Trabajo y Previsidn
Social-STPS).     Financing would be provided for consultants' services, technical assistance, media
coverage and workshops.

Subcomponent 2.2 Analysis and      regulatedframework      (US$ 0.82 million). This subcomponent aims to
provide the analyticalbase to strengthen tertiary educationpolicy. The following studies are planned:

a) Means to enhance tertiary education equity.
b) Financingalternatives for tertiary education.
c) Quality assurance mechanisms for tertiary education.
d) Means to enhance the linksbetweentertiary education andthe productive sector.
e) Feasibility study for the creation o f an income-contingent reimbursable grant program. The topic for
     this study mightbe modifiedshouldthe,incoming Administration in2007 set different priorities.

A consultative group formed by national and international experts would be contracted to provide quality
                                      I


 assurance for the development o f the proposed studies, through two review meetings-one at midterm
 and a second upon the completion o f the studies.

 Subcomponent 2.3 Evaluation of student assistanceprogram (US$ 0.15 million). This subcomponent
 aims to consolidate the results of the evaluation o f student assistance programs carried out under
 Components 1, 3 and 4 and disseminate the evaluation results.            Financing would be provided for
 consultants' services to design the mechanisms to aggregate evaluation data, for preliminary analysis and
 for dissemination o f the information.

 Component 3: Support for disadvantaged students (US$ 5.91 million or 2.0 percent of total project
 cost). This component aims to promote more equitable access to, and completion of, tertiary education
 through interventions designed to compensate for academic, social and informational disadvantages faced
 bypoor talented students. This objectivewould be achieved through two subcomponents.




                                                       33

Subcomponent 3.1 Early interventions to assist talented low-income students (US$ 1.22 million). This
subcomponent aims to test interventions that seek to improve the opportunities to enroll in tertiary
education for talented lower-income, upper-secondary students. The program would be targeted to high
school students who are beneficiaries o f the Jbvenes con Oportunidades program. The Oportunidades
program would also contribute by making available the database on its beneficiaries in the selected states
so to facilitate the design o f the pilot program and its evaluation. The subcomponent would be
implemented by SEP through the Under-Secretariat for Upper Secondary Education (Sub-Secretaria de
Educacibn Media Superior-SEMS). Participationby the selected states inthe form o f cost sharing would
be expected. The plannedactivities comprise:

a)  Selection o f one or two states interested inpiloting the program.
b) Designo finterventionsto bepiloted (see Box 2 below)
c) Design o f program evaluation and collection o fbaseline data.
d) Implementationand evaluation o fthe pilot program.

Box 2 Examples of Early Interventions Targeted to Upper-Secondary EducationStudents

                      More information should be made available about tertiary education
   Information        opportunities and financial aid.      The information could be provided to
  dissemination       upper-secondary students through workshops, written materials, websites,
                      visits to local universities, and keynote speeches duringschool assemblies.
                      School-based counsels could offer guidance to upper-secondary students
    Counseling        regarding     tertiary   education    opportunities,  career  choices,  entry
                      requirements, procedures to access financial aid for tertiary education, and
                      other issues affecting the student's decision-to continue studying.
                      Individual tutoring that would follow the academic develop o f the students,
     Tutoring         and help them (aridentify areas were they need to put more effort, and (b)
                      help prepare them for college entrance examination. Tutoring could be
                       offered to interested second and third year upper-secondary students as an
                       optional after-school activity, but volunteer teachers and/or more advanced
                       students.
                       Leveling courses in key subjects-such       as Spanish, Math and Science-
 Leveling courses      could be offered to upper-secondary students to help them improve their
                       competency level to meet tertiary education entrance requirements. These
                       courses could, be offered during in the school year on weekends, and/or
                       during the Summer vacations at the high school or at local university
                       campuses.
   Scholarships        Special scholarships to enroll in high quality local private schools could be
                       offeredby the private sector to poor and talented upper-secondary students.
                       T o promote higher expectations among talented low income upper
   Role modeling       secondary students and their parents in order to help them visualize tertiary
                       education as a viable option, role modeling interventions could be designed
                       thereby successful upper grade students from the community and
                       community leaders act as role models to high school students and their
                       parents are critical decision making times in the student's high school
                       career.
  General Criteria     In all cases, the participation o f the selected upper-secondary students in
                       any o f these activities to be piloted would be voluntary.

Subcomponent 3.2 Expansion of the Indigenous Students Assistance Program (US$ 4.69 million): This
subcomponent aims to improve the education outcomes for indigenous students who are enrolled in
tertiary education institutions, through the strengthening and expansion o f the existing Pathwaysprogram,
currently financed by the Ford Foundation and implemented through the National Association o f
Universities and Tertiary EducationInstitutions (Asociacidn Nacional de Universidades eInstituciones de
Educaci6n Superior-ANUIES).          The expanded program would finance Academic Support Units (ASU)
in public universities selected on a competitive basis. These ASUs would provide tutoring, academic
support, remedial courses, commuiity outreach and information on available financial aid programs to
indigenous students through institution-based coordinators and tutors. Thus far, program evaluations
show that beneficiaries have higher completion rates and improvements in academic performance.
Duringphase I, program is expected to be expanded to an additional seven to nine tertiary education
                 this
institutions in seven states with high percentage o f indigenous population (Oaxaca, Guerrero, Yucatan,
Sinaloa, Michoachn, Nayarit and Chihuahua).          The proposed expanded coverage o f the program i s
expected to benefit approximately 3,000 new indigenous students. This subcomponent would be
implemented by PRONABES through a collaboration contract with ANUIES, and in accordance with the
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) described in Annex 10. ANUIES would be directly
responsible for the selection o f the participating universities, the management o f the program at national
level, the transfer of funds to the participating universities inthe form o f grants to finance their respective
programs, and for the monitoring and evaluation o f program implementation and impact.                     The
participating universities would be responsible for providing services to their indigenous students and
their communities, as described in Annex 10. The grants to ANUIES and to the universities would
finance the following activities:

     Technical assistance for high priority tertiary education institutions to develop competitive proposals
     for program participation;       -
     Support for program coordinators and tutors, including training for new and existing university staff;
     University extension courses and community development activities.
     Student extracurricular activities.
     Equipment, furniture and accessories for the ASUs.
     National and regional workshops, conferences and special seminars.
     External program evaluation.
     Enhanced programmonitoring system.
     Programpromotion and adminipation.

Component 4: Support for state-level student loan programs (US$ 10.58 million or 3.2 percent o f
total project cost). The objective o f this component i s to support financially sustainable state student loan
programs that are consistent with the national tertiary education policy, and in the long term to build an
effective tertiary education student assistance system.. The component would be implemented by state
student loan agencies with financing from a national development bank, BANOBRAS. This objective
would be achieved through the following subcomponent:

Subcomponent 4.1 Support for stag-level student loan programs (US$ 10.58 million). In phase I,the
 sub-component would be implemented by the Student Loan Institute o f the State o f Quintana Roo
 (Instituto de Cre'dito Educativo del Estado de Quintana Roo-ICEEQROO).            Specific activities would be
carried out in accordance with the BANOBRAS and the ICEEQROO Operations Manual, and include
 student loans and institutional strengthening. The ICEEQROOwould be financed through on-lending by
BANOBRAS, with the guarantee o f the state, supporting student loans, and goods and services aimed at
institutional strengthening and program evaluation. Operating costs would be financed with state funds.
To ensure sustainability, the Institute would be capitalized with funds to constitute a Reserve Fund
 sufficient to cover losses associated with non-performing loans.

The following box summarizes the national guidelines for state-level student loan programs. These
criteria would be further developed by PRONABES and BANOBRAS in conjunction with specialists
with experience from the commercial sector duringphase I.The responsibility o f enforcing these criteria
belongs to BANOBRAS and PRONABES, as part of their program coordinating role. Enforcement could
be based on recommendations from a specialized external firm contracted to supervise the individual
state-level student loan agencies.   ..

                           Box 1State-Level Student LoanProgram Criteria

;inancia1 soundness          The state has confirmed its willingness to participate in the program
                             n accordance with these criteria and has provided evidence of its
                             :apacity to assume the debt corresponding to the BANOBRAS loan
                             mdto repay it under the terms o fthe loan.
ndependent and               The state has established the legal foundation for a student loan
irofessional governance      igency that i s an autonomous legal entity with competent professional
                             staff and non-political, competitively selected executive management.
Long term capitalization     The state student loan agency can demonstrate that it has adequate
strategy                     ;apital to support its proposed lending operations in a sustainable
                             manner, that it has a long term capitalization strategy and will
                             maintain a reserve fund o f no less than 10% o f the gross amount o f
                             student loans outstanding to cover non-performing loans and other
                             risks.
Policy consistency           The state student loan agency has agreed to offer loans to tertiary
                             cducation students in amounts not to exceed their demonstrated
                             capacity to repay in full according to objective eligibility criteria. The
                             interest rate must be close to the cost o f capital and inno matter less
                             than 2 percent above the expected inflation rate. Selection criteria
                             will favor students who score in the upper half o f the EXANI I1
                             tertiary education admissions test or, in the case o f students already
                             enrolled in tertiary education, whose academic performance i s above
                             a pre-defined and communicated level.
Transparent and sound        The state student loan agency has adopted an operations manual that
operating procedures         guarantees transparent, sound lending practices and implemented a
                             verified information system, both satisfactory to the Bank and
                             SEPA'RONABES.
Normative compliance         The state student loan agency has agreed to comply with the national
and external supervision     norms     for    student  loan   programs     to   be    established    by
                             SEPA'RONABES, including utilization o f the services o f a credit
                             bureau as an instrument to reward prompt repayment and sanction
                             non p a p e n t . The state student loan agency has further agreed to
                             being supervised in the future by an external, national, specialized
                             credit agency (or to permit its auditors to examine its operations
                             according     to    substantially  equivalent,    additional     oversight
                             procedures).
 Clear, rigorous and         The state student loan agency has agreed to (i)       operate a tracking

It is expected that Component 4 would be expanded to at least three additional states inphase I1of the
proposed APL. T o promote a financially sustainable, transparent and efficient student loan system,
PRONABES with the assistance o f BANOBRAS and external consultants, would continue to enhance
and enforce the national rules applicable to student loans. Commitment to comply with these rules on the
part o f a state would be a requirement for programparticipation.

Component 5: Promotionof private investmentsinstudent loans(US$0.12 million or 0.04percent o f
total project cost). This component i s planned for later phases o f the APL. The component would be
implemented by BANOBRAS.            Its objective i s to stimulate the mobilization o f private capital for
financing student loans, contributing to the expansion o f private student loan agencies and leveraging the
resources o f public student loan agencies. The design o f this component would be based on a study on
alternative financing for higher education that would be undertaken in phase Iunder Component 5. The
study would examine the following issues:

a) H o w best to attract private investment in student loans.
b) Alternative institutional arrangements for the public sector in the area of student loans, including
     ways to reduce political riskand ways to engage the private banlung sector inlending.
c) H o w to build a database o f information supporting private investment instudent loan.
d) How to create economies of scale inthe administrationo f state andprivate student loanprograms.

The activities that would be implementedinphase I1under this component would be consistent with the
findings o fthis study.

                                Annex 6: ImplementationArrangements

The Borrower: The Government has requested two loans from the Bank to finance the proposed project; each
would be made to different borrowers. The first loan would be made to the United Mexican States to support
the activities to be carried out by SEP pertaining to Components 1, 2, and 3. Government designated the
National Bank o f Public Services and Works (Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Pziblicos-BANOBRAS)
as the financial agent for this loan. The role o f BANOBRAS as financial agent, including the flow o f fund
between the Bank loan, BANOBRAS, the National Treasury and SEP, would be detailed in a mandate contract
to be entered into by SEP, the Secretariat o f Finance (Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr6dito Pziblico) and
BANOBRAS.

The second loan would be made to BANOBRAS, which would on-lend to ICEEQROO with the guarantee o f
the State o f Quintana Roo. This loan would support the activities to be carried out by Instituto de Crddito
Educativo del Estado de Quintana Roo (ICEEQROO) pertaining to Component 4. BANOBRAS would act as a
borrower for this loan. The terms and conditions applicable to the loan between BANOBRAS and
ICEEQROO, including the flow o f funds, would be specified inthe corresponding loan contract. The draft loan
contract betweenBANOBRAS and ICEEQROOwould be available by Negotiations.

Project Operations Manual(s) for the implementation o f the proposed program, satisfactory to the Bank, would
have been adopted by SEP, BANOPRAS and by the ICEEQROO by Negotiations.

Project Executing Agencies: The proposed program would be implemented at the federal level by SEP
through coordination o f PRONABES, a program under the Directorate General for Higher University
Education (Direccidn General de Educacidn Superior Universitaria-DGESU)           o f the Under-Secretariat for
Higher Education (Sub-Secretaria de Educacidn Superior-SES)          and by the Under-Secretariat for Upper
Secondary Education (Sub-Secretaria de Educacidn Media Superior - SEMS). Further support would be
provided by the Directorate General for Legal Affairs (Direccidn General de Asuntos Juridicos-DGAJ)        and
the Directorate General for Budget Administration and Financial Resources (Direccidn General de
Administracidn Presupuestal y Recursos Financieros-DGAPRF)           at SEP. PRONABES would have direct
responsibility for the execution o f the scholarship program, for establishing the regulatory framework for
tertiary education student assistance programs, and for carrying out, with the collaboration o f ANUIES the
proposed expansion o f Pathways Indigenous Students Assistance Program (Subcomponent 3.2). To carry out
subcomponent 3.2, collaboration agreements would be entered into between SEP and ANUIES and between
ANUIES and the participating universities; the draft o f these agreements would be available by Negotiations.
PRONABES would be responsible for the implementation o f activities pertaining to policy analysis and
institutional strengthening (Component 2). In the case o f Subcomponent 3.1, the responsibility for
implementation o f the early interventions would be assigned to the Under-Secretariat for Upper Secondary
Education (Sub-Secretaria de EducacidnMedia Superior-SEMS)         workmg incoordination with PRONABES.

At state level, student loan agencies would be the executing agencies for the student loanprogram(Component
 4). Inphase I,the ICEEQROO would have the responsibility to implement the student loan program in the
 State o f Quintana Roo. In subsequent phases o f the APL, as other states express interest inparticipating and
 demonstrate readiness for implementation, their respective student loan agencies would also be designated
project executing agencies for Component 4.

 Financial management and disbursement arrangements are specified inAnnex 7 and Annex 8, respectively.

                  Annex 7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements


Country Issues. The Mexico Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was completed in
October 2003. The CFAA focused on the federal level public sector, which i s considered to have
generally sound financial management (FM) systems and institutions. Country Financial Management
(FM)riskwas ratedas Moderate and all individualrisk factors were ratedLow or Moderate.

The impact o f the CFAA on the Project FM system i s direct for one Bank loan (out o f the two Bank loans
for this project) because its project implementation will be handled by a federal level entity, the
Secretariat for Public Education (Secretariade Educacidn Publica), Specifically by the Sub-secretaria de
Educacidn Superior through PRONABES unit (Programa Nacional de Becas para la Educacidn
Superior), and by the Sub-Secretaria de Educacidn Media Superior. The latter will be coordinated by the
PRONABES unit.

The impact o f the CFAA on the Project FM systems i s indirect for one Bank loan (out o f the two Bank
loans for this project), specifically for the state level operation with the state level student loan agencies,
which in phase Iworld be the Instituto de Crddito Educativo del Estado de Quintana Roo (ICEEQROO).
The reason for this i s that the CFAA didnot include FMat the state or municipal level.

All executing agencies will receive support from a national development bank Banco Nacional de Obras
y Sewicios Publicos, S.N.C. (BANOBRAS), which will act as Financial Agency for the two Bank loans,
and as Borrower for the operation with the state level student loans. The UnitedMexican States (UMS)
shall be the Borrower for the loan supporting SEP. The U M S i s represented by the Secretariat o f Finance
(Secretariade Hacienday CrdditoPtiblico).

FinancialManagementAssessment(FMA). The main objective o f the FMA conducted for the project,
was to evaluate the FM arrangements for the project and the capacity o f SEP and ICEEQROO to
effectively manage and implement the project and to provide the Bank with accurate and timely
information. The main conclusion i s that current financial management arrangements for the Bank-
financed project are operational. While the main strength o f SEP i s the informatiodmanagement system
which the Secretariat uses for its regular operations and which will be utilized in the Bank financed
project, the main weakness i s its lack o f experience with FM for Bank-financed projects. The main
weaknesses identified for ICEEQROO are its informatiodmanagement system, staff turnover and lack o f
experience with FMfor Bank-financed projects.
ProjectManual:FMsection. The FMsection o fthe project Operations Manual (OM) includes detailed
information on the following areas.

Executing agencies. SEP will be the mainproject executing agency and will have overall responsibility
for the implementation o f the project. The ICEEQROO through BANOBRAS will also be an executing
agency o f the project, responsible for carrying out the student loan program in Quintana Roo, the first
participating state inthe project inphase Io f the APL. SEP and ICEEQROO through BANOBRAS will
have responsibility for project financial management with respect to their corresponding components,
implementation activities, and loans.         SEP i s a national level secretariat and ICEEQROO i s a
decentralized entity o f the executive branch o f the state Government o f the State o f Quintana Roo which
coordinates its operation with the State Secretariat o f Education and Culture (Secretaria de Eduacidn y
Cultura del Estado de Quintana Roo).

Fundsand Information Flows. Bank funds of both loans may flow from Loan Accounts to the Special
Accounts (one for each loan). These accountswill be managedby the financial agency BANOBRAS and
will be established in U S dollars at the Mexican central bank Banco de M&xico, BANOBRAS or any
commercial bank to be accepted by the Bank. For the PRONABES loan, BANOBRAS, as financial
agent, will transfer funds to TESOFE basedon a mandate contract signedwith SEP andthe Secretariat of
Finance (Secretaria de Hacienda y Cre`dito Pziblico). These Special Accounts will be utilized to
reimburse the GoM through the National Treasury (TESOFE), however the GoM may opt for direct
reimbursing to TESOFE without using the Special Accounts. The section on "Disbursement
ArrangementsandRetroactiveFinancing" provides informationto complementthis section.

Regardingthe loan supportingSEP, SEP will receive funds inMexican Pesosvia its standard budget from
the National Treasury (TESOFE). TESOFEwill be reimbursedat the end of the cycle. Counterpartfunds
will be part of standard budget of SEP and will be usedto complementBank funds. Both Bank funds and
counterpartfunds will be registeredin SEP's standard budget intwo separated budgetary lines earmarked
for the project.

Concerningthe BANOBRAS loan, the loan contract between BANOBRAS and ICEEQROO will be the
base for the transfer of funds from BANOBRAS to ICEEQROO. BANOBRAS will receive Bank funds
in US dollars, and then will transfer them to the state student loan agencies, which in phase Iwill be
ICEEQROO.

Recognizing expenditures upon transfer for some components is justified in the proposed Bank-financed
project based on the following: (a) the executing agencies record expenditures upon transfer; and (b) the
executing agencies plan and monitor the use o f the transfers as follows: (i)sub-project agreements
identify the activities to be financed and provide the estimated cost; (ii)               the executing agencies carry out
technical supervisiodmonitoring of agreements; and (iii)               the executing agencies review audit reports o f
entities receivingtransfers.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. SEP and ICEEQROO maintain records and accounts adequate to
reflect, in accordance with accounting practices compatible with International Accounting Standards and
incompliancewith localnationaland state requirements, their operations and financial condition. Forthe
Bank-financed project, accounting policies and procedures would include records and separate accounts
to be used in the project.           However, since ICEEQROO's existing FM arrangements need to be
strengthened, a set of actions to this effect were recommended to ensure readiness.

Information Systems.          Regarding the loan supporting SEP, SEP's existing systems, which will be
utilized for the proposed School-Based Management Project as well (a Bank-financed project which will
be implemented by the Under-Secretariat o f Basic Education), are considered acceptable to the Bank.
These systems will track every project transaction and produce required information (except for some
parts o f the FMR e.g. project indicators). SEP i s utilizing for the operation o f its standard programs the
 federal treasury system SIAFF and in-house but institutional systems, which i s used in combination with
 spreadsheets.

 Regarding the loan supporting the state student loan agencies through BANOBRAS, ICEEQROO's
 existing arrangements require important modifications, particularly to improve reporting and budgeting.
 ICEEQROO will implement actions to ensure that systems will track every project transaction and
 produce required information.

 K e y FM staff. The staff o f SEP, BANOBRAS and ICEEQROO have qualifications and public sector
 experience adequate to undertake all FM tasks related to these loans under the Bank-financed project.
 The risk-inthis area for ICEEQROO i s the combination o f understaffing and turnover. The Bank will



                                                          47

closely follow-up ICEEQROO's staffing to ensure that it i s adequate for the project before negotiations
and effectiveness and duringthe entire implementationperiod o f the project.

FinancialReporting. SEP and ICEEQROO will prepare, on quarterly basis, information inthe format of
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). Regarding the loan supporting SEP, SEP will consolidate the
information and submit, through BANOBRAS, to the Bank consolidated FMRs for the Bank-financed
project. Concerning the BANOBRAS loan, BANOBRAS will consolidate the information and submit to
the Bank consolidated FMRs for the Bank-financedproject. It i s expected that there will be various forms
and levels o f financial reporting.

Regarding the loan supporting SEP, the FMRs will be complemented with the Financial Statements o f the
project. Concerning the loan supporting ICEEQROO, its FMRs will be complemented with the Financial
Statements o f the project and o f the entity. All Financial Statements will be annually audited inline with
the corresponding Bank policy and requirements(see next subsection onInternal and External Audit).

The FMRs will not form the basis o f disbursement, as it i s agreed that SEP will submit to the Bank, via
BANOBRAS, information in a report (agreed during appraisal) for disbursement purposes; and the state
student loans institutions, in phase IICEEQROO, will submit Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs) for
disbursement purposes (see next subsection onDisbursement Arrangements)

Internal and ExternalAudit. The project will be audited by internal and external auditors. These audit
reviews will be carried out according to Bank requirements which are fundamentally based on the new
audit policy approved in January 27, 2003. This policy requires audited annual Financial Statements o f
the two Bank loans (supporting SEP and ICEEQROO through BANOBRAS), and project executing
agencies (in this case only the entlty's Financial Statements o f ICEEQROO). For the proposed project
both executing agencies will be audited on annual basis, in accordance with auditing standards, by
independent auditors (a private firm for ICEEQROO and the Organo Interno de Control de la Secretaria
de la Funcidn Pziblica en la Secretaria de Educacidn Pziblica for SEP) under Terms o f Reference
acceptable to the Bank.

As soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end o f each audited year, both
executing agencies, through BANOBRAS, will furnishthe corresponding audit reports to the Bank.

DisbursementArrangements.
Method. Disbursements (Loan withdrawal applications - WA) will be prepared in accordance with
guidelines set out in the Bank's Disbursement Handbook. Specifically for the loan supporting SEP, the
project will utilize the report-based disbursement approach for its requests; and for the loan supporting
ICEEQROO, the Bank will reimburse uponrequest and against Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs).

 Thresholds and supporting documentation. The Bank's Loan Department will determine the threshold for
 submittingsupporting documentation, which will be reviewed as part of the project audit. Documents in
 support o f disbursements will be maintained by each project executing agency for at least until one year
after the Bank has received the aud[t report for the fiscal year inwhich the last loan withdrawal was made.
 Such documents must be available for` review by the auditors and Bank staff at all times.
 Ver$cation of supporting documentation. The independent auditors will verify the eligibility for Bank
 financing o f funds disbursed under parts A.l. and (2.2. o f the Program. Said scheme consists o f the
 following steps:
     (a) The percentage o f eligible expenditures under both grant programs during the year being audited
         i s estimated by auditing the documentation o f a sample o f grants and extrapolating the result; and




                                                      48

     (b) Such estimated percentage of eligible expenditures is compared to the percentage of each grant
         program financed by the Bankunder the loan agreement.
Ifthe estimated percentage is higher than the maximumpercentage financed, the contractual requirement
i s considered to have been met.
Should the percentage estimated by the auditors be lower than the percentage financed by the Bank, the
Borrower would submit new documentation o f eligible expenditures.

Special Account (SA). The project may establish inBanco de Mdxico, BANOBRAS, or any commercial
bank a S A in U S dollars for each loan. BANOBRAS will be responsible for the management o f these
accounts (thereby carrying out monthly account reconciliations, and submitting Bank-Form 1903
periodically). BANOBRAS will be responsible for the overall coordination o f project reporting and
auditing.

The Special Accounts will maintain a "zero balance" status, but may receive Bank funds to reimburse the
National Treasury TESOFE. It will therefore have occasional balances, for a brief time until the transfer
is made to TESOFE. It may be possible for the SEP loan to disburse directly to TESOFE, and for the
BANOBRAS loan to disburse without utilizing the corresponding Special Account.

SEP and ICEEQROOwill provide all needed information on project operations to both BANOBRAS and
TESOFE to ensure proper flow o f funds (see the Flow ofFunds and Information section above for further
details).

Retroactive Financing.       The project will be eligible to submit for retroactive reimbursement,
documentation on expenditures totaling up to 10% o f each loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred
during the period betweenthe dates of the official Project Appraisal (April 29, 2005) and signing o f the
Loans Agreements.

ProcurementinMexico: recent developments

Procurement o f goods, services and works financed by the World Bank under the first phase o f the
Program would be carried out in accordance with World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" published in May 2004); the hiring o f consultants would be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers" published in May 2004), and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and in the
Procurement Plan.

The Bank has agreed with the Government o f Mexico to accept the full-fledged use o f the
COMPRANET as vehicle for the Bank-financed procurement for N C B and ICB pursuant to paragraphs
2.11, 2.18, 2.44, 2.45 and other parts of the Procurement Guidelines o f M a y 2004. In order to remove
some perceived obstacles for international participation in Bank-financed procurement, COMPRANET
has agreed that: (a) the bidding documents will be free o f charge; (b) will adopt The Hague Convention
on national certification of the back-up, paper signed copy o f the signature of the prospective bidders and
will enter into relevant agreements with countries that have not signed that Convention as needed, and
(c) will add a facility inthe system to post the ads indgmarket and W D B possibly through the use o f the
Bank's Client Connection. The bidding documents for ICB will be the same as those used in the pilot
program successfully completed as of July lst,   2004, the only difference being the addition o f arbitration
clauses and a 45-days period for bid submission.

The Secretaria de la Funcidn Pziblica (SFP) and the Bank have agreed on a new generation o f standard
bidding documents for goods and works under NCB. These documents are to be used by all federal
purchasing entities for international procurement under the national law and for all NCB procurement
financed by the Bank. Such documents would require several modifications due to recent changes to the
Law. The Bank, IDB and Government reached agreement on a harmonized Request for Proposals
package in October 2005. The Bank has completed two sector studies: one at the federal level and
another one at the state level in order to determine the acceptability o f the country systems in
procurement and other fiduciary areas, and to monitor and evaluate government procurement
performance at the state level. The findings o f the studies continue demonstrating that Mexico has robust
procurement procedures.

Procurementof GoodsandNon-ConsultingServices:

         Goods and Non-Consultirig Services procured under the program would include information
technology equipment and software, office equipment, air conditioning units, vehicles, rental o f office
building, data warehouse and internet services, and furniture totaling US$300,000 equivalent. N o ICB or
N C B procedures are expected under the program. Consequently, contracts estimated to cost less than
US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract as defined in the annual review o f the procurement plan, will be
procured usingshoppingprocedures or its more formal equivalent o f the federal law known as Invitacidn
apor lo Menos Tres Personas.

Employmentof Consultants

         Consultant services would be procured inaccordance with "Guidelinesfor the Use of consultants
by the World Bank Borrowers and the Bank as Executing Agency", published in May 2004 and the
agreements in the procurement plan. Consultants services will be contracted under this Program include


                                                      51

audits, and advisory services in financial institutions, legal and information technology. These services,
estimated to cost US$5,060,000 equivalent, will be procured using the methods QCBS and Selection o f
Individuals. The short list o f consultants, estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent per contract,
may comprise entirely national consultants, in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the
Consultant Guidelines.

        Firms. All contracts for firms would be procured using QCBS procedures except for small
contracts for assignments o f standard or routine nature and estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO
equivalent that would be procured using Least Cost Selection, up to an aggregate amount o f US1.0
million or as defined inthe annual procurement planreview.

        Individuals. Specialized advisory services would be providedby individual consultants selected
through comparison o f qualifications o f at least three qualified candidates. They would be contracted in
accordance with the provisions o f paragraphs 5.1-5.3 o f the Consultant Guidelines as defined in the
annual procurementplan reviews.

        Prior Review Thresholds: The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the
procurement capacity assessment o f ICEEQROO and SEP, and are summarized inTable B. Inaddition to
the prior review o f individual procurement actions, the plan and proposed budget for the program would
be reviewed and approved annually by the Bank.

         ProcurementPlan

         The ICEEQROO and SEP prepared a global procurement plan for project implementation has
been agreed upon. The global procurement plan provides information for the Table A. At the beginning
o f eachyear, the Borrower will update the Procurement Plan with a detailed procurement schedule for the
coming 18 month-period.

         Procurement Monitoring

         Inaddition to the prior review supervision to be carriedout by the Bank, the capacity assessment
o f the institution recommended: (a) one full annual supervision mission, and (b) based on the overall high
risk assessment, the post-review field analysis should cover a sample o f not less than 1 in 5 contracts
signed. As capacity o f the implementing agencies increases, the overall risk can be lowered to "average".
This would reduce the post-review field analysis to not less than 1in10contracts.

                                Annex 9: Economic andFinancialAnalysis


This Annex provides summary information on the state of tertiary education (TE) inMexico and a cost
benefit analysis o f the project. Mexico has one o f the lowest enrollment rates among upper-middle
income countries in the region. At the same time spending on higher education i s misallocated with the
subsidies concentrated among the richest groups o f the population. The relatively high returns to TE
education inMexico (10 percent) combined with the relatively low enrollment rate suggest the presence
o f significant constraints inaccessing and financing tertiary education.

1.       Link to CAS, sector analysis, country policies/programs

Given that the project objective i s to help the Government o f Mexico (GM) to expand tertiary education
(TE) coverage with equity, it fits well with the Country Assistance Strategy for Mexico, which is focused
on reducingpoverty and inequality, and increasing competitiveness.

Mexico has one o f the lowest enrollment rates among upper-middle income counties in the region.
Figure 1 shows the gross enrollment rate2 for several Latin American countries. Note that Mexico's
performance i s inferior to that o f Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela by the end o f the 1990s.

Despite the fact that enrollment in Mexico has been increasing during the 1990s, by 2004 it i s estimated
that only 21 percent o f the population inthe 19-24year age group attends a higher education institution.

Also, in terms o f the enrollment rate, Mexico i s close to the average o f all Latin American countries, but
underperforms relative to upper-middle income and OECD countries.
Inadditiontothe lowperformance ingrossenrollmentrates, itseemsthatMexicohas alowefficiencyin

Inaddition, Table 2 shows the resultsofabenefit-incidence exercise. Public gross enrollment per capita
has the same pattern as the gross enrollment rate; consequently, estimated per capita public spending i s
 very regressive across the income quintiles.' That i s to say, for a student inthe poorest quintile among 18-
 24 year olds who attend tertiary institutions, the government spends on average 38 pesos; in contrast, for
 the richest quintile, spending is 1,158 pesos.

The benefit-incidence estimations are supporting evidence for promoting equity and efficiency in the
higher education sector. The expansion needed has to include the poorest students, but it i s needed that
such an expansion provides the right incentives to complete tertiary education on time in order that
government can make an efficient use o f the resources.

Moreover, the returns to education are relatively high. On average, the annual rate average private rate o f
return to investment in education i s 10 percent. With the actual trend o f public spending in tertiary
education and the high returns, income distribution will not improve at all. However, high returns to
schooling point toward education as a powerful tool to help students from the poorest income levels (see
Figure 3).

Therefore, demand for high level skills is high and should be profitable for the individual, thus there
should be highprivate demand for higher education.

However, there i s underinvestment in higher education since middle and lower income students
(households) cannot afford the full cost o f higher education (direct and opportunity costs). Moreover, they
cannot easily borrow to finance their studies (capital markets failure).

2.      Alternatives considered and rejected
                     -

(1)Do nothing-"no      project" alternative. This will result in persistent regressive public spending and
possibly a future underinvestment in tertiary education. As can be seen inFigure 4, tertiary enrollments
have increased steadily since 1980 and real spending on higher education is highly pro-cyclical, that is,
during the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 higher education public spending decreased sharply. Moreover,
since 2002 real spending started to decrease while enrollments maintainedan increasing trend.

(2) Expand higher education with public finances. Since public finance i s scarce, the expansion o f
tertiary education through taxes i s unsustainable, and this alternative i s inequitable if targeting i s not
reallocated to the students at the lowest tail o f the income distribution (see benefit-incidence analysis
presented in Table 2). The scarcity o f public funds i s visible in Figure 5, which shows that per capita
public spending inreal terms has been practically constant since the mid 1990s. Consequently, increases
in public resources devoted to higher education have been barely covering inflation and enrollment
growth.   However, actual enrollment trends reflect a future high demand for higher education that
government will not be able to finance inthe long run.

(3) Expand higher education with fees (cost-recovery). An expansion o f tertiary education based on
cost recovery will have a limited impact since the lower income students are not able to afford the actual
cost o fpublic higher education. For example, the annual average cost (for the government) o f a student in
public tertiary education i s 43,000 pesos (US$4,000) and, according to the Household Survey, the poorest
two income quintiles have an annual average income lower than 32,000 pesos.                    Consequently, only
wealthy students will enroll and income distribution will not improve to favor poorer families.

(4) Income contingent loans with tuition fees - the ideal situation. There are two main types o f
student loans. The mortgage-type scheme has a specified time period, with fixed payments. In many
countries, mortgage type loans were introduced in an effort to minimize risks. Under this type o f loan,
students make equal installments o f fixed payments over a specified period.            This minimizes the
uncertainty for the borrowers since,payments are fixed. Opponents o f mortgage-type student loans argue
that they limit access to tertiary education because the payments take up too much o f graduates' income
and the needy do not have the income necessary to meet payment schedules. In addition, mortgage-type
loans do not provide the additional - or new-resources needed for universities. It i s costly to the public
since students borrow public money, loans carry an interest subsidy, and administration costs are high.
Default rates are high as not all graduates are able to meet installments, even well after they have
completed their education. It mobilizes no private funding and government i s burdened with having to
single-handedly provide higher education financing.

An alternative to mortgage-type loans are income-contingent loans. Under this type o f loan, students are
able to defer payments untilthey are working and after they have reached a certain level o f income. This
scheme allows the needy, and notjust the wealthy, access since they are not expected to start contributing
during their study years. It also has a lower default rate since the loan repayment is contingent upon
income. Income-contingent loans are also more equitable and satisfy more fully the ability-to-pay
principle, since graduates' payments are in direct proportion to their income. Administration i s generally
simpler and cheaper under such schemes because loan recovery i s handled through existing collection
mechanisms (such as the income tax administration, where applicable, or through payroll).
However, this option requires a lotI,o f information to function properly; for example, the administrators
need information on graduates, their income, location, and so on, inorder to effect repayment. Therefore,
income contingent repayment programs work best in countries that have well developed tax and
collection systems (for example, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom). Therefore, this i s
only a mediumto long-term solution for Mexico.

(5) Scholarships andLoans- alternative acceptedas the bestoptioninthe short term
Given the present constraints associated with the implementation o f income contingent loans the
alternative option pursuedthrough this loan i s the implementation o f a scheme that combines scholarships
withthe establishment o f sustainable student loans schemes at the state level and early interventions.

The scholarships targeted towards poor students in TE accompanied by the early interventions aimed
towards increasing the graduation rates o f poor and indigenous students from secondary schools promote
the equity components o f the project.

The student loan programs will address liquidity constraints and promote efficiency through the
expansion o f access to credit for higher education. It i s well known that access to credit for investment in
human capital, such as education, may be limited due to informational problems such as moral hazard and
adverse selection. Both o f these factors tend to induce lenders to increase their risk premium and impose
collateral requirements for loans that tend to exclude the poor from access to credit. There i s evidence for
Mexico that "liquidity or borrowing constraints" play an important role in the decision o f students to
enroll in TE. Canton and Blom (2003), for example, using the 2000 ENIGH survey report that students
who receive some kind o f financial support have a 24% higher chance o f enrollment into a university
program. Using a sample o f 19-21 year olds from urban Mexico, Jacoby and Skoufias (2002) find that
borrowing constraints have a significant andnegative effect on the enrollment rate o f students inTE. Both
o f these studies suggest that liquigity constraints are likely to be even more important among poorer
families.

Choice o f Loan System

(a) National or decentralized system

The principal advantages of a national student loan program are (1) the ability to buildeconomies o f scale
inthe "back room" operations ofthe student loanprogramand (2) the ability to influencerepayment on a
national scale.    Once students complete their education, they fi-equently move to other parts o f the
country. It i s difficult for state student loan agencies to maintain contact with people who leave the state
and to keep pressure on them to repay. However, a national loan program requires a national source o f
capital and a national program management superstructure, neither o f which exists inMexico today.

The delivery and collection o f student loans require close coordinationamong students, their parents, their
schools and the loan provider. These are not the kinds o f activities that improve with scale. In addition,
where the states are providing the loan funds, it i s inevitable that each state will want to limit its loans to
students who live in that state and to implement its own ideas about what program features are important.
These inherent differences among similar state programs offer a unique opportunity to compare the results
achieved by the different states.

(b) State-direct or state-guaranteed system

States that provide subsidies or guarantees to commercial banks to make student loans clearly get the
greatest number of loans for each dollar o f public funds. Inaddition, commercial banks already have in
place most o f the infrastructure required to deliver an efficient student loan program: they have systems to
deliver and collect loans; they have systems o f internal controls; they have external audit agencies; and
they have offices inevery town and city neighborhood.

On the other hand, states have a lower cost o f funds for making student loans, which provides the lowest
possible student loan interest rates. Moreover, in Mexico, people have more trust in government than in
banks, which may be essential to,overcome a cultural resistance to borrow money to finance higher
education.

3. IndigenousPeople

Students from indigenous groups have a l o w participation in higher education; near 6 percent o f total
indigenous population from 15-and-older years o f age has a high school or a tertiary education degree.
However, this low participation i s the result o f problems from early educational levels that leave ill-
prepared indigenous students for higher education, mainly inupper secondary level.

Besides the academic barriers, indigenous students face economic and social barriers that hamper
enrollments o f this group inTE. For example, in2002, an individual that lived ina municipality where 10
to 40 percent o f the population i s indigenous had an average income equivalent to 46 percent o f the
income o f a person ina non-indigenous municipality (Garcia and Ramirez 2005). Similarly, an individual
in a predominantly indigenous municipality (above 40 percent indigenous) had an income equivalent to
only 26 percent o f the income o f a person in a non-indigenous municipality. Even with similar education
levels, indigenous people have a much higher probability o f being poor than do non-indigenous people.
The indigenous population with no education i s more than twice as likely to be extremely poor than the
non-indigenous population without education. Rather than narrowing with increased education, this gap
grows as higher educational levels are attaified. For individuals with incomplete secondary schooling, the
probability o f being extremely PO& i s five times larger if you are indigenous than if you are not, and
almost ten times higher ifyou have completed secondary education (see Table 3).

Despite significant improvements in education over the past several decades, considerable educational
differences persist between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. Illiteracy rates and dropout
rates continue to be substantially higher among the indigenous population. Average years o f schooling,
on the other hand, are much lower for indigenouspeople. Educational gaps, however, are closing rapidly
in the younger generations. The average hon-indigenous individual born before 1939 has 120 percent
more years of schooling than an"indigenous individual o f the same age group.                A non-indigenous
individual born between 1979 and 1985, by contrast, has 26 percent more years o f schooling than an
indigenous individual born in the same period. And among 7-14 year-old children the indigenoushon-
indigenous educational gap i s down to 8 percent (Garcia and Ramirez 2005).

Indigenous peoples' returns to education are lower than for non-indigenous people (Garcia and Patrinos
2005).    Therefore, despite recent advances in indigenous peoples schooling attainment over the last
several decades, indigenous people will continue to lag behind the non-indigenous since their schooling
will result inlower labor market earnings.

Part o f the reason for the lower returns that indigenous people experience i s the quality o f that schooling
that indigenous people receive. Indigenous schools consistently obtain lower reading and mathematics
scores than all other types o f schools, regardless o f area o f residence. As evidenced by the scores, not
only do indigenous schools obtain significantly lower scores than urban public and private schools, they
also have poorer test performance than rural public schools and CONAFE community schools. In2002 a
 sixth grader from an indigenous school had 15 percent lower reading scores and 8 percent lower
mathematics scores than the average sixth grader nationwide. When compared with students from urban
public schools, sixth graders in indigenous schools had test results that were 16 percent lower inreading
and 9 percent lower in mathematics. Furthermore, even when compared with students from public rural
 schools, indigenous students performed poorly. The average sixth grader inan indigenous school had 10
percent lower reading test results and 6 percent lower results inmathematics than the average sixth grader
 inapublic rural school (Garcia andRamirez2005).

4. Cost-Benefit Analysis

(1)Sectoral rates ofreturn

Highprivate returns to TE inMexico suggest that is a good economic investment. Including the average
direct costs for TE the private rate o f retum to TE i s 10.4 percent, while the social rate o f return i s 7.1
percent.

Specifically, based on the Income-Expenditure Survey (ENIGH-Encuesta Nacional de Ingreso y Gasto
de 10s Hogares), which i s a nationally representative survey o f both urban and rural areas inMexico; in
2002 the investment on tertiary education yielded an average retum o f 16 percent. At the same time, there
are minor gender differences in returns to TE; for example, the rate of return for males was around 17
percent and about 15 percent for women. See table below.


                                    Table 7: Private Rates o f Returnto TE

                                     2000     18.0      19.1        16.0
                                     2002     16.2      17.1        14.8
                                     Source: ENIGH

Based on the National Employment Survey 2003 (ENET-Encuesta Nacional de Empleo Trimestral), using
individuals as the relevant unit for the assessment and ignoring the size o f the loanproject (i-e., number o f
beneficiaries and capital investments), a range o f the returns to TE can be estimated depending on how
the costs o f education are calculated. For a start, the private return considering only the opportunity cost
o f education (i.e. labor income foregone due to attending school) yielded a rate return o f 15.8 percent in
comparisonto only completing high school education; this result i s compatible with the estimations based
on ENIGH that were presented before. When the average annual costs o f TE, such as tuition fees and
supplies, are included in the measure o f aosts, the estimated rate i s lower but still high at around 10
percent. See table 8.                 3

The social rate o f return was estimated to be 8.3 percent. In addition to the private opportunity cost, this
cost estimate included the annual average cost for government o f TE which by 2003 was around 42,000
pesos (US$3,655). Finally, considering all social costs; that i s to say, opportunity costs, per pupil direct
cost inpublic universities and government per pupil costs inpublic TE, the estimated rate o f return i s 7.1
percent.

Insummary, at the individual level there is'a highprofitability on investing inTE incomparison to only
completing upper secondary education.

(2) "Project" ratesof return

The cost-benefit analysis will be focused on PRONABES beneficiaries because they are the main
benefited population from this project. Also, since more than 90 percent o f the total project costs are
devoted to the financing o f the school grants it i s important to estimate what will be the economic benefits
o f helping this group o fpeople.

Inthis exercise is consideredthat PRONABESis helping students to graduate fromTertiary Education.
However, there is not enough evidence o f this case because PRONABES has been in operation since
2001. Also, there has not been a study that rigorously measures the impact o f PRONABES on terminal
efficiency, thus the available preliminary data showed: 1) in a sample o f the technological universities
almost a 100 percent of the PRONABES beneficiaries enrolled in the last school year was graduated; 2)
drop out rate for PRONABES beneficiaries i s lower than students that are not beneficiaries o f the
program.

Assumptions. Inreality receipt o f a scholarship does not necessarily lead to graduation and graduation
does not guarantee employment in the labor market. Therefore, for this analysis we make the following
assumptions:
     0   The impact o f the project will be on the terminal efficiency o fbeneficiaries
     0   The expected change in te&inal efficiency will be the proportion o f increased earnings that will
         be attributedas benefits o fthe program
     0   Studies are completed in 5 years
     0   Students start their studies at age 18 and graduate and start working at age 23 untilretirement at
         age 65 and
     0   All graduates are automatically employed.

Number of beneficiaries. Specifically, it is assumed that PRONABES will maintain the actual level o f
140,000 grants per year. Given that 60 percent o fthe current grant beneficiarieshave their grants renewed
(estimation based on the observed percentage o f renewals), this implies that a total o f 308,000 individual
studentswill bebenefitingfrom a grant over a periodo f 5 years.

Age-earningsprofile.Based on the information from the National Employment Survey (ENET-Encuesta
Nacional de Empleo Trimestral) the average lifetime earnings for a higher education graduate and a high
school graduate are estimated (see Figure 7). Even though university graduates enter the labor force later
than high school graduates who do not go to university, they pay lifetime earnings that are higher than
those for high schools graduates, and this advantage persists over the entire working lifetime (assuming
retirement at 65 years old).

Benefits. The benefits will be determined by the impact o f the project on the terminal efficiency o f
beneficiaries. Particularly, the benefits are measured as the difference in the age-earnings profiles from a
university degree and the high school degree times the increase in terminal efficiency as a result o f the
project. Given that the first cohort o f PRONABES beneficiaries will not be graduating until2006 it i s not
possible to measure the terminal efficiency among PRONABES beneficiaries. Thus again one has to
resort to assumptions.

First,we assume a 40 percent o f terminal efficiency without the project and then we simulate the change
in benefits derived from increasing the terminal efficiency from 40 to 50 (low impact) from 40 to 60
percent (medium impact), and so on until we move the terminal efficiency from 40 to 100 percent (high
impact).

Costs. Fromthe society's point o fview the costs o fthe programare the total value o fthe grants given out
by federal government (USD 280.6 million) and state governments plus the opportunity costs or forgone
earnings from the decision o f studying and not working at an earlier age. The contribution o f the states
will be assumed to be 90 percent o f the total value of the grants given out by federal government. This
assumption i s based on what all the states have been contributing to the program, see table 11.

Economic Rateof Return(ERR) and Sensitivity Analysis. The estimates derived from the simulation
exercise yield that from the society's perspective the project will be beneficial as long as the terminal
efficiency among beneficiaries i s 60% or higher (see table 9 below). With a terminal efficiency o f 70
percent the ERR will be around 5 percent and the most favorable scenario will yield an ERR o f 10
percent. In this highest impact scenario the terminal efficiency moves from 40 to 100 percent which
means that approximately 308,000 students will complete higher education with financial help from
PRONABES grants.

5. Financial and Fiscal Issues

PRONABES i s a program designed by the federal government, but operated by states. Despite o f states
participation i s voluntary; they have been actively participating and co-financing the program in equal
amounts than the federal government. This shows the importance that states have been devoting to
support this grant program.

Table 10 shows the participation o f both government levels in the financing o f this program, in particular
it is notable that the total contribution from all states is almost as equal as the contribution from federal
government.

Interms o f the fiscal burden PRONABES is still a modest program. By 2004, PRONABES represented
only a 0.38 percent o f the total public education spending and 2.5 percent o f the total tertiary education
spending. Finally, these numbers show that grant interventions has a low cost for taxpayers and remain as
a promising way for increasing the number o f higher education graduates from the lowest income groups.

Introduction

Indigenous people's access to tertiary education in Mexico i s dismally low.          This contributes to a
marginalization o f indigenous people, reduces possibilities for escaping poverty and increases inequality
in the Mexican tertiary education system. The Government of Mexico and the World Bank actively
support that an increased number o f indigenous people attain tertiary education.

This Indigenous People's Development Plan (IPDP) identifiesbarriers for indigenouspeople's attainment
o f tertiary education. Further, it proposes a specific action plan to assist indigenous people overcome
these barriers.

The IPDP i s part of the Tertiary Education Student Assistance Project (PAEES) that aims to improve
equity and expansion o f Mexican tertiary education. Under the Bank's Indigenous Peoples' Policy (OD
4.20), a plan should be elaborated during project preparation to ensure the development o f indigenous
people. The plan devotes specific attention to the two program that will target assistance to indigenous
people: Component 1 Assistance to the National scholarship Program (Programa Nacional de Becas de
Educacidn Superior, PRONABES) will finance scholarships to indigenous student in tertiary education,
and Subcomponent 3.2 that will consolidate and expand Support Program for Indigenous Students in
Higher Education Institutions (Pyograma de Apoyo a Estudiantes Indigenas en Instituciones de
Educacidn Superior, PAEIIES), implemented by the National Association o f Universities and High
Education Institutions (Asociacidn Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educacidn Superior,
A W E S ) and financed by the FordFoundation's (FF) global program for Indigenouspeoples, Pathways.

The document has two sets o f main findingsregardingthe barriers o f indigenouspeople's to attain tertiary
education:
      0   The main findings from analysis o f socio-economic and educational data are: (i)Lack o f
          financing prevents many potential indigenous students from enrolling in tertiary education; (ii)
          The inadequate quality o fprimary and secondary education inrural areas restricts access to many
          young indigenous students who would like to enroll intertiary education; and (iii)    Owing to the
          disadvantaged rural location o f indigenous communities, potential students and their parents are
          unaware o f the opportunities for tertiary education and the possible careers.
      0   The main findings from consultations with indigenous people in six states and 18 higher
          education institutions are: (i)Indigenous people support the PRONABES national scholarship
          program; (ii) Itreduces, but does not resolve, the indigenous people's lack o f finance to pursue
          tertiary studies; (iii)The PRONABES program i s compatible with the social and cultural
          practices o f the indigenous people; (iv) indigenous people face difficulties complying with
          PRONABES paperwork requirements, and (v) The PAEIIES program i s effective in assisting
           indigenous students to access and complete tertiary education through academic assistance,
          information campaigns and assistance with paperwork.

The IPDP proposes an action plan to assist indigenous students, families and communities. The actions
seek to (i)assist indigenous students finance their studies through the PRONABES program; (ii)          assist
indigenous students academically through peer tutoring programs, and (iii)        assist potential indigenous
students and their families in choosing and enrolling into tertiary education through information
           .

       campaigns. The last two actions will be carried out through an expansion and consolidation o f the

       2 Brief description o f Mexico's indigenous population and its legal framework

       The National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Populacidn, CONAPO) estimates the indigenous
       population o f Mexico (defined as either speaking an Amerindian language or pertaining to an indigenous
       ethic group) to be 12.7 million. This figure approximates other estimates o f the indigenous population
       based on different social, cultural and demographic indicators (Indicadoresp. 20).    '
       For the purpose o f socio-economic variables, indigenous households within municipalities considered as
        indigenous have the following characteristics:

        Table 1 shows the distribution o f the total population over the age o f five. HLI(Habla lengua indigena)
        stands for indigenouspeople - definedas those who speak an indigenous language (Indicadores p. 25). It
        shows that indigenous people tend to live in areas with a high density o f indigenous population. 66.1%
        live in areas where 30% or more are indigenous people. However, 2.05 million indigenous people reside
        inmunicipalities where they are aminority.



          This IPDP is based on the following five main sources: (i) on-site community consultation already described
                                                                     The

Besides the academic barriers, indigenous students face economic and social barriers that hamper
enrollments o fthis group inTE. For example, in2002, an individual that lived ina municipality where 10
to 40 percent o f the population i s indigenous had an average income equivalent to 46 percent o f the
income o f a person ina non-indigenous municipality (Garcia and Ramirez 2005). Similarly, an individual
ina predominantly indigenous municipality (above 40 percent indigenous) had an income equivalent to
only 26 percent o f the income o f a person in a non-indigenous municipality. Even with similar education
levels, indigenous people have a much higher probability o f being poor than do non-indigenous people.
The indigenous population with no education i s more than twice as likely to be extremely poor than the
non-indigenous population without education. Rather than narrowing with increased education, this gap
grows as higher educational levels are attained. For individuals with incomplete secondary schooling, the
probability o f being extremely poor i s five times larger if you are indigenous than if you are not, and
almost ten times higher ifyou have completed secondary education (see Table 3).

Access to public services and doinestic possessions are lacking in most municipalities populated by
indigenous peoples. Nine out o f ten indigenous people lack a room for cooking; the space for food
preparationi s not appropriate due to direct contact with fumes and gas that endanger health, since 62% of
all households cook with charcoal or firewood. Only six out o f ten houses have access to piped water.
Seven out o f ten have access to independent sanitary services. 83% houses have electricity. Only two
households out ten have a computer. The limited services hinder the development o f capital and reduce
the social mobility o fthe indigenous population.

Overall, the living conditions o f Mexico's indigenous population are below those o f non-indigenous
students. One o f the main reason's for this i s lack o f education.      Improving access to all levels o f
education, including tertiary education, would therefore increase the welfare o f the indigenouspopulation.

Lesal Framework for Indigenous People
The acknowledgement o f the multicultural nature o f Mexico has increased since the late 1970s. The
Mexican Constitution has been modified several times in the recent past in order to expand and clarify
indigenous peoples' rights. Indigenous peoples' rights to their practices and traditions must continue to
be recognizedineach specific legal domain, and their living conditions must be improved.

The third and fourth sections o f article 7 o f the General L a w on Education establish that all institutions
that offer education shall: (i)  strengthen sovereignty and national awareness, and the knowledge of
history, patriotic symbols and national institutions, and the cultural traditions and particularities of all
national regions, and (ii)  promote, through the Spanish language, a common language for all Mexicans
while protecting and promoting the development o f indigenous languages.

Insummary, Mexican legislationoneducationrecognizes the righto findigenouspeoples, as Mexicans, to
 education, as well as the moral obligation to compensate centuries o f discrimination and lack o f
 opportunities, which are especially notorious at the tertiary education level.

                                   INDIGENOUS PEOPLE' ACCESS TO EDUCATION

Education improves individual capabilities through the acquisition o fknowledge and slulls. Therefore,
education i s a basic tool for social interactionand for adequate incorporation into the individual's social,
economic and cultural environment; it i s also a valuable asset for improving an individual's productivity,
wages and welfare. It i s only by attending school from primary to tertiary level that an individual can
exercise hisbasic constitutionalrightto education. Therefore, poor school attendance i s a social handicap
for any individual from any social group.

Despite significant improvements in education over the past several decades, considerable educational
differences persist between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. Illiteracy rates and dropout
rates continue to be substantially higher among the indigenous population. Data indicates that 25% o f
indigenous people over 25 years o f age do not read or write; 40 % o f indigenous people over 15 years of
age have not even completed primary education, o f these 18% have never been to school, and only 22%
have completed some years o f elementary school. On the other hand, almost two out o f ten individuals
from indigenous households have completed elementary school, and four out o f ten have completed post-
primary education (Indicadores, p. 34). Average years o f schooling, on the other hand, are much lower
for indigenous people. Educational gaps, however, seem to be closing in the younger generations. The
average non-indigenous individual born before 1939 has 120 percent more years o f schooling than an
indigenous individual o f the same age group. A non-indigenous individual born between 1979 and 1985,
by contrast, has 26 percent more years o f schooling than an indigenous individual born in the same
period. However, this gap will widen when the generation in question will reach secondary and tertiary
education, where enrollment differences between non-indigenous and indigenous are larger.

Despite recent advances in indigenous peoples schooling attainment over the last several decades,
indigenous people will continue to lag behind the non-indigenous since their schooling will result in
lower labor market earnings. This occurs because the Indigenous peoples' returns to education are lower
than for non-indigenous people (Garcia and Patrinos 2005).

Part o f the reason for the lower returns that indigenous people experience i s the quality o f that schooling
that indigenous people receive. Indigenous schools consistently obtain lower reading and mathematics
scores than all other types of schools, regardless o f area o f residence. As evidenced by the scores, not
only do indigenous schools obtain significantly lower scores than urban public and private schools, they
also have poorer test performance than rural public schools and CONAFE community schools. In2002 a
sixth grader from an indigenous school had 15 percent lower reading scores and 8 percent lower
mathematics scores than the average sixth grader nationwide. When compared with students from urban
public schools, sixth graders in indigenous schools had test results that were 16 percent lower inreading
and 9 percent lower in mathematics. Furthermore, even when compared with students from public rural
schools, indigenous students performed poorly. The average sixth grader in an indigenous school had 10
percent lower reading test results and 6 percent lower results inmathematics than the average sixth grader
inapublicruralschool (Garcia andRamirez2005).

The learning gap i s exacerbated trough the secondary education system. In2002 only 3.5 percent o f the
students that took the EXANI I1 (admission exam for Higher Education) spoke or understand an
indigenous language (thisvariable i s the proxy for identifyingan indigenous student). In2002 the EXANI
I1appliedthe exams to 258,660 students.

According to the EXANI I1test, the indigenous students are on average 17 index points below to rest o f
the population that took such an exam. Also the difference i s more pronounced in two key subjects for
success intertiary education: "verbal reasoning" and "mathematics".

The data document that indigenous students arrive at the entry point to tertiary education less prepared
than its non-indigenous peers. To increase their participation and completion rates o f tertiary education,
there i s a need for additional academic assistance in order to bring the indigenous student on par with
their colleagues. The IPDP's proposed actions will address this need.

3 Indigenous students intertiary education

Data on indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education institutions i s practically inexistent. The
Secretariat o f Education acknowledges this lack o f information and i s working towards remedying it.
Preliminary data collected by PRONABES authorities provides information on 15 out o f 28 Mexican
states, and on 2 out o f 5 national institutions with signed agreements. This data provides information on
6,078 indigenous students (3,271 male and 2,807 female). Unfortunately some states with a significant
indigenous population, such as Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Guerrero, Tabasco, and Michoacan, are not
included.

More reliable data regarding indigenous people with tertiary education comes from the 1997 Encuesta
Nacional en Zonas Indigenas (ENEZI) (National Survey in Indigenous Zones). According to ENEZI, o f
3,083,743 indigenous people over 5 years o f age, 62,230 had completed tertiary education (2%) and
 129,334 had completed upper secondary .education (4%). The transition rate from upper secondary

education to tertiary education i s only 50%, which i s below the national average. Furthermore, most
indigenous people with tertiary education have degrees in five fields: education (bilingual teachers), law,

The effort that has been started to gather data about indigenous people and tertiary education must
continue. Indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education institutions must become visible. Reliable
data i s needed in order to undertake a consistent and sustained follow-up o f the academic performance o f
indigenous students in tertiary education and to measure actions to ensure equity towards this
disadvantaged sector o fMexican society.

According to consultations with indigenous people, educators and government officials, indigenous
students are substantially more likely to drop out o f tertiary education and repeat classes. Consequently,
fewer indigenous students graduates from tertiary education than non-indigenous students.




                                                            74

A key factor to keep in mind is that indigenous people live in the poorest municipalities in Mexico;
municipalities which, in addition to inadequate economic conditions, have l o w and poor-quality
educational coverage. Hence the physical and cultural distance they must overcome in order to obtain
admission to and attend tertiary education i s an obstacle that not all qualified indigenous students can
surmount.      Once enrolled in a tertiary institution, indigenous students have cultural and social
disadvantages that prevent them from fulfilling the academic requirements relating to quality and time
that tertiary institutions demand from all students.

There i s hence a need for additional assistance to indigenous student to help them complete their studies.
Besides, overcoming the disadvantage o f having receiving-on average-a            lower quality secondary
education, the following section investigates the causes for lower transition rate, higher repetition and
higher drop out rates.

3.1 Obstacle, Vulnerability, and social risks for indigenous students

Research conductedwithin more than 20 communities and several tertiary education institutions indicates
that social and physical distance form critical obstacles that indigenous students from low-income
families must overcome inorder to participate intertiary education. Students must travel up to two hours
each way to attend courses. They must have money available for food and transportation. Daily
transportation costs may be as high 50 Mexican pesos (US$4). To avoid traveling long distances, some
students rent a room or share a room with relatives. Our data indicate that this costs 400 Mexican pesos a
month per student (US$36). When-livingaway for home, food costs 300 pesos a week (US$27). Also,
most tertiary institutions attended by indigenous students have sporadic charges that can add up to an
extra 1,000 pesos per month (USSSO) and, in addition, students must find money for photocopies, books,
other school materials, and appropriate clothing. The consultations identified a significant number of
disadvantaged students at the upper secondary education level (bachilllerato andpreparatoria) with few
opportunities to continue their education due to lack o f economic resources.

Furthermore, family and emotional costs must also be considered. Culturally and socially speaking,
students (as well as some o f the parents) interviewed recall traveling to and residing in, for the first time,
an urban environment where their language, lifestyle, and behavior appeared awkward and open to
discriminatory actions by others.

This disadvantageous situation becomes a social risk that demands compensatory actions to ensure
successful completion o f tertiary education. Failure to complete studies should not be seen as an
individual problem only; as we have shown inthe above social assessment, it i s also a problem for family
and community members, all o f whom have made important sacrifices in order to acquire increased
capabilities for their f h r e socio-economic development.

Indigenous people consulted manifested their approval o f the PRONABES scholarship program After
three years o f operation, the majority o f students consulted at tertiary institutions know about the
PRONABES grants that are aimed at marginal and extremely marginal populations and about the
minimum grade average requested (an average GPA of 8.0 is required to receive and maintain the
PRONABES scholarship).          However, some parents and potential university students are unaware o f the
 existence o f PRONABES. Participants inthe consultations asked for information about scholarships and
tertiary education institutions where the grant i s available. Students also mentioned the difficulties they
must confront in order to complete the paperwork required when applying for a scholarship. As some
recalled: information about scholarships i s not easily available and only for short periods o f time. Most
 applications must be completed at the beginning o f the semester, when students have just arrived in
 school, For those studying far from their places o f residence, the request for information about family
 income means an unforeseen expense, since they must obtain official information from the town hall o f


                                                      75

the municipality where their parents are officially registered although not necessarily residing; moreover,
such data i s not always ready in time for the applications. Two students mentioned difficulties because
monolingual authorities had to prepare such information. Subsequently, they never know the reasons why
they receive or are denied the grant; this means that many o f the parents and students interviewed assume
that grants are offered on a discretionary basis rather than on the students' own merits. There i s hence a
need for further dissemination o f the existence o f the PRONABES scholarship program among
indigenous communities with potential tertiary level students. Further, assistance with the submission o f
paperwork i s desirable.

It is a common practice for poor rural families to oblige the oldest adolescents to abandon the household
in order to gain a salary and, ifpossible, send money to the household. This tends not to be the case for
the other siblings, which i s why one finds the younger siblings attending upper secondary and tertiary
education rather than the oldest children. It i s only when the first child enters tertiary education that
parents overburden themselves in order to allow the other children to continue their studies beyond
secondary level.

Next, the most visible strategies developed to overcome the challenges involved in maintaining students
intertiary education arepresented.

3.2 Strategies to overcome the lack o f financing and transuortation

The obstacles presented above are surmounted using different strategies. The main strategy involves
students and parents working extra hours to increase earnings, which will help to overcome the main
obstacle to tertiary education: financing for tuition, transportation, lodging and substitution o f foregone
earnings.

Students, parents, and leaders, all recognized that "many sacrifices" must be made in order to maintain a
child studyingoutside their community. Data gathered duringfieldwork indicates the following:

Parents:
         The mother must work for a salary or cash-income: working on another farm, in an unskilled
         position in a factory, as a maid, catalogue salesperson, by expanding her domestic activities such
         as livestock care; two widowers decided to travel to the United States. They all said: "apretando
         el gasto" [cutting down on expenses].
         Both parents must work more hours each day; intensify use o f land resources; take on salaried
         activities, even if badly paid - many men work as unskdled construction workers, and on night
         shifts at factories or other institutions.
         Families become indebtedat highinterest rates, risking the loss o f their limitedpatrimony.
         They seek student support from members o f the extended family, or from co-parenting relations.
         They avoid investing inhome appliances and neededrepairs.
         Parents start a local business, such as a grocery store or a workshop; if successful, they encourage
         their children to study.
         And, they avoid communal responsibilitiesthat implyexpending time and money (fees for annual
         celebrations, mayordomias, pilgrimages, etc.

Students:
         Many try to avoid working, but if needed, they complement their parents' money and the
         scholarship, if they have one, by working on a part-time basis (as housekeepers, maids, shop
         assistants, car washers, waiters), often not mentioning it to their parents.
         Paid activities on weekends and duringvacations.

        They find an institution in`a town where relatives or godparents reside who are willing to give
        them board (normally inexchange for some housework).
        They sell food at school; share living expenses with other students; avoid visiting their parents.
        At best, they find apart-time job at the university.

Young people often have to make the choice between higher education or keeping a secure salaried job
for which further education i s not required. But data gathered indicated that students would often rather
loose a job than a scholarship; therefore when grades are threatened by salaried activities, the job i s
dropped.

Despite the foregoing, the data collectedproves that, as mentioned above, professional education reduces
social ties - rights and duties - within the community, to the extent that a cash income makes an
individual more independent from communal resources, either personal collaboration or access to natural
resources. This i s shown by the fact that indigenous professionals collaborate with their communities on,
at best, a sporadic basis, in most cases. One exception i s school teachers, because they are the only
professionals who have a permanent position within the communities, and this enables them to be
constantly involved and participating in community affairs.

A scholarship, even if it is low, to cover food or institutional fees becomes basic to fulfill        school
requirements. It certainly helps to overcome financial obstacles and, in this way, pave the way for
indigenous students to enrollment and completion o f a tertiary education degree.

         4   Indigenousueoule inPAEIIES

         In2001, ANUIES and FF initiated the PAEIIES program for tertiary education institutions with
indigenous students. FF finances university projects in order to establish Academic Support Units in
selected institutions attended by indigenous students. One o f the main objectives o f ANUIES, i s the
promotion o f inter-institutional activities that improve interactions between their member institutions. The
purpose o f the program i s to establish Academic Support Unitsthat foster innovative academic support to
indigenous students such as: tutorials, remedial classes, introductory courses, and fieldwork training,
which increase university completion rates and buildresearch skills by providing assessment on research,
which will prepare indigenous students for graduate education.

An inter-institutional committee was appointed, headed by FF and ANUIES, in order to discuss the main
guidelines o f the project, monitor injtial results, and consider options for future expansion. The committee
consists o f representatives o f FF, ANUIES, the National Council for Indigenous Peoples' Development
(CDI), SEP, CIESAS (Center for Research and Advanced Studies in Social Anthropology), and the
University o f Guadalajara's Center for Indigenous Community Development.

Despite its short period o f operation (3 years), the PAEIIES Academic Support Units have proved
 successful in improving academic performance among participating students. The project has had
multiple impacts on tertiary education institutions, students and the community. Among the most visible
 impacts are:
                                      t

    0    Acknowledgement that most tertiary education institutions lack awareness, knowledge or
         statistics about the presence or enrollment o f indigenous students.
    0    Increasedknowledge of indigenous students and a decrease indrop-out rates.
    0    Improvedor maintained grade point average.
    0    Specialized tutorial assistance to resolve specific concerns regarding the new environment where
         indigenous students study.



                                                       77

    0  Assistance inacceding to new technology, libraries and university services.
    0  Remedial courses to fillthe educational gap most indigenous students have, and
    0  Increased incentives for tertiary education institutions to enroll indigenous students through the
       provision o f additional funds for the necessary academic assistance

In2001, the committeeacceptedsixprojects, andin2002, fivemorewere selected, allfundedbythe Ford
Foundation. One institution from Chiapas lost its fundingdue to failure to fulfillprogram goals.

PAEIIES supports ten Academic Support Units; at the end o f 2004, a total o f 3,550 participating
indigenous students were registered inthe ASU:




                                    c




Despite its short 3-year life, PAEIIES units have proved successful with multiple and significant effects
on the tertiary education institutions (TEI), the students and their communities. Nevertheless, PAEIIES
academic units do not have mechanisms to overcome the obstacles confronting students at the upper
secondary level who have the capability to enter tertiary education.

The most visible effects that emerged from the three abovementioned evaluations included:

    0   Indigenous students 'enrollment at the ten TEI attended by PAEIIES had increased from 1,309 in
        2001 to 3,697 by the end o f 2004, representing an increase of 182%; mainly because more
        indigenous students decided to enter the program knowing its benefits. From the initiation o f the
        program in 2001 to December 2004, PAEIIES delivered more than 343 academic courses,
        seminars, and workshops. In addition, the program provided more than 12 different kinds o f
        services, ranging from tutorials and vocational guidance to psychological and pedagogical
        guidance, to almost 4,000 students.




                                                     78

    0   Academic performance of the participating students increased from an average GPA o f 7.9 in
        2001 to 8.4 by the end o f 2004.

    0   Improved sustainability in funding. Two additional sources o f funding were obtained: (i)
        ANUIES asked the Secretariat o f Education for it's support to contribute to the sustainability o f
        the program. In 2005, SEP allocated US$50,000 in funding for the program, and (ii)          Funding
        from participating institutions. Motivated by the impact, the development and the professional
        management o f this program, the FF, the ten TEI and ANUIES created a matching fund to
        continue the original program. Now, the two-year one grant donation has been increased to a
         five-year program via three grants made by the FF amounting to almost US$3,000,000. The 10
        TEIparticipating inthe programhave channeled more that US$750,000 o f ownresources into the
        development and management o f the program.

Despite its initial signs o f success, the PAEIIES program faces challenges to scale up its impact:

    0   Expanding into geomaphical areas and institutions with a highdensitv o f indigenouspeople. The
        program currently covers only 10 tertiary education institutions in Mexico. None o f these
        institutions are in the southern states where a large proportion o f indigenous people. Inorder to
         expand into these states, the program requires (i)    additional fbnding for the program. This i s
         included as Line 1 o f the budget, and (ii)   support to institutions with a higher proportion o f
         indigenous students.      These institutions were not selected in previous (competitive) rounds,
        because their proposals for academic support units were enough well-prepared compared to other
         proposals. There i s therefore a need to provide support to institutions with a high density o f
         indigenous student, which will raise the quality o f their proposals. This is included as Line 2 o f
         the budget.
    0    Reduce turn-over of tutors and coordinators. The program has so far relied exclusively upon
         voluntary workers and helpers. This has led to a high turn-over among tutors and coordinators,
         which threatens to destabilize the program and reduce its effectiveness. To reduce the lose o f
         tutors and coordinators, the program could introduce an reward for participation inthe program. It
         should not be a salary, but an incentive and recognition o f the efforts that tutors and coordinators
         have invested inthe program. This i s includedas Line 3 and 4 o f the budget.


5 Benefits for indigenous people from PRONABES and PAEIIES (through the proposed PAEES Proiect)

The Tertiary Education Student Assistance Project, with the support o f the PAEIIES program, will seek to
improve indigenous peoples' access to and completion o f tertiary education. To ensure an appropriate and
efficient use o f the funds, the IndigenousPeoples' Development Plan includes the following items:

Financial aid. In order to overcoqe the main obstacle for indigenous student to enroll and complete a
tertiary level degree, PRONABES will assist these students, specifically:

     0   PRONABES has offered to ensure that all indigenous students attended by PAEIIES units, and
         who qualify, will receive a scholarship. PAEIIES units help students with the paperwork and
         procedures that can impede access to scholarships. By the end o f 2004, 730 students were
         receiving a PRONABES scholarship; another 1,246 students were receiving scholarships from
         their own universities, NGOs, or the National Commission for the Development o f Indigenous
         Peoples (CDI).

their coverage, and the effectiveness o f PAEIIES-funded units for academic assistance to indigenous
students.
                                       1
Expansion of academic assistance to student in tertiay education. Through an expansion o f the PAEIIES
academic assistance units, at least an additional 3,000 indigenous students will receive aid. The expansion

        Prioritize assistance to institutions in states with a strong presence o f indigenous peoples,
        including but not limited to: Oaxaca, Guerrero, Sinaloa, Yucatan, Michoacan and Chihuahua.
        Offer o f technical assistance to tertiary education institutions in such states so as to raise the
        quality o f the prepared proposal.
        Develop an incentive programfor specialized tutors and unit coordinators.
        Periodically monitor each unit program. It should be part o f the SEP parameters for excellence.
        Organization o f a periodic evaluation o f the program.
        Workshops, conferences, seminars, and specialized courses inorder to attain program goals, share
        experiences and good practices, and increase interaction between students from different ethnic
        groups, with different experiences.
        Training o f tutors for indigenous students inenable the latter to better achieve their goals.
        Establish information programs for the indigenous communities in order to diffuse the
        opportunities intertiary education.

6 Monitoring and Evaluation o fthe IPDP
As a final and general conclusion, there is no doubt o f the PAEIIES and PRONABES social benefits for
the indigenous population. Nevertheless, the implementation o f the proposed plan must be evaluated and
monitored in the medium and long term. Its real success has to be constructed through daily practice in
every tertiary institution. Statistics on indigenous students at tertiary level must be developed in order to
monitor the IPDPadequately.

The success o fthe PAEIIES and the concomitant financial aid support from PRONABES i s firstly:
         The completion degrees o f supported indigenous students.
Secondly, the program will be measured on its ability to expand its impact to more institutions and
therefore help more indigenous students enroll and complete a tertiary level degree. This i s measuredby:
         The number of indigenous students supported

These two indicators are also the IPDP's key performance indicators. Each academic unit will collect the
data, which will be organized by ANUIES and disseminated on a semi-annual basis.

           Annex 12: NationalScholarshipProgramfor Tertiary Education(PRONABES)


Objectives and OperatingRules:PRONABES is a federal government program, created in 2001, with
the objective of expanding coverage o f tertiary education with equity. The program gives non-
reimbursable grants to lower-income students to help finance their tertiary education careers. The
program operates with the participation o f state governments and tertiary education academic institutions.
Since its creation, demand for the program on the part o f the states and universities has been strong. As
o f December 2004, PRONABES has celebrated 37 Program Agreement including with the 31 states and
with 6 universities. The participating universities are: Universidad Autdnoma Metropolitana (UAM),
Universidad Autdnoma de MCxico (UNAM),Instituto PolitCcnico Nacional (IPN), Escuela Nacional de
Antropologia e Historia (ENAH), Escuela Nacional de Biblioteconomia y Archivonomia (ENBA) and the
Universidad Pedagdgica Nacional (UPN).             Thus, the program includes State PRONABES and
Institutional PRONABES, depending on whether states or academic institutions sign a Program
Agreement with SEP. Program Agreements are renewed yearly, confirming the financing arrangements
and the operatingrules for program applicable to that year.

Decentralized Operational Arrangements: The State PRONABES are administered by Technical
Committees comprising representatives from tertiary education institutions o f the state, the state
government, SEP and ANUIES.           The Institutional PRONABES are also administered by Technical
Committees integrated by representatives of the university teachers, the university administration, and one
representative o f SEP. The executive secretary o f these Technical Committees i s generally the secretary
o f education of each state.

Financing Arrangements: The original federal allocation for the program (MxN$248 million in 2001)
was determined based on a study carried out by SEP o f the potential demand for tertiary education from
lower-income students. Funding for the program i s determined each year based on commitment made by
the participating parties, thereby the federal government matches the financial commitment made by the
states and the participating universities. The amount o f share contributed by party varies according to
their budgetary availability, but Tust ensure enough funds to cover commitments made to students
already enrolled inthe program. Inother words, once a student receives the first annual scholarship he or
she i s guaranteed to continue receiving scholarships through the end o f their tertiary education career.
Each participating state and university must establish a Trust Fund (Fideicomiso) to manage program
funds. Funds are transferred from the federal budget by SEP and deposited inthe 33 Fideicomisos, which
inturn is entrustedto issuemonthly checks to the beneficiary students. Each Fideicomiso is responsible
for the financial management o f its respective part o f the program and SEP i s responsible for the overall
financial management based on aggregated data provided by the operating units.

Periodic Adjustment to Program,OperatingRules:Every year SEP releases an updatedversion o f the
operations rules for the PRONABES program. This practice allows for modifications that can improve
the operation o f program over time. Federal PRONABES funds may also be used to support other grant
programs administered by the states, provided that (a) the program i s deemed successful, (b) operates
with rules similar to those o f PRONABES, and (c) obtained a satisfactory rate in the evaluation carried
out by SEP.

Selection of Beneficiaries:The operating norms o f the program are established at federal level by SEP
and appliedby the participating states and universities. The selection o f beneficiaries in carried out intwo
stages. Ina first stage, tertiary eduoation institutions (not necessarily only the "participating" universities)



                                                       83

receive applications from students, verify their academic eligibility for enrollment and convey the names
o fthe eligible students to the state or the institutionalTechnical Committee. The final selection is made in
the second stage by the Technical Committee based on evidence o f financial need, but also talung into
account the tertiary education program selected by the student. It i s possible, for example that preference
be given to specific careers that are considered strategic for the development o f the state (Box 1).

     -                         Box 1.PRONABES Scholarship Eligibility Criteria-
     To be eligible for a PRONABES scholarship the student musthave:
         1. MexicanNationality
         2. A highschool degree or equivalent completed
         3. Proof o f acceptance in a public institutions for higher educations in Mexico, including
              technical and polytechnic universities
         4. Or be a current student ina Mexican institution for higher education with current and past
              academic qualifications showing satisfactory approvals and credits
         5. Not have any additional grant or other source o f financial support provided by a private
              or public institution at the time the student applies for a PRONABES grant4
         6. Not have a prior undergraduate or technical higher education degree
         7. Family income family less or equal to 4 (four) minimumsalaries

     [f the above requirements are complied with, the student's application is given priority for
     receiving a scholarship according to the following order o f criteria:

                  a. L o w family income
                  b. Low family income with priority for students that attend schools locatedinrural,
                        indigenous and urban-marginal communities or who are beneficiaries o f the
                        OPORTUNIDADES program
                  c. Academic achievements
                  d. Having been accepted to enroll in or be currently studying at high qualio
                        program accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of the Highei
                        Education (Consejo para la Acreditacidn de la Educacidn Superior-COPAES:
                        or by the Inter-institutional Committees for the Evaluation o f Higher Educatior
                        (Comitbs Interinstitucionales para la Evaluacidn de la Educacidn Superior-
                        CIEES).

         PRONABES scholarships are renewed every school year. The approval o f the grant renewa
         i s contingent upon the student having:

 Preferential Targeting: Over time PRONABES has strengthen its targeting policy favoring indigenous
 students, even though the participation o f indigenous students i s still very low. For example, in Chiapas
 only 5 percent o f the grant beneficiaries are indigenous and in Oaxaca about 22 percent. In absolute
 number the two states combined have only 892 indigenous students holding PRONABES grants, this
 number i s in line with the number o f indigenous students who graduate fiom      ,upper-secondary education
 although it i s small considering the large indigenous population o f those two states. Preference in grant
                                        4

  PRONABES will as part o f the institutional development examine whether it would be bringbenefit to the student
 and savings to the state ifthe PRONABES grant inthe future can be combined with other sources o f assistance.

awards is also given to the beneficiaries of the Oportunidades program; in the state o f Oaxaca
approximately 21percent o f the PRONABESbeneficiaries are also Oportunidudes beneficiaries.

Variations in the Family Income Eligibility Criteria: In 2001, 60 percent o f the beneficiaries had a
family income o f less than 3 minimum salaries. Because o f regional differences, some states-
particularly the Northern states-asked   PRONABES to raise the family income eligibility threshold to 4
minimum salaries.      The change in income threshold became effective in 2003. A comparison of
beneficiariesby income level in2001and 2003 i s given inFigure 1.

According to PRONABES, the observed increase in coverage o f higher income students occurred in the
richer states but not elsewhere. Nevertheless, a careful analysis o f this modification in the eligibility
criteria i s warranted, as the change may have resulted in constraining the access to grants for lower
income students.

Scholarship Amount and Terms. PRONABES scholarships support students attending traditional
university that have an average duration o f 4.5 years and grant a degree. The program also supports
students in enrolled Technological Universities or Institutes, offering tertiary technical education through
courses lasting on average 2.5 years. PRONABES gives incentives to students for graduating early, since
the amount of the grant increases as students move through their academic careers. The grants are
disbursed monthly and duringthe 12 months o f the year. Grant amounts vary as follows:

Program Coverage: Program coverage has increased steadily since its creation.                  The number o f
beneficiaries grew almost three times from 44,422 in 2001-2002 to 122,642 in 2002-2003, and it i s
expected to reach 160,000 students in the 2004-2005 school year. The coverage o f the program as a
percentage o f the total enrollment in universities and technological tertiary education institutions has
increased from 2.4 percent in2001 to 6 percent in2003 (see table 2). At present, PRONABES i s the most
important grant program in Mexico supporting tertiary education students. In number o f grants, SEP
estimates the participation o f PRONABES as representing 61.2 percent o f the total number o f publicly-
funded grants inMexico (Source: PRONABES-SEP).

Distributionof Grants by Study Area: The majority of the grants are given to students enrolled in
traditional universityprograms: in 2003 these represented 89 percent o f all grants and only the 11percent
o f the grants was awarded to students attending technological institutes or universities. It i s interesting to
note that in 2001 the distribution o f the grants by study area favored engineering and technology
programs-which      absorbed 48.6 percent o f all grants, while social and administrative sciences programs
have 27.8 percent o f the grants. It i s not clear to what extent the distribution o f grants among study areas
i s actively encouraged by the states based on their labor market needs.


PRONABES Resources: The importance of PRONABES in total education spending is still modest as
shown in Table 3. A s percentage o f the total higher education spending PRONABES represents less than
2 percent o fthe total.

            Annex 13: The SupportProgramfor IndigenousStudentsinTertiary Education


Program Objectives andDescription

The proposed project would expand the ANUIES-Ford Foundation program to Support Indigenous
Students in Tertiary Education Institutions (PAEIIES).      This annex succinctly presents the program,
summarizes the undertaken evaluations and recommendations to scale-up and improve the program.

The PAEIIES forms an integral part o f a series o f Mexican initiatives that recognize diversity and seek to
promote equity in tertiary education. It responds to indigenous students' needs and promotes their
academic success through completion o f tertiary education studies. The PAEIIES i s framed within the
overall Mexican Strategic Plan for Tertiary Education which contributes to the program success and
allows partnerships with governmental and non-governmental institutions. The higher education system
in Mexico is not been able yet to ensure equal access to tertiary education institutions for poor and
disadvantaged students, inparticular indigenous students. Among the Mexican student population, only 1
percent i s indigenous students, which compares to an overall share o f the population o f around 10 percent.

The program finances academic support activities for indigenous students currently enrolled in tertiary
education institutions to increase their completionrates, improve the quality of education, and allow them
to qualify for graduate programs. Inthis regard, it promotes equity in access to tertiary education. The
program presently attends around 3,700 indigenous students, which represents less than 2% o f the
indigenous students enrolled inMexico's tertiary education system.

The program invites, through a technical committee (Cornitdde Gestidn),tertiary education institutions to
present proposals for program participation on a competitive basis. The proposals are evaluated and
awarded based the following five criteria: (i)Commitment by the Institution, President and/or Rector; (ii)
potential number o f indigenous students reached through the program, (iii)general information about
their institution, programs and stuqents; (iv) Quality of proposal and the detailed project description for
the creation o f a Academic Support Unit (ASU) to assist indigenous students, and (v) Evidence that the
institution possesses an appropriate academic structure to establish a ASU. The ASU will be responsible
for promoting indigenous students enrollment, and deliver special services to its indigenous students, such
as academic and technical support, orientation, tutorials, and psychological support and other services that
benefit indigenous students well being and academic performance

The ANUIES administrates the program and monitors, supervises and audits the participating tertiary
education institutions. In each participating institution, the President or Rector i s accountable for the
program, but its daily operationrelies on the Coordinator o f the AUS and a group o f tutors that implement
the program.

The PAEIIES program was initiated as part o f a global program, Pathways to Tertiary Education,
supported by the Ford Foundation. The program's goal i s to promote greater access and opportunity to
higher education for excluded populations worldwide.           As such, the program reaffirms the Ford
Foundation's historical commitment to advancing human achievement, promoting social justice and
alleviating poverty. Education, viewed as a vehicle to advance this goal, has received substantial
Foundation support. The Pathways program globally makes available between US$4 to 5 million per
year to support projects that increase access and graduation for members o f educationally
underrepresented groups. The focus of funding i s the institution, rather than the individual student, in


                                                     88

                                      ,




order to promote institutional commitment and increase the likelihood o f permanent change. Projects
supported may include efforts targeted at improving student readiness for college, the higher education
application and admissions processes, and efforts to increase the admission and graduation rate o f
underserved students. The PAEIIES program in Mexico i s among a group o f country program that has
received additional funding and attention from the Pathways program due to the well-functioning and
innovative initiatives.

Evaluation of the PAEIIES

Administrative monitoring and supervision. Duringthe first two years o f program implementation the
ANUIES focused its efforts in the identification o f the indigenous students registered in the program, as
well as designing and implementing a database o f indicators related to the academic history, personal
data, scholarships and information on the tutors working with the indigenous students. Emphasis was
given to indicators to follow up enrollment, registration, continuity in program participation, and
academic achievement. In this regard, the ANUIES evaluated the effectiveness of remedial courses and
tutoring offered to the students by comparing their GPA duringthe two years of program implementation.
In addition, indicators to monitor the management, continuity and program institutionalization in the
participating HE1were also considered. Supervision activities included biweekly communication with
program coordinators and two site visits per year to all participating HEI. The institutions were also
required to submit program implementation reports including program status, and academic and financial
performance twice a year.

The data collected by the administrative monitoring and supervision effort shows that the program
reaches its key objective:       (i)anincreaseof 171percentinthe enrollment ofindigenous student in
participating tertiary education institutions from 2001to 2004. Increased willingness to self-identification
as an indigenous explains part of this increase; and (ii)   academic achievement improved from a grade
point average o f 7.9 in2001 to 8.4 in2004.

Findings and recommendations of external evaluations. Besides the administrative monitoring and
supervision, two external evaluations were carried out to assess the program's impact and identify
recommendations for improvement..

Results o f the external evaluations confirm the results o f the administrative data: (i)       although the
indigenous students have participatedinthe program for a short period o f time, the increase intheir GPA
i s statistically significant, and (ii) increase inthe identified enrollment o f indigenous students. Further,
                                     the
the evaluations find an influence o f the institutional environment for diversity and inclusiveness. In
particular, the evaluation conclude that the program i s successful in promoting: (iii) inclusion o f
                                                                                            the
indigenous students in tertiary education programs and increase in the equity and diversity o f tertiary
education; (iv) improved personal yell-being o f the indigenous students; (v) more active participation o f
indigenous students within the higher education community; (vi) increased institutional commitment to
diversity and equity; (vii) intercultural dialogue between indigenous students and university staff to
reduce discrimination and prejudice, and (viii) the initiation o f an open regional and national debate
regardingthe ability o f higher education institutionsto respondto cultural, ethnic and language diversity.

The evaluations recommend five areas to improve the program's effectiveness: (i)         Scale-up to reach a
large share o f the indigenous students; (ii)  Reduce turn over o f tutors and coordinators which otherwise
jeopardizes the effectiveness o f the program; (iii)   Improve o f the tutoring program by comparing the
initial design and actual results, including tutor training; (iv) Ensure that remedial courses do not
duplicate the existing courses already offered by the institutions; (v) Include grammar and writing classes
in Spanish; (vi) Expand additional services to the indigenous students such as psychological counseling
and community programs; (vii) Continue the improvements in the monitoring system and promote the


                                                     89
         . .

diffusion o f the results and lessons learned; and finally, (viii) Continue developing a strong collaboration
with the participating institution's rector.

The PAEES Participation

The proposed program would build upon the above recommendations from external evaluations and
scale-up the PAEIIES program to assist more indigenous students to enter and complete a tertiary level
degree program. Incomponent 3.2, the Programwould support the PAEIIES program by:

Scaling-up the program. The program would include the participation 3,000 additional indigenous
students and expansion to other Mexican states that have some o f the highest indigenous population,
including Oaxaca, Guerrero, Yucathn, Sinaloa, Michoacin, Chihuahua and Nayarit.               Since program
participation i s on a competitive basis, activities would include the provision o f technical assistance to
promote the participation o f key higher education institutions with high percentage o f indigenous
students.

Promoting program sustainability. Program sustainability would be achieved by developing increased
commitment o f higher education institutions and strengthening their Academic Support Units as well as
the services provided to indigenous students, including tutor training and incentives.           In addition,
financial sustainability would be promoted by the gradual phasing out o f financial support to participating
higher educationinstitutions, which would be gradually institutionalizing the program.

Enhancing the program monitoring and evaluation system. Funds would be allocated to expand the
management information systems to improve program targeting, implementation and diffusion o f results.
Inaddition, programevaluations wouldbecarried-out onayearly basis.

                                        Annex 14: ProgramEvaluation
This program aims to assist the Government of Mexico in building a strong and efficient student
assistance system.     This can only be reached through the initiation o f a virtuous circle o f planning,
implementation, evaluation and change. For this reason the program emphasizes evaluation and learning
as a key strategy for successfully assist students to enter and complete a tertiary level degree. The impact
evaluations complement the Monitoring and Results framework presented in Annex 3 in the following
way: The continual monitoring through indicators allows the participating institutions to observe the
development in the main outcomes that the program seeks to influence. However, the indicators cannot
credibly establish the extent to which the development in the main outcomes i s due to the program's
efforts or due to factors external to the project. To establish a credible causality and quantify the impact
o f the program, rigorous impact evaluations are necessary.

The Annex describes the impact evaluations planned for the two largest components. Component 1
Support for PRONABES student Scholarship Program and Component 4 Support for State-level Student
Loan Program.

A. Evaluation of PRONABES National Scholarship Program. The PRONABES scholarship program
will be evaluated at national level to verify the equity impact o f the program as measured by the actual
percentage o f beneficiaries coming from its targeted population. To this end a verification o f the income
level o fbeneficiary students will be made through a nationally representative sample survey. This survey
will be carried out in APL 1 and will constitute the baseline for the evaluation analysis o f the program
when compared with a second survey carried out in APL-3. The expected outcome i s an improvement in
the targeting o f the program over the life of the APL. Responsibility for this evaluation lies with
PRONABES.

B. Monitoring and Evaluation of state-level student loanprograms. These evaluations will be conducted
at state level, starting with the state o f Quintana Roo. The number o f separate evaluations o f student loan
programs will be equal to the number o f participating states in each phase o f the APL. In all cases, the
expected program impact i s an increment in the efficiency, coverage and quality o f TE in the state.
Efficiency gains will be measured by the rate o f terminal efficiency at the tertiary education institutions in
the state.   Expanded coverage will be measured by the absorption rate o f upper-secondary school
graduates into TE. Quality gains will be measured by improved grade-point average among student loan
beneficiaries and by the share o f beneficiaries enrolled in accredited programs. Baseline data on these
impact indicators will be a condition for state participationinthe program; and subsequent measurements
will be done yearly duringallphases o fthe APL.

Specifically, for the monitoring o f the state-level student loan program in the state o f Quintana Roo, the
student information collected in the application form completed through the web, will be complemented
by ICEEQROO with the academic scores from EXANI11.

Regarding the designo f the impact evaluation, it was decided that a treatment and control group will need
to be established and followed over time. Given that ICEEQROO has scarce financial resources, it i s
highlyprobable that the Quintana Roo student loan program will face an excess demand for loans during
the first years of the program. At present, the plan i s for the ICEEQROO board to make the final selection
o f borrowers based on the list o f eligible candidates and three indicators aimed at facilitating the final
decision o f who can receive a loan. These indicators are:

               a. A score that indicates if the student i s a good candidate for being a borrower (the higher
                   the score, higher i s the probability o f receiving a loan from ICEEQROO)
               b. A variable o fthe economic necessity ofthe student
               c.  Socioeconomic status o f the student

The teams agreed on using one o f two possible methods o f selecting the treatment and control groups.
The preferred evaluation methodology i s the randomizedselection. The alternative methodology involves
the application o f an Encouragement Design.

Randomized selection method. This method would replace the final step o f the selection o f borrowers by
the ICEEQROO board with a randomized selection process whereby all the eligible candidates are
assigned into a treatment and control group. The treatment group will be composed o f all the students that
were selected to be awarded loans, while the control group will be composed o f students that were on the
list o f eligible candidates and fulfilled all the requirements for getting a loan but could not obtain it due to
budget restrictions o f ICEEQROO.

Data requirements for the randomized selection method: ICEEQROO will have socioeconomic and
academic information o f all the students that applied for a loan through the website. The updating o f the
database will be crucial for the evaluation of the program. ICEEQROO will need to update the
information o f all its borrowers and the non-borrowers. Specifically, it i s important to: 1) Identify in the
database the students in the treatment group and in the control group; 2) to update the academic
information for both groups through explicit arrangements with the participating universities.
Specifically, those who do get selected for a loan will need to report their academic performance to
ICEEQROO on a regular basis. The academic performance o f the control group can be obtained if
ICEEQROOwere to sign agreements with all the universities inthe state for receiving the academic GPA
each semester from all the students inthe universities.

Encouragement Design. The alternative methodology for the evaluation o f the program involves the
application of an Encouragement Design. With this methodology, the selection o f who receives a loan
will be made by the Board as originally planned, but the selection o f the treatment and control groups is
done at a point prior to the selection o f the decision o f who receives a loan. Specifically, the
encouragement design requires that ICEEQROOfollow two loan promotion strategies:

           Strategy A: Corresponds to the annual campaign for promoting loans that i s already planned by
           ICEQOOO.

           Strategy B: This strategy consists incontacting directly the potential borrowers. ICEEQROO will
           have to devote economic resources to contact via telephone first year students enrolled inhigher
           education institutions inthe state. T h i s strategy may be applied at the beginning o f the 2006-2007
           school year.

Data Requirements for the encouragemeht design: In order to have a solid and successful impact
evaluation it i s necessary to:
         i)       Select a random sample o f higher education institutions in the state, considering that the
                 sample corresponds approximately to 50 percent o fthe total number o f institutions.
         ii)      Select o f a random sample o f students. This sample will be near 20 percent of the total
                 number o f first-year-students enrolledinthe institutionspreviously selected.

                merging the 2 databases usingCURP or individual ID variable.
      v)      Also, ICEEQROO need explore the possibility o f applying a survey especially designed for

Dear Madam,

The purpose o f this letter i s to inform you o f the Mexican Government's educational policy, especially
with respect to higher education. As part o f this policy we hereby describe the objectives of the National
Fellowships Program for Higher Education (PRONABES), managed by the Under Secretariat o f Higher
Education, whose strategic objective i s to expand coverage o f higher education with equity. The
Assistance Program for Higher Education Students (PAEES) would be included within PRONABES, for
which the Mexican Government has requested technical and financial support from the World Bank.

GENERAL GUIDELINES OF THE EDUCATIONALPOLICY INMEXICO

The National Development Plan 2001-2006 (NDP) deems that national education faces three significant
challenges: coverage with equity; quality o f educational processes and learning levels; and integration and
operation o f the educational system. The first one-coverage with equity-addresses        the problem that
education benefits have yet to reach the entire population and, notwithstanding the progress achieved,
there i s still inequality in the country's development process. Inequality in educational opportunities i s
particularly serious instates and regions with greater socioeconomic marginalization and among the most
vulnerable groups, such as the indigenous, peasant, and migrant populations. From the foregoing,
coverage and equity still constitute the fundamental challenge at all levels and types o f education in
Mexico. Furthermore, the NDP describes the significant structural changes currently facing Mexican
society, among which are demographic, social, economic, and political transitions. These changes present
challenges and opportunities that will mark the country's development process for the next 10 or 20 years.
Inthiscontext, theNDPrepeatedlyandemphaticallyconfershighpriority to educationbystatingthat itis
the core issue and should be the cenpal priority o f the Government of the Republic.

Inorder to respondto the challenges posedbythe NDP, the National EducationPlan2001-2006 (NEP)
    ...
establishes the following specific objectives:

         Expandthe educational system, placing special emphasis on equity.
         Provide good-quality education to meet the needs o f all Mexicans.
         Promote educational federalism, planning, coordination, integration, institutional management,
         and social participation.

Inorder to achieve these objectives, we will seek an increase inthe resources available to the national
educational system, improving their distribution and establishing mechanisms to make their use more
efficient and transparent, thus improving the quality o f the services provided and promoting equity in


                                                      94

access and retention o f children and youth in school. Specifically, we seek to reach the goal o f an 8
percent share o f GDP earmarked for education in2006, including bothpublic and private expenditure.

HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY FRAMEWORK

As one o f its main objectives, the NEP promotes the development with equity o f a good-quality higher
education system that responds in a timely fashion to the social and economic demands o f the country,
leading to better and more reliable results. The NEP regards equity and educational justice as indivisible
elements o f quality. In order to promote greater equity in educational opportunities, the NEP proposes
greater allocation o f public and private resources as a condition for an ever-growing number o f
beneficiary students. The increase inresources that may be achieved in the coming years will relieve the
pressures o f the demand inthe high school and higher education levels. At the same time, it i s necessary
to promote strategies aimed at improving the quality o f educational institutions and at offering
preferential treatment to poor students that require complementary assistance to help cover the cost o f
their education and overcome their educational lag. Achievement o f this objective would offset the
current trend restricting access to university education primarily to students from middle and higher
income families.


One o f the NEP's strategies to achieve greater equity i s to prioritize support to public higher education,
expanding coverage and diversifying the supply o f this educational level, in collaboration with State
Governments. The main mechanism created to achieve this objective i s the non-reimbursable fellowships
program granted to poor students from higher educationpublic institutions. T o this end, PRONABES was
established as a national program that operates through Coordination Agreements between the Federation
and each o f the states and six federal higher education public institutions (UAM,UNAM, UPN, IPN,
ENBA and ENAH).Operation o f the Program began in the 2001-2002 academic year, through national
calls published indifferent mass media, informing students o f its existence and the requirements to obtain
scholarships, their amount and duration, and how to apply. The operation o f PRONABES i s based on the
principle o f shared responsibility between the Federal Government, State Governments and participating
higher education institutions, each `one contributing their corresponding 50 percent o f the PRONABES
fellowship budget.


PRONABES has been subject to external evaluations carried out by ANUIES, year after year, with
support from the Research and Economic Education Center (ICED). The evaluation reports indicate that
the program i s meeting its fundamental objectives. Specifically, PRONABES "constitutes not only a
policy .that serves an undeniable demand for equity in access to higher education, but its institutional
design has been framed within regulations that are transparent and that make it possible to serve the
proposed objective, while allowing the demarcation o f responsibilities in its scope. The Program i s
feasible and i s institutionally well constructed, with agreement between general and specific objectives as
well as with operational mechanisms. Targeting i s adequate and specifically responds to a demand that
has been verified through the use o f national data whose sources are entirely reliable (INEGI) and
appropriate statistical techniques. The policy has a positive impact and helps fellows have access and
complete their higher educationas desired."


THE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS (PAEES) IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
EDUCATIONAL POLICY

With the objective of implementing its short- and medium-term policies for the development o f higher
education, the Federal Government has been preparing the PAEES with support from the World Bank.



                                                      95

This program aims at supporting, the expansion o f higher education coverage in an equitable and
sustainable manner, in accordance with the needs o f the demand, through a student assistance scheme that
combines the PRONABES fellowships and special complementary aid for students from poor families,
with other types o f aid, among which are educational loans. PRONABES will be the governing linchpin
o f the program, since it issues the standards and procedures for its implementation and operation, and will
be responsible for its corresponding monitoring and evaluation process. The Federal Government has
requested the financial support o f the World Bank to implement the three phases programmed for the
PAEES.

The PAEES i s aligned to the general objective o f the long-term national educational policy proposed in
the NEP, which consists o f achieving a relevant, inclusive, and comprehensive educational system,
always guided by the principles o f equity and quality, and which will be the fundamental linchpin o f the
cultural, scientific, technological, economic, and social development o f Mexico inthe year 2025.


The specific interventions programmed for the PAEES will lead to the efficient achievement o f this
general objective, as follows:

     The PRONABES fellowships will contribute directly to the equitable expansion o f higher education,
     allowing access, retention, and graduation o f qualified students fiom poor families.

     State educational lending programs will help mobilize private resources to finance higher education
     while at the same time promoting the sustainable expansion o f quality programs.

     The complementary aids for high school students from poor families are academic, information and
     counseling support given to talented, underprivileged students before and during the course o f their
     higher education, to facilitate the transition betweenthe two educational levels and to promote greater
     equal opportunity. This support would be a supplement to the financial support given to these same
     students through the fellowships o fJbvenes con Oportunidades programs and PRONABES.

Furthermore, the evaluation activities and the studies programmed for the PAEES will directly contribute
to achieve the short- and long-term objectives o f the NEP, as they will lay a solid foundation for the
development o f new programs and for the introduction o f continuous improvements to existing programs.
As a whole, the PAEES will contribute to a better articulation o fthe national educational system and will
strengthen the cooperation between the federation, the states, and the private sector in consolidating a
relevant and quality higher education system that i s accessible to all.

For the implementation o f the PAEES program, the Government o f the United Mexican States, through
the Public Education Secretariat, ratifies the designation o f this Secretariat as the governing entity
responsible for the execution o f the program through the Under Secretariat o f Higher Education and the
Under Secretariat o f Higher Secondary Education. This responsibility encompasses the program activities
directly under the Secretariat, as well as the activities related to regulation, coordination, and monitoring
o f student lending programs in the states participating in the PAEES, in cooperation with the National
Bank for Public Works and Services (BANOBRAS).

           El Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2001-2006 -PND- considera que la
           educacion nacional enfrenta tres grandes desafios: cobertura
           con equidad; calidad de 10s procesos educativos y niveles de
           aprendizaje; e integraciun y funcionamiento del sistema
           educativo.El primero de ellos, el de lacobertura con equidad,

enfoca el problema de que !os beneficios de la educacibn
todavia no alcanzan o loda la poblacicin y no obstante 10s
avances logrados, se sigue observando desigualdad en el
proceso de desarrollo del pais. La inequidad de oportunidades
educativas se hace particutarmente grave en las entidcrdes
federutivas y regiones de mayor marginacion socio-econbmica
y entre 10s grupos mas vulnerables de la poblacih, COMO 10s
indigenas, campesinos y migrantes. Por lo anterior, la cobertura
y la equidad constituyen todavh el reto fundamental para
todos 10s niveles y tipos de educacidn en Mt5xico. Ademus, el
PND describe importantes cambios estrucfurales que enfrenta
actualmente la sociedad rnexicana, entre 10s           cuales se
destacan las transiciones demogrbfica, social, ecan6rnica y
polka. Estos cambios presentan retos y opartunidades que
marearan el procesode desarrolto del pais durante 10s proximos
der u veinte afios. En este contexto, el PND confiere a la
educacion, en forma reiterada y enfutica, un lugar de primera
importanciaal afirmar que la educacibn es el eje fundamental y
deb& ser la prioridadcentraldelGobiernode la Repbbfica.

Para responder a 10s    desaflos planteados en el PND, el Plan
Nacional de Educacih 2001-2006 -PNE- establece 10s siguientes
objetivos especificosr

     Arnplias el sisterna educativo privilegiando la equidad.

     atender las necesidudes de todos 10s mexicanos.
     Irnputsar et federalimo educativo, la planeacion, la
     coordinacibn, la integraci6n, la gestion institucionai y la
     participaciunsocial.

Para alcanzar estos objjetivos, se buscaru incrementar 10s
recursosde que dispone el Sistema Educativo Nacional,

                    I                                          2

hacer mus eficientey transparente su uso, consiguiendo con ello
elevar la calidad de 10s servicios proporcionados y propiciando
la equidad en el acceso y permanencia de 10s nifios y jbvenes
en la escuela.     Especificamente, se ha propuesto alcanzar
como meta en 2006 una proporcitm del 8%del PIB destinada Q
educacibn, incluyendoel gaslo pirblico y el privado.

ELMARC0 DE POLhlCA DE EDUCACI6N SUPERIOR

El PNE tiene como uno de sus principalesobjetivos el irnpulsar el
desarroHo con equidad de un sistema de educacibn superior de
buena calidad, que responda con oportunidad a las demandas
sociales y economicas del pais y conlleve a mejores y mas
confiables reswltados. El PNE considera la equidud y la justicia
educativa como elernentos indisociubfes de la calidad, Para
prornover mayor equidad de oportunidades educativas, el PNE
piantea una mayor asignacion de recursos pljblicos y privados
como condicion para que exista wn nkh-nero coda vez mayor de
estudiantes beneficiados. Los incrementos de r@cursusque
logren alcanzarse en {osproximos at=~os aliviardrnlas presiones de
la demanda en la educacion media superior y superior. AI
mismo tiempo, se hace necesario irnpulsar estrutegias
orientadas a mejorar la calidad de las instituciones educativas y
a ofrecer atenci6n preferencial a 10s    estudiantes de escasos
recursos que requieren apoyos cornpensatorios para ayudar a
cubrir 10s costos de su educacion y superar el rezago educativo
en que se encuentrun.El logro de este objetivo contrarrestariala
tendencia actual que limita el acceso al grado universitario
mayormente a estudiantes provenientes de familias de ingresos
rnediosy altos.

      Annex 16: PerformanceandLessonsfrom Mexico HigherEducationFinancingProject


University education i s clearly a good investment for many secondary school graduates. One might
therefore expect the private sector to offer student loans. But information asymmetries betweenthe lender
and borrower (for example, about a student's ability, or the effort he will put into his studies), and the
absence of sizable collateral (unlike loans on a car, or a house, which can be re-possessed by a bank) limit
private sector provision in the absence o f some government intervention. This has resulted in provision
by the public sector, or substantial involvement, in almost all countries in the world. However, public
sector efforts to provide student loans can be a serious drain on the public purse. Since student loan
schemes are generally not targeted, student loan schemes in many countries contain an important
scholarship element, often going to high-income groups o f society. There i s therefore considerable
interest among policymakers in designing a student loan system that provides cost-effective, easy-
accessible, un-subsidized student loans that keep public expenditures at a minimum,while still fostering
the maximum enrolment into tertiary education. This i s especially true in l o w and middle income
countries.

The Mexico Higher Education Project provides valuable lessons learned, because o f its funding o f two
widely different student credit organizations within the same country, ICEES and SOFES. Although
being far from a natural experiment, the project contains a key aspect o f a natural experiment: The
national legal framework and the national culture i s the same. Hence, the often referred to culprit o f a
highdefaultrate: "lack o f a repayment culture" cannot explain the difference inthe size o fthe subsidy of
the two student loans.

The implicit subsidy of a student loan i s determined by three factors: (i) interest rate, (ii)
                                                                                              administrative
costs and (iii)loan recovery. Figure 1 and 2 show the marked difference in administrative efficiency and
loan recovery:

      L           ICEES            SOFES                                 ICEES                SOFES




For the interest rate subsidy, the difference was in the opposite direction as that o f the two other factors.
Due to a persistent decline in inflation, the ICEES scheme turned its initial interest rate subsidy into a
positive interest margin, because ibmaintained a fixed interest rate at 9-12 percent. In contrast, SOFES
operates under an inflation regulated, variable interest rate. Thus the fall in inflation did not impact its
subsidy. The policy decision inICEES to maintain interest rate significantly reduced the implicit subsidy
inthe student loans and as such was a very important step to improve financial sustainability inICEES.
However, calculations o f the implicit subsidy in the two schemes shows that the performance in cost-

   recovery and administrative efficiency are the most important difference between the two schemes. At the
   current conditions, SOFES has close to no subsidy in its loan, while the implicit subsidy element o f
   ICEESreaches 20-30 percent.'

   As i s often the case, the volume o f lending was not a good indicator for the financial performance a low
   implicit subsidy, Figure 3. Both organizations had a substantial increase in lending. The difference arose
   primarily inloan recovery and secondarily inadministrative efficiency.

   It should be noted that the socio-economic and educational background also differ between the two
   institutions. SOFES beneficiaries have a higher grade point average from secondary school and on
    average. come from more affluent families. Both factors contributed to a higher future ability to repay
    among SOFES borrowers.
    'Although,   ICEES stands out as poor performer in comparison to SOFES, it appears less grave when put into an
   Latin American context. A systematic (ifby now outdated) review o f student loan programs in the world by Albrect
    and Ziderman (1991) concluded that the implicit subsidy in the average Latin American case reached 75 percent
    (compared to less than 30 percent in Scandinavian countries). The study highlights the importance o f interest rate
    subsidies (especially important in the context o f the 1985-1995 recurrent incidences o f high inflation in the region)
    and low cost recovery.

The main lessons learned from this experience in terms o f design and management o f student loan
organizations are:
   a   Encourage a design with risk-sharing among participants;
   a   Ensure strong financial incentives to recover the student loans;
   a   Enforce penalties for non-repayment and design incentives for repayment, such as the use o f
       credit rating agencies;
   a   Include commercial banking experience inthe management o f the scheme;
   a   Create external oversight o f the student loan provider according to commercial banking laws;
   0   Exclude political interference (such as political appointees involved inthe day-to-day operations);
   a   Ensure transparent communication to the public and policymakers o f the costs o fhighdefaults;
   a   Develop a long-term capitalization strategy to foster financial sustainability, and
   a   Take care that borrowed funds for student loan should have at least the same maturity as that of
       the offered student loans.
   a   Establishrisk administration policies
   a   Use assets management policies
