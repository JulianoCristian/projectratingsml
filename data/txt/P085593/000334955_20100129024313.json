The actions seek to a) assist\n            indigenous students finance their studies through the\n            PRONABES program (National Scholarships Program for Higher\n            Education); b) assist indigenous students academically\n            through peer tutoring programs, and, c) assist potential\n            indigenous students and their families in choosing and\n            enrolling into tertiary education through information\n            campaigns.
