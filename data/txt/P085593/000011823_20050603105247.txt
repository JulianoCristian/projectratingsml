Social Assessment  
and  
Indigenous People’s Development Plan (IPDP) 
 
Introduction 
 
Indigenous people’s access to tertiary education in Mexico is dismally low.  This 
contributes to a marginalization of indigenous people, reduces possibilities for escaping 
poverty and increases inequality in the Mexican tertiary education system.  The 
Government of Mexico and the World Bank actively support that an increased number of 
indigenous people attain tertiary education.  
 
This Indigenous People’s Development Plan (IPDP) identifies barriers for indigenous 
people’s attainment of tertiary education. Further, it proposes a specific action plan to 
assist indigenous people overcome these barriers.  
 
The IPDP is part of the TERtiary Education Student Assistance Project (TERESA) that 
aims to improve equity and expansion of Mexican tertiary education. Under the Bank’s 
Indigenous Peoples’ Policy (OD 4.20), a plan should be elaborated during project 
preparation to ensure the development of indigenous people.  The plan devotes specific 
attention to the two program that will target assistance to indigenous people: Component 
1
Assistance to the National scholarship Program (
Programa Nacional de Becas de 
Educación Superior, 
PRONABES) will finance scholarships to indigenous student in 
tertiary education, and Subcomponent 3.2 that will consolidate and expand Support 
Program for Indigenous Students in Higher Education Institutions (
Programa de Apoyo a 
Estudiantes Indígenas en Instituciones de Educación Superior
,
PAEIIES), implemented 
by the National Association of Universities and High Education Institutions
 
(
Asociación 
Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educación Superior
,
ANUIES) and 
financed by the Ford Foundation’s (FF) global program for Indigenous peoples, 
Pathways. 
 
The document has two sets of main findings regarding the barriers of indigenous people’s 
to attain tertiary education:  
·
The main findings from analysis of socio-economic and educational data are
:
(i) 
Lack of financing prevents many potential indigenous students from enrolling in 
tertiary education; (ii) The inadequate quality of primary and secondary 
education in rural areas restricts access to many young indigenous students who 
would like to enroll in tertiary education; and (iii) Owing to the disadvantaged 
rural location of indigenous communities, potential students and their parents are 
unaware of the opportunities for tertiary education and the possible careers. 
·
The main findings from consultations with indigenous people in six states and 18 
higher education institutions are
:
(i) Indigenous people support the PRONABES 
national scholarship program; (ii) It reduces, but does not resolve, the indigenous 
people’s lack of finance to pursue tertiary studies; (iii) The PRONABES program 
is compatible with the social and cultural practices of the indigenous people; (iv) 
IPP123
Page  2
indigenous people face difficulties complying with PRONABES paperwork 
requirements, and (v) The PAEIIES program is effective in assisting indigenous 
students to access and complete tertiary education through academic assistance, 
information campaigns and assistance with paperwork
.
The IPDP proposes an action plan to assist indigenous students, families and 
communities.  The actions seek to (i) assist indigenous students finance their studies 
through the PRONABES program; (ii) assist indigenous students academically through 
peer tutoring programs, and (iii) assist potential indigenous students and their families in 
choosing and enrolling into tertiary education through information campaigns. The last 
two actions will be carried out through an expansion and consolidation of the PAEIIES 
program administered by ANUIES. 
 
The IPDP is organized in the following sections:

Brief description of Mexico’s indigenous population and its legal framework
The National Population Council (
Consejo Nacional de Populación
,
CONAPO) estimates the 
indigenous population of Mexico (defined as either speaking an Amerindian language or 
pertaining to an indigenous ethic group) to be 12.7 million. This figure approximates other 
estimates of the indigenous population based on different social, cultural and demographic 
indicators (
Indicadores

For the purpose of socio-economic variables, indigenous households within municipalities 
considered as indigenous have the following characteristics:

defined as those who speak an indigenous language 
(

 p. 25).  It shows that indigenous people tend to live in areas with a high density of 
indigenous population. 66.1% live in areas where 30% or more are indigenous people. However, 
2.05 million indigenous people reside in municipalities where they are a minority. 
 
Besides the academic barriers, indigenous students face economic and social barriers that 
hamper enrollments of this group in TE. For example, in 2002, an individual that lived in 
a
municipality where 10 to 40 percent of the population is indigenous had an average 
income equivalent to 46 percent of the income of a person in a non-indigenous 
municipality (Garcia and Ramirez 2005).  Similarly, an individual in a predominantly 
indigenous municipality (above 40 percent indigenous) had an income equivalent to only 
26 percent of the income of a person in a non-indigenous municipality.  Even with similar 
education levels, indigenous people have a much higher probability of being poor than do 
non-indigenous people.  The indigenous population with no education is more than twice 
as likely to be extremely poor than the non-indigenous population without education.  
Rather than narrowing with increased education, this gap grows as higher educational 
levels are attained.  For individuals with incomplete secondary schooling, the probability 
of being extremely poor is five times larger if you are indigenous than if you are not, and 
almost ten times higher if you have completed secondary education (see Table 3).

Access to public services and domestic possessions are lacking 
in most municipalities 
populated by indigenous peoples.
 Nine out of ten indigenous people lack a room for 
cooking; the space for food preparation is not appropriate due to direct contact with 
fumes and gas that endanger health, since 62% of all households cook with charcoal or 
firewood. Only six out of ten houses have access to piped water. Seven out of ten have 
access to independent sanitary services. 83% houses have electricity.  Only two 
households out ten have a computer. The limited services hinder the development of 
capital and reduce the social mobility of the indigenous population.  
 
Overall, the living conditions of Mexico’s indigenous population are below those of non-
indigenous students. One of the main reasons for this is lack of education.  Improving 
Page  4
access to all levels of education, including tertiary education, would therefore increase 
the welfare of the indigenous population.  
 
Legal Framework for Indigenous People
The acknowledgement of the multicultural nature of Mexico has increased since the late 1970s. 
The Mexican Constitution has been modified several times in the recent past in order to expand 
and clarify indigenous peoples’ rights.  Indigenous peoples’ rights to their practices and traditions 
must continue to be recognized in each specific legal domain, and their living conditions must be 
improved.  
 
The third and fourth sections of article 7 of the General Law on Education establish that all 
institutions that offer education shall: (i) strengthen sovereignty and national awareness, and the 
knowledge of history, patriotic symbols and national institutions, and the cultural traditions and 
particularities of all national regions, and (ii) promote, through the Spanish language, a common 
language for all Mexicans while protecting and promoting the development of indigenous 
languages. 
 
In summary, Mexican legislation on education recognizes the right of indigenous peoples, as 
Mexicans, to education, as well as the moral obligation to compensate centuries of discrimination 
and lack of opportunities, which are especially notorious at the tertiary education level.

ACCESS TO EDUCATION
 
Education improves individual capabilities through the acquisition of knowledge and skills. 
Therefore, education is a basic tool for social interaction and for adequate incorporation into the 
individual’s social, economic and cultural environment; it is also a valuable asset for improving 
an individual’s productivity, wages and welfare.  It is only by attending school from primary to 
tertiary level that an individual can exercise his basic constitutional right to education. Therefore, 
poor school attendance is a social handicap for any individual from any social group. 
 
Despite significant improvements in education over the past several decades, 
considerable educational differences persist between the indigenous and non-indigenous 
populations.  Illiteracy rates and dropout rates continue to be substantially higher among 
the indigenous population.  Data indicates that 25% of indigenous people over 25 years 
of age do not read or write; 40 % of indigenous people over 15 years of age have not 
even completed primary education, of these 18% have never been to school, and only 
22% have completed some years of elementary school.  On the other hand, almost two 
out of ten individuals from indigenous households have completed elementary school, 
and four out of ten have completed post-primary education (
Indicadores
,
p.
34).  Average 
years of schooling, on the other hand, are much lower for indigenous people.  
Educational gaps, however, seem to be closing in the younger generations.  The average 
non-indigenous individual born before 1939 has 120 percent more years of schooling 
than an indigenous individual of the same age group.  A non-indigenous individual born 
between 1979 and 1985, by contrast, has 26 percent more years of schooling than an 
indigenous individual born in the same period.  However, this gap will widen when the 
generation in question will reach secondary and tertiary education, where enrollment 
differences between non-indigenous and indigenous are larger.

Despite recent advances in indigenous peoples schooling attainment over the last several decades, 
indigenous people will continue to lag behind the non-indigenous since their schooling will result 
in lower labor market earnings.  This occurs 
because the Indigenous peoples’ returns to education 
are lower than for non-indigenous people (Garcia and Patrinos 2005).

Part of the reason for the lower returns that indigenous people experience is the quality of that 
schooling that indigenous people receive.  Indigenous schools consistently obtain lower reading 
and mathematics scores than all other types of schools, regardless of area of residence.  As 
evidenced by the scores, not only do indigenous schools obtain significantly lower scores than 
urban public and private schools, they also have poorer test performance than rural public schools 
and CONAFE community schools.  In 2002 a sixth grader from an indigenous school had 15 
percent lower reading scores and 8 percent lower mathematics scores than the average sixth 
grader nationwide.  When compared with students from urban public schools, sixth graders in 
indigenous schools had test results that were 16 percent lower in reading and 9 percent lower in 
mathematics.  Furthermore, even when compared with students from public rural schools, 
indigenous students performed poorly.  The average sixth grader in an indigenous school had 10 
percent lower reading test results and 6 percent lower results in mathematics than the average 
sixth grader in a public rural school (Garcia and Ramirez 2005).

The learning gap is exacerbated trough the secondary education system.  In 2002  only 3.5 
percent of the students that took the EXANI II (admission exam for Higher Education) spoke or 
understand an indigenous language (this variable is the proxy for identifying an indigenous 
student). In 2002 the EXANI II applied the exams to 258,660 students. 
 
According to the EXANI II test, the indigenous students are on average 17 index points 
below to rest of the population that took such an exam. Also the difference is more 
pronounced in two key subjects for success in tertiary educat
ion: “verbal reasoning” and 
“mathematics”.

The data document that indigenous students arrive at the entry point to tertiary education 
less prepared than its non-indigenous peers.  To increase their participation and 
completion rates of tertiary education, there is a need for additional academic assistance 
in order to bring the indigenous student on par with their colleagues.  The IPDP’s 
proposed actions will address this need.

Indigenous students in tertiary education
Data on indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education institutions is practically inexistent. 
The Ministry of Education acknowledges this lack of information and is working towards 
remedying it. Preliminary data collected by PRONABES authorities provides information on 15 
out of 28 Mexican states, and on 2 out of 5 national institutions with signed agreements. This data 
provides information on 6,078 indigenous students (3,271 male and 2,807 female). Unfortunately 
some states with a significant indigenous population, such as Tlaxcala, Veracruz, Hidalgo, 
Guerrero, Tabasco, and  Michoacan, are not included.  
 
More reliable data regarding indigenous people with tertiary education comes from the 1997 
Encuesta Nacional en Zonas Indígenas 
(ENEZI) (National Survey in Indigenous Zones).  
According to ENEZI, of 3,083,743 indigenous people over 5 years of age, 62,230 had completed 
tertiary education (2%) and 129,334 had completed upper secondary education (4%). The 
transition rate from upper secondary education to tertiary education is only 50%, which is below 
the national average.  Furthermore, most indigenous people with tertiary education have degrees 
in five fields: education (bilingual teachers), law, accounting, administration and, recently, 
computer sciences.

The effort that has been started to gather data about indigenous people and tertiary 
education must continue. Indigenous students enrolled in tertiary education institutions 
must become visible. Reliable data is needed in order to undertake a consistent and 
sustained follow-up of the academic performance of indigenous students in tertiary 
education and to measure actions to ensure equity towards this disadvantaged sector of 
Mexican society. 
 
According to consultations with indigenous people, educators and government officials, 
indigenous students are substantially more likely to drop out of tertiary education and 
repeat classes.  Consequently, fewer indigenous students graduates from tertiary 
education than non-indigenous students.   
 
A
key factor to keep in mind is that indigenous people live in the poorest municipalities 
in Mexico; municipalities which, in addition to inadequate economic conditions, have 
low and poor-quality educational coverage. Hence the 
physica
l
and cultural distance they 
must overcome in order to obtain admission to and attend tertiary education is an obstacle 
that not all qualified indigenous students can surmount.  Once enrolled in a tertiary 
institution, indigenous students have cultural and social disadvantages that prevent them 
Page  9
from fulfilling the academic requirements relating to quality and time that tertiary 
institutions demand from all students.  
 
There is hence a need for additional assistance to indigenous student to help them 
complete their studies.  Besides, overcoming the disadvantage of having receiving
—on
average—a lower quality secondary education, the following section investigates the 
causes for lower transition rate, higher repetition and higher drop out rates.  
 
3.1   Obstacle, Vulnerability,  and social risks for indigenous students
Research conducted within more than 20 communities and several tertiary education 
institutions indicates that social and physical distance form critical obstacles that 
indigenous students from low-income families must overcome in order to participate in 
tertiary education.  Students must travel up to two hours each way to attend courses. They 
must have money available for food and transportation. Daily transportation costs may be 
as high 50 Mexican pesos (US$4). To avoid traveling long distances, some students rent a 
room or share a room with relatives. Our data indicate that this costs 400 Mexican pesos 
a
month per student (US$36). When living away for home, food costs 300 pesos a week 
(US$27). Also, most tertiary institutions attended by indigenous students have sporadic 
charges that can add up to an extra 1,000 pesos per month (US$80) and, in addition, 
students must find money for photocopies, books, other school materials, and appropriate 
clothing. The consultations identified a significant number of disadvantaged students at 
the upper secondary education level (
bachilllerato
 and 
preparatoria
)
with few 
opportunities to continue their education due to lack of economic resources.  
 
Furthermore, family and emotional costs must also be considered.  Culturally and socially 
speaking, students (as well as some of the parents) interviewed recall traveling to and 
residing in, for the first time, an urban environment where their language, lifestyle, and 
behavior appeared awkward and open to discriminatory actions by others.  
 
This disadvantageous situation becomes a social risk that demands compensatory actions 
to ensure successful completion of tertiary education. Failure to complete studies should 
not be seen as an individual problem only; as we have shown in the above social 
assessment, it is also a problem for family and community members, all of whom have 
made important sacrifices in order to acquire increased capabilities for their future socio-
economic development. 
 
Indigenous people consulted manifested their approval of the PRONABES scholarship 
program After three years of operation, the majority of students consulted at tertiary 
institutions know about the PRONABES grants that are aimed at marginal and extremely 
marginal populations and about the minimum grade average requested (an average GPA 
of 8.0 is required to receive and maintain the PRONABES scholarship).   However, some 
parents and potential university students are unaware of the existence of PRONABES.  
Participants in the consultations asked for information about scholarships and tertiary 
education institutions where the grant is available. Students also mentioned the 
difficulties they must confront in order to complete the paperwork required when 
applying for a scholarship. As some recalled: information about scholarships is not easily 
Page  10
available and only for short periods of time. Most applications must be completed at the 
beginning of the semester, when students have just arrived in school. For those studying 
far from their places of residence, the request for information about family income means 
an unforeseen expense, since they must obtain official information from the town hall of 
the municipality where their parents are officially registered although not necessarily 
residing; moreover, such data is not always ready in time for the applications. Two 
students mentioned difficulties because monolingual authorities had to prepare such 
information. Subsequently, they never know the reasons why they receive or are denied 
the grant; this means that many of the parents and students interviewed assume that 
grants are offered on a discretionary basis rather than on the students’ own merits. There 
is hence a need for further dissemination of the existence of the PRONABES scholarship 
program among indigenous communities with potential tertiary level students.  Further, 
assistance with the submission of paperwork is desirable. 
 
It is a common practice for poor rural families to oblige the oldest adolescents to abandon 
the household in order to gain a salary and, if possible, send money to the household. 
This tends not to be the case for the other siblings, which is why one finds the younger 
siblings attending upper secondary and tertiary education rather than the oldest children.  
It is only when the first child enters tertiary education that parents overburden themselves 
in order to allow the other children to continue their studies beyond secondary level. 
 
Next, the most visible strategies developed to overcome the challenges involved in 
maintaining students in tertiary education are presented.
 
3.2   Strategies to overcome the lack of financing and transportation
The obstacles presented above are surmounted using different strategies. The main 
strategy involves students and parents working extra hours to increase earnings, which 
will help to overcome the main obstacle to tertiary education: financing for tuition, 
transportation, lodging and substitution of foregone earnings.   
 
Students, parents, and leaders, all recognized that “many sacrifices” must be made in 
order to maintain a child studying outside their community. Data gathered during 
fieldwork indicates the following: 
 
Parents:  
-
The mother must work for a salary or cash-income: working on another farm, in 
an unskilled position in a factory, as a maid, catalogue salesperson, by expanding 
her domestic activities such as livestock care; two widowers decided to travel to 
the United States. They all said: “
apretando el gasto
”
[cutting down on expenses].  
-
Both parents must work more hours each day; intensify use of land resources; 
take on salaried activities, even if badly paid – many men work as unskilled 
construction workers, and on night shifts at factories or other institutions.  
-
Families become indebted at high interest rates, risking the loss of their limited 
patrimony.  
-
They seek student support from members of the extended family, or from co-
parenting relations. 
Page  11
-
They avoid investing in home appliances and needed repairs. 
-
Parents start a local business, such as a grocery store or a workshop; if successful, 
they encourage their children to study. 
-
And, they avoid communal responsibilities that imply expending time and money 
(fees for annual celebrations, 
mayordomias
,
pilgrimages, etc. 
 
Students:  
-
Many try to avoid working, but if needed, they complement their parents’ money 
and the scholarship, if they have one, by working on a part-time basis (as 
housekeepers, maids, shop assistants, car washers, waiters), often not mentioning 
it to their parents. 
-
Paid activities on weekends and during vacations. 
-
They find an institution in a town where relatives or godparents reside who are 
willing to give them board (normally in exchange for some housework). 
-
They sell food at school; share living expenses with other students; avoid visiting 
their parents. 
-
At best, they find a part-time job at the university. 
 
Young people often have to make the choice between higher education or keeping a 
secure salaried job for which further education is not required. But data gathered 
indicated that students would often rather loose a job than a scholarship; therefore when 
grades are threatened by salaried activities, the job is dropped. 
 
Despite the foregoing, the data collected proves that, as mentioned above, professional 
education reduces social ties – rights and duties – within the community, to the extent 
that a cash income makes an individual more independent from communal resources, 
either personal collaboration or access to natural resources. This is shown by the fact that 
indigenous professionals collaborate with their communities on, at best, a sporadic basis, 
in most cases. One exception is school teachers, because they are the only professionals 
who have a permanent position within the communities, and this enables them to be 
constantly involved and participating in community affairs. 
 
A
scholarship, even if it is low, to cover food or institutional fees becomes basic to fulfill   
school requirements. It certainly helps to overcome financial obstacles and, in this way, 
pave the way for indigenous students to enrollment and completion of a tertiary education 
degree.

Indigenous people in PAEIIES
In 2001, ANUIES and FF initiated the PAEIIES program for tertiary education 
institutions with indigenous students. FF finances university projects in order to establish 
Academic Support Units in selected institutions attended by indigenous students. One of the main 
objectives of ANUIES, is the promotion of inter-institutional activities that improve interactions 
between their member institutions. The purpose of the program is to establish Academic Support 
Units that foster innovative academic support to indigenous students such as: tutorials, remedial 
classes, introductory courses, and fieldwork training, which increase university completion rates 
Page  12
and build research skills by providing assessment on research, which will prepare indigenous 
students for graduate education.  
 
An inter-institutional committee was appointed, headed by FF and ANUIES, in order to discuss 
the main guidelines of the project, monitor initial results, and consider options for future 
expansion. The committee consists of representatives of FF, ANUIES, the National Council for 
Indigenous Peoples’ Development (CDI), SEP, CIESAS (Center for Research and Advanced 
Studies in Social Anthropology), and the University of Guadalajara’s Center for Indigenous 
Community Development. 
 
Despite its short period of operation (3 years), the PAEIIES Academic Support Units have proved 
successful in improving academic performance among participating students. The project has had 
multiple impacts on tertiary education institutions, students and the community. Among the most 
visible impacts are: 
 
·
Acknowledgement that most tertiary education institutions lack awareness, knowledge or 
statistics about the presence or enrollment of indigenous students. 
·
Increased knowledge of indigenous students and a decrease in drop-out rates. 
·
Improved or maintained grade point average. 
·
Specialized tutorial assistance to resolve specific concerns regarding the new 
environment where indigenous students study. 
·
Assistance in acceding to new technology, libraries and university services. 
·
Remedial courses to fill the educational gap most indigenous students have, and 
·
Increased incentives for tertiary education institutions to enroll indigenous students 
through the provision of additional funds for the necessary academic assistance 
 
In 2001, the committee accepted six projects, and in 2002, five more were selected, all funded by 
the Ford Foundation. One institution from Chiapas lost its funding due to failure to fulfill 
program goals. 
 
PAEIIES supports ten Academic Support Units; at the end of 2004, a total of 3,697 participating 
indigenous students were registered in them:

Despite its short 3-year life, PAEIIES units have proved successful with multiple and significant 
effects on the tertiary education institutions (TEI), the students and their communities. 
Nevertheless, PAEIIES academic units do not have mechanisms to overcome the obstacles 
confronting students at the upper secondary level who have the capability to enter tertiary 
education.  
 
The most visible effects that emerged from the three abovementioned evaluations included: 
 
·
Indigenous students’ enrollment
 at the ten TEI attended by PAEIIES had increased from 
1,309 in 2001 to 3,697 by the end of 2004, representing an increase of 182%; mainly 
because more indigenous students decided to enter the program knowing its benefits. 
From the initiation of the program in 2001 to December 2004, PAEIIES delivered more 
than 343 academic courses, seminars, and workshops. In addition, the program provided 
more than 12 different kinds of services, ranging from tutorials and vocational guidance 
to psychological and pedagogical guidance, to almost 4,000 students. 
 
·
Academic performance of the participating students
 increased from an average GPA of 
7.9 in 2001 to 8.4 by the end of 2004.  
 
·
Motivated by the impact, the development and the professional management of this 
program, the FF, the ten TEI and ANUIES created a matching fund to continue the 
original program.  Now, the two-year one grant donation has been increased to a five-
year program via three grants made by the FF amounting to almost US$3,000,000. The 
10 TEI participating in the program have channeled more that US$750,000 of their own 
resources into the development and management of the program.   
 
·
Improved sustainability in funding. 
ANUIES requested the Mini
stry of Education’s 
support to contribute to the sustainability of the program. In 2005, the Ministry allocated 
US$50,000 in funding for the program. 
 
Despite its initial signs of success, the PAEIIES program faces challenges to scale up its impact:  
 
·
Expanding into geographical areas and institutions with a high density of indigenous 
people
.
The program currently covers only 10 tertiary education institutions in Mexico. 
None of these institutions are in the southern states where a large proportion of 
indigenous people.  In order to expand into these states, the program requires (i) 
additional funding for the program. This is included as Line 1 of the budget, and (ii) 
support to institutions with a higher proportion of indigenous students.  These institutions 
were not selected in previous (competitive) rounds, because their proposals for academic 
support units were enough well-prepared compared to other proposals. There is therefore 
a
need to provide support to institutions with a high density of indigenous student, which 
will raise the quality of their proposals. This is included as Line 2 of the budget. 
Page  14
·
Reduce turn-over of tutors and coordinators.
The program have so far relied exclusively 
upon voluntary workers and helpers. This has led to a high turn-over among tutors and 
coordinators, which threatens to destabilize the program and reduce its effectiveness.  To 
reduce the lose of workers, the program could introduce an reward for participation in the 
program. It should not be a salary, but an incentive and recognition of the efforts that 
tutors and coordinators have invested in the program. This is included as Line 3 and 4 of 
the budget.

Benefits for indigenous people from PRONABES and PAEIIES (through the TERESA Project)
The Tertiary Education Student Assistance Project, with the support of the PAEIIES program, 
will seek to improve indigenous peoples’ access to and completion of tertiary education. To 
ensure an appropriate and efficient use of the funds, the Indigenous Peoples’ Development Plan 
includes the following items: 
 
Financial aid
.
In order to overcome the main obstacle for indigenous student to enroll 
and complete a tertiary level degree, PRONABES will assist these students, specifically:  
 
·
PRONABES has offered to ensure that all indigenous students attended by PAEIIES 
units, and who qualify, will receive a scholarship. PAEIIES units help students with the 
paperwork and procedures that can impede access to scholarships. By the end of 2004, 
730 students were receiving a PRONABES scholarship; another 1,246 students were 
receiving scholarships from their own universities, NGOs, or the National Commission 
for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (CDI).
 
The following findings correspond to inquiries made about the functioning of PRONABES grants 
and their coverage, and the effectiveness of PAEIIES-funded units for academic assistance to 
indigenous students. 
 
Expansion of academic assistance to student in tertiary education.
 Through an expansion of the 
PAEIIES academic assistance units, at least an additional 3,000 indigenous students will receive 
aid. The expansion will: 
·
Prioritize assistance to institutions in states with a strong presence of indigenous peoples, 
including but not limited to: Oaxaca, Guerrero, Sinaloa, Yucatán, Michoacan and 
Chihuahua. 
·
Offer of technical assistance to tertiary education institutions in such states so as to raise 
the quality of the prepared proposal. 
·
Develop an incentive program for specialized tutors and unit coordinators. 
·
Periodically monitor each unit program.  It should be part of the SEP parameters for 
excellence.  
·
Organization of a periodic evaluation of the program.  
·
Workshops, conferences, seminars, and specialized courses in order to attain program 
goals, share experiences and good practices, and increase interaction between students 
from different ethnic groups, with different experiences.  
·
Training of tutors for indigenous students in enable the latter to better achieve their goals.  
·
Establish information programs for the indigenous communities in order to diffuse the 
opportunities in tertiary education.

Monitoring and Evaluation of the IPDP
As a final and general conclusion, there is no doubt of the PAEIIES and PRONABES social 
benefits for the indigenous population. Nevertheless, the implementation of the proposed plan 
must be evaluated and monitored in the medium and long term. Its real success has to be 
constructed through daily practice in every tertiary institution. Statistics on indigenous students at 
tertiary level must be developed in order to monitor the IPDP adequately. 
 
The success of the PAEIIES and the concomitant financial aid support from PRONABES is 
firstly: 
·
The completion degrees of supported indigenous students.  
Secondly, the program will be measured on its ability to expand its impact to more institutions 
and therefore help more indigenous students enroll and complete a tertiary level degree. This is 
measured by: 
·
The number of indigenous students supported 
 
These two indicators are also the IPDP’s key performance indicators. Each academic unit will 
collect the data, which will be organized by ANUIES and disseminated on a semi-annual basis.
