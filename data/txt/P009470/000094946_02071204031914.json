Lessons highlight\n            primarily, the need for greater discretionary authority,\n            regarding availability of funds, and decisions on costs, and\n            expenses, as it relates to the timing for an effective\n            plantation management, and optimal forest product yields,\n            particularly, in a country such as Bangladesh, whose current\n            system of budgetary allocation, and control precludes a\n            timely funding. It is thus strongly suggested, that future\n            projects involving industrial plantation development, and\n            management, include definitive measures, in addition to the\n            necessary legal covenants, to ensure these shortcomings are\n            overcome: the establishment of a financially autonomous\n            entity, having a commercial management approach with the\n            Government, local communities, and possibly in partnership\n            with the private sector, is an avenue worth exploring. While\n            the project demonstrated that mangrove establishment on\n            accreted silt beds, can stabilize these beds, and lead to\n            the formation of new land masses, suitable for agriculture,\n            the sustainable management of mangrove plantations however,\n            will depend on such practice being a sound legal basis for\n            tenure, with agreed policies for mangrove disposition. But,\n            the effective development of forests, and protection of\n            wildlife will not be possible, without appropriate\n            consideration of the needs, and the involvement of marginal\n            populations adjacent to the forests."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
