This will be achieved by: (1) improving and\n            further institutionalizing the forest resource information\n            management system; (2) integrating environment and\n            socio-economic factors and criteria into resource management\n            and utilization; (3) carrying out a pilot scheme for\n            people's participation in forest development; (4)\n            expanding the countries forest resources through plantation\n            establishment and improved management; (5) formulating\n            management plans for nature conservation areas and\n            supporting investments in selected sanctuaries and parks;\n            (6) streamlining the organization of the Forest Department,\n            and creating within the Department a new responsibility for\n            environmental management; (7) providing support for\n            professional and technical education and training, and more\n            mangrove research.
