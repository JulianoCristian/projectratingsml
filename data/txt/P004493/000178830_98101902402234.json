particular emphasis on\n            exploring new areas close to the Manila market, and to help\n            strengthen the geothermal policy development of the\n            Government, PNOC and National Power Corporation, and\n            facilitate the involvement of the private sector. The\n            geothermal exploration program consists of: (a)\n            geoscientific studies to determine potential drilling\n            locations; (b) drilling of about 25 wells to prove\n            sufficient reserves for a power generating unit at each\n            location; two shallow wells for non-power steam at\n            Bacon-Manito; and 8 wells in other prospective locations on\n            Luzon; (c) four studies, including two geothermal\n            exploration/development policy studies and studies to\n            determine the extend of reserves at Palinpinon and\n            Bacon-Manito; and (d) technical assistance, in the\n            implementation of the exploration program. Part of the\n            technical assistance will be financed by New Zealand, Italy\n            and Japan, the balance out of the Bank loan."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
