                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed DPL-DDO is to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact.
                         The reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government’s revenue-
                         raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed
                         to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the
                         reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government’s fiscal buffer, but
                         without requiring actual disbursement of funds.
                         The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated by a Progress Report was presented to the Board in December 2011, is to
                         pursue public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of
                         fiscal sustainability, which the Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.
