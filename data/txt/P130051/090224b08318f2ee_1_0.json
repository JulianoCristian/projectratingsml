        (DPL) with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) Project for\n            Romania were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in retrospect, the choice of the DDO instrument was\n            appropriate; the Bank should consider to promote it more\n            actively to clients who seek risk insurance to adverse\n            exogenous shocks rather than direct financing. Relevant\n            analytical work and synergy with other Bank activities are\n            essential. The DPL-DDO design was built on a solid\n            foundation of country knowledge acquired through thorough\n            analytical work. Just-in-time policy advice and technical\n            assistance make a difference. Political leadership and\n            direct involvement of senior officials (often the Prime\n            Minister) is critical to implement sensitive reforms.\n            Baseline indicators and targets (for example, savings from\n            elimination of certain drugs from the list of compensated\n            medicine) must be firmly documented, or when revised must be\n            reflected in amended targets. Definition of results\n            indicators must be consistent over the lifetime of the\n            operation, or appropriate corrections in targets must be\n            made when revised."}, "docdt": "2015-11-02T23:42:03Z"}
