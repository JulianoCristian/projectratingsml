                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed DPL-DDO is to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact.
                         The reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government’s revenue-
                         raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed
                         to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the
                         reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government’s fiscal buffer, but
                         without requiring actual disbursement of funds.
                         The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated by a Progress Report was presented to the Board in December 2011, is to
                         pursue public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of
                         fiscal sustainability, which the Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.

                         The macroeconomic framework for the operation remains satisfactory, but the country faces several external and domestic risks that will require closely management. Main risks
                         include a potential euro crisis and the quasi-fiscal activities of state-owned enterprises. Growth prospects remain low, due to the protracted slowdown in the European economy and
                         the sluggish pick up in domestic demand, highlighting the need to continue the reform effort in all areas covered by the program.

                         The implementation of the Government’s reform program supported by the DPL-DDO initiated early this year has continued.
                         The preparatory stage of public sector reforms (public finance management and tax policy and administration) began, but a concerted effort would be required over the next few
                         months to be able to launch key components.

                         Progress in the reforms of the energy sector has been uneven:

                         �          Good progress has been made on implementing legal and regulatory reforms. It is important, however, that the progress be interpreted in the proper context as these are
                         only initial steps on what should be considered a ‘steep’ road.

                         �        Progress has been made towards designing the safety net that would need to be put in place to offer protection to poorest households from energy tariff increases.

                         �       Good steps have been taken towards the introduction of transparent and competitive contracting for Hidroelectrica – through its insolvency process – but the process of
                         awarding new contracts is still ongoing and, thus, it is too early to be assessed.

                         �        Less progress has been made in terms of introducing sustainable commercial/payment discipline among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector (and more
                         generally across all SOEs). SOE arrears are still common and prevalent in general, and efforts to secure a bridge-loan to CRF Infrastructure do not address the need to introduce
                         hard budget constraints on this company.

                         �       Reforms in the areas of corporate governance and private sector participation have proceed at a slow pace, particularly with respect to the energy sector SOEs included in
                         the DPL-DDO program. With a few exceptions, key steps in this area have been either formally put on hold, or are experiencing long delays.

                         Positive steps have been taken in health care sector reforms (hospital network rationalization and the introduction of health technology assessment), but these represent only initial
                         steps in what is an overall a complex agenda.
