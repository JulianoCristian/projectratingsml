                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed DPL-DDO is to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact.
                         The reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government’s revenue-
                         raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed
                         to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the
                         reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government’s fiscal buffer, but
                         without requiring actual disbursement of funds.
                         The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated by a Progress Report was presented to the Board in December 2011, is to
                         pursue public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of
                         fiscal sustainability, which the Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A.         Macroeconomic framework

                         The macroeconomic framework for the operation remains satisfactory. Nevertheless, the country faces several external and domestic risks that will require close management. Main
                         risks include a deterioration of the economic situation in the Eurozone and the quasi-fiscal activities of state-owned enterprises, especially in energy and transport. Economic growth
                         has picked up modestly, driven by exports and agriculture, but medium term prospects remain subdued, due to the protracted slowdown in the European economy and the sluggish
                         pick up in domestic demand (particularly investments), highlighting the need to continue the reform effort in all areas covered by the program. Fiscal consolidation remains on track.

                         B.       Implementation of the reform program

                         The implementation of the Government’s reform program supported by the DPL-DDO has continued. In key areas, such as public investment management, energy price liberalization
                         and private participation in key SOEs, the pace of reforms was either maintained or accelerated.

                         The public sector reforms (public finance management and tax policy and administration) have continued. The Government has taken important regulatory and institutional steps to
                         reform the public investment framework, and has advanced the restructuring of the tax administration. However, further efforts would be required over the next months in order to
                         ensure the sustainability of the reforms adopted.

                         Significant progress has been made in the energy sector:

                         �       Very good progress has been made on implementing legal and regulatory reforms, especially with respect to the liberalization of the electricity and gas markets (gas price
                         increases proceeded as agreed, and so electricity market liberalization).

                         �        Very good progress has been made towards designing and putting in place the safety net offering protection to poorest households from energy tariff increases (Parameters
                         of key safety nets were simplified and budgets augmented in mid-2013).

                         �        Good progress has been made towards the introduction of transparent and competitive contracting for Hidroelectrica, which has also come out of insolvency and is by now
                         the only company for which professional boards of directors need to be appointed and an IPO launched.

                         �        Progress has been made in terms of introducing sustainable commercial/payment discipline among state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector, and more
                         generally across all SOEs. SOE arrears have declined from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to around 2.2 percent at end-June 2013, but they are still common and in particular non-
                         payments by railway companies are still to be addressed.

                         �        Reforms in the areas of corporate governance and private sector participation have advanced. All energy SOE Boards participating in the program have been reconstituted,
                         with the exception of Hidroelectrica, which is scheduled for later in the year. Successful IPOs have been completed in April 2013 for Transgaz and in September 2013 for
                         Nuclearelectrica, while the preparation of the IPO for the large gas producer Romgaz is advanced and likely to be completed by the end of 2013.

                         Positive steps have been taken in health care sector reforms (hospital network rationalization and the introduction of health technology assessment), but these represent only initial
                         steps in what is an overall a complex medium-term agenda.
