F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives:
The DPL-DDO objective was to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal
sustainability goals as defined by the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic
and Monetary Union (henceforth referred to as the Fiscal Compact). The reforms supported by the DPL-
DDO aimed to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending
and the Government’s revenue-raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve
governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed to
modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public
health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the reallocation of resources to high-return
preventive care and health promotion programs.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     The Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL-DDO)
was appraised and negotiated in April 2012 with the coalition government that had
implemented the DPL1-3 program during 2009-2011. The coalition Government which was
comprised at the time of the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), the Hungarian Union of
Democrats in Romania (HUDR) and the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR)
vigorously pursued fiscal consolidation. The President supported the difficult adjustment
measures proposed by the Government, and addressed the nation repeatedly to explain and
defend these measures. The coalition enjoyed a frail parliamentary support, counting on a small
majority in the lower chamber and almost parity with the opposition in the Senate. In May 2012
a new coalition government was formed by the Social-Liberal Union (USL), comprised of the
Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL), joined by UNPR and the
Conservative Party (PC). The new coalition continued the implementation of the reform agenda
supported by the DPL-DDO.
2.      During 2009-2011 – prior to the DPL-DDO approval-- Romania implemented a
program of steep fiscal consolidation, tight monetary policy and careful management of
financial sector risks, with the support of the European Commission, the IMF and the
World Bank. The program was necessary because Romania entered the financial crisis with
large domestic and external imbalances. In 2008, the headline fiscal deficit reached 4.8 percent
of GDP (the structural fiscal deficit was even larger at 7.5 percent of GDP), while the current
account deficit was 11.6 percent of GDP, prompting the Government to take swift action to
correct the imbalances. As a result of these actions, the structural fiscal deficit fell to 2.8 percent
in 2011, annual average inflation declined from 7.8 percent to 5.8 percent, and the financial
sector weathered well the impact of the international crisis, with no bank failures and adequate
capital adequacy and liquidity ratios. Nonetheless, non-performing loans increased and credit
to the economy did not recover. The economy showed signs of recovery in 2011 with a 2.2
percent growth driven by strong performance in agriculture and strong export dynamism.
Exports advanced by 31 percent in 2011 in Euro terms compared with 2008. The Government’s
program was supported by a €20 billion financial package by the IMF (€13 billion Stand-By
Arrangement, SBA), the EU (€5 billion co-financing), the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD)/European Investment Bank (EIB) (€1 billion lending), and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (€1 billion DPL1-3).
3.      The DPL-DDO, together with successive IMF and EU programs, provided a fiscal
buffer to the Government in the context of fiscal consolidation and heightened external
uncertainty, while supporting the Government’s structural reforms agenda. The external
conditions and the pro-cyclical fiscal stance pursued up to the beginning of the crisis forced
the Government to center the 2009-2011 reforms on crisis management, with emphasis on
fiscal consolidation. Though the repercussions of the global financial crisis began to subside,
it became clear that Europe was facing a period of weak growth and heightened uncertainty.
At the same time, the crisis brought to surface important weaknesses of the Romanian economy,
which required decisive Government reaction. In response, the Authorities focused on the need
to consolidate fiscal gains, build fiscal buffers and accelerate structural reforms to boost a
sustainable economic recovery in the context of a weak external environment, focusing on
reforms in energy, health and state-owned enterprises. Moreover, the Authorities were


                                                  1
confronted with new policy challenges stemming from Romania’s adherence to the EU Fiscal
Compact that set more stringent fiscal rules and guidelines in response to the protracted
economic crisis 2.
4.      The 2011-2013 National Reform Program 3 (NRP) of the Government articulated
a medium-term agenda of fiscal management and structural reform which helped
underpin the DPL-DDO. The NRP marked a gradual shift of the reform agenda away from
crisis management and towards renewed growth and competitiveness gains, with a view to
resuming and accelerating progress towards convergence with EU incomes and standards of
living. In line with the DPL-DDO agenda, the NRP addressed (i) public finance reforms to
abide by the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary
Union (the Fiscal Compact) with the EU; (ii) energy sector reforms and in particular
governance of energy state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and energy market liberalization; and
(iii) public health care financial sustainability. Public finance reforms planned for 2012-2014
focused on strengthening fiscal discipline, on tax policies and tax administration and on laying
the foundations for the strengthening of linkages between planning and spending. Energy sector
objectives included improved governance and contracting practices in SOEs, as well as
legislative and regulatory reforms to deregulate markets, enhance competition and attract
private investment. Health sector reforms sought to contain rising costs, increase the efficiency
of public spending for health, and improve the quality and equity of services.
5.      The DPL-DDO was requested by the Government during the consultations for the
preparation of the mid-term Progress Report on the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 4 and was consistent with the FY09-13 CPS. The focus and the design of the DPL-
DDO reflected: (i) the more protracted crisis and the greater impact of the unfavorable
economic climate in the EU, demanding rapid responses; (ii) the need to harmonize the DPL-
DDO objectives and implementation timing with the IMF and EU programs; and (iii) the need
to express the institutional and legal reforms proposed by the CPS into quick deliverables with
monitorable outcomes. The DPL-DDO was aligned with the objectives of the FY09-13 CPS
under the pillars of public sector reform; growth and competitiveness; and social and spatial
inclusion, namely to: (i) reduce fiscal vulnerabilities by restoring budget discipline, improving
the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures, and improving resource mobilization;
(ii) improve the business environment and the capacity to enforce competitive business
practices in the marketplace; (ii) support Romania in implementing its energy strategy in line
with the EU Directives; and (iv) support the design and implementation of the Government’s
health sector reform program to improve the efficiency and quality of health services, mobilize
additional resources for health and improve health outcomes.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.     The DPL-DDO extended and deepened Romania’s 2009-2011 reform agenda in
the areas of public finance, public health, and energy sector governance. In synergy with


2
  Romania signed in 2012 the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary
Union (known as the Fiscal Compact), committing to reducing its structural fiscal deficit to the Medium-Term
Objective (MTO) of one percent of GDP by 2015.
3
  The NRP is a program of structural policy measures prepared by the EU members in the context of the EU-wide
Europe 2020 Strategy. It presents the three-year ahead policy agenda through which an EU member country
proposes to meet its Europe 2020 targets for smart, sustainable and inclusive economic development.
4
  The mid-term Progress Report on the CPS was finalized in November 2011 and proposed adjustments to the FY
09-13 CPS, which was prepared before the outburst of the crisis, to respond to the uncertain situation in the EU
at the time, help accelerate economic recovery and manage fiscal and financial risks.


                                                       2
IMF and EU precautionary programs concluded in 2011 and 2013, the DPL-DDO helped
Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact.
Consistent with the timing envisaged for effectiveness, the PDOs of the DPL-DDO were
formulated for a three-year period and included: (i) improving public financial management to
enhance the efficiency of public spending, and the Government’s revenue-raising capacity
through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improving governance of SOEs in the energy sector
to generate savings and attract the private capital needed to modernize plants and increase
competitiveness; and (iii) enhancing fiscal sustainability of public health care through
reduction of inefficient outlays and reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and
health promotion programs.
7.      The financing provided by the DPL-DDO helped the Government to increase its
fiscal buffer (Table 1). The fiscal buffer was defined in the Government’s Public Debt
Strategy 2011-13, and was in accordance with the Convergence Program 5 for 2012-2015 and
with the agreements with the EC and the IMF. The fiscal buffer consisted of: (i) funds held at
the National Bank of Romania (NBR); and (ii) the DPL-DDO funds, which could be drawn
upon by the Government in case of shocks that were beyond the control of the Government
and could cause challenges to the financing strategy. It was the objective of the Government
to build a fiscal buffer equivalent to about 4 months of financing needed for 2012 and beyond
amounting to about € 5-6 billion 6.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
9.      There were no changes in the proposed PDOs and the results framework of the
DPL-DDO. However, to better capture the complexity of the reforms supported by the DPL-
DDO and their outcomes, four additional indicators were proposed and monitored jointly with
the Government outside the original results framework: (i) the consolidated budget revenue
ratio to the GDP; (ii) the structural fiscal deficit ratio to the GDP; (iii) Hidroelectrica’s net
annual profit; and (iv) the number of Hidroelectrica’s directly negotiated bilateral sales
contracts. Progress on all indicators, including the ones above, was discussed with the
Government during the quarterly supervision missions.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program
10.     The DPL-DDO supported public finance reforms to improve tax compliance,
increase tax revenues, reduce tax administration costs and strengthen budget discipline.
These reforms aimed at increasing revenue collection, significantly reducing the number of tax
offices for small taxpayers (from 362 offices in 2011 to 47 offices by end-2014), the expansion
of electronic filing to capture over 90 percent of all legal entities, and strategic fiscal
management on the basis of a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with the EU Fiscal
Compact.
11.     The Authorities implemented significant prior tax and budgeting actions. By April
2012, they: (i) reduced by 39 percent the number of tax offices for small taxpayers; (ii)
expanded e-filing by legal entities to 80 percent; (iii) approved the restructuring plan of the
National Tax Administration Agency (ANAF) for 2012-14; (iv) enacted the 2012 Budget Law
in line with the 2012-14 Fiscal Strategy; and (v) submitted to the EU the Convergence Program
Report for 2012-15 including a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with commitments
undertaken under the EU Fiscal Compact (Table 2).

12.     Reforms of state-owned energy generation companies aimed at fostering market
competition and increasing investment, energy efficiency and economic growth. The SOE
sector is large in Romania, especially in energy, and these reforms were necessary to remove
market distortions, improve the transparency of contracts and sales and restore the financial
situation of the respective SOEs. The DPL-DDO supported the termination or renegotiation of
direct bilateral contracts for electricity sales by SOEs, increased reliance on the transparent
OPCOM Power Exchange for electricity sales, and the establishment of a gas trading platform,
and price and tariff deregulation for electricity and gas.
13.     Prior actions in the energy sector included critical legislative and regulatory
measures. The Government approved a Memorandum mandating electricity sales by
Hidroelectrica (a large SOE producing around 30 percent of Romania’s electricity) through
competitive market processes and publishing information on all bilateral contracts for
electricity sales 7 . A new Electricity Law was approved by Parliament, through which the
Government transposed the EU Third Energy Package of Energy Reforms and set forth the
operational and financial autonomy of the energy regulator ANRE, and approved a roadmap
for phasing out regulated prices for electricity for companies and households 8 (Table 2).

14.    The DPL-DDO supported efficiency gains and financial sustainability in the health
sector. The DPL-DDO supported Government measures to rationalize the use of drugs,
treatments, technology and hospital facilities, and reallocate resources to more efficient health
prevention and promotion programs. These reforms were necessary to address the heavy bias
towards inpatient hospital care and remove inefficiencies and unnecessary services or
treatments.
15.     Prior actions in the health sector. The Government revised the list of subsidized drugs
to exclude drugs being used outside the terms of their marketing approval or for which there is
no medical evidence supporting their indication 9 . The National Health Insurance House
(NHIH) set forth the conditions under which drugs in the basic health package can be
reimbursed 10 and implemented the 2012 National Hospital Master Bed Plan approved by the
Government 11 (Table 2).

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
16.     There were no changes in the policy areas supported by the DPL-DDO.

1.6 Other significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
and schedule, and funding allocations:
17.    There were no changes in the DPL-DDO design, scope, scale, implementation
arrangements, and funding allocations. The duration of the program was up to three years (until
June 2015), with the possibility of an extension for another three years. The Government drew
the money under the program in two tranches, closing the loan in October 2014 (see para 19).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

18.      The DPL-DDO program was delivered in a timely manner and funds were fully
disbursed one year before the expiration of the program in June 2015. Disbursements were
contingent on a satisfactory medium-term macroeconomic framework and satisfactory
progress on the reform agenda, which has been the case throughout the effectiveness period.
The DPL-DDO was fully disbursed in two tranches, of €700 million in mid-October 2013 and
of €300 million at end-June 2014. While the initial intention of the government was not to draw
the DPL-DDO, debt management considerations and the unexpected sharp increase in the geo-
political tensions in neighboring Ukraine, leading to considerably heightened risks and
volatility of the markets, prompted the government to request the withdrawal of the funds to
consolidate its fiscal buffer as a precautionary measure.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

19.    Political commitment during DPL-DDO preparation. The DPL-DDO was prepared
and negotiated with the outgoing Administration that had demonstrated commitment to
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms during 2009-2011 and had built a sound
partnership with the Bank, the EU and the IMF. The Government had taken strong and

unpopular measures during 2009-2010 via wage and pension cuts and VAT and social
contribution hikes and implemented reforms in public finance, education, health, public
administration, social assistance, public pension system and the financial sector. The IFIs and
the EU supported the Government’s program, considered that it was implemented in a
satisfactory manner and disbursed €18 billion out of the total commitments of €20 billion. The
last tranche of the IMF SBA was converted into a precautionary tranche. DPL1-3 were fully
disbursed.
20.     Political commitment during implementation. The Government that took office in
May 2012 and was responsible for implementing the DPL-DDO assumed fully Romania’s
commitments as negotiated by the previous Administration. The governing program of the new
Administration reiterated the resolve to pursue fiscal discipline and meet the targets of the EU
Fiscal Compact, and to expand and deepen the reform process. At the same time, the new
Government pledged to deepen the implementation of structural reforms, particularly in energy,
health, and the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Government also
championed the establishment of an independent energy regulator that was crucial to advancing
the DPL-DDO agenda, and continued to work on the initial public offerings (IPOs) for energy
SOEs.
21.     The rationale for continuing Bank policy and financial support was compelling.
The effects of the global crisis on the European economy proved longer and more pervasive
than expected. Notwithstanding good crisis management during 2008-2011 Romania still
needed support for macroeconomic stabilization, financial sector resilience, and incentives to
pursue pro-growth and pro-equity policies. The Bank was able to make a considerable
contribution to key areas of Romania’s medium-term strategy with knowledge gained in other
Eastern European countries and around the globe. The Bank was well respected by the
Authorities and by other stakeholders and had a proven record of cooperative relationship with
other IFIs and the EU. Moreover, its funding was available on more favorable terms than that
from other sources. Bank’s experience with energy and health sector reforms was particularly
appreciated by the Romanian authorities, the EU and IMF. The choice for a DPL-DDO
instrument, as opposed to a standard DPL, reflected the intention of the Government at the time
of the request not to withdraw the money, similarly to the precautionary IMF and EC parallel
programs, but rather to use it as insurance against risks.
22.     The DPL-DDO was designed and implemented in synergy with the IMF and the
EU. A precautionary IMF SBA approved in March 2011 provided €3.5 billion in support of
fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to boost growth, and financial assistance against
possible external shocks. A follow-up precautionary SBA of €1.98 billion was approved by the
Executive Board of the IMF in September 2013. In parallel, the Council of the EU approved
two precautionary arrangements in May 2011 and October 2013, amounting to €1.4 billion and
€2 billion, respectively. Both 2011 programs were considered successful by the IMF and the
EU in preserving macroeconomic stability and advancing economic adjustment, although
progress on the structural reform agenda was uneven. No money was drawn by the Authorities
under the two programs. The signing of the second precautionary agreements with the IMF and
the EC in 2013 provided a framework for updating the reform agenda, although implementation
was uneven. Both agreements helped to better fine-tune the direction for the reforms supported
by the DPL-DDO, laying the foundation for the next series of DPLs; the first DPL was
approved by the Bank’s Board in May 2014.
23.     Relevant lessons were taken into account. The DPL-DDO preparation and its
implementation benefitted from lessons learned during the implementation of the previous DPL
series, the implementation of the Bank portfolio in Romania, feedback from stakeholders


                                               7
during the preparation of the Romania Country Economic Memorandum, which focused on
drivers of growth and competitiveness 12, and the IEG study on the WBG response to the global
crisis 13. The DPL-DDO built on the Bank’s comparative advantage in development policy
lending and in analytical work and coordinated closely with the EU and the IMF in designing
and monitoring the program agreed upfront with the Government. The Bank also provided
reimbursable and grant technical assistance to address policy and implementation issues, and
engaged in a dialogue with the Prime Minister’s Office and the Presidency. But the most
important lesson learned that was used during the preparation and implementation of the DPL-
DDO program was to forge a professional, open and honest relation with key government
counterparts, which was managed for the most part directly from the Bank’s country office in
Bucharest.
24.     The DPL-DDO was underpinned by relevant analytical work and technical
assistance. The Bank carried out analytical work on macroeconomic management, public
sector reforms, SOE performance, and energy under the CEM (2011-2013); on public financial
management, including on tax and budgeting, under the Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review (PEIR) in 2009 and the Functional Review of the Public Finance Sector (2010-2011) 14;
on medium-term budgeting, human development and the energy sector under the 2009-2011
Policy Notes for the Government; on health under the Functional Review of the Health Sector
(2011); and on energy under the Functional Review of the Energy Sector (2011). Technical
assistance on fiscal decentralization, tax administration, the modernization of public
administration, health and education was implemented in FY11-12. Long-term institutional
reforms initiated by the DPL-DDO (e.g., in tax administration and health sector) have been
followed up closely with investment operation that are currently under implementation (see
below).
25.     The DPL-DDO design was focused, consistent with EU and IMF arrangements
and well adapted to Romania’s political situation and capacities, triggering further
reforms in the areas covered by the operation. The program was explicitly focused on public
sector management priorities which complemented the IMF and EU-supported programs. The
success of the reforms pursued under the DPL-DDO catalyzed the interest of the Government
towards deepening the reforms in tax administration and health through dedicated investment
projects of the World Bank and through the establishment of a Delivery Unit in the Chancellery
of the Prime Minister, aimed at helping delivering quick wins in energy, tax administration,
public procurement and job creation (see the details below). The choice of a deferred drawdown
option (DDO) was made at the request of the outgoing Government. The Ministry of Public
Finance was particularly keen in ensuring that the facility be part of a legally established buffer
of about 4 months of the annual financing needs of the budget to be used in the event of a new
major external shock (about €5 billion). 15 The buffer is being maintained up to this day –with
disbursed funds used also to facilitate treasury and debt management operations, such as bond

ample public debates were organized on the main themes of the report. The debates were attended by all relevant
stakeholders (government, business community, academia, trade unions, etc.) and benefitted from international
presence, including from the IMF, the EU and European think-tanks.

   The Operations Committee also suggested the option of a regular DPL, but the Government (in hindsight
rightly) insisted for a DDO.

re-openings, which required a larger amount of liquidity. Thus, the DPL-DDO proceeds were
not used to widen either the fiscal deficit and/or directly support routinely public expenditures.
26.       Key risks were broadly identified at appraisal, and were largely mitigated:
      •   Economic, fiscal and financial risks stemming mostly from the vulnerability of
          Romania’s economy and financial sector to the volatile external environment and the
          severity of the crisis in Europe were successfully mitigated by firm macroeconomic
          management, strict and pro-active supervision of the financial sector, mobilization of
          EU structural and cohesion funds, tight public expenditure control and the dynamic
          response of the economy. External and internal imbalances were substantially reduced
          (see Table 2) and no bank had to resort to support from the Government or the central
          bank. Nevertheless, macroeconomic performance during implementation fell short of
          the outcomes projected at appraisal (See the Macroeconomic Performance section). The
          risks stemming from the large and poorly performing SOE 16 sector were partly
          mitigated by imposing harder budget constraints and through corporate governance
          reforms. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to enhance the governance of SOEs to
          reduce arrears, attract investment and enhance profitability. The SOE reform agenda is
          a long term process and is supported by the ongoing DPL series. The time needed for
          and the costs associated with the restructuring of the Tax Agency were underestimated,
          as it took longer for the Agency to reduce administrative costs. In addition, the Tax
          Agency has renounced the plans to further downsize the number of offices, as
          committed through the 2012-2014 restructuring plan.
      •   Political risks identified were associated with the local and parliamentary elections of
          2012 but they did not materialize as the new majority coalition formed in the Parliament
          following elections in June 2012 and the new Government firmly continued the
          implementation of the reform agenda supported by the DPL- DDO as agreed with their
          predecessors. However, progress on the structural reforms slowed down in 2015,
          delaying the implementation of the programs with the EU, the IMF and of the FEG-
          DPL.
      •   Social risks identified were associated in particular with potential employment and
          wage cuts stemming from the restructuring of the public and SOE sectors, an increase
          in energy prices following markets liberalization and the lingering effects of the 2009-
          2010 fiscal austerity package. The social risks were successfully mitigated by the
          Government. At the macro level, the return of the economy to positive growth and firm
          expenditure control allowed the Government to find the resources to restore the salary
          cuts of 2010 in the public sector. The impact of energy price increases under the Third
          EU Energy Reform Package introduced in the summer of 2012 was mitigated by the
          coverage of the safety nets for the poorest households (minimum guaranteed income
          and family benefits) and the heating benefits; with additional resources allocated to
          these programs in 2013. In particular, the government eliminated a series of assets
          filters that increased the ability of people to apply to all these programs and also

   The SOE sector is large in Romania. It consists of more than 1,000 SOEs, of which over 250 are overseen by
the central government. SOEs are dominant in energy and transport and have endemically been a source of
arrears and fiscal risks.

         increased budget allocations in the 2013 mid-year rectification 17. Is also important to
         mention that the increased competition following the liberalization of the electricity
         market, aided also by the rapid development of the renewable sector, and the
         elimination of the bilateral contracts of Hidroelectrica, which now sells its output on
         the OPCOM energy platform, resulted in a decline of the wholesale electricity prices
         that trickled down to households. As an example, wholesale electricity prices declined
         by over 15 percent in 2014 relative to 2013 on the OPCOM centralized market for
         bilateral contracts. Thus, while tariffs for gas were raised (by about 10 percent per year
         in nominal terms), retail tariffs for electricity –the most widely used source of energy –
         increased less than initially expected following the liberalization. SOEs’ privatization
         has not been accompanies by collective lay-offs, with the exception of the rail freight
         company CFR Marfa. The privatization of CFR Marfa failed in its first attempt, but the
         process has been restarted, albeit with delays, and is expected to be finalized in 2016 18.
     •   Capacity constraints were partly mitigated by technical assistance, mainly delivered as
         part of supervision missions for the DPL-DDO, but limited capacity remains a main
         constraint to policy design and implementation. The Bank helped address this weakness
         by organizing quarterly supervision missions which offered advice to the implementing
         agencies on how to approach the reform measures committed to in the program. The
         Bank has an active Reimbursable Advisory Service Portfolio in Romania, but none of
         these focus on the core reform areas covered in the DPL-DDO (e.g., Tax Administration,
         Energy and Health). An investment project in support of the Tax Administration
         reforms initiated under the DPL-DDO launched in late 2013 is expected to fill in
         capacity gaps and provide continuity to this dialogue. Similarly for the investment
         project in Health approved by Banks’ Board in March 2014. But none of these two
         projects was under implementation (i.e., effective) neither during the period in which
         the DPL-DDO was approved nor during the time that the further commitments
         undertaken in the Letter of Development Policy were implemented. In Energy, the
         DPL-DDO supervision budget facilitated an active and continued presence of a senior
         bank staff.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
27.     M&E design. The DPL-DDO included a policy matrix for prior actions and end-
program outcome indicators. The matrix did not propose interim results indicators. Outcome
indicators matched the availability of statistics provided by the Government and other publicly-
available sources of information.
28.     M&E implementation. The Bank agreed with the Government on monitoring
arrangements that included a quarterly assessment of the macroeconomic framework and of
progress towards the reform agenda, based on the policy matrix and the LDP. The supervision
benefited from quarterly visits of Bank technical teams throughout the implementation of the
DPL-DDO and was coordinated and sometimes carried out jointly with the IMF and EU. The
Bank office in Bucharest, through the Country Management Unit, the Country Economist and
the technical experts, provided ongoing M&E of the program and policy dialogue related to the
DPL-DDO. The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) was responsible for overall Government


17
   While the overall increase in 2013 was relatively small (only about 120 million RON) it allow the Ministry of
Labor and Social Protection to increase coverage of the two means-tested programs by about 20 percent (from
approximately 529,000 to about 630,000 individuals) according to Bank staff estimates.
18
   The privatization of CFR Marfa led to around 2,400 redundancies from the company in 2014.


                                                      10
specific monitoring duties and coordinated actions among all concerned ministries and
agencies. The MoPF provided monitoring reports on the implementation of the agreed
macroeconomic framework, on progress towards reforms, and on achievement of the proposed
outcomes. MoPF also ensured the Bank’s access to the requisite data and reports produced by
the National Bank of Romania (NBR), the Ministries of Economy and Health, and other
ministries and agencies as needed. The General Directorate for International Financial
Relations in the Ministry of Public Finance devoted staff to accompany supervision missions
and actively participated in the drafting of Aide Memoires. They also followed up closely on
DPL-DDO implementation issues between supervision missions and liaised with the Bank
office in Romania.
29.   M&E utilization. The new Programmatic DPL in support of Fiscal Effectiveness and
Growth (FEG-DPL) has picked up key follow up steps in the areas of public finance, energy
and SOEs that started as part of the LDP in the DPL-DDO. The M&E arrangements for the
FEG-DPL are the same as for the DPL-DDO, including on the Government’s side.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
30.      The CPS for 2014-17 proposed two new DPL series, tentatively scheduled to be
delivered as one DPL per year 19. The first loan of the two-operation “Fiscal Effectiveness
and Growth” DPLs (FEG-DPLs) was approved in May 2014 and extended a loan of €750
million. The second DPL is under preparation and is proposed to be submitted to the Board in
the fiscal year 2016. The PDO of the FEG-DPL is to support Romania’s goals of: (i)
strengthening fiscal management (debt management and the quality of public spending) and
the performance of state-owned enterprises; and of (ii) improving the functioning of the
property, energy and capital markets. The DPLs continue and deepen Romania’s reforms in
debt management, investment prioritization and the effectiveness of pro-poor spending
programs, performance of SOEs; energy, including the implementation of the Roadmaps for
electricity and gas liberalization; help improve the functioning of the property market by
adopting new cadaster legislation; and support the modernization of the legal and institutional
framework for the capital markets. Policy-based sector operations in health, education, energy,
social inclusion and justice were also planned. The “Health Sector Reform Project” (€250
million) was approved in March 2014 and focuses on needed hospital rationalization and
institutional investments, while the “Romania Secondary Education Project” (€200 million)
was approved in March 2015 and it is aimed at improving the transition of the students from
upper secondary into tertiary education.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
31.   The relevance of objectives, design and implementation to country priorities and
Bank assistance strategy is satisfactory:
    •   The relevance of the DPL-DDO objectives to Romania’s development priorities is
        satisfactory. The DPL-DDO agenda was congruent with Romania’s EU convergence
        objective, which imposed measures to restore investor confidence, deliver
        commitments made at the time of EU accession on liberalization of energy markets,
        and reverse the decline in health standards.

                                                   11
      •   The design relevance is satisfactory. The Government decided to pursue a reform
          agenda which reflected its policy priorities in budget management, energy and health.
          The design of the program, the selected outcome indicators and targets matched the
          expectations of the Government.
      •   The relevance of implementation is satisfactory. The DPL-DDO provided critical
          substance to the objectives set by the Government in the areas of intervention. The
          DPL-DDO and parallel Bank activities helped design, implement and monitor the
          Government’s reform agenda in the areas of tax administration, SOEs’ governance,
          SOEs’ privatization, liberalization of energy markets, and management of health
          services.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
32.     PDOs were achieved to a large extent and most proposed outcomes and outputs
were delivered. Romania stayed the course on the reform agenda supported by the DPL-DDO,
and by mid- or end-2014 it had met most of the outcome indicators proposed by the operation
and of the output indicators advanced by the LDP, or was well on track.
(a)       Macroeconomic Performance
33.    Macroeconomic performance was good but fell short of the performance projected
at appraisal. DPL-DDO supervision missions evaluated the implementation of the
macroeconomic framework of the program as satisfactory, taking into account the impact of
the protracted international economic and financial crisis, and in particular the substantially
worse-than-expected impact of the crisis in the EU. Good macroeconomic management
throughout the program implementation period led to a significant reduction of the internal and
external imbalances. The fiscal deficit reached 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014, the lowest level
since 2006. The execution of the consolidated budget at half-year in 2015 showed a budget
surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP, driven by expenditure restraint and good revenue collection.
The current account deficit was 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Inflation was 1.2 percent at end-
June-2015, enabling the central bank to cut its policy rate to 1.75 percent in May 2015, the
lowest level in the last two decades. The economy also resurged in 2013 –driving mainly by
exports although domestic demand started to contribute as well during the last part of 2013—
but slowed down again in 2014. Economic growth accelerated further in 2015. Growth was 3.8
percent in the first half of 2015, one the highest in the EU, driven by exports and domestic
demand.
34.      In retrospect, some of the targets of the original macroeconomic framework for
2012-2014 were optimistic. The initial macroeconomic targets assumed “growth to accelerate
gradually to 4 percent by 2015, buoyed primarily by further rising domestic demand and
measures to improve competitiveness.” While economic growth indeed picked up significantly
in 2013, driven by domestic demand and exports, as predicted at appraisal, the average during
the implementation period 2012-14 was around 2.3 percent, strongly affected by the modest
performance in 2012. Similarly, demand, savings, investment and credit to the private sector
have been lower than anticipated. The cash and structural fiscal deficits during the 2012-14 (at
2.3 and 1.8 percent of GDP, respectively) were also higher than projected (e.g., 1.9 and 0.4
percent of GDP, respectively), mainly on the account of lower than envisaged revenue
collection (for the structural deficit, the output gap closed faster than envisaged in part due to
revisions to the potential GDP). Exports, however, performed better than expected, and
together with imports depressed by sluggish demand led to trade and current account deficits
lower than initially projected (Table 3).

35.     The actual macroeconomic framework during the DPL-DDO was consistent with
financial sustainability and economic growth objectives. Driven by strong exports, a robust
industrial output and a good agricultural season, the 3.5 percent growth in 2013 was the highest
of all EU-28 countries. In 2014 growth slowed down to 2.8 percent, due to the worsening
economic conditions in the Europe, but remained above the EU average, as domestic demand
gradually picked up and structural reforms such as the liberalization of energy began to take
effect. Domestic demand, which was virtually stagnant in 2012-2013, has been slowly
overtaking exports as the main driver of growth, but public investment has not picked up
significantly partly due to a continued slow absorption of EU funds. Private investment was
affected by the global economic conditions and by a needed trimming of a generous subsidy
scheme in support of renewable energy. On the other hand, investments by SOEs in the energy
sector picked up – partly as a result of the DPL-DDO sponsored reforms to the sector and these
SOEs. Inflation remains low mainly due to low energy and food prices, but also due to the
reduction in VAT for food, implemented in June 2015 20. Finally, as designed at appraisal, the
DPL-DDO funds contributed to the buildup of the fiscal buffer. As indicated in Table 1 above,
the fiscal buffer increased to € 5.5 billion in 2013 and has since been maintained over 2013-
2015.
36.     Romania’s macroeconomic performance boosted its external credit rating. Due to
its achievements in macroeconomic consolidation and economic recovery, in May 2014
Standard & Poor (S&P) raised Romania’s long-term sovereign bond rating from BB+ to BBB-,
the lowest investment grade, putting it on a par with Brazil, Russia and Spain. 21 Spreads and
yields of sovereign bonds have fallen steadily since 2012. This reflects Romania’s rapid
progress in improving its external and internal balances and maintaining financial stability.
IPOs by two energy companies (in the Bucharest Stock Exchange but traded also in London)
have also put Romania in the radar screen of international investment funds. Fitch and Moody’s
upgraded Romania’s rating to a similar level in April 2014. Romania successfully tapped the

international markets with its first ever 30-year bond in 2014 and all Government bonds issued
in 2014 and 2015 were substantially over-subscribed.

(b) Public Finance Reforms
37.      In this area two outcome indicators were exceeded, while one was met later than
estimated at appraisal. Tax revenue and cash budget deficit targets were exceeded: tax
revenue increased by €4.1 billion equivalent compared to the proposed increase of only €0.5
billion, while the cash budget deficit of the general government declined to 1.9 percent of GDP
in 2014, against a proposed target of under 3 percent. The original tax revenue target was
however modest to account for the expected temporary disruptions due to the reform of tax
administration and the overall economic uncertainty. The tax administration costs target was
not met in 2014 (Table 4). However, by mid-2015, administration costs fell to below the end-
program target, driven primarily by a good revenue collection performance of the Tax
Administration Agency. The fiscal deficit reduction was achieved through cuts in expenditure,
both capital expenditure, which declined from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to 6.5 percent of
GDP in 2012 and to an estimated 5.4 percent of GDP in 2014, and current expenditure. Tax
administration costs marginally increased in 2013 (to 1.15 percent) as a proportion of tax
revenue due to delays in the proposed consolidation of the tax offices system, disruptions
inherent to the process, and increased expenditure to combat fraud and enhance transparency,
by financing the reallocation of about 1,700 staff to prevention and control activities, creation
of a General Directorate for Fiscal Antifraud and development of a taxpayers’ portal and a
database for both central and local governments. Administration costs declined in 2014 to 1.11
percent in 2014 and to 1.03 at end-June 2015 and the Tax Administration Agency is confident
that the costs will further decline in the medium term due to the reorganization. At the same
time, the Tax Administration Agency decided to halt the further downsizing of its territorial
network, in spite of committing to reduce the number of offices from 221 to 47 for small tax
payers through the 2012 restructuring plan. The Bank continues to provide support to the Tax
Administration Agency through the RAMP investment project, which helps with the
modernization of the business processes, the information systems and risk management.

38.     The Government remains committed to a strong fiscal framework, but risks
remain. The general budget deficit was 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014, and has recorded a surplus
of 0.9 percent of GDP during the first six months of 2015. The structural budget deficit was
1.8 percent of GDP in 2014 and will likely remain at a similar level in 2015. By end-2015,
Ministry of Public Finance projections suggest the headline cash deficit will be below 1.8
percent of GDP. These targets will likely be attained given good revenue projections and
expenditure restraint. A recent reduction of the social contributions (by 5 percentage points, in
October 2014) was promoted by the Government, as payroll taxes in Romania were among the
highest in Europe. Romania continues to maintain its fiscal buffer equivalent to over €5 billion
(around four months of budget and debt financing). The fiscal deficit is however expected to
widen in 2016 following the decision of the Government to reduce the overall VAT level from
24 percent to 20 percent starting with January 2016. In addition, there will be wage increases


                                                   14
for public sector employees, including for doctors and teachers. The Government is
nevertheless confident that the consolidated budget deficit will not exceed 3 percent of GDP in
2016.

Energy Sector Reforms
39.     All but one of the DPL-DDO outcomes on the improved governance of SOEs in
the energy sector were met (Table 5). No new directly negotiated bilateral contracts for sale
of electricity have been concluded since 2012. The share of SOEs’ electricity sales through
direct contracts declined from 25 percent in 2011 to less than 9.2 percent in 2014. In 2014, 83
percent of all electricity generation was sold in OPCOM Power exchange market, compared
with 25 percent in 2011. Electricity sales to non-residential consumers were fully deregulated
and the share of electricity sales at regulated prices fell from 50 percent in 2011 to 17.9 percent
in 2014. Since January 2014, all wholesale electricity sales for non-residential consumers have
been done at market prices (zero electricity sales at regulated tariffs). Hidroelectrica’s gross
pre-tax revenue increased from €755 million in 2011 to €765.8 million in 2014, but below the
target of € 898 million, due to lower than anticipated water inflows and the decline in wholesale
prices due to market liberalization (the only outcome target not met in this section). However,
due to bold restructuring measures, Hidroelectrica’s net profit increased remarkably, from €1.4
million in 2011 to €214 million in 2014, and the company is on track to beat the 2014 profit
record in 2015. At the same time, the ongoing legal disputes between Hidroelectrica and the
traders which had benefited from the bilateral contracts forced the company to re-enter
insolvency in 2014. The financial position of the company remains nevertheless solid and the
company is expected to exit insolvency in 2016. The Government plans to subsequently list
Hidroelectrica through an IPO.

40.     Progress in improving the functioning of the energy markets has been remarkable,
placing Romania as regional leader in energy market reforms. The reforms supported by
the DPL-DDO contributed to the full liberalization of the electricity market for non-households
and increased the competitiveness of energy SOEs. The reforms already led to increases in the
profits and own investment of energy SOEs, and attracted private capital through privatization
and market liberalization. Under the FEG-DPL, the gas market was also fully liberalized for
non-residential consumers. The liberalization of the electricity and gas markets for households
is on track, and the Government has put in place social measures to mitigate the impact.




                                                               15
(c) Health Sector Efficiency Gains
41.     In this area, two outcome indicators exceeded the targets and one was not met. The
savings from the revision of the basic package of health services were below the target of €
100 million at end-2014. Evidence indicates that NHIH reimbursement of compensated drugs
prescribed without compelling medical evidence (in particular the eritropoetine group and the
gingko-biloba) was reduced in 2012-14 by an estimated of €26 million cumulatively through
the elimination of the two groups of medicines from the basic package. Although below the
proposed DPL-DDO savings of €100 million (i.e., the full amount of estimated NHIH
reimbursement for these drugs in 2011) this outcome was considered an improvement worth
highlighting, as this measure will continue to add savings in the future. At the same time, 16
new molecules (drugs) were introduced on the list of the basic package in May 2014 and
another 23 in November 2014, the former without being ex-ante evaluated through the HTA
framework, as committed under the DPL-DDO. The MoH does not compute savings from the
basic package on a regular basis. The number of hospital beds for acute care contracted by
NHIH declined faster than anticipated, from 129,524 in 2011 to 121,579 in June 2014 (by 6.1
percent), below the end-program target of 123,127. 22 Health prevention and promotion
programs are being strengthened by the MoH and treatment programs are transferred to NHIH.
In 2014, preventive and health promotion programs received 36.9 percent of the state budget
for all National Programs compared with 16 percent in 2011 (Table 6). As an example, the
MoH allocated in 2014 about €4.3 million to a new program for early detection of cervical
cancer, and the treatment of diabetes was moved from the National Program to NHIH, where
it belongs.

42.     The Government implemented additional measures to control expenditures, and
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare. A negative list of health services and
drugs was introduced by NHIH based on the recommendations of the technical assistance
activities carried out by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).
The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) department of the MoH is now operational, and
designed an interim simplified HTA methodology, currently applied to pre-approved new
drugs. Co-payments for hospital services (excluding emergency services), based on modest
fixed amounts were introduced in March 2013. The MoH started to implement a
comprehensive reform of the healthcare system, focused on a minimum health package, a basic
health package, the list of reimbursable drugs, and updating of national health care programs.
43.    In 2013 the Ministry of Health (MoH) started to gradually introduce the
centralization of procurement of medical supplies and medical devices. The objective of
the decision was to lower unit prices, improve transparency and oversight, and the availability
and predictability of flow of inputs and move towards standardization. In 2012, MoH was

  Despite this reduction that followed a 16 percent reduction during 2002-2007 in the number of acute care beds,
Romania has 30 percent more beds and 29 percent more hospital admissions per 1,000 population than the EU-
15 average (PAD for “Health Reform Project”, March 2014).

designated as the centralized unit for public procurement, empowered to sign framework
agreements on behalf of and for the public medical units from its network and from the network
of the local governments. At the level of MoH, centralized procurement is organized for a
number of medicines, medical equipment, medical devices, protective equipment, services,
fuels and lubricants and the list is under expansion. Biddings are organized by the Department
of Public Procurement based on the needs estimation done by the technical departments from
the MoH. For 2014 a number of 15 packages were developed under procurement procedures
producing budgetary savings estimated at around €10 million.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.     The Moderately Satisfactory rating is based on the DPL-DDO relevance, measures
and outcomes. The relevance of objectives is satisfactory, while design and implementation,
the outcome indicators and the outputs proposed by the DPL-DDO are moderately satisfactory.
The DPL-DDO relevance is conferred by its consonance with the Government’s overall reform
program, and its consistency with the reform areas supported by IMF and the EU. The design
of the operation and its implementation are moderately satisfactory. Some risks were under-
estimated during the design phase, such as those associated with the restructuring of the Tax
Administration Agency. Implementation also had some shortcomings, mainly in health, where
the restructuring of basic package of services did not have the depth expected at appraisal.
Proposed outcomes and outputs were met for the most part: nine out of twelve outcome
indicators were met or exceeded, two were not met (Hidroelectrica’s gross pre-tax revenues
and the potential savings from the restructuring of the health basic package), and one
(administrative costs for revenue collection) was met with a delay.
45.     The rating takes into account the sustainability of the reform agenda supported
by the DPL-DDO. The continuity of Romania’s commitment to fiscal discipline and reform
demonstrates broad support across the political spectrum. At the same time, implementation of
structural reforms slowed down in 2015, and the calendar of the FEG-DPL is delayed relative
to the original plans, although the implementation of the measures supported by the operation
continue to progress 23. The slowdown in reforms in 2015 also explains the difference in the
rating of the ICR and that of the last ISR. Public acceptance of austerity policies and respect of
EU commitments was demonstrated by the muted reaction to unpopular measures (new or
higher taxes, cuts in wages and pensions, increased energy tariffs).

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
46.    Mitigation of DPL-DDO poverty and social risks. The DPL-DDO was expected to
be overall beneficial for the poor, although some measures in energy were initially identified
as potentially detrimental. In the end, the risks either did not materialize as envisaged or were
well mitigated by the Government. As detailed in para 26, eligibility thresholds and/or benefit

     The updated calendar of the FEG-DPL envisages a Board date of early 2016.



                                                      17
levels were increased 24for the key social assistance programs- subsidies for district heating, the
minimum guaranteed income, and the family benefits, together with incentives for the
reinsertion of persons with disabilities in the labor market in 2012-2013 25. An analysis of the
Ministry of Labor 26 shows that absolute poverty 27 declined from 3.5 percent in 2011, to 3.0
percent in 2012 and to 2.9 percent in 2013.
47.     The DPL-DDO had a direct impact on gender and social development, as the increased
funding allocated to the well-targeted cash transfer programs, the guaranteed minimum income,
the family benefit and the heating subsidy to compensate for the liberalization of the energy
prices benefited primarily poor and vulnerable households with women as family head.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
48.    The DPL-DDO supported substantive institutional reforms. The operation
supported or inspired reforms in tax administration, governance of energy sector SOEs and
management of public expenditure for health:
     •   Tax administration reforms focused on improving tax collection and compliance. As
         described in section 3.2, institutional reforms in this area stemmed from the
         Government’s commitment to meet the EU Fiscal Compact goals of fiscal
         sustainability.
     •   The governance of energy SOEs benefitted from competitive selection of SOEs’ boards
         and managers, increased scope of OPCOM marketing of electricity and creation of a
         gas trading platform.
     •   Management of public expenditure in health is being strengthened through streamlining
         of the basic health package, more rigorous screening of the reimbursement of
         compensated drugs, and budget reallocation to health prevention and promotion
         programs.

49.     Policy advice and technical assistance provided by the Bank helped strengthen
critical capacities. Bank analytical work and supervision during the DPL-DDO preparation
(see section 2.2) helped the Government internalize policy advice and make policy decisions.
During DPL-DDO implementation policy advice was extended through the “Growth and
Competiveness” Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) in FY13. The DPL-DDO quarterly
supervision helped strengthen the M&E capacity of implementing agencies. A reimbursable
Advisory Services (RAS) for “Support on the Establishment of a Delivery Unit” (starting in
late 2013/early 2014) helped the authorities in the area of taxpayer services. The “Revenue
Administration Modernization Project” (RAMP) is expected to provide further and ample
technical assistance in 2015 and after. A series of RAS, currently under preparation, are
expected to provide substantial technical support for the consolidation of the public
administration, in particular in the areas of strategic planning and budgeting starting with 2016.



24
   Income poverty among the poorest 20 percent of the population is expected to be further reduced through the
consolidation of the three means-tested programs into a single flagship anti-poverty program, the Minimum Social
Insertion Income Program. This measure is supported by the FEG-DPL.

   The national absolute poverty threshold is defined as the equivalent of an intake of 2,550 calories per day per
adult-equivalent plus a minimum basked of non-food goods and services. The figures refer to dwellings. For
comparison, the figure for the absolute poverty was 15.1 percent in 2004.

50.     Bank-financed operations stemming from the DPL-DDO policy dialogue agenda
support institutional development and capacity-building. Three Bank-financed operations
benefitted from the policy dialogue fostered by the DPL-DDO: the FY13 “Revenue
Administration Modernization Project” (RAMP, €69 million), the “Health Sector Reform
Project” (€250 million) and the “First Fiscal Effectiveness and Growth” DPL (€750 million).
All these operations include substantive institutional development, technical assistance and
capacity-building activities that steamed from the DPL-DDO dialogue. The RAMP has an €6
million institutional development component supporting organizational development, auditing
systems, legal framework management, business processes, and human resources
development. The “Health Sector Reform” project finances technical assistance and training in
the areas of hospital network rationalization, ambulatory care strengthening and health sector
governance and stewardship. The first DPL for “Fiscal Effectiveness and Growth,” (FEG-DPL)
approved in July 2014, has provided support to the Government in areas, such as debt
management (coordinating closely with Treasury implemented RAS), public expenditure
management (budgeting, public investment, pro-poor spending), oversight of SOEs, safeguards
of private property rights, and supervision of capital markets. The implementation of the FEG-
DPL is supported by technical assistance in the areas of public investment and property markets
(through RASs) and capital markets (through Bank-financed analytical work).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
51.     The successful implementation of the DPL-DDO encouraged the Government to
deepen and broaden the reform agenda in public finance, energy and health, partly with
the support of the Bank. The FEG- DPL series supports reforms and institutional
strengthening in the PFM area (fiscal management, results-informed budgeting, better
management of public debt, public investment and pro-poor spending), the energy sector
(stronger governance of SOEs and further liberalization of energy markets), and for economic
growth (safeguards for private property rights, in particular cadaster and land registration, and
functioning and oversight of capital markets). The “Health Sector Reform Project” supports
the implementation of the 2014-2020 National Health Strategy and the mobilization and
efficient use of funds, including EU structural and cohesion funds.
52.     The DPL-DDO provided the catalyst for stronger coordination of economic,
financial and institutional reforms at the center of Government. The Government created
in December 2013 a Delivery Unit in the PM’s office to facilitate policy implementation and
monitoring across the government in four areas (public procurement, tax payer services, energy
and youth employment). The Delivery Unit also developed tools to support the implementation
of the Romania Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) 28.




28
  The CSRs provide tailored advice to EU member states on how to boost jobs and growth, while maintaining
sound public finances. The European Commission publishes the CSRs every spring, as part of the European
Semester, the EU's calendar for economic policy coordination. The CSRs focus on what can realistically be
achieved in the following 12-18 months to make growth stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive, in line
with the EU's long-term jobs and growth plan, the Europe 2020 Strategy.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

53.    Beneficiary Survey and Stakeholder Workshops were not conducted. However,
continued meetings with key stakeholders (e.g., unions, local level authorities, parliament, and
representatives of the pharmaceutical and private health provision industries) during
supervision activities helped the team shape the dialogue during supervision. The team also
worked actively with Government counterparts at all levels of the public administration.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate
54.     The risk to development outcome is moderate. The risk to DO can be defined in
terms of sustainability and the likelihood of reaching targets for reforms that have a longer
gestation time:
   •   Risk to sustainability is moderate: (i) macroeconomic stability is likely although not a
       given. The Fiscal Council estimated that the impact of the package of tax cuts (VAT,
       excises, special construction tax and others) to be implemented starting with 2016,
       accompanied by increases in the public sector wages, could push the budget deficit
       towards 3 percent of GDP next year in the absence of compensatory measures and will
       lead to an increase in the structural fiscal deficit. The IMF estimates that the
       implementation cost of the new Fiscal Code will be around 1.0 percent of GDP in 2016
       and 1.2 percent in 2017. Policy initiatives with fiscal impact, such as public sector wage
       increases, could be further promoted in 2016 in the context of the planned parliamentary
       elections; (ii) tax administration reform has continued and the RAMP is under
       implementation, which will help the authorities to continue to advance the restructuring
       of the Tax Agency. The FEG-DPL provides important leverage and assistance for
       improved fiscal management; (iii) further strengthening of SOEs’ governance and
       liberalization of energy markets is also supported by the FEG-DPL; and (iv) the
       Authorities are committed to consolidating and deepening health sector reforms with
       the support of the “Health Sector Reform” project.
   •   The likelihood of achieving longer-term targets is mixed. Substantial progress is
       expected in the areas of full liberalization of energy markets. The Authorities plan to
       continue with the privatization of SOEs, but the pipeline of companies planned for
       privatization in 2016 is reduced. Slow progress is anticipated for the improvements of
       health standards.
55.     Economic risks are moderate. The economy has been recovering, driven by the
gradual pick up in the domestic demand and by exports. Romania had one of the highest GDP
growth of all EU member states in the first half of 2015, of 3.8 percent, and the economy would
continue to grow in 2015-2016 at a similar pace. Future growth, expected to be driven mainly
by investment, industry and, to some extent, by exports, hinges on the Government’s ability to
reallocate public expenditure to productive public investment, mobilize EU structural and
cohesion funds, and consolidate the confidence of foreign investors. The external environment
remains constrained, with the economy of the Eurozone recording modest growth in the last
quarters, and with uncertainties surrounding the situation in neighboring Greece. Fiscal
pressures will increase in 2016 due to the cut in the level of the taxes through the Fiscal Code
and due to increases in the public sector wages. It is therefore important that the commitment
of the Government to keep the budget deficit in the limits agreed under the Fiscal Compact is
observed.



                                              20
56.     Financial risks are moderate. Romanian banks have weathered well the financial
crisis but their ability to support economic recovery is hampered by the still high level of non-
performing loans (NPLs) and ongoing deleveraging. Asset quality is improving, with NPLs
declining from 21.9 percent at end-2013 to around 13 percent at end-2014. Short-term
profitability is low. Banks’ reliance on local funding has increased following the gradual
withdrawal of parent funding, prompting the decline in loan-to-deposit ratio from 117 percent
in 2012 to below 100 percent in 2014, although with significant variation across banks. Credit
to the private sector declined by 3.1 percent in real terms in 2014. Stress tests conducted by
NBR indicate that the banking system would be resilient to severe shocks, although a number
of banks would need to raise additional capital 29.
57.    Political risks are moderate. Current economic reforms and policies are broadly
agreed with and, thus, not expected to be reversed with the parliamentary elections in 2016. A
slowdown in the implementation of the structural reforms occurred however in 2015.
58.     Non-government stakeholders’ ownership is relatively weak. One cannot talk about
stakeholders’ ownership of reforms, but rather of acceptance. In some cases, e.g., reforms in
health and education, stakeholders’ organizations take a more active role. In general, however,
proposed reforms and measures met with acknowledgement, and did not trigger opposition,
although both energy and health are strongly unionized sectors.
59.     Social risks are moderate. The combined effects of a recovering economy, opening of
EU job markets and socially-minded policies of the center-left governing coalition (e.g., VAT
reduction for food products starting with June 2015, social safety net measures, heating
subsidies, stimuli to employment) are expected to mitigate the impact of the convergence of
prices and tariffs with the EU. Some lay-offs caused by the privatization or restructuring of
SOEs are expected, but they are likely to be concentrated in a handful of companies, such as
the energy complex Hunedoara, However, compensatory measures have or will be put in place
in those cases 30.
60.      Governance risks remain significant. The European Commission reports on the Co-
operation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) state that progress notwithstanding, Romania
still faces important challenges in ensuring judicial independence, improving the consistency
of jurisprudence and judicial practices, strengthening the integrity framework, continuing the
fight against high-level corruption and extending it to lower-level corruption. The
accountability of public sector management has been enhanced in recent years with the support
of DPL1-3, DPL-DDO and the ongoing FEG-DPL, as well as with the support of sector
operations in health, education, etc. However, progress towards tangible outcomes has been
slow.
61.      Institutional and capacity risks are significant. The EU’s and IFIs’ support for
institutional reforms, technical assistance and capacity building can mitigate constraints.
However, Romania has a record of ad-hoc institutional changes in the structure and
responsibilities of government agencies, of low absorption of technical assistance, and of slow
progress on capacity building. Root causes include the absence of a coherent longer-term
strategy for capacity-building, the frequent and disruptive changes in senior administration and
political appointments, and the ingrained culture of a politicized public administration.



29
   Romania also completed in 2015 a balance sheet review and stress test of the insurance sector and started a
more comprehensive asset quality review and stress test of the banking sector.
30
   The restructuring in 2015 of the energy complex Oltenia, one of the largest electricity producers in Romania,
led to around 2,000 redundancies. Compensatory measures were put in place by the company and the Authorities.


                                                      21
Capacity constraints may become more critical as the reform process is broadened and
deepened in coming years.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
62.     Strategic relevance and approach. The DPL-DDO supported Romania’s short- to
medium-term objectives of fiscal stabilization and reform of the energy and health sectors.
Romania had weathered relatively well the impact of the 2008-2011 crisis, but at some social
costs and with mixed results: by end-2011 the economy was showing signs of recovery, but
government finances had uncomfortable cash and structural deficits, inflation was high, the
energy sector contributed little to the budget and was a source of quasi-deficits, was poorly
positioned to meet the more stringent EU energy policies and did not have the resources needed
to modernize and enhance its competitiveness 31 , and health services were inadequate. The
DPL-DDO supported the Government to address some of these issues.
63.     Macroeconomic and structural reform goals. The macroeconomic framework
agreed with the Authorities and supported by the EU, IMF and WB helped Romania to weather
well the effects of the crisis of 2009-2011. The macroeconomic targets included compliance
with the EU Fiscal Compact, improved external creditworthiness and financial sector viability.
Energy sector reforms aimed to implement the EU Third Energy Package, generate savings,
and invest in companies’ modernization and efficiency. Health sector reforms sought to
rationalize expenditure on drugs and hospital capacities, and redirect savings to high return
health prevention and promotion programs.
64.     Poverty, gender and social development. The appraisal of the DPL-DDO had
identified the poverty impact and mitigation measures. Improved fiscal management was
expected to promote investment and employment, and enhance delivery of public goods and
services. Energy sector reforms could improve business access to electricity, reduce prices, and
stimulate investment and job creation. The mitigation of energy tariffs increase included
increased heating benefits for vulnerable households, and the allocation of additional resources
to the well-targeted and cost-effective social assistance programs targeting the poorest
quintiles. Efficiency gains in the health sector were expected to finance prevention and
promotion programs with a positive impact on health outcomes for the poor.
65.    Environmental aspects. The appraisal documented the expected positive impact of the
transposition of the EU Third Package of Energy Reforms supported by the DPL-DDO.
Market-based pricing, competitive contracting, price deregulation and privatization could
foster investment in modernization of plants with up-to-date environmental standards,
exploration of cleaner natural gas production and renewable energy.
66.   Fiduciary aspects. The DPL-DDO appraisal based its fiduciary analysis on the 2003
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and subsequent steps taken by the


31
  “Doing Business 2012” ranked Romania below all other Central and Eastern European countries in 2011 on
“getting electricity”, overall and on the cost of electricity. Romania was ranked 165th out of 183 countries (the
other Central and Eastern European countries had an average rating of 85), and its cost of electricity represented
556.9% of the per capita income, compared with an average cost of 229.7% for the rest of the EU-11 countries.


                                                       22
Government to implement PFM reforms and strengthen internal control, financial reporting
and auditing systems. The appraisal noted the 2010 downgrading of Romania’s Open Budget
Index Assessment (OBI) but Government action for and during the implementation of the DPL-
DDO have mitigated this (e.g., the active consultation with stakeholders, such as the fiscal
Council).
67.    Policy and institutional aspects. The preparation of the DPL-DDO identified legal
and institutional bottlenecks and secured Government’s upfront commitment on addressing
them. This included the Government’s request for the establishment of a Delivery Unit in the
Office of the Prime Minister and a request for an operation supporting the design and
implementation of strategic planning and coordinating capacity in the center of the
Government.
68.    Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements. The Bank agreed with
the Government during appraisal on specific implementation and monitoring arrangements
which delegated to the MoPF overall coordination responsibility. The MoPF was to manage
and monitor the implementation of the macroeconomic framework and the public finance
reform, coordinate the implementation of reforms in energy and health managed by the
Ministries of Economy and Health, and report quarterly to the Bank on the status of DPL-DDO
implementation, including the macroeconomic framework and policy matrix of expected
outcomes. Bank supervision was to be carried out quarterly through expert visits to Romania,
while the Bank office in Bucharest maintained continuous engagement with the authorities.
69.    Risk assessment. Risk assessment was candid but in some instances may have under-
or overstated expected difficulties. For example, the impact of the crisis on growth prospects
was underestimated, the impact of elections on continuity of reforms was overestimated, and
the social impact of the potential increases in energy prices was overestimated. The efforts
required to restructure the Tax Administration Agency were underestimated, as well as the
capacity of MoH to comprehensively restructure the basic health package.
70.    Bank inputs and processes. The Bank’s identification mission advanced a
comprehensive agenda of reforms that could be supported by the DPL-DDO and which
provided a solid basis for the subsequent appraisal and negotiation of the operation. 32 The pre-
appraisal mission narrowed down the DPL-DDO agenda and identified prior actions and
outcomes, most of which were agreed with the Government without major changes during
negotiation. However, as explained above, some risks were under-estimated at appraisal. The
proposed DPL-DDO scope, outcomes and timing were discussed with the IMF and the EU.
The DPL-DDO was approved by the Board four months after identification.

(b) Quality of Supervision
      Rating: Satisfactory
71.     Focus on development impact. The DPL-DDO supported substantive reforms in the
energy sector and fiscal management. These reforms have set the stage for medium-term gains
in economic competitiveness and public sector management. Health sector reforms sought to
free additional resources for financing priority expenditure.
72.    Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes. Quarterly supervision ensured timely
monitoring and substantial leverage in motivating the Government to keep the DPL-DDO on
track. Aide-memoires provided feedback on the implementation of the macroeconomic

framework and the reform agenda and recommendations on specific reforms prepared or/and
implemented by the Authorities.
73.     Candor and quality of performance reporting. Bank reports were factual, candid and
constructive. Aide-Memoires provided the Government with a clear synopsis of the status of
reforms, identified openly bottlenecks, and provided explicit advice on managing obstacles to
implementation and avoiding excessive delays. The Bank was flexible in evaluating
performance and agreeing with the Government on changes in the formulation or timing of
specific actions.
74.     Transition arrangements. The implementation of the DPL-DDO provided an
opportunity for extensive and permanent policy dialogue, which prompted the Government’s
request for further policy-based Bank financing to help extend and deepen reforms supported
by DPL1-3 and DPL-DDO. Under the CPS for 2014-17, the Government endorsed a lending
program that includes four new DPLs and policy-based lending in health, education, social
inclusion, energy and justice. A first FEG-DPL and a “Health Sector Reform Project” were
approved by the Board in FY14.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.     Overall Bank performance was moderately satisfactory: moderately satisfactory
for quality at entry and satisfactory for supervision. The DPL-DDO was well focused on
critical areas of reform, outcomes were explicit, limited in number and adequately
complemented by Letter of Development Policy (LDP)-proposed outputs, and implementation
risks and constraints were reasonably identified, although some were under-estimated, and
included recommendations on mitigation. The operation was implemented timely and with
minimal changes. Bank supervision helped maintain momentum, supplemented knowledge and
capacity gaps, and ensured adequate coordination with the IMF and the EU. Outcomes and
outputs were met for the most part.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
76.     Government ownership and commitment to achieving development objectives
remained strong throughout the preparation and implementation of the DPL-DDO.
During 2012-2014 Romania had three different coalition governments; all endorsed the
objectives of the DPL-DDO and secured parliamentary support. The President supported the
program regardless of political tensions.
77.    DPL-DDO-supported reforms were consistent with Romania’s development
objectives. The DPL-DDO agenda was consonant with Romania’s National Reform Program,
convergence goals and EU commitments, including commitments assumed under the EU Fiscal
Compact and the EU Third Energy Package of Energy Reforms.
78.      Implementation arrangements and capacities built on the previous DPL1-3 series
and were adequate. Romania had a proven capacity to manage reform programs with the
Bank. The DPL1-3 series had been implemented in a satisfactory manner by the same
government agencies under the overall responsibility of the MoPF. The Prime Minister’s office
participated closely to all policy decisions, arbitrated when necessary diverging views, and
facilitated coordination with the Parliament, the National Bank of Romania, and other
stakeholders.


                                             24
79.     Monitoring and evaluation arrangements were efficient and addressed
implementation issues in a timely manner. M&E was carried out jointly with the
Government and findings were presented to senior Government officials for endorsement and
corrective actions.
80.     Coordination with the IMF and the EU was very good. The Government effectively
coordinated well the ongoing programs by the Bank with those of the IMF and the EU, all of
which were provided with a common macroeconomic framework. The synergies in the
structural reform program were also well developed and the Government encouraged joint
supervision mission with the IMF and the EU.
81.     Transition arrangements are in place. The Government is committed to maintaining
the reform momentum and has asked for the Bank’s support through new DPLs and policy-
based sector operations. Romania endorsed the CPS indicative lending program that includes
four new DPLs and policy-based sector operations in health, education, energy, social inclusion
and justice. The Board approved in FY14 the FEG-DPL and the “Health Sector Reform
Project”.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
82.     The DPL-DDO was coordinated by the MoPF and implemented by MoPF and the
Ministries of Economy (Energy Department) and Health. The MoPF coordinated
implementation of the DPL-DDO efficiently and transparently, cooperated well with the line
ministries in charge of reforms in energy and health, and brought promptly contentious issues
to the attention of senior officials, including when necessary to the Prime Minister. The line
ministries internalized DPL-DDO-proposed reforms, maintained the commitments and
delivered them in a reasonable manner. They submitted reports on time, provided clean audits
and explanatory notes and carefully tracked progress in implementation. At the same time,
however, capacity limitations were visible in implementation. The implementation of the basic
health package by MoH failed to achieve the intended savings and was more limited in scope
than initially planned, while the restructuring of the territorial network of the Tax
Administration Agency did not reach the committed downsizing. The implementing agencies
were responsive to the requests of the Bank experts and maintained a direct contact with the
Bank office in Romania.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
          Rating: Satisfactory
83.    The Satisfactory rating is predicated on several criteria: Romania’s commitment to
reform was strong at both political and technical level; the DPL-DDO program was delivered
fully and on time; implementing agencies demonstrated reasonable capacity to manage,
monitor and evaluate implementation; implementation was coordinated efficiently and in a
constructive manner with external partners; and Romania has sought and obtained Bank
support for broadening and deepening the reform process.

6. Lessons Learned
84.       General lessons:
      •   DDOs are instruments which give appropriate flexibility when governments seek to
          insure against exogenous risks. In retrospect, the choice of the DDO instrument was



                                              25
           appropriate; the Bank should consider to promote it more actively to clients which seek
           risk insurance to adverse exogenous shocks rather than direct financing 33.
       •   Continuity of country team and country office involvement is critical for success. The
           country office maintained an ongoing dialogue with the authorities, helping overcome
           obstacles to implementation through just-in-time reactions.
       •   Relevant analytical work and synergy with other Bank activities are essential. The DPL-
           DDO design was built on a solid foundation of country knowledge acquired through
           thorough analytical work.
       •   Just-in-time policy advice and technical assistance make a difference. The
           implementing agencies engaged the appropriate sector staff in the local Bank office and
           in Washington virtually on a continuous basis on policy choices and decisions.

85.        Specific lessons:
       •   Disruption created by major institutional reforms (e.g., tax administration reform,
           which required massive reallocation of staff –around 1,700 people—and the
           establishment of new offices) should not be underestimated.
       •   Properly assess the strength of vested interests (e.g., when proceeding with the
           liberalization of energy markets) could be underrated. Political leadership and direct
           involvement of senior officials (often the Prime Minister) is critical to implement
           sensitive reforms.
       •   Baseline indicators and targets (e.g., savings from elimination of certain drugs from the
           list of compensated medicine) must be firmly documented, or when revised must be
           reflected in amended targets.
       •   Definition of results indicators must be consistent over the lifetime of the operation, or
           appropriate corrections in targets must be made when revised.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

86.    The Government commented on the draft ICR through the Ministry of Public Finance,
as coordinating agency for implementation (see Annex 4 on the Borrower’s ICR). The
Authorities provided an accurate and candid summary on the implementation of the DPL-DDO.
They broadly agreed with the ICR assessment and conclusions and were satisfied with the
cooperation with the Bank. The Government continues and deepens reforms in public finance,
energy and health, as well as in other areas, with support from the ongoing FEG-DPL series.
No particular issues were raised in the Government’s feedback.

(b) The IMF and the EU

87.    The IMF and the EU largely agree with the ICR assessment and consider that the DPL-
DDO made an important contribution to Romania’s management of the crisis and the
advancements in structural reforms, particularly in energy. The two institutions call for
continued support of the Bank for Romania’s reforms and highlight the short and medium term
risks which the country faces. The two institutions emphasized the excellent cooperation with

     The Romania DPL-DDO was, to our knowledge, the first one implemented in the ECA region.

Context and Overall Assessment

The DPL-DDO extended and deepened the reform program implemented by Romania during
2009-2011 with the support of International Financial Institutions (IFIs), including the World
Bank. The implementation of the Development Policy Loans (DPL) 1-3 contributed
significantly to a successful management of the crisis and an emergent recovery in 2011. The
DPL-DDO complemented precautionary arrangements concluded by Romania with the IMF
and the EU in 2011 and 2013. This report highlights the main goals and achievements under
the program. The DPL-DDO was highly relevant to Romania’s progress towards its main
development objective of EU convergence.

The DPL-DDO objective was to help Romania accelerate progress towards fiscal sustainability
through a comprehensive three-year 2012-2014 program for: (1) public financial management
(PFM) reform; (2) energy sector reforms; and (3) health sector reforms. Specific objectives
included: better enforcement of tax laws to increase budget revenue; improved governance of
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the energy sector and resumption of their privatization with
a view to generating savings and investment for their modernization and increased
competitiveness; and improved quality and efficiency of public spending in the health sector.

The DPL-DDO was structured around specific outcomes detailed in the Policy Matrix of the
Program Document, and additional outputs proposed by the Government’s Letter of
Development Policy (LDP). Outcomes included a satisfactory macroeconomic performance
and specific targets on tax revenue and budget deficits, Hidroelectrica’s profits, deregulation
of energy tariffs, liberalization of energy markets, cost savings and reallocation of expenditure
for health to prevention and promotion programs. The LDP proposed PFM legal and
institutional reforms, reforms in SOEs’ governance, steps to resume the privatization of energy
SOEs, and revision of the basic health package.

The implementation of the DPL-DDO was coordinated by the Ministry of Public Finance
(MoPF) and executed by MoPF, the Energy Department of the Ministry of Economy 34, and the
Ministry of Health.

The Government considers that the overall implementation of the DPL-DDO was satisfactory.
Program objectives were substantially achieved and the vast majority of outcomes and outputs
were delivered as proposed. The main achievements of the program are detailed below.

Macroeconomic Framework
The macroeconomic framework for the operation remains consistent with internal and external
sustainability, able to manage risks and vulnerabilities, and conducive to overall medium-term




34
  The Ministry of Energy, Small and Medium Enterprises and the Business Environment (“MEIMMMA”) took
over the activities and structures of the former Department of Energy and of the Department of Small and
Medium Enterprises, Business Environment and Tourism, except those in the tourism sector - Government
Emergency Ordinance no. 86/2014.



                                                  31
growth. Growth has resumed, internal and external imbalances have been reduced, and the
confidence of investors has increased.

Romania had the best growth performance of all EU-28 states in 2013, when the GDP increased
by 3.5%. Economic growth was driven by a robust industrial output, strong exports and an
abundant harvest. Structural reforms, such as the liberalization of energy markets and the new
labor code, are starting to show results. Domestic demand is expected to gradually overtake net
exports as the main driver of growth. Investment is projected to regain momentum this year,
supported by better absorption of EU funds. Private consumption is expected to pick up
moderately as consumer confidence improves and disposable income increases on account of
higher real wages. At the same time, credit growth, which was in negative territory in 2013, is
expected to remain constrained by the ongoing deleveraging of households and banks.

In 2013, the balance of trade in goods and services improved strongly by 4.1% of GDP as
export growth was solid and import growth remained subdued. Exports are expected to keep
growing on the back of an improvement in the external environment, particularly in the EU.
Imports are set to rise over the forecast horizon, alongside domestic demand, outpacing export
growth in 2015.

Inflation declined significantly. This was mainly because of a drop in food prices thanks to a
good harvest, a cut in VAT on flour and bakery products, and because of a favorable base effect
from high food prices in 2012. Annual average inflation decelerated further in 2014 amid
historical lows, again thanks to falling food and fuel prices. As domestic demand recovers,
inflation is expected to pick up in the medium term. Downside risks to growth include the
slower than expected recovery in the Eurozone and rising global interest rates. Upside risks
would include higher investment induced by better-than-expected absorption of EU funds.
Risks to the inflation outlook are balanced over the forecast horizon.

The general budget cash deficit was reduced from 3 percent of GDP in 2012 to 1.9 percent in
2014. The consolidation was expenditure-driven, with total expenditures relative to GDP being
down by 1.7 percentage points (pps) and total revenues being lower by 1 pp. in 2013. The
general budget deficit is forecast at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015. The structural budget deficit
was reduced from 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011 to 1.7 percent in 2013.

Public Financial Management reforms

a) Budget reforms. We strongly focused on the key pillars of our medium-term fiscal
framework, aimed in particular to increase results-informed budgeting and enhance public
investment management.

In 2013 the Parliament enacted amendments to the Public Finance Law that empowers
us to improve results-informed budget programs. In this context, we have prepared a
detailed plan to start piloting this approach in two ministries (Ministry of Health and Ministry
of Education) and plan to adopt their 2017 budget applying the result based framework.
Ministry of Public Finance is closely working with these line ministries to issue relevant norms.
These norms are expected to be approved before starting the 2016 budget preparation process.

We have established and staffed a Public Investment Evaluation Unit (Unit) within the
Ministry of Public Finance based on the Emergency Ordinance no 88/2013. This helps
strengthen quality control in the preparation, prioritization, appraisal and management of the


                                               32
significant public investment projects financed by the central government. The significant
public investment projects financed by the central government will be subject to prioritization
criteria and vetting by this Unit. In March 2014 the Government approved the methodological
norms for the implementation of the significant projects prioritization system. A first evaluation
and prioritization process using the new approved norms took place on June 2014.

Budget execution reports were produced by sub-function (COFOG 2) for four budget
chapters’ education, defense, environment protection and public order for 2012. These
reports were submitted by the Ministry of Public Finance to the National Institute for Statistics
for Eurostat reporting purposes. Budget execution reports were not further extended to other
chapters, as initially planned, given that starting with 2014 we start using a new information
system, FOREXBUG, that ensures more detailed execution reports, (the third level COFOG 3),
for all expenditures financed out of the state budget, local budget and social insurance budget.
By the end of the 2015 the system will be implemented also at the level of the public entities
partially or entirely financed out of their own resources.

On March 31st 2014, five of the six selected ministries 35 submitted to the General
Secretariat of the Government (GSG) the updated strategic plans. GSG will help the
Ministry of Health (MoH) prepare the updated strategic plan and its 2017 budget based on
results according to the new framework, through specific consultant service provided under the
current IBRD trust fund. The purpose of this exercise is to improve the linkages between
strategic planning and policy, and the process of budget formulation and its execution through
the development of strategic sectorial plans anchored in the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy for 2015-
2017. GSG reviewed the strategic plans and made recommendations for improvements so that
they become useful input for the budget formulation process. The aim of the GSG is to work
together with line ministries to improve the design of the objectives and correlate them with
the main strategic documents of the Government (the National Reform Program, the Fiscal
Budgetary Strategy, and the Convergence Program). GSG was consulted also by MoPF in its
exercise to increase results-informed budgeting.

b) Tax administration: In order to increase the revenue collection and efficiency we have
intensified the efforts to monitor all aspects of tax collection while continuing with our
comprehensive reforms of the tax administration. For this purposes a high-level task force was
set up in October 2013 to better understand the low revenue collection in the third and fourth
quarters of 2013. As part of ANAF restructuring and modernization, we created eight regional
directorates in September 2013 and will set up 47 local offices by 2016. Around 1,700 staff
were reallocated to prevention and control activities, and in the Bucharest Region, in particular,
the resources have been increased in order to combat fraud, through the creation of the General
Directorate for Fiscal Anti-fraud. Voluntary compliance is also improving. Training programs
with the assistance of partner country tax administration specialists and IMF technical
assistance have been undertaken and a pilot structural compliance project targeted on
undocumented labor and tax evasion, in line with the EU version of the Compliance Risk
Management Model, has been recently launched. This pilot program is expected to increase
voluntary compliance and reduce tax evasion for labor and raise awareness nationwide on the
related issues. Efforts have been also made to develop taxpayer services, for example, offered
through ANAF’s portal by mid-2014 and by ensuring that the interpretation of the tax law is

Public Administration; the General Secretariat of the Government; the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development; the Ministry of Education; and the Ministry of Health.


                                                   33
unambiguous. We will set up a central database that will allow us to manage and assess together
with local authorities the data regarding taxes and contributions owed to the general
consolidated budget as well as information on properties. This will be an important source of
information for taxpayers and should also raise compliance.

c) Taxation regime. From September 2013, we reduced on a temporary basis the VAT on flour
and bakery products to 9 percent and identified countervailing measures in excises to offset the
budgetary impact. In early 2013, MoPF enacted measures to move the VAT collection onto a
cash accounting basis for companies with annual turnover below € 500,000. A solidarity levy
on the windfall gains from the deregulation of gas prices was introduced starting with February
2013. In the meantime an inter-ministerial working group is preparing a strategy for a new oil
and gas taxation regime, to be effective from 2015 through 2024. On the other hand, in May
2014 Government started taking the legal steps to remove 14 non-fiscal taxes and tariffs and to
merge other 78.

Energy sector reforms
Significant progress has been made in particular on: legal and regulatory reforms, safety net
for poorest households, transparent and competitive contracting, SOEs privatization and
corporate governance

a) Legal and regulatory reforms. In 2011 the government re-launched reforms to ensure
compliance with the EU third energy package for electricity and gas. In 2012, the Parliament
adopted new electricity and gas law (Law of Electricity and Natural Gas. 123/2012), as well as
the law ensuring ANRE operational and financial independence and empowering it to continue
energy market reform. ANRE has implemented the electricity and gas price road maps as
planned. Also the pass-through mechanism for electricity and gas purchases by the supply
companies continue to be applied. For electricity, complete deregulation of electricity prices
for nonresidential consumers was achieved by January 1, 2014, as scheduled. For natural gas,
ANRE increased regulated prices in October 2013 and January 2014 as called for the gas price
liberalization road map. Given that the domestic producer prices of gas have reached the level
of prices from the relevant European gas hubs, ANRE has concluded that a further regulatory
price adjustment in the wholesale gas price (the commodity price of gas) in the regulated tariff
of non-residential costumers was not needed in July 2014.

The Electricity and Natural Gas Law no. 123/2012, and its amendments, includes provisions
to eliminate regulated gas prices: (i) until 31 December 2014 for non-household customers,
except that this time there is a significant difference between the selling price of the domestic
production and import European price, which could jeopardize the stability of the market, in
which the term is extended until 31 December 2015; (ii) until 1 July 2021 for household
customers.

In line with EU requirements, recent changes to the energy and natural gas legislation set forth
a road map for the liberalisation of the prices of natural gas. On the gas market, liberalisation
of the prices of natural gas was finalised for non-household consumers (except thermal energy
producers, only for the quantities of natural gas used to produce heat in cogeneration plants
and heating plants for household consumption) at 1st of January 2015. In line with the last
road-map convened at Governmental level (GD no 488/2015), the gas market will be fully
liberalised for household consumers in 2021.




                                               34
According to the provisions of Law 123/2012, and its amendments, in order to ensure non-
discrimination between the same class of consumers, by the end of the regulation period,
household consumers and thermal energy producers, only for the quantities of natural gas used
to produce heat in cogeneration plants and thermal power plants for household consumption
have the same treatment in terms of ensuring the quantity and selling price of natural gas
consumed, whether they chose to be eligible or regulated

In order to increase the activity on the gas market and improve liquidity, the regulator imposed
(by Order no. 118/2014) that from 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2018, Romanian natural
gas producers and their affiliates must trade on the centralised markets, in a transparent and
non-discriminating manner, a minimum quantity of gas destined for consumption within the
Romanian market (at least 35% in 2015, at least 30% by 2016, at least 25% in 2017 and at least
20% in 2018). The same obligation applies to traders / suppliers (except those that are also gas
producers - oil agreement holders) starting with 1 March 2015 and until 31 December 2018 (at
least 30% in 2015, at least 25% by 2016, at least 20% by 2017 and at least 15% in 2018). There
are currently two centralised markets available, one operated by OPCOM and the other
operated by the Romanian Commodities Exchange.

The Government adopted on July 9, 2014 a draft law amending the Law of electricity and
natural gas no. 123/2012, the Petroleum Law no. 238/2004 and the Government Emergency
Ordinance no. 6/2014 on the exercise of rights and obligations arising for the State as
shareholder to the National Power Grid "Transelectrica" - SA and the National Gas
Transmission Company "Transgaz". In compliance with European requirements of unbundling,
"Transelectrica" S.A. and "Transgaz" were transferred to the Ministry of Economy, Commerce
and Tourism (Government Emergency Ordinance no. 86/2014).

b) Safety net for poorest households. To mitigate the gradual increase in energy prices (gas
and electricity), protection measures have been put in place using existing means-tested cash
transfer programs: guaranteed minimum income (GMI), family allowances (FA), and heating
benefits (HB). In this respect last year we eliminated in part the unnecessary asset filters from
means-tested programs to increase their coverage of the poor, and increased their eligibility
thresholds and/or benefit levels. On the other hand in order to reduce income poverty among
the poorest 20 percent of the population we have already initiated the process for the
consolidation of the all means-tested programs - the Heating Benefits, Family Benefits, and
Guaranteed Minimum Income program – into a single flagship anti-poverty program, the
Minimum Social Insertion Income Program (MSIP).

c) The introduction of transparent and competitive contracting for Hidroelectrica. In
2012 the company was placed into insolvency process in order to restructure it and to
commercialize its energy production in a transparent manner via the energy exchange platform
OPCOM. Thus, the bilateral electricity sales contracts have been cancelled or substantially
renegotiated (with higher prices and in some case reduced volumes), all the electricity released
being sold on OPCOM. During the insolvency process the Administrator also cancelled or
renegotiated hundreds of smaller contracts and proposed investment projects deemed to be
against the interest of Hidroelectrica. It came out of insolvency but in February 2014 the
Appeals Court placed it back into insolvency until the legal claims of energy traders against
the company will be resolved. However, the company has recorded financially progress. We
expect that it will exit from insolvency at mid-2016.




                                               35
  e) SOEs Corporate Governance. All energy SOEs Boards included in the program has been
  reconstituted, except for Hidroelectrica 36 . This is a first step to improve the corporate
  governance standards of the energy SOEs and further guidelines to enhance corporate
  governance are drafted and implemented. In this respect, an assessment of the implementation
  of Ordinance no109/2011 was performed. This will provide key inputs to improve the
  emergency ordinance in order to ensure an enactment of a full ownership policy. MOPF has
  started to systematically monitor SOEs budgets and arrears. Government approved a
  Memorandum on state ownership and oversight sharpening the management of the SOE
  national portfolio, which also promotes good practices, including movement towards
  international financial reporting standards (IFRS)

  f) Significant progress in implementing the privatization agenda:

 i.Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and secondary public offerings (SPOs), we sold 15 %
   of the shares in Transgaz (SPO) in April 2013, 10% of the shares in the Nuclearelectrica (IPO)
   in September 2013, and 15 % of the shares in the state-controlled natural gas producer
   (Romgaz) (IPO) in October 2013. Romgaz is the largest state-owned enterprise by revenue.
   The Romgaz IPO was oversubscribed and increased both foreign and domestic interest in the
   equity market and was considered one of the most successful IPOs. The Romgaz IPOs was the
   first time we issued Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) in conjunction with a public offering
   on the Bucharest stock exchange. The experience gained through the Nuclearelectrica and
   Romgaz transactions will be also apply to the preparation of the next IPOs in other energy
   companies.
ii. The IPOs for Electrica was launched on June 16, 2014 in order to sell 177.19 million shares,
   representing 51 percent of the company’s capital. The shares were listed on the Bucharest Stock
   Exchange (BVB), and part of the offer were structured in global depository receipts (GDRs
   Electrica has obtained approximately 1.95 billion RON (€ 444 million) following its initial
   public offer through an offer of shares and GDRs and the admission to trading the shares on
   the Bucharest Stock Exchange and the GDRs on the London Stock Exchange. The IPO of
   Electrica was successful, the oversubscription for the offer was 2.2 times.
iii.We have started the preparation of an IPO for Oltenia Energy Complex, hiring a consultant in
    order to conduct a coal reserve assessment. We have transferred Berbești mine to CET Govora,
    in order to diminish the company’s arrears and make it more attractive to potential buyers.
iv.Government approved a decision for the sale of 15% of Hidroelectrica’s shares (more than we
   initially planned). The IPOs will be launched as soon as possible after it exits from insolvency.

  Health Sector Reform

  The Government’s health sector reform incorporate actions in two areas: (a) increasing the
  health service quality while improving cost effectiveness; (b) improving the health service
  delivery model including a rationalization of the public health care sector infrastructure. To
  control expenditures and ensure efficiency gains on short run the following measures were
  implemented:

 i.We introduced a negative list of health services and drugs (prior action under this program),
   based on the recommendations of the technical assistance carried out by NICE. Health


  36
          Further to the recent returning into insolvency Hidroelectrica’s Supervisory Board was dismissed


                                                      36
  Technology Assessment (HTA) department is fully operational and staffed. An interim
  simplified HTA methodology was designed and is currently applied to the pre-approved new
  drugs, before being included in the lists of compensated drugs (the full HTA methodology that
  will be further used is going to be developed under the new loan for health).
ii.In 2012 we have started to implement the National Hospital Bed Plan and reduced the number
   of hospital beds that can be contracted by the National Health Insurance House (according to
   GD 449/2014 hospital care beds to be contracted by the NHIH are: for 2014 - 121579, for
   2015 - 120579 and for 2016 - 119572).
iii.In March 2013, we started to introduce co-payments, based on a modest fixed amount
    depending on services provided, in the hospital sector, excluding emergency services.
iv.The MoH is strengthening the prevention and health promotion programs and is transferring
   treatment programs to the National Health Insurance (NHIH). In 2013 the Ministry of Health
   started to implement a program for early detection of cervical cancer, the budget allocated to
   this program being increased from 0 in 2012 to about lei 19 million in 2014. Based on the MoH
   data the state budget allocated for preventive/health promotion programs reached in 2013 about
   24% of the state budget allocated to all the National Programs (toward 16% in 2011) and is
   estimated to be 39% in 2014.
v.In order to raise the efficiency of healthcare spending and improve health outcomes, while
  improving cost effectiveness ministry of health started to implement a comprehensive reform
  of the healthcare system, focused on four main pillars: (a) a minimum health package, (b) a
  basic health package, (c) revision to the list of reimbursable medicines, and (d) revision to
  existing and introduction of new national health programs.

  Romania’s Performance in Implementing the DPL-DDO

  We consider the Government’s performance to have been satisfactory. The Government
  participated fully in the preparation of the DPL-DDO, made satisfactory arrangements for
  implementation, delivered outcomes and outputs substantively and timely, and provided high-
  level political oversight and support. Virtually all outcomes and outputs were met or are in
  advanced stages of implementation. Risks were managed and mitigated efficiently, and reforms
  were all accepted by stakeholders and the population at large.

  The Government considers that the performance of the Bank and other IFIs has also been
  satisfactory. Our partnership with the Bank has been exemplary. We shared a common
  philosophy, cooperated in finding adequate solutions, and agreed on most issues. Lessons
  generated by the cooperation with the IFIs highlight the importance of timely policy advice
  and technical assistance in preparing and implementing reforms, the need for close high-level
  political attention and support in resolving incipient disagreements among implementing
  agencies, and the necessity of adequate monitoring and evaluation arrangements.

  Future Operations

  The Government intends to extend and deepen the reform program, and to continue to rely on
  IFIs’ support to this end. In addition to continuing precautionary arrangements with the IMF
  and the EU, the Government counts on the Bank’s support. Romania has endorsed the program
  proposed by the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2014-2017, which includes four DPLs
  and several policy-based sector operations in health, education and energy.




                                                37
The First Fiscal Effectiveness and Growth DPL was approved In May 2014 and the
Government has implemented agreed reforms in fiscal management, SOEs’ performance and
functioning of the property, energy and capital markets. The Health Sector Reform Project
approved in March 2014 deepens the reform agenda initiated under DPL 1-3 and DPL-DDO.

Concluding Remarks

The Government has assisted in the preparation of the Bank’s ICR through the submission of
progress reports, extensive consultations with the Bank team, and feedback on the draft ICR.

IMF Observations on World Bank Participation in Multilateral Support for Romania in
                                  2012-2014

The World Bank was an important partner in the multilateral support of Romania’s economic
program in the period 2012-2014 aimed at addressing crisis legacies and advancing structural
reforms. Together with the two successive precautionary IMF Stand-by Arrangements and
European Commission Balance of Payments Assistance Programs (2011-13, 2013-15), the
World Bank DPL-DDO provided a fiscal buffer against external shocks. The DPL-DDO, its
monitoring activity, and Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) operations, contributed to
advancing several macro-critical reforms, in particular in the energy sector, and supported the
on-going process of strengthening public institutions, in particular tax administration, state-
owned enterprise governance, and public financial management. Many of these reforms
encountered delays and are not yet complete, however.

Among the key contributions of the DPLs were the following:

       Energy sector reform. Bank support helped keeping the energy price deregulation on
track, resulting in a full deregulation for electricity prices for non-resident consumers, and
greater transparency and competition. At the same time, Bank engagement was targeted at
cushioning the impact of energy price developments on the most vulnerable by the support
system more targeted and ultimately more generous. Adoption of comprehensive supportive
legislation is still pending.

      Tax administration. The DPL supported the modernization of the tax administration
agency which resulted in a significant reduction in local tax offices, increase in electronic filing,
and creation of an anti-fraud unit. Bank engagement and IMF technical assistance worked
complementary to foster tax compliance, with the Fund focused on large taxpayers and high
net wealth individuals.

       Public financial management. With Bank support the authorities developed criteria to
prioritize public investment projects, a prior action for the approval of the Fund-supported
program, and established an evaluation unit in the Ministry of Public Finance. While public
investment planning, executing, and monitoring remain a major weakness, Bank involvement
was critical to initiate greater transparency.

      Corporate governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Building on the
Emergency Ordinance from 2011 that introduced a new SOE corporate governance framework,
the Bank’s review of its implementation helped identify shortcomings. Jointly with the Fund,
the Bank supported draft amendments that are also aimed at raising the legislative basis of SOE
governance. Bank efforts also supported the Ministry of Public Finance’ SOE monitoring unit.

       Health care reforms. While significant work still needs to be done to address the
fundamental difficulties facing the health care system, Bank support has been important in
providing expertise in areas that could eventually improve cost-effectiveness, such as shifting
to more preventive care, out-patient treatments, more centralized procurement, and electronic
health cards.



                                                 39
Coordination during the DPL-DDO operation with the Fund was excellent. Both institutions
shared information, agreed on diagnostic and policy recommendations, and conducted many
joint missions, including consultations with the government, parliament and other stakeholders.

      Comments of the European Commission on the World Bank Implementation
               Complementation Report for the Romania DPL-DDO

                                       12 October 2015


Dear colleagues,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the report.
The Bank's loan to Romania for a DPL-DDO was an important complement of the second
(2011-13) and third (2013-15) EU balance of payments financial assistance programmes, both
of precautionary nature, and of the IMF's parallel stand-by arrangements. We very much
welcome the Bank's assessment of a very positive cooperation between the three institutions,
which we fully share. We also agree that the Bank had, and retains, an important role in
supporting capacity building among Romania's public actors. Technical support and advisory
services from the Bank shall continue to support Romania's administration in building up its
capacity to deliver efficiently and timely public services and goods to its population.
We largely share the evaluation and the conclusion of the report that the joint effort of the EU,
the Bank and the IMF were essential in helping Romania stabilise its economy and correct most
external and internal imbalances. During 2009-11, under a first joint EU/IMF programme
which the Bank supported, Romania successfully stabilised its fiscal stance, re-established
market access for the sovereign and safeguarded financial stability. This effort was further
consolidated during the DPL-DDO period. The current account deficit continued to decline,
Romania reached its medium-term objective of a structural deficit of 1% of GDP, and the
financial sector has further reduced risks to its stability.
The report appropriately describes these trends. Conceivably, the report could address more
explicitly risks going forward. The slowdown of the reform efforts over the last year – to a
large extent after the end of the DPL-DDO – impacts upon important areas covered by our joint
programmes. Privatisations, restructuring of SOEs and improvements to their corporate
governance have registered little progress in 2015. Reforms in health care provision have
slowed down. The announced pro-cyclical fiscal policy in 2016 and 2017 could be a risk to
macroeconomic stability. A new unified wage law is being prepared without due integration
with the Strategy for the Public Administration adopted by the government in October 2014
and its fiscal impact will need to be addressed. Special pensions have been re-introduce for
several professional categories, undoing early progress.
We agree that these risks shall not eclipse the many achievements since the financial crisis.
Regulatory improvements and reforms of state owned energy companies fostered competition
and investment in Romania's energy markets. Financial management in the health sector
markedly improved and there has been some effort towards rationalisation of health providing
structures. Legal and functional reforms increased the efficiency of the tax authority, reduced
administrative burden on companies, and had a visible impact on tax revenues. The Delivery
Unit created at the centre of the government improved implementation of policy priorities and
fostered a useful debate on the need to strengthen policy design and coordination at the centre
of the government. In this context, reinforcing the link between national policy priorities and
Romania's responsibilities under the European Union's fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance
will be a challenge that Romania must continue to pursue.
Under the Stability and Growth Pact and its own legislation Romania defined a medium term
objective of a deficit of 1% of GDP in structural terms. This prudent fiscal stance is key to



                                               41
ensure fiscal sustainability in a country prone to boom-bust cycles which often triggered by
pro-cyclical fiscal policy. Keeping the budget deficit under, but close, to 3 percent of GDP
would be in breach of Romania's commitments and would account for a substantial fiscal
stimulus at a moment when the output gap is fast closing. It would be important that the report
will be clear about this and encourage Romania to fully oblige by the fiscal rules it helped to
develop and which will support sustainable growth.
