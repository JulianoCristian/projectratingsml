                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The objective of the proposed DPL-DDO is to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact.
                         The reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government’s revenue-
                         raising capacity through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed
                         to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the
                         reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government’s fiscal buffer, but
                         without requiring actual disbursement of funds.
                         The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated by a Progress Report was presented to the Board in December 2011, is to
                         pursue public sector reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of
                         fiscal sustainability, which the Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.

                         A.         Macroeconomic framework

                         The macroeconomic framework for the operation remains satisfactory. Economic growth has accelerated in early 2014, driven by exports and industrial production. There are also
                         signs of improvement in the domestic demand, driven by private consumption. Firm macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, incomes), anchored in the program with the IFIs, have
                         largely corrected the external and internal imbalances, improving the confidence of the markets in the Romanian economy. As a result, an important rating agency has recently
                         upgraded Romania to investment grade. Thus, all major rating agencies place now Romania in the investment grade category. Furthermore, Romania successfully issued its first ever
                         30-years bond in early 2014. In spite of the remarkable macroeconomic consolidation, Romania continues to face several external and domestic risks which require close attention

                         from the government. Main external risks include a slower than expected recovery in the Eurozone, which can adversely affect Romania's exports and growth prospects, and the
                         tightening of the global financial conditions, which can trigger capital outflows, putting pressure on the currency and the interest rates. Main internal risks include the still large quasi-
                         fiscal activities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), especially in transport, and the slow progress in implementing good corporate governance practices in SOEs. The approaching
                         presidential elections, to be held in late autumn 2014, can slow down reforms, with potential implications for the relationship with IMF and the EC, as both institutions have ongoing

                         B.       Implementation of the reform program

                         The implementation of the government’s reform program supported by the DPL-DDO has continued. In key areas, such as public investment management, energy price liberalization
                         and private participation in key SOEs, the pace of reforms was maintained. In the health sector there has been renewed focus on key aspects of the reform agenda, such as the
                         review of the lists of subsidized medicines and treatments. Specifically:
                         - In the public sector, reforms in public finance management and tax policy and administration have continued. The Government has taken important regulatory and institutional steps
                         to reform the public investment framework, and has advanced the restructuring of the tax administration. However, further efforts would be required in order to consolidate the
                         sustainability of the reforms adopted.
                         - In the energy sector, solid progress has been made on implementing legal and regulatory reforms, especially with respect to the liberalization of the electricity and gas markets; gas
                         price increases proceeded as agreed, and the electricity market was fully liberalized for non-households. Good progress has been made towards putting in place the safety net
                         offering protection to poorest households from energy tariff increases and the government is working to further improve the coverage and the targeting of the safety net. Good
                         progress has been made towards the introduction of transparent and competitive contracting for Hidroelectrica, and improve the profitability of the company by cutting costs and
                         eliminating inefficient investments, in spite of the fact that the company was put back into insolvency at the request of the courts. Progress has been made in terms of introducing
                         payment discipline among SOEs and arrears have been reduced, but efforts need to continue to ensure the sustainability of the situation. Private sector participation in the energy
                         sector has advanced substantially through a number of successful IPOs and SPOs (Transgaz, Nuclearelectrica, Romgaz, the latter listed dually in Bucharest and London), and the
                         preparation of a large majority privatization of an electricity distributor (Electrica) is in its latest phases. While these are remarkable achievements, the SOE corporate governance
                         reform agenda has registered mixed results, particularly in the transport sector, where a number of SOE GSMs and boards appointed according to the new governance framework
                         (GEO 109/2011) have been revoked.
                          -Positive steps have been taken in health care sector reforms, particularly regarding the hospital network rationalization and the reduction of the number of hospital beds. The
                         introduction of the e-prescription has helped to improve the efficiency and the governance of the health system. Steps have been taken to introduce the health technology
                         assessment and rationalize the package of compensated medicines, but these represent only initial actons in what is an overall a complex medium-term agenda.
