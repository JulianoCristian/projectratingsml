     help stimulate resource mobilization, underpin private\n            investment and promote economic diversification.\n            Specifically, the project will assist in: (i) strengthening\n            the central bank so that it can perform its monetary policy\n            and regulatory functions; (ii) developing banking\n            infrastructure; (iii) improving the legal and regulatory\n            environment for financial operations; and (iv) establishing\n            institutional mechanisms for financing private investment.\n            The project will consist of: (a) strengthening the National\n            Bank of Angola, the central bank, principally through\n            improvements in its accounts and accounting practices,\n            procedures and information systems, and in its staff skills\n            in administrative and functional areas; (b) development of\n            banking infrastructure, including establishment of a\n            national check clearing system, a training center for\n            financial sector personnel, and training a core of financial\n            professionals; (c) disseminating and implementing laws and\n            regulations affecting the banking sector, ensuring their\n            coherence, establishing the legal and regulatory framework\n            for the insurance sector; and establishing accounting and\n            auditing standards for the enterprise sector; and (d)\n            improving institutional mechanisms for financing private\n            investment and studies on access to credit by the private sector."}, "docdt": "1992-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
