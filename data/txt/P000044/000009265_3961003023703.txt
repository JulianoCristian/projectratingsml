MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INT NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO TH                    E       DIRCTRS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF ANGOLA
FOR A FINANCIAL INSlITUTIONS MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.           I suibmit for your approval the following report and recomendation on a proposed
development Credit to the People's Republic of Angola for SDR14.8 million, the equivalent of US$21.0
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Financial Institutions
Modernization Project.
Backromud
2.           Angola, with a GNP per capita of US$620 (1989) and a population of about 10.6 million,
is one of the richest countries in Africa in natural resource endowment, while Its economy has been one
of the most distorted in the continent. The courmy was torn by a civil war which began at independence
in 1975 and which ended only last year. In spite of its considerable agiculural potential, Angola has
become extremely dependent on oil, as the war made much of the countryside too insecure for
agricultural production and transport. The war also made large claims on government resources and
destroyed mucd c' the country's economic and fnancial infrastructure. In addition, ipropriae
econo: p policies .Ier independence created an economic system with a formal economy (mostly public)
maged through idministraiive controls and a large parallel economy. Also affecting the economy are
unu,;Wuly severe human resource constraints. This is, in part, the result of the masive exodus of
Portugsvvw setlers who were in control of the economy at independence.
3.           The Government is aware that current economic problems are due to a large ext  to
hiappropriate policies, and has begun introducing changes with the objective of orienting the economy
to a free market system. Decisions on the economic front have coincided with the end of the war and
the opening up of the political system. Free elections are now scheduled for September 28 and 29, 1992.
A key aspect of the economic reform program is the establishment of a financial system to serve the
pnvate sector during the recovery and beyond.
4.           The financial system was well developed in colonial times, but independent Agola only
had two financial institutions: one bank which had some central banking and commercial banking
functions and a savings bank where the deposits of individuals were placed. As the foma productive
sector was largely publicly-owned, banks were used to channel savings to public enterprises. As In most
socialist fnancial systems, decisions regarding the volume and allocation of credit were made in the
Ministry of Planning, with the banking system acting as a conduit. Thus, analytical functions associated
with banks in market-oriented economies were not performed; banks were not supervised; and bank credit
assessment, regarded as largely irrelevant, was not developed.
5.           Starting in November 1991, the Government began introducing reforms to the price and
exchange rate structre, changes which significantly improved the prospets and the need for a well-
functioing financial system. The remonetization of wages and the application of a more realistic
exchange rate is an important step towards the rationalization of trading and price relationships. The
economic reform package approved in November 1991 includes a new schedule of interest rates.
Althougb still highly negative when taking into account current and projected inflation, the new rats
(maximum deposit rate of 14 percent p.a. and maximum lending rate of 20 percent p.a.) represent a move
in the right direction. To be effective, the reform package will need to be accompanied by a mnmber of
measures designed to reduce the budget deficit (and thereby the inflation rate). Only then will there be
oppormitdes for lines of credit to the productive sectors and a meaningful discussion of the interest rate
structure.

6.           The Government has begun to establish a two-tier banking system by enacting a law on
financial institutions and one on central bank statutes. In addition, the Government has established three
financial institutions - two commercial banks, the Bank of Commerce and Industry (BCI) and the Bank
of 'avings and Credit (BPC), and 2 specialized credit institution - the Agriculture and Fisheries Credit
Fund (CAP). The cental and commercial banking functions of the central bank, the National Bank of
Angola (BNA) have been split, and BNA has already stopped most of its commercial banking functions
in Luanda (e.g., deposit taking; lending to the private sector). The Governmerw has stated its intention
to prvatize the two commercial banks it has created, and has spelled out the approach =nd calendar to
meet this objective. In addition, the Government proposes to restructure CAP to make it mole effective.
Lasty, the Government has decided in principle to allow privately-owned banks, and foreign banks, to
do banking in Angola. Three foreign banks have received an authorization in principle to open branches
in Luanda. The Government's reform program in the financial sector is summarized in its Statement on
Fiacial Sector Reform. The Statement confirms the Government's commitment to the adjustment of
the sector, including the privadzation of government-owned banks; and gives plans for the losing of
BNA branches and for the cessation of trade financing operations by BNA.
7.           Although the Government has moved fast in setting the legal framework for a two-tier
banking system, there are serious obstacles to this development. First, there is little central banking
experience in Angola. In addition to limited qualified personnel, BNA does not have well-defined
operating practices, and works with a severe shortage of modem equipment. BNA will, therefore, find
it difficult to carry out its policy and supervisory roles. The shortage of qualified personnel and of
modern techniques extends to the whole financial system.  Second, the legal, regulatory and
administrative framework in which financial institutions are operafing is rudimentary. It is therefore
difficult to enforce the rights of lenders and borrowers. For instance, because of administrative
weaknesses, it is difficult to constitute and enforce loan guarantees. Also, there are no national
accounting standards which could help banks determine the financial position of commercial clients, a
critical issue in Angola, as very few national companies have financial statements.
Proiect OQbectives
8.           The Project supports institution building and reform in the financial system to help
stimulate resource mobilization, underpin private sector investment, and promote economic
diversification. Specifically, the Project would assist in: (i) strengthening the central bank so that it can
perform its monetary policy and regulatory functions; (ii) developing banking inifrastructure; (iii)
improving the legal and regulatory environment for financial operations; and (iv) establishing institutional
mechanisms for financing private investment. The Project complements technical assistance being
provided to the BNA by the Interntional Monetary Fund, with financing from the United Nations
Development Programme, and the Bank of Portugal in the areas of banking legislation, supervision,
monetary statistics and monetary policy instruments. The Project has been discussed with both
instutions. The Project also complements assistance being provided to key ministries affecting policy
in the real sectors under the IDA-financed Economic Management and Capacity Building Project (Credit
2274-ANG).
Pxoiect Desn
9.           The Project consists of: (i) strengthening of BNA, principally through improvements in
its accounts and accounting practices, procedures and information systems, and staff skills in
administratve and functional areas (38 percent of tGW.l project costs); Q) development of banng
irastructure, through the establishment of a national check clearing system, a training center for



-3-
finanial sector persomel, and training of a core of fincial professionas (38 percent of total projec
costs); (iii) improvements in the dissemon and implementation of laws and regulations affecig tIhe
banking sector to ensure their coherence; establishing the legal and reguatory famewrk for the
insuranc3 sector; and establishing accounting and auditing standards for the enterprise sector (10 percen
of total project costs); Ov) Impovements in the Institutional mecnsm  for investment financing and
studies on access to credit by the la-ivate sector (8 percent of total project costs); and (v) projec
management (6 percent of total project COSts). A timetable of key project processing events is given in
Schedule C of this Memorandum.
10.          The proposed Credit would finance: (i) technical assistance and trainig to strengthen
inStitUtions associated with the operations of the financial sector for a four-year period statg in the first
half of 1993; (d) equipment, vehicles materials and supplies; and (iii) rehabilitation of DNA buildings for
the training institute and to house project consultants during the Project-implemntation period, as an
acute housing shortage is a major constraint tD effetve project execution.
Project Cost and Financing
11.          Total project cost is esfimated at US$23.6 million with a foreign exchange cost of
US$20.6 million. The Credit would finance about 89 percent of project costs; the balance of project coiss
would be financed by the Government. Details of project costs, financing plan, procement and
disbursemen arrangements are given in Schedules A and B of this Memorandum.
12.          Project activities would be coordinat  by a Project Coordinator who would be assisted
by a Deputy, both of whom are senior DNA staff. Because of the substnti worldoad associated with
the Project, the Project Coordinator and the Deputy would be assisted by an experienced expatate
who has already been appointed, and who would be in chage of day-t-day activities such
as maintng project accounts. During project preparation and appraisa, the projeoct coordination team
demonstrated the ability to carry out effectively a number of tasks associated with mpi
Responsibility for implementing the specific BNA project compone    would reat with the Project
Coordinator and with the BNA Directorate which has the fuctionad responsibility for the particular
component. BNA's architect, who is well qualified, has been assigned on a part-time basis to supervise
the Project's civil works. The Project Coordinator, assisted by the relevant unit in the agencies, lo
would be responsible for the components which are in the Ministry of Fmace (enterprise accounting and
insurane legislation), the Mistry of Justice (improvements in the notaries and pubic registries) and the
Agostnho Neto University (training of a core of financi profossionals).
13.          An Interagency Committee consistng of r   es of the Ministies of Plan and
Finanmce and of the BNA would be established to provide guidance on policy issues; to monitor progress
of the Project; and to address issues requiring interagency coordination. The Project Coordinator and
Deputy Coordintor would be members of the Committee. Reprntati  of other ititution    aed
with the Project would be invited to the meengs as required. Ibis would ensre involvement of key
government agencies in the Project.
14.          Becase of the Proect's focus on ins onl development, it is exected dt
supervisim by IDA staff would be heavier than that for a normal nvestment project, ecaily In the
firt years of project Implento    In addition, annual impil     reviews would enable the
Govement and IDA to monitor closely the Project's progress. To fcilitate project Ximp   a



-4-
manual has been prepared, and would be finalized during a project launch workshop to be carried out in
October 1992.
EPject Sustainability
15.          The ipstitutional Improvements and capacity building activities under the Project address
specific weaknesses. They are designed to strengthen the central bank's capacity, and ensure the
availaoility of basic financial services and financial skills In the financial sector. As such, they are
expected to 'lave a lasting impact on financial stability and, in time, on the quality of financial
intermediation. The training center and the check clearing system are expected to be self-financing.
Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement
16.          The Project takes into account the Bank's experience with the first operations in Angola.
There is increasing familiarity with the Bank's procedures in Angola, and the staff appointed to the
Project has demonstrated considerable implementation capability during project preparation. This should
reduce startup problems encountered by other projects. In addition, the Project focuses only on the
financial system, and the institutions involved have close working relations, which will simplify project
implementatuon. The Project also has been designed talkng into account recommendations drawn from
regional experience with technical assistance projects (Operations Evaluation Department Report No.
8573) relating to Government commitment and activities financed. The Government, which has been
actively involved in project design, has shown a strong commitment to the Project's objectives, as
reflected in actions taken to create a two-tier banking system as well as those planned, and which are
contained in the Government's Statement of Financial Sector Reform. In manpower development, the
Project emphasizes training in accounting, auditing and management, programs which were effective
elsewhere. Consulting work would be judged in part on its training content, and specific conditionality
of the Project would ensure that benefits from training accrue to the government agencies for which it
was intended.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
17.          The Bank's strategic priority in Angola is to lay the foundation for sustainable growth
with equity through a supportive policy framework and the provision of physical and instiuional
infrastructure. Principal imnediate objectives are to facilitate the transition to a peacetime economy and
to support the process of economic reform. The correct phasing of reforms in the financial and real
sectors and appropriate institutional support for their effective implementation are critical elements in the
transformation of socialist economies. The proposed Project would be the first of a series designed to
support the restructuring and development of the fiancial sector, as a key vehicle for private sector
development. To set the stage for this support, the Government and other donors are looking to the Bank
to help put in place a sound financial sector infrastructure. This Project would complement work being
carried out under other IDA-financed operations such as the Economic Management and Capacity
Building, and Education projects.
Agree Actions
18.           During negotiations, the Government has given  ts hat: (i) the rehabilitated BNA
building would be used exclusively for consultants employed under the Project and the National Banking
Training Institute (IFBA) building would be used exclusively for the training institute; (ii) it would



-5-
prepare documentation and piarticipate in annual project -mplementation reviews; (iii) staff receiving long-
term fellowships would be assigned to positions where acquired skills would be used, and would have
minimum work requirements after completion of training; and (iv) BNA staff would be assigned to work
with project information systems consultants in a ratio of two to one. Tbe following vould be conditions
of disburment for specific items under the Project: (i) the Information Systems Strategic Plan would
be completed prior to IDA's disbursement for the equipment, technical assistance and tralning associated
with the information systems development program of BNA, (i) procedures for the legal establishment
of IFBA would be completed prior to IDA's disbursement for civil works, equipment and taining under
this component; and (Wii) CAP would be restructured and qualified staff would be appointed prior to
IDA's disbursement for technical assistance, training and equipment. Pfi to CredittEfhtie e, me
Govenment would: (i) appoint the Interagency Committee to advise and provide guidance on policy
issues and overall project coordination; and (ii) sign the Adinisitraton Agreement for the transfer of
funds to BNA.
Enviromental Aspects
19.          The Project consists of technical assistance, training, and the supply of equipment which
do not have environmental effects. The rehabilitation of the two BNA buildings is not expected to have
an impact because of the small size and urban location of the works.
Program Objective Categories
20.          The Project would contribute in the following categories: (i) public sector reform, through
the strengthening of BNA, and (ii) private sector reform, through the establishment of institutional
firnework which would permit financing for the private sector and an accounting framework for
entcrprises. Ihe technical assistance contemplated under the Project would assist policy makers in
implementing and monitoring reforms; it would also promote instiutional development by strengtihening
the BNA and key units of the Ministry of Finance and of the Directorate of Registries and Notaries of
the Ministry of Justice.
Project Benefits
21.          An efficient, broadly-based financial sector with an effective banking system at Its core
is necessary for the development of a market-oriented economy. At present, financial infiastucture and
institutions are at a rudimentary state. ITe Project aims at laying the groundwork for the development
of a financial system in Angola, which would facilitate the mobilization of savings and their investment
in productive uses. The Project would be the first vehicle for the Bank's dialogue with the Government
on financial sector issues. The establishment of sound financial insttons; support for strengthening
the banking profession; the introduction of necessary regulations for the system; and the supervision and
surveillance of financial institutions would help increase confidence in the system and facilitate the process
of intermediation.
Project Risks
'z.          Project risks are associated with the slow implementation capability of a new member with
a w      man resource capacity. As mentioned earlier, BNA staff, led by a Project Coordinator, and
assisted by an expatriate Project Administrator has already demonstrated considerable project



-6-
implementation skllls. The risk that a new government after the elections in September 1992 will not
agree with the objectives and scope of the Project is small, as there is a consensus among the major
political parties about the general direction of ecoitomic reform. The project is non-controversial, with
its focus on institution building. Experience elsewhere in Africa shiows that governmental changes have
not affected materially projects aimed at institutional development and capacity building. Lastly, reforms
in the financial sector, and therefore the long-term success of the project, will be affected by reforms in
the macroeconomic framework. The Government of Angola has requested dhe Bank and the Fund to
assist in the preparation and implementation of a reform program. Following the forthcoming elecions,
the Bank will make a major effort to help the new Government give a fresh impetus to macroeconomic
reform.
Recommendatins
23.          I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

C. BANK GROUPS INMAL EXPERIENCE
1.           Angolajoined the Bank, IFC and MIGA in September 1989. The Bank's initial approach
has been to nurtre trust between Angola and the Bank so as to develop the type of mature partnership
that the Bank has with other Borrowers; to help strengthen the country's weak institutions; to assist in
the rehabilitation and reconstuction of infrastructure by carrying out pre-investment studies aimed at
addressing evident, high-priority bottlenecks; and, finally, to initiate a dialogue on policy reform priorities
and reconstruction needs. IDA lending to Angola in FY91-92 was planned before the politica! and
economic policy breakthroughs of 1991 and 1992, and in the context of a 'start-up" IDA assistance
program of limited scope, with emphasis on capacity building, along with preparation work for high-
priority projects for rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure. Concurreny, the Bank began
an active economic and sector work program to build knowledge of the economy and identify the man
policy reform priorities. The projects approved in FY91-92 consist of a Credit for an Economic
Management and Capacity Building Project, an Infrastructure Rehabilitation Engineering Project, an
Urban Environment Project for the Lobito-Benguela area (the second largest urban area in Angola), an
Education Project, and a Power Rehabilitation Project.
2.           The Economic Management and Capacity Building Credit became effective in December
1992. It was off to a slow start, partly because of inexperience and lack of familiarity with Bank
procedures and partly because of objective difficulties in the working environment and logistical supports.
The project is now staffed with a good team of competent and dedicated professionals; the office is
reasonably weil organized; satsfactory work procedures have been established; and implemeion is
underway. Some key components, notably human resource development, are on arget, while others,
such as the studies on economic liberalization, are just stardng. Credit disbursements are about five
months behind appraisal projections, but are expected to accelerate in the first half of 1993 after several
large conacts are signed. The lInfastructure Rehabilitation Engineering Credit became effective in
February 1992, and Implementation has been satisfactory though disbursements are about three months
behind schedule because of delays in processing payments and disbursement applications.
3.           Project implementatIon will receive the attention that the Borrower's relative inexperience
and ntiuional weakes require. Consequently, in order to build the implementation capacity of this
Borrower who is relatively unfamiliar with Bank procedures, and to help ensure that operations get off
to a good start, the allocation of resources for supervision planned for FY93-95 is about 30% higher than
the regional average. Country procurement assessment and training will be given high priority. The first
Country Implemnentation Review is planned for 1993. The Bank's Resident Mission, which is in the
ptocess of being established, is expectk. to make a major contribution in project implementation and
supervision.
