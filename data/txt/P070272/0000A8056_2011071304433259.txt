                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         At this point in project implementation, all attention is focused on completing the remaining activities and bringing the project to closure. The April-May 2011 mission agreed with the
                         GOE the following:

                         (i) The PMU/MOE will discuss with communities and contractors the possibility of installing as many fences as feasible for all schools constructed under the program, and submit a
                         proposal to IDA for no objection;

                         (ii) The PMU will also assess the cost of putting latrines and washing areas at the 60 teachers' quarters and submit a proposal to IDA for no objection;

                         (iii) Amend contract with the company installing solar hand pumps to include fencing with a gate to provide security for the pumps; and
