Some lessons learned included:\n            when there are severe limitations in the baseline data\n            informing project design, this should be clearly laid out in\n            the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (even when this means\n            questioning official data). In these situations, teams\n            should exercise additional care when preparing the results\n            framework, choosing indicators that do not directly depend\n            on problematic data. During both design and restructuring,\n            due to problems with the official population data, the team\n            did not understand how far Eritrea had actually come with\n            regard to providing access to elementary education.\n            Development of a sector-wide approach for post conflict\n            countries with weak capacity is not appropriate unless there\n            is strong donor coordination and governments view donor\n            coordination as essential to the development of the sector.\n            Although the Ministry of Education (MOE) and donors\n            discussed and drafted a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\n            for donor coordination, the government and donors did not\n            pursue the idea of stronger coordination. Project teams and\n            Bank management should be cautious when making decisions on\n            accepting donor trust funds that more than double the size\n            of projects, particularly when the majority is for civil\n            works. The Bank agreed to accept the European Commission\n            (EC) grant despite poor civil works implementation progress,\n            limited capacity and country issues with Bank procurement\n            procedures. Civil works components need to be carefully\n            developed and evaluated to avoid implementation delays.\n            Plans and designs should be done as part of project\n            preparation. Sufficient time to review and comment on\n            designs is crucial, as is the need to complete works at\n            least one year prior to project closing to be able to\n            measure impact. High construction costs should not\n            automatically be assumed to have room for reduction as it\n            could jeopardize school functionality or safeguards compliance."}, "docdt": "2012-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
