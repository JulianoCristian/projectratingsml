             ERITREA EDUCATION SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT (P070272)

           "EUROPEAN COMMISSION TRUST FUND FOR ERITREA EDUCATION
                         CONSTRUCTION" (TF091092)

                                       Restructuring Paper

1. The closing date for "European Commission Trust Fund for Eritrea Education" (EC TF)
   TF091092, which supports the larger Eritrea Education Sector Investment Project (P070272)
   will be extended from August 31, 2010 until August 31, 2011. The EC TF is governed by a
   Financing Agreement (FA) between the European Commission (EC) and the State of Eritrea
   (SOE) as well as the Administrative Agreement (AA) between the EC and the World Bank.
   The extension of the FA has now been approved and the completion date of the AA has been
   extended from December 31, 2010 until February 28, 2012. The extension of the AA was
   necessary before IDA could consider the GOE's request to extend the EC TF closing date
   until August 31, 2011 as indicated in their letter dated June 14, 2010.

2. The EC TF TF091092 provides additional support to the Civil Works component of the IDA
   project and focuses on the construction of elementary and middle schools, education support
   facilities as well as skills development centers. Implementation of these activities was
   initially slow but has greatly improved since April 2009 with the introduction of the
   Community Participation ­ Rapid Results Approach modality. To date, 320 new elementary
   classrooms (benefitting 18,648 students) and 30 new middle schools classrooms (benefitting
   2,016 students) have been constructed using EC TF funding. Currently, there are contracts in
   place which would allow for the construction of 60 teacher quarters, the extension of 30
   existing and 21 new schools and the construction of 10 Pedagogical Resource Centers.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that critical activities financed by the EC TF
   can be carried out. Failure to process the proposed one-year extension would jeopardize the
   achievement of the Project Development Objective of "increased and more equitable
   enrollment." There are no changes to the project design, its objectives or financing
   mechanisms.

4. The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date which
   provides that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
   Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the Recipient has
   prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the World Bank to complete the existing
   contracts and agreements. Furthermore, the Recipient has agreed that only those contracts
   and agreements which are currently under implementation will be executed on a high priority
   basis.

5. This will be the second extension of the EC TF091092.
