Eritrea Education Sector Investment Project 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
 
SUMMARY 
 
The Eritrea Education Sector Investment Project is scheduled to close on February 2011. 
While many activities are completed, two are not.  These include (i) the development and 
printing of secondary textbooks and (ii) the construction of several middle and secondary 
schools, learning resource centers, and other supporting educational structures.  A short 
extension of six months is required in order to allow smooth completion of these 
activities, especially the civil works, as well as to align the closing of the project with the 
World Bank-managed European Commission Trust Fund (ECTF) for Eritrea Education 
Construction (TF091092). 
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
The implementation of the project stalled from effectiveness through restructuring in 
2007, especially in the area of civil works, due to the difficulties with contract size and 
the ability of the government to undertake medium to large scale procurement as initially 
envisaged under the project. In April 2009, the introduction of a Community Participation 
Rapid Results Approach (CP-RRA) methodology for implementing civil works 
significantly accelerated implementation progress and sharply increased the likelihood 
that the project would meet its development objectives. Recently, the Project 
Management Unit (PMU) analyzed progress and found a need to: (i) reallocate funds 
across categories and, (ii) provide a six-month project extension to enable the contracts, 
which the Borrower entered into in good faith, to be fully executed before the project 
closes.  
 
Notable achievements in terms of intermediate targets are: (i) in-service teacher training 
targets have been surpassed; (ii) 100 percent of subject syllabi have been revised as part 
of the curriculum reform in elementary, middle and secondary schools; (iii) training and 
upgrading of Ministry of Education staff targets have been achieved; (iv) incentives for 
girls to attend school surpassed to twice the original target; and (v) the percentage of girls 
in secondary schools has also surpassed project projections. The team would use the 
extension period to conduct additional, in-depth analysis of project outcome data to 
further validate such progress. 
 
The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date, 
namely that (i) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (ii) the performance of 
the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (iii) the 
Recipient prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the IDA to complete the existing 
contracts and agreements. 
 
The current disbursement rate is 63 percent, but the amount of the remaining activities 
which have already been costed, committed and are under implementation (i.e. civil
Page  5
2
works contracts) will lead to an almost 100 percent disbursement of the IDA credit. The 
June 2010 mission reported that National Competitive Bidding (NCB) contracts for a cost 
of US$3.5 million was at 32 percent completion and was expected to be finished by 
February 2011. The larger International Competitive Bidding (ICB) contracts for 16 
secondary schools at a cost of US$15 million are also underway and could be completed 
by March 2011. However, given delays experienced in the past, it is suggested that an 
additional six months be granted to ensure completion of all NCB and ICB schools. 
Completing all the civil works alone would use up 85 percent of the total credit amount.  
The project team has reviewed and is satisfied that both the revised Procurement and 
Annual Work Plans depict a realistic picture of project implementation status and the 
activities that can be achieved by August 31, 2011. Furthermore, the additional six 
months would allow the project team to continue indept analysis of the achievements,  
particularly in the last nine months, such as an expected reduction in pupil:classroom 
ratio, alleviating pressures on school infrastructure and improving the learning 
environment.

2. 
Project implementation accelerated following its restructuring in 2007, but gained 
significant momentum with the introduction of the community participation modality for 
small-scale school construction starting in April 2009. To date, 426 classrooms have been 
constructed by the project (benefitting approximately 24,000 students) using IDA 
resources and the European Commission Trust Fund for Eritrea Education Construction 
(ECTF) managed by the IDA. To improve quality, IDA resources supported policy 
studies, teacher development, creation of a master plan to replace costly expatriate 
teachers by training and upgrading 2,725 elementary and 580 middle school teachers, and 
the expansion of the Asmara Teacher Training Institute. Over time, the project also 
supported the printing of approximately 1.1 million textbooks and syllabus guides, 
assisted with improving the measurement of learning achievement, and provided 
incentives to more than 3,000 girls to attend school.

3. 
To date, disbursements stand at 63 percent of the IDA Credit, with the majority of 
remaining activities having already been identified and/or procured for a total amount of 
US$28.5 million. If all contracts are fully implemented, almost 100 percent of project 
funds will be utilized.  
 
4. 
The reallocation of proceeds is necessary because of unforeseen price escalation 
for civil works and associated equipment due to prevailing international and country 
circumstances. Project cost savings have been realized under the “Consultancy 
Service/Expatriate Teachers” category because many project activities initially planned in 
this category were covered by other sources of financing (e.g., the supervision of 
construction was carried out by the Ministry of Public Works instead of an international 
consultancy firm) or represented a shift in government priorities (e.g., from paying 
expatriate teacher salaries to continuing to upgrade Eritrean teachers with other donor 
support). Hence the restructuring will reallocate savings from this category to civil works 
and goods categories.  
 
5. 
The reallocation of credit proceeds complies with OP 13.25, paragraph 2, on the 
Use of Project Cost Savings. OP 13.25 requires that (a) project implementation is 
satisfactory and includes substantial compliance with the Agreements for the project; (b) 
the additional activities have high priority and are consistent with the original project 
objectives; (c) the activities have been fully appraised by the World Bank staff and are 
economically justified; and (d) financing the activities does not violate the country 
financing parameters or cost sharing.   
 
6. 
In addition, the extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on 
Closing Date. The OP requires that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; 
(b) the performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies be 
satisfactory; and (c) the Recipient prepare a specific action plan acceptable to the World 
Bank to complete the existing contracts and agreements. (see Annex 2 for Extension of 
Closing Date details). 
 
7. 
Both the reallocation and Extension of Closing Date are made in response to a 
Government of Eritrea request dated September 9, 2010 (attached).

ANNEX 2: 
Extension of Closing Date 
 
ERITREA - ERITREA EDUCATION SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT  
(CR. 3794-ER) 
–
P070272 
 
Restructuring Paper 
 
8. 
The closing date for the Eritrea Education Sector Investment Project (Cr. 3794-
ER, P070272) will be extended by six months
 
from February 28, 2011 until August 31, 
2011.  The education sector program is also supported by a European Commission Trust 
Fund for Eritrea Education Construction (ECTF) in the amount of 
 31,169,280
which
the
Bank manages. The purpose of this extension request is to (i) allow for completion of 
contracts that have already been entered but completed due to delays resulting from 
unforeseen circumstances (
force majeure
); (ii) align the IDA project’s closing date with 
the closing date of the ECTF (August 31, 2011); and (iii) complete ongoing activities 
necessary to achieve the PDOs.  
 
9. 
As discussed in Annex 1, the project has made significant progress despite 
challenging country circumstances, and is poised to achieve 100 percent disbursement of 
credit proceeds if granted a short extension. All remaining activities were identified, 
relevant contracts agreed, and construction of eight middle schools and 16 secondary 
schools is currently underway. The completion and equipping of these schools has the 
potential to benefit 22,000 students, and will require a project extension of six months.  
This extension would further enable the client to finish the expansion of its teacher 
training institute, thus reducing its reliance on expatriate teachers and creating 
employment for qualified national teachers. It would also allow the IDA credit to support 
the finalization and printing of the revised grade 9-12 textbooks and teacher’s guides.  
 
10. 
The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that critical activities financed not 
only by the IDA credit but also by the ECTF can be completed in an orderly manner. 
Failure to process the proposed six-month extension would jeopardize achievement of the 
project objective of “increased and more equitable enrollment” as well as “enhanced 
quality in elementary and secondary education”. There are no changes to the project 
design, its objectives, or financing mechanisms.   
 
11. 
Aligning the IDA credit’s closing date with the ECTF’s closing date is also 
necessary for IDA to continue its mandate of supervising the ECTF.  To date, IDA has 
supervised the construction of 320 new elementary school classrooms (benefitting 18,648 
students) and 30 new middle school classrooms (benefitting 2,016 students) using ECTF 
funding.  Currently, the ECTF is financing contracts for the construction of 60 teachers’ 
quarters, the extension of 30 existing and 21 new schools, and the construction of ten 
Pedagogical Resource Centers. Closure of the linked IDA-funded Project as scheduled on 
Page  9
6
February 28, 2011 would result in the inability of IDA to properly supervise completion 
of these contracts, and possible reputational harm to IDA as the GoE, the European 
Commission and/or other stakeholders might see the IDA as prematurely walking away 
from its commitments to see agreed contracts through to satisfactory completion. 
 
12. 
The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date. 
The OP requires that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the 
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies be satisfactory; 
and (c) the Recipient prepare a specific action plan acceptable to the IDA to complete the 
existing contracts and agreements.   
 
13. 
This will be the second extension of the IDA credit resulting in a cumulative 
extension of over two years from the project’s original Closing Date and therefore 
requires RVP approval in accordance with OP 13.30 paragraph 7.
