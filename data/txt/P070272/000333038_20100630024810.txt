              ERITREA EDUCATION SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT (P070272)

                                         Restructuring Paper

1.                                                                                               Th
     e closing date for "European Commission Trust Fund for Eritrea Education" (EC TF)
     TF091092, which supports the larger Eritrea Education Sector Investment Project (P070272)
     will be extended from June 30, 2010 until August 31, 2010. The EC TF is governed by a
     Financing Agreement (FA) between the European Commission (EC) and the State of Eritrea
     (SOE) as well as the Administrative Agreement (AA) between the EC and the World Bank
     (currently set to close on December 31, 2010). An extension of the FA is currently being
     processed at the highest level of the EU Delegation in Brussels, but will not be finalized prior
     to June 30, 2010. Therefore, the EC asked the International Development Association (IDA)
     in a letter dated June 14, 2010 to extend the closing date for TF091092 between IDA and the
     SOE from June 30, 2010 until August 31, 2010 to allow the EC to finalize processing their
     FA. The letter also indicates the EC's intention to request a longer extension of the AA with
     IDA. This current two-month extension would result in a reduction of the grace period to two
     months between the closing of the EC TF and the AA so that the end disbursements date
     would remain the same, October 30, 2010. In a letter dated June 14, 2010, the SOE also
     requested an extension of the EC TF until August 31, 2011 thus implicitly approving this
     proposed short-term extension.

2. The EC TF TF091092 provides additional support to the Civil Works component of the IDA
   project and focuses on the construction of elementary and middle schools, education support
   facilities as well as skills development centers. Implementation of these activities was
   initially slow but has greatly improved since April 2009 with the introduction of the
   Community Participation ­ Rapid Results Approach modality. To date, 320 new elementary
   classrooms (benefitting 18,648 students) and 30 new middle schools classrooms (benefitting
   2,016 students) have been constructed using EC TF funding. Currently, there are contracts in
   place which would allow for the construction of 60 teacher quarters, the extension of 30
   existing and 21 new schools and the construction of 10 Pedagogical Resource Centers.

3. The proposed extension is necessary to ensure that the EC TF remains active. Failure to
   process the proposed two-month extension would jeopardize the achievement of the Project
   Development Objective of "increased and more equitable enrollment." There are no changes
   to the project design or financing mechanisms.

4. The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date which
   provides that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
   Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the Recipient has

                                                  4
   prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the World Bank to complete the existing
   contracts and agreements. Furthermore, the Recipient has agreed that only those contracts
   and agreements which are currently under implementation will be executed on a high priority
   basis.

5. This will be the first extension of the EC TF091092.
