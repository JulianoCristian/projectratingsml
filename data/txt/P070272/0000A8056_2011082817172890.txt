                         The most recent ISR was done only two months ago. The Bank team has not returned to Eritrea since it completed in early June and therefore this final ISR cannot comment further
                         on whether the recommendations of the last mission have been fully implemented. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will address those issues of (i) accelerating
                         completion of civil works; (ii) addressing issues of installing water supply and sanitation facilities; (iii) conducting training to communities and schools on environmental issues and

                         The purpose of this final ISR is to reflect recently received data on the achievement of development objectives - i.e.: increased and equitable access to quality education as measured
                         by numerical increases in enrollments, improvements in gender parity at all levels of the education system, and attainment of specific targets in student assessment over a baseline
                         Measuring Learning Achievement (MLA) Survey. These data make it clear that based on the original (2003) and revised (2007) targets, it is not possible to evaluate project outcomes
                         as satisfactory. This not because the project has not achieved notable successes (which it has); rather, it is because the nature of the data make it impossible to evaluate the project's
                         performance in terms of the original indicators of success. The problems include, inter alia:

                         (i) the adequacy of the quality of data on which enrollment targets were based at both appraisal and the 2007 restructuring;

                         (ii) the quality of the original MLA instruments for measuring proficiency and competency in the three subject areas - as well as issues regarding the comparability of the second MLA
                         to that of the baseline;

                         (iii) the lack of adapting for the impact of the overhaul of the curriculum for grades 1-12 during the project which affected the measurement of learning outcomes and project
                         implementation;

                         (iv) the appropriateness of the design of interventions to address bottlenecks such as increasing the share of girls at the primary level - which remained virtually unchanged
                         throughout the life of the project whereas girls' participation at junior and senior secondary increased significantly (in numeric terms more than as a percentage of all students); and

                         (v) significant changes in the education system and environment over time including curriculum change, major restructuring of the University of Asmara and teacher training
                         institutions, creation and implementation of an Education Sector Development Plan, etc.

                         With regards to the IP rating, it is not possible with existing information to distinguish bottlenecks which were in the realm of control by the MOE and project entities from those factors
                         which were external to the project. Examples include the rising cost of imports due to national policy shifts, elimination of licenses for private sector engineers/architects by the GOE,
                         the difficulties in the relationship between the broader World Bank and the Ministry of Finance, or the impact of the country periodically going into arrears for a short time towards the
                         end of the project.

                         Therefore the PDO and IP ratings are being changed from Moderately Satisfactory to Moderately Unsatisfactory.
