Natural\n            Resources and Rural Development's Directorate of\n            Natural Resources and its Forestry and Environmental\n            Protection Services, and for training in forestry and\n            agroforestry; (b) specific programs to promote tree planting\n            and soil conservation, improve the management of forest\n            reserves, expand forestry and agroforestry research,\n            establish and manage national parks and biosphere reserves,\n            and monitor land use in Haiti; and (c) promotion by the\n            Bureau of Mines and Energy of more efficient charcoal stoves\n            in urban areas.  The project will build the institutional\n            and policy framework for Haiti's Tropical Forestry\n            Action Plan through which complementary efforts will be made\n            to redress Haiti's natural resource destruction, as\n            implementation capacity develops."}, "docdt": "1991-09-03T00:00:00Z"}
