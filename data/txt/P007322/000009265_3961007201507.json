The\n            Bank's Board approved the credit on September 24, 1991,\n            but credit signing was postponed indefinitely after the\n            military coup on September 30, 1991 and the subsequent\n            international trade embargo with Haiti. The Bank withdrew\n            the credit on March 1, 1994 following attempts to\n            restructure the project. Funding for preparation work for\n            the project was provided by a Japanese grant and an advance\n            under the IDA's Project Preparation Facility. Some\n            activities financed under these funds were underway at the\n            time of the coup. The Japanese grant supported: (i) studies\n            to support the preparation of the Household Energy\n            component; (ii) work on maintaining, delimiting, and\n            protecting the Pine Forest Reserve; and (iii) preparation of\n            the 1989-93 Management Plan for the Pine Forest Reserve.\n            Under the Project Preparation Facility, the following were\n            executed: (i) work on maintenance, inventories, and\n            surveying; (ii) forest guards and fire fighter crews were\n            hired; and (iii) one of the two scholarships was granted.\n            The major lesson learned is that the activities proposed for\n            the project were and remain vital to Haiti's\n            sustainable economic development, and now to Haiti's\n            immediate reconstruction needs, especially those activities\n            directly targeted to the rural poor."}, "docdt": "1994-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
