                    PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE
THE TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROJECT
                          (LOAN 7184-TR)


    I.       INTRODUCTION

1.      The US$20.00 m i l l i o n Loan for the Trinidad and Tobago HIV/AIDS Prevention and
Control Project was approved on June 27, 2003 and became effective o n December 23, 2003.
The Closing Date for the Loan has been extended once from December 3 1,2008 t o December 3 1,
2009,

2.        The proposed restructuring will: (a) revise the Project Development Objective statement
t o better reflect the outputs and outcomes that are achievable and attributable t o the Project; (b)
revise the results framework t o align indicators with the revised Project Development Objective;
(c) establish a Special Account for the Loan under the Office o f the Prime Minister and an
Operational Project Account under the Ministry o f Health; and (d) revise Schedule 1 o f the Loan
Agreement to: (i)    include a new category 'sub-projects' for financing subprojects for c i v i l society
organizations and (ii)   reallocate resources among categories o f expenditure to take account o f the
actual costs o f project activities and to reflect the funding needs t o support the revised project
objectives and activities in the future; and (e) extend the project closing date from December 3 1,
2009 t o September 30,2010.

    1.
     1       BACKGROUND AND REASONS FOR RESTRUCTURING

A. The HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Trinidad and Tobago

3.       The Caribbean i s the region most affected by H I V / A I D S after Sub-Saharan Africa'. The
estimated adult prevalence o f HIV in the Caribbean in 2007 was 1.1 percent. An estimated
230,000 people are living with HIV, o f whom 20,000 were infected in the previous year alone.
An estimated 14,000 people died o f AIDS-related illnesses in the same year. A I D S i s the leading
cause o f death among adults aged 25 t o 44 years. The epidemic i s s t i l l largely transmitted
through heterosexual contact, with unprotected sex between sex workers and clients as a
significant factor. Transmission between men having sex with men i s a smaller but important
factor that remains hidden because o f stigma and discrimination. Trinidad and Tobago has an
estimated HIV/AIDS prevalence o f 1.5 percent o f the population aged 15-49 years (UNAIDS
2008, MOH, GorTT 2007)2. I t i s concentrated in high risk and vulnerable groups rather than
generalized in the population. The predominant mode o f transmission i s heterosexual. Seventy
seven percent o f a l l AIDS cases reported are among the 15-49 age group and o f these, 56 percent
are males. R i s k y social behavior, such as multiple concurrent partnering i s a major factor for
spread o f the disease. B o t h stigma and discrimination are widespread.

B. Trinidad and Tobago HIV/AIDS Response

4.      In September, 2004, the Government launched a comprehensive H I V / A I D S Prevention,
Treatment and Care Strategic Plan (NSP) for the 2004-2008 period. The implementation o f the
current NSP has been extended t o 2009 and a new NSP i s under development for the 2010-2014


' 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update - UNAIDS
* Ministry o f Health, Government o f the Republic o f Trinidad and Tobago
                                                    2
period. The Trinidad and Tobago HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project i s part o f the
Caribbean Multi-Country H I V / A I D S Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending
approved in June, 2001. In order t o support the Government's Five-Year National HIV/AIDS
Strategic Plan, the original Project Development Objective, as stated in the Loan Agreement, was
t o assist the Borrower in controlling the H I V / A I D S epidemic through: (a) the scaling up o f
programs for the prevention, care and control o f the epidemic targeted in particular t o H I V / A I D S
high-risk groups; (b) the heightening o f awareness in respect to HTV/AIDS infection and
prevention, amongst the Borrower's population; and (c) the strengthening o f the institutional
capacity o f the Borrower's related agencies and c i v i l society organizations t o ensure the
effectiveness and the sustainability o f the Project.

C. Project Performance to Date

5.       During the first t w o years, project execution was slow due to delays in requests for
reimbursement, initial capacity constraints, and inflexible internal Government procedures. By
the Mid-Term Review (MTR) o f the Project in March 2006, the Bank had reimbursed only
US$3.9M (20%) out o f the $20 m i l l i o n Bank loan. The MTR mission agreed with the
Government o n a range o f actions t o expedite project implementation and disbursements. The
Government confirmed that it needed all the Loan resources in order to effectively implement i t s
national H I V / A I D S program. Subsequently, the implementation improved and disbursements
notably increased. The Closing Date has been extended once from December 31, 2008 t o
December 31,2009. As o f September 30,2009, the Bank had disbursed US$15.5 m i l l i o n (77.7%
o f the Bank loan).

6.          The Project has contributed t o the strengthening o f the national response t o the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. With project support, 5924 HIV/AIDS patients were under care as o f
December 3 1, 2008. O f these, 3 172 patients, or 54 percent, were on antiretroviral treatment. This
includes 192 children who were under care, while 145 children were o n antiretroviral treatment.
The provision o f pharmaceutical supplies remains the best performing activity o f the project. The
project i s the main source o f external resources for pharmaceuticals for people living with
H I V / A I D S (PLWHA) including antiretroviral drugs, condoms and pharmaceuticals for
management o f opportunistic infections. The management o f pharmaceutical stocks and reagents
in the country has been strengthened and n o significant stock-outs have been reported, partly due
t o the project support. The Project has so far supported 88 sub-projects run by c i v i l society
organizations (CSOs) t o cany out activities addressing stigma and discrimination, prevention,
care and support. A number o f capacity building and networking activities have been undertaken
t o support schools, CSOs and line ministries t o conduct peer education activities and parenting
programs. The project also supported policy changes such as revising the HlV Testing and Counseling
Policies and conducting assessments o f laws affecting PLWHAs and other vulnerable groups.
Over the last five years, Trinidad and Tobago has seen a decrease in the number o f babies born t o
HIV positive women each year because the HIV positive mothers and the exposed babies are
receiving treatment under the Prevention Mother t o Child Transmission (PMTCT) programs.

7.       C i v i l works, however, continued t o pose serious obstacles as there were delays in key
Government decisions. Thus, it was agreed that the Bank would finance only those c i v i l works
activities that could be realistically completed before the closing date o f the Loan. As some o f
the constraints t o implementation persisted, the Government submitted a letter in June 2007,
seeking t o restructure the project and t o amend the loan agreement. The restructuring process
itself was then delayed by staffing challenges in the National AIDS Coordinating Council
(NACC) -- key project staff were lost t o promotion (the former N A C C director i s n o w the
Minister o f Social Development) and death (the former deputy N A C C director passed away last
year). T w o other key slots were also vacant for most o f last year, despite good faith efforts by the

                                                   3
Government t o fill them. Only until recently, four key positions (Technical Director, Deputy
Technical Director, Communications Officer, and Procurement Management Officer) at the
National A I D S Coordinating Committee (NACC) Secretariat have been filled. The technical
director has been on board since January 2, 2009 and i s providing needed leadership for project
implementation. The most recent position filled was that o f Procurement Management Officer
who came o n board on September 1,2009. Having the Procurement Officer o n board n o w offers
the Project the much needed capacity t o be able to effectively monitor the activities t o be
implemented during the extension period.

D. Reasons for Project Restructuring

        The main reasons for restructuring the Project are as follows:

    Need to Align the Loan Agreement with the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The Loan
    Agreement and the P A D had different Project Development Objectives (PDOs). The PDO
    stated in the Loan Agreement was t o assist the Borrower in controlling the HIV/AIDS
    epidemic through: (a) the scaling up o f programs for the prevention, care and control o f the
    epidemic targeted in particular t o HIV/AIDS high-risk groups; (b) the heightening o f
    awareness in respect t o H I V / A I D S infection and prevention, amongst the Borrower's
    population; and (c) the strengthening o f the institutional capacity o f the Borrower's related
    agencies and c i v i l society organizations t o ensure the effectiveness and the sustainability o f
    the Project. However, the PAD states that the Project i s focused o n attaining the following
    specific priority area outcomes (Development Objectives) in five years: (a) Prevention: curb
    the spread o f new HIV infections; (b) Treatment, care and support: reduce the morbidity and
    mortality attributed t o HIV/AIDS; (c) Advocacy and Human Rights: Increase the quality o f
    l i f e o f People living with HIV/AIDS; and (d) Surveillance, Research and Management: build
    sustainable institutional capacity for managing HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities
    for the long-term. A disconnect exists between these two Bank documents in terms o f the
    stated Project Development Objectives. Moreover, both documents tended t o reflect the
    broader objectives and targets o f the National Program rather than achievable and
    measurable project objectives.

    Need to have appropriate indicators to measure project performance and impact. The
    original Results Framework has too many indicators, many o f which did not have baseline
    data and targets, while some had unrealistic targets. Several o f these indicators have also
    proven difficult for the Project t o measure during the course o f implementation given the
    monitoring and evaluation capacity o f local agencies and the lack o f an established
    "monitoring and evaluation culture" in the country. Therefore, the M&E framework and
    indicators need to be revised in order to be realistic and measurable, taking into account the
    existing local information system and institutional capacity.

    Need to establish a Special Account for the Loan under the Office o the Prime Minister
                                                                             f
    and an Operational Project Account under the Ministry o Health. At the time the
                                                                     f
    Trinidad and Tobago HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved by the Board
    in June 2003, the state o f the economy o f Trinidad and Tobago was such that the
    government did not foresee the need for establishing a Special Account (or Designated
    Account using current terminology). During the preparation o f the project an understanding
    was reached that the Government would pre-finance all the expenditures that were not due to
    suppliers or service providers in the form o f direct payments and subsequently seek
    reimbursement from the Bank. As project implementation has proceeded and the amplitude
    o f expenditures has increased, together with the advent o f the financial crises, the increased
    demand on Government resources has necessitated the establishment o f a designated

                                                  4
     account t o facilitate project implementation. The absence o f a Special Account was one o f
     the main reasons for slow disbursements. Having a Special Account for the Loan under the
     Office o f the Prime Minister and an Operational Project Account for the M o H would help
     facilitate the f l o w o f funds.

 (d) Need to provide a separate "sub-projects" category to continue to support CSOs' activities.
     The separate category would allow the Project t o continue t o support activities being carried
     out by CSOs, but would ease the administration and disbursements o f these funds since
     these funds would n o longer be disaggregated into the Project's existing expenditure
     categories, but would instead be financed directly through a specific "sub-projects"
     category.

 (e) Need to reallocate loan proceeds to reflect the actual expenditure and future needs o the
                                                                                          f
     Project. The Government had exceeded i t s expenditure allocation for pharmaceuticals and
     requested more funds t o be reallocated t o this category. Since some c i v i l works such as the
     construction o f the National Blood Transfusion Unit (NBTU) building (estimated at about
     US$2 million) would not be able t o completed within the project l i f e time, the Government
     has agreed t o use its own funds to finance such c i v i l works and the loan proceeds will be
     reallocated t o finance other project priorities such as medical supplies.

 (f) Need to extend the Project Closing datefrom December 3 I , 2009 to September 30,2010 t o
     allow for the completion o f a number o f priority activities. Due t o the financial crisis and the
     limited budget allocation in this fiscal year, an extension would allow the project t o fully
     utilize the remaining US$4.5million before the project closes o n September 30, 2010. The
     government sent a letter o n August 25, 2009 requesting a nine-month extension to allow for
     the Project funds t o be fully utilized in support o f the following priority activities: (i)   the
     refurbishment o f the medical laboratory for the installation o f the viral load machine, (ii)
     purchase o f ancillary viral load equipment, (iii) purchase o f CD4 and V i r a l Load Reagents,
     (iv) purchase o f antiretroviral medication, (v) procurement o f consulting services t o
     undertake clinical monitoring o f Mt. Hope, (vi) consultancies, including for condom social
     marketing and NGO support, and purchase o f goods including condoms and reprinting o f
     F A Q booklet.

9.      Proposed Project Restructuring. The proposed project restructuring will:

 (a) Revise the Project Development Objective (PDO) to better reflect the outputs and outcomes
     that are achievable and attributable to the Project. The original Project Development
     Objective, as stated in the Loan Agreement, was t o assist the Borrower in controlling the
     HIV/AIDS epidemic through: (a) the scaling up o f programs for the prevention, care and
     control o f the epidemic targeted in particular t o H I V / A I D S high-risk groups; (b) the
     heightening o f awareness in respect t o H I V / A I D S infection and prevention, amongst the
     Borrower's population; and (c) the strengthening o f the institutional capacity o f the
     Borrower's related agencies and c i v i l society organizations t o ensure the effectiveness and
     the sustainability o f the project. The proposed revised Project Development Objective i s t o
     assist the Borrower in controlling HIV/AIDS through the: (a) scaling up o f prevention
     services for vulnerable groups and the general population; (b) expansion and strengthening
     o f treatment, care and support services for People Living with HIV/AIDS; and (c)
     strengthening o f the institutional capacity o f the Ministry o f Health, other Government
     agencies and c i v i l society organizations to ensure an effective multisectoral response to the
     HIV/AIDS epidemic.



                                                  5
(b) Revise the results framework t o align indicators with the revised Project Development
    Objective. The revised results framework i s attached as Annex Io f this paper. Progress
    towards the achievement o f the PDO will be tracked through the Project's results
    framework.

(c) Establish a Special Account for the Loan under the Office o f the Prime Minister and an
    Operational Project Account under the Ministry o f Health t o help facilitate the f l o w o f
    funds.

(d) Revise Schedule 1 o the Loan Agreement to include a new category for `sub-projects'for
                         f
    financing CSOs activities. This does not constitute a change in the Project's description
     because support for CSOs (NGOs and faith-based organizations) has been included in
     Components A, B and C under the Project Description o f the Project Appraisal Document
     (PAD), and Project Operational Manual (POM). In particular, the Project will finance CSO
     proposals for activities under components 1 t o 3 o f the Project. Schedule 1 o f the Loan
     Agreement would be amended t o include a new `sub-projects' category under which CSO
    activities would be allowed as expenditures t o be financed from the proceeds o f the Loan
    under Part A, "PreventiodPromotion o f Activities t o Reduce Spread o f HIV/AIDS", Part B,
                                                                                     ~.
    "Access t o Treatment and Care", and Part C o f the Project, " A d v ~ c a c y ~ Establishing a
    separate `sub-projects' category as per the Government's request, will facilitate ease o f
    administration o f these funds instead as they will n o longer have t o be disaggregated by
    existing expenditure categories such as consulting services and training. W e propose that
    the "sub-projects" category for CSOs also include financing their operational cost, instead o f
    financing their operational cost under the Operating Cost Category in order t o facilitate the
    f l o w o f disbursements. The team recommends 90% o f the Bank financing for the "sub-
    projects" category. The funding mechanism, selection criteria and procedures have been
    developed and incorporated t o the Project's Operational Manual, Annex 5.

(e) Extend the Loan's Closing Date from December 31, 2009 to September 30, 2010. This
    would be the second extension o f the Closing Date. The main reason for another extension
    i s that the government has agreed t o use i t s o w n funds t o complete the design and expansion
    o f the National Blood Transfusion Unit (NBTU), which would take more than eighteen
    months. The project funds would need t o be reallocated to support other priority areas,
    which have been specified in paragraph 8(f) and which can be completed by the end o f the
    Client's fiscal year, September 30, 2010. For this reason, a nine month extension has been
    requested. Given the global financial crisis and i t s impact o n the country's economy, the
    Government i s interested in fully utilizing the Loan t o support i t s National A I D S program.
    With the restructuring and extension, the project will be able t o achieve i t s revised PDO. If
    this extension i s approved, it would bring the total extension period in the l i f e o f the Project
    t o twenty one months. The Project has submitted a revised work-plan and the Bank team
    found it satisfactory.

( f ) Review the Bank Financing Percentages. The government has requested the Bank to
      increase its financing percentage t o 100% t o a l l Categories except Category 5, Operating
      Costs, and t o simple the declining financing percentages and their related trigger amounts
      for Category 3 and Category 5. However, the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project i s
      the only project the Bank has in Trinidad and Tobago at this time and the Bank has not
      established a Country Financing Parameter (CFP). Without a CFP, the Bank financing
      cannot be increased to 100% and financing for recurrent costs cannot be simplified unless a
    waiver i s obtained. Considering the amount o f the loan remaining ($5million) and the fast
    approaching closing date o f the project, the Bank team, after having consulted with the
    Government team, agreed that the project can fully utilize the remaining US$5 m i l l i o n

                                                  6
     within the extension period. In light o f this, establishing a CFP in order t o increase the Bank
     financing percentage may not be necessary. Therefore, the Bank team recommends seeking
     an extension and the percentage o f Bank financing in Schedule 1 will remain unchanged.

10.     The Project's main components remain the same with the exception o f one change being
introduced under Component 2: "development and dissemination o f the clinical care protocol".
This activity was planned during project preparation and i s in the Project Appraisal Document,
but was not reflected in the Loan Agreement. The revised Component 2 n o w reads as follows:

11.       "Access to Treatment and Care: Strengthening o f the Borrower's health network to
improve the diagnosis o f HIV/AIDS and other opportunistic infections, including: (a) the
provision o f laboratory equipment for diagnostic and confirmatory HIV testing; (b) the provision
o f training t o medical staff (including epidemiologists), health workers and pharmacy staff in the
areas o f HIV/AIDS treatment and care; (c) the provision o f anti-retroviral drugs (to patients
outside the mother-to-child transmission preventive program referred t o in Part A.4 above); (d)
the refurbishing o f selected health and pharmacy service facilities; (e) the provision o f
community and home care; and ( f ) development and dissemination o f the clinical care protocol."

12.      While there are n o other changes t o any o f the components, the scale o f some activities
within particular components has changed. In particular, under the treatment, care and support
component, c i v i l works have been significantly scaled down to include only those that can be
realistically completed by the end o f the project while provision o f pharmaceuticals t o address
opportunistic infections especially for antiretroviral treatment has been scaled up because demand
has far exceeded supply during the course o f project implementation. This scale down o f c i v i l
works activities does not affect the achievement o f the P D O as this component continues to
support point (b) o f the P D O which i s "strengthening o f treatment, care and support services for
People Living with HIV/AIDS" through the provision o f equipment, training, pharmaceuticals,
and care, and funds that have not been used for c i v i l works have been reallocated for procurement
o f ARVs for treatment. The government i s putting i t s o w n funds into the planned c i v i l works.

 13.      Institutional Arrangements for Project Management. The Office o f the Prime
Minister, through the National H I V / A I D S Coordination Committee (NACC), i s the Government
institution responsible for the execution o f the Project. The N A C C advises the Government on
 /D
ASI
  VI          policies, sets project priorities, and advises on budget parameters and a l l issues
regarding the implementation o f the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. A Secretariat o f the
NACC, which includes a Project Coordination Unit (PCU), i s responsible for day-to-day
activities o f the N A C C . I t i s staffed with administrative and technical staff, including Financial
Management and Procurement staff. Day-to-day coordination and facilitation o f project activities
i s the responsibility o f the Secretariat. The specific responsibilities o f the Secretariat include
preparing the project's work plans, reviewing proposals from CSOs and w o r k plans from L i n e
Ministries, in addition t o carrying out project financial management and procurement functions.
The institutions above are functional and have some staff with extensive experience working with
the Bank. The NACC, however, faced staffing challenges in 2008 which it has already partially
addressed through the successful recruitment o f its new Technical Director and Deputy Technical
Director, who started their assignments o n January 2, 2009, as w e l l as recent training o f
additional project staff in Bank fiduciary procedures. The Government has also agreed t o assign
short-term help as needed t o provide technical or administrative support t o the NACC; for
example, an assistant accountant was assigned to help process the required documentation for
reimbursement requests.

14. Economic and Social Analysis. In the Project Appraisal Document for this Project
(Report No. 25939-TR dated June 09, 2003), the economic justification for investment in the

                                                   7
Project i s outlined. That justification i s s t i l l valid. The Caribbean i s the region most affected by
HIV/AIDS after Sub-Saharan Africa3. The estimated adult prevalence o f HIV in the Caribbean in
2007 was 1.1 percent. An estimated 230,000 people are living with WV, o f which 20,000 were
infected in the previous year alone. An estimated 14,000 people died o f AIDS-related illnesses in
the same year. A I D S i s the leading cause o f death among adults aged 25 t o 44 years. In Trinidad
and Tobago, HIV/AIDS i s concentrated in the 15-49 age group; about 77 percent o f reported
cases belong t o this age group. This poses a substantial risk t o household incomes and welfare
and a potential risk t o economic growth, and provides a justification for public sector investment
to halt the spread o f new infections. Priorities to be financed by the Project are consistent with
internationally accepted cost-effective interventions for slowing down the epidemic and
mitigating i t s impact: targeted interventions for high risk groups including men who have sex
with men (MSM) and commercial sex workers (CSWs) and interventions for the general public;
voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services; control o f sexually transmitted infections
(STIs); prevention o f mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT); and anti-retroviral treatment
(ART).

 15.     Environmental Assessment.        The Project was assigned a Category `B' environmental
rating, mainly due t o the requirements for biomedical waste management and the c i v i l works
activities o f the Project. The Ministry o f Health (Environmental Health Division) conducted a
biomedical waste survey, as part o f the preparation for this Project in 2003. The Survey showed
that there was an adequate level o f segregation, in-house handling, treatment and ultimate
disposal o f most biomedical wastes, although there were gaps in management, equipment,
incineration and treatment that presented risks to the integrity o f the overall system. This was
partly due to the system being derived from the application o f general infection control practices,
and not seen as a specifically targeted or regulated area o f attention. In order to address
recommendations from the 2003 biomedical waste survey, the Project has:

        (a) Supported the dissemination and use o f the code o f practice (COP) for biomedical
        waste management, in consultation with the regional health authorities, and individual
        health facility managers;

        (b) Financed the clarification o f management responsibilities for biomedical waste at the
        health facility level, including training o n these responsibilities. The Project i s also
        supporting the strengthening o f the biomedical waste committee at the Ministry o f
        Health;

        (c) Supported the development o f a training manual o n biomedical waste management
        and the carrying out o f workshops for training o f health care staff o n biomedical waste
        management; and

        (d) Financed the assessment o f biomedical waste management systems, infrastructure
        and equipment in the various health facilities in the country, and the development o f
        specifications for recommended equipment. The assessment report was submitted t o the
        Ministry o f Health in 2006 and i s the basis for the ongoing and planned acquisition o f
        new biomedical waste equipment.

16.    A report dated January 26, 2006 t o the biomedical waste technical sub-committee o f the
Ministry o f Health outlines the actions that have been taken t o address the issues raised by the
survey o f 2003. The review o f the legal and regulatory framework in order to recommend
improvements i s an activity which remains to be addressed during the remaining part o f the


 2008 AIDS Epidemic Update - UNAIDS
                                                    8
project implementation period. The Project will also support a consultant to provide technical
support t o the regional health authorities, liaising with them t o finalize equipment and supply
needs, as w e l l as conducting an evaluation o f the various treatment technologies currently being
used. Although the Project will not finance incinerators, guidelines for environmental assessment
o f installation or upgrade o f an incinerator are attached as an annex o f the updated Operations
Manual for the Project. The status o f biomedical waste equipment at various health facilities in
the country i s also attached as an annex t o the updated Project Operations Manual. Sample
criteria for environmental management o f construction activities are also part o f the updated
Project Operations Manual. Responsibility for ensuring that the above safeguards in the
Operations Manual are adhered t o lies with the N A C C Secretariat in coordination with the
Ministry o f Health. Since the project has drastically reduced i t s support t o c i v i l works activities,
therefore, requirement for environment assessment for the c i v i l works has been significantly
reduced.

17.      Project Costs and Financing. The original components o f the Project will remain
unchanged. Nevertheless, there has been some reprioritization o f Project activities with
reallocation o f Project resources across categories o f expenditure, mainly from c i v i l works t o
pharmaceuticals. For example, the Government has decided to finance from other Government
resources the construction costs o f the Trinidad Public Health Laboratory, the Queens Park
Counseling Center and Clinic and the National Blood Transfusion Unit. The Bank-supported
project i s the largest source o f external financing for pharmaceuticals for managing opportunistic
infections. The overall total cost o f the Project remains unchanged.

18.      There are n o outstanding audits.

19.     Outcomes. T h e Project's Results Framework has been revised and i t s M&E indicators
will be used t o measure the results o f the Project. The revised Results Framework i s attached as
Annex I f this document. The proposed revised Project Development Objective i s to assist the
         o
Borrower in controlling HIV/AIDS through the: (a) scaling up o f prevention services for
vulnerable groups and the general population; (b) expansion and strengthening o f treatment, care
and support services for People Living with HIV/AIDS; and (c) strengthening o f the institutional
capacity o f the Ministry o f Health, other Government agencies, and c i v i l society organizations t o
ensure an effective multi-sectoral response t o the epidemic.

20.      Benefits and Risks.     The achievement o f the Project's objectives will contribute t o the
strengthening o f the national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The prevention elements o f
the Project will have benefits in averted new infections; the treatment and care activities o f the
Project will have benefits related t o improved treatment and care; and other elements o f the
Project, particularly those involving non-health sector Line Ministries and CSOs will have
benefits in better work and community conditions for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.
Benefits will also be realized in the strengthening o f the institutional capacity t o coordinate,
monitor and evaluate the overall H I V / A I D S response.

2 1.     At this stage o f the project, the restructuring i s s t i l l needed and appropriate because the
revised M&E framework will provide a measurable and realistic assessment o f project
achievements taking into account existing local M&E capacity. The special account and
simplification o f Schedule 1 will help address financial f l o w issues, given the country's budget-
constraints especially due to the declining price o f o i l (which i s one o f its main revenue sources)
and the reallocation o f funds from activities (mainly c i v i l works-related) that cannot realistically
be completed during the project implementation period t o address pharmaceutical needs,
especially antiretroviral treatment. With the restructuring and additional time, the project will be
able to successfully complete the planned activities in order t o achieve the revised PDO.

                                                    9
22.      One o f the main risks to achievement o f the Project's objectives is the lengthy internal
approval processes followed by the Government in order t o obtain clearances for project related
activities. The involvement o f the Permanent Secretary, Prime Minister's Office in approving all
transactions undertaken by the Project i s just one step in the entire approval process. This
proceduralhreaucratic risk i s being mitigated by the adoption o f an annual w o r k plan and budget
approval process by the Office o f the Prime Minister, with quarterly reviews. I t i s further
mitigated by the establishment o f a Special Account for the Loan under the Office o f the Prime
Minister and a Project Operational account for the Ministry o f Health, which accounts for a
majority o f the allocated project resources. A designated HIV/AIDS team at the Ministry o f
Health i s n o w in place t o ensure that project activities are given priority among the many
competing challenges o f the Ministry o f Health. A c i v i l works consultant was hired t o focus on
the Project's c i v i l works activities in the Ministry o f Health. The MOH decided in November
2008 to establish a new c i v i l works unit and appointed a focal person t o be responsible for the
Bank-financed c i v i l works. The Bank's supervision team also includes a c i v i l works Consultant
t o ensure effective supervision in this area. The planed c i v i l works has been reduced significantly
and the risk o f delays in c i v i l work has been reduced.

23.      Sustainability o f the program depends o n institutional arrangements in place, and o n the
effectiveness o f the prevention program, failure o f which will lead to higher costs o f treatment.
I f the Government draws down the Bank loan as planned and continues t o provide funding in i t s
budget, then i t s needs would be covered in the short-term. However, it will need t o take a
strategic view o f its options for sustaining i t s financing thereafter. The Government i s already
financing the salary costs o f the N A C C Secretariat and the line ministry coordinators. It will
need t o reflect on the financing needs o f treatment and care when external funds may n o longer
be available but the HIV/AIDS epidemic will s t i l l be a threat t o the health and economic
productivity o f the population.

24.     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) will continue to be a challenge in the short-to-medium
term, particularly while needed surveys are being undertaken and while the different stakeholders
such as the line ministries and CSOs, are getting more involved in providing information t o
inform the M&E process. T o mitigate the M&E challenges, the Bank, through the Global AIDS
Monitoring and Evaluation Team (GAMET) conducted an assessment o f the country's M&E
framework, collaborated with the Government in producing a costed M&E operational plan, and
will continue to support the Government in strengthening i t s M&E capacity during project
implementation. It i s also working with UNAIDS and other partners o n a regional epidemic
synthesis t o obtain information o n the epidemic that could be used for development o f the new
National Strategic Plan. The Government i s also strengthening i t s N A C C M&E working group
by establishing a new post o f M&E Program Officer to lead the M&E function o f the
multisectoral response.
