                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         On November 4, 2009, the Board approved a first-order restructuring of the Project. The revised PDOs are aimed at assisting the Borrower in controlling HIV/
                         AIDS epidemic through:

                          (a) scaling up of prevention services for vulnerable groups and general population;
                          (b) expanding and strengthening of treatment, care and support services for people living with HIV/AIDS; and
                          (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of the MOH, other government agencies and CSOs to ensure an effective multi-sectoral response to the HIV/AIDS
                         epidemic.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress has been made in the five priority areas defined in the National Strategic Plan (NSP). Achievements by priority areas follows:

                         a.        Prevention. The focus has been on raising awareness of HIV in the general population through mass media, educational campaigns at cultural events and support to Civil
                         Society Organizations including those working with Most At Risk Populations (MARPs). Capacity for HIV testing has increased and more condoms have been distributed. However
                         the number of people tested has remained low as has the percent of people reporting using condoms. The new National Strategy Plan, which is under development will focus more
                         attention to prevention and target the MARPs.

                         b.       Treatment. Free antiretroviral therapy (ART) is provided for people living with AIDS. MOH reports that 6452 HIV/AIDS patients were receiving treatment and care as of June
                         30, 2010. Of these, 4487 patients (69.5%) were on ART showing an increase of 895 patients or 15.5% on ART compared to 2009. The deaths due to AIDS has significantly reduced
                         since the introduction of ART.

                         c. Advocacy & Human Rights. A legislative assessment has been conducted on the impact of the laws of Trinidad & Tobago on people living with and affected by HIV &AIDS (PLHIV).
                         A national HIV policy is being prepared and would be followed by drafting legislation to deal with the issue of stigma and discrimination of PLHIV.

                         d.        Surveillance & Research. An IT based surveillance system has been pilot tested in seven sites improving the capture of HIV data and with the potential of reporting
                         nationally once a central database has been established and the seven sites agree to share the data captured. The system will be rolled out to more treatment and testing sites. A
                         number of research projects have sought to improve the evidence base on HIV in the country.

                         e.      Program Management Coordination and Evaluation. The Government of Trinidad & Tobago has funded a national committee and a secretariat in Trinidad and also in
                         Tobago to coordinate amultilevel response including financial inputs from other development partners and other implementers. M&E indicators have focused on process and output
                         measures with limited evidence of outcomes achieved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The country is at a critical point in maintaining control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Despite of the progress made so far, sustained effort is needed to control the spread of HIV through
                         prevention and treatment programs to avoid a reversal of the trend. The National AIDS Program will need to address the following challenges:
                         a.       Need for strengthening Prevention Programs
                         b.       Need for improving Monitoring and Evaluation and information system and having a better understanding of the drivers of the AIDS epidemic
                         c.       Need for improving Institutional Arrangements for the National AIDS Program
