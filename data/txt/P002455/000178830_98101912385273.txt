I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
1.01      Somalia, with its 630,000 km  in the northeastern corner of Africa,
consists largely of sparse grazing land and desert. Only about 13% of the
land is suitable for cultivation, and this lies for the most part between
the Juba and Shebeli rivers in the southern part of the country where irri-
gation is possible. Natural resources are scarce and the economy is dependent
on the export of livestock (and livestock products) and bananas which accounted
for 60% and 20%, respectively, of export earnings in 1976. Budget deficits
have been a continuing feature, financed largely by foreign development aid.
Per capita income is one of the lowest in the world (US$110 in 1976).
1.02      Somalia's 3,000 km, coastline is one of the longest on the continent
but it has very few natural harbors. The population, estimated at just above
3 million, is largely nomadic. The highest concentrations are around Mogadishu
(300,000), the capital, commercial center and major port, and in the northern
Hargeisa/Berbera area. The arid nature of the country, the low level of
economic activity, and the sparseness of the population between distant popu-
lation centers combine to make the provision of a transport system adequate
to development needs a formidable problem. As a consequence of the settle-
ment pattern, transport development has proceeded mainly in the southern and
northern areas where economic growth has been most evident.
B. The Transport System
General
1.03      The exploitation of Somalia's limited resources has been inhibited
by the lack of adequate transportation facilities. Somalia's transport infra-
structure comprises about 17,700 km of roads, four principal ports and ten
airports, but no railways, pipelines, or internal waterways. The density of
cargo and passenger traffic is light in all modes. Although some 10,400 motor
vehicles operate in the country, camels and donkeys are also an important
means of transport.  Many of the estimated 2.5 million camels in Somalia are
used for this purpose, but no data are available on the type and quantity
of goods transported. Camels are capable of carrying 100 kg loads over
average distances of 30 km per day. The ability of camels to function effec-
tively in areas of limited water and forage makes them well-suited to the vast
dry areas of Somalia. Thousands of donkeys haul small loads within cities
as well as to and from communities.
Highways
1.04      The road network is still limited and comprises about 17,700 km of
which some 1,400 km are bituminous surfaced roads and about 1,000 km are gravel
roads. Long distances and light traffic densities make road projects diffi-
cult to justify economically although they are necessary to ensure national



-2-
unity and administrative accessibility. IDA has financed the Afgoi-Baidoa
highway, providing a road link from Mogadishu through the center of its
hinterland and the Hargeisa-Berbera road, and is currently financing the
construction of a paved road from Hargeisa to Borama (113 km) with a link to
Tug Wajale (19 km) under the Third Highway Project. A 1,045 km road, financed
by the People's Republic of China, is under construction from Belet Uen in the
central region, to Burao in the north, and the remaining 275 km of the coastal
road between Kismayo and Mogadishu are now being paved under an EDF-financed
project.
Ports
1.05      The four major ports, Berbera in the north on the Gulf of Aden and
Mogadishu, Merca and Kismayo in the south, handle practically all of Somalia's
ocean transport. Ports with sheltered deep-water facilities are Berbera,
which exports mostly livestock, Mogadishu, which imports most of the country's
general cargo and Kismayo, which exports bananas and meat. Merca, which
exports bananas is a lighterage port. The new sheltered deep-water port at
Mogadishu financed jointly by IDA (Credits 359-SO and 586-SO) and the Euro-
pean Development Fund, was inaugurated on October 22, 1977. The relative
importance of the four ports is shown in following table:

1970, 1973, 1976 Somali Ports Authority.
1.06      Most of Somalia's international trade is handled by foreign vessels,
supplemented by the National Shipping Line, which was established in 1974 as
a joint venture of the Governments of Somalia (51% ownership) and Libya. This
line operates two refrigerator ships, of 4,000 dwt and 4,700 dwt capacity,
a livestock-carrying ship of 2,500 dwt capacity and two small general cargo
vessels of 1,500 and 2,000 dwt capacity.
1.07      Transport by coastal shipping within Somalia is limited despite the
long coastline, because there has been little inter-regional trade suitable
for such shipping. However, a cement plant under construction in Berbera will
send most of its annual output (100,000 tons) by ship to Mogadishu. Similarly,
petroleum products from the new refinery outside Mogadishu will be transported



- 3 -
by small tankers to Berbera and Kismayo. Current development of commercial
fishing is also expected to stimulate some growth of coastal shipping because
the fish is to be transported from a number of small ports to a few processing
and distribution centers, particularly Mogadishu and Berbera.
Civil Aviation
1.08      The air transport system in Somalia serves ten scattered regional
centers, with Mogadishu as the focal point. Only three airports have paved
runways. Somali Airlines operates three DC-3's, two turbo-prop aircraft
(F-27 and Viscount) and two Boeing 720 jet aircraft on its international
routes which connect Mogadishu with Rome, Cairo, Nairobi, Djibouti and various
points on the Arabian Peninsula. A few foreign airlines link Somalia with
other African countries and Europe.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
Policy
1.09      The Government's overall economic objectives are set out in the
1974-78 Development Program prepared by the former Ministry of Planning and
Coordination, now the State Planning Commission. The largest investments are
planned for irrigated agriculture. Industry is to be expanded, mainly to
build import substitution plants using domestic raw materials. Development
strategy for the livestock sector, which accounts for two-thirds of the
country's exports and provides a livelihood for much of the population,
emphasizes increasing production. Transport accounts for a substantial part
of total investment, as in the previous Three-Year Program.
1.10      The Government's transport objectives, as indicated in the 1974-78
Program, are to: (i) open new areas for development and thus increase the
economy's productive capacity; (ii) foster regional economic integration of
the country's many isolated areas; and (iii) lower the cost of, and facilitate
domestic transport, thereby reducing the disparity between rural and urban
areas in price and availability of goods. The Government intends to achieve
these goals primarily through construction of main and feeder roads; two of
these main roads are included in the Third Highway Project. Other key plans
are the completion of the Mogadishu harbor and relocation of its airport,
improvement of the Hargeisa airport, and strengthening of the national airline
and the national shipping line.
Planning
1.11      Transport and communications account for 25% of total planned
public investment over the 1974-78 period, compared with 35% in the previous
Three-Year Program. Only 60% of the 1971-73 investment plan for this sector
was implemented, largely because of delays in starting projects, particularly
the Mogadishu port project. Nevertheless, actual investments comprised 29%
of overall investments during the period.



-4
1.12      Within the transport and communications sector of the 1974-78
Program, the investment resources are allocated as follows:
Percent of
Investment           Total Sectoral Investments
(So.Sh. millions)
Highways                   687                          73
Ports and Shipping         184                          19
Civil Aviation              29                           3
Communications              45                           5
Total                945                          100
1.13      The Government is presently engaged in:  (i) evaluating progress
made in implementing the program; (ii) finalizing the investment program for
1978; and (iii) preparing a development program for 1979-81.
Coordination
1.14      Four ministries are concerned with the transport sector; the Ministrv
of Public Works (MPW) which, through its Civil Engineering Department (CED),
is responsible for highway maintenance and for planning and construction of
highways, ports and airports; the Ministry of Transport which is responsible
for vehicle registration and control, and for civil aviation through its Civil
Aviation Department; the Ministry of Marine Transport and Ports which, through
the Somali Ports Authority (SPA), is responsible for port operations and,
through the National Shipping Line, is responsible for marine transport; and
the Ministry of Interior which is responsible for highway traffic control.
No Government agency exists to oversee the functioning of the whole sector,
but some limited coordination is provided by the State Planning Commission.
1.15      Intermodal coordination is not an issue; there is no railway nor
are there any plans for one, and the limited coastal shipping is not likely
to increase significantly in the foreseeable future with the exception of
cement and petroleum products. Overall staff limitations have resulted
in heavy reliance on consultants for transport planning. Thus the Transport
and Communications Sector Plan of the 1971-73 Development Program generally
followed the investment recommendations made by consultants (Grimle, Canada)
in its 1966 Transport Survey, under the First Highway Project. In preparing
the 1974-78 Development Program, the 1966 Transport Survey again served as a
general guide. Under the Second Highway Project, an updated Transport Survey
by consultants (Renardet-Sauti, Italy) was completed in 1977. This survey
focussed primarily on the road network and secondarily on the aviation sector.
Only minor treatment was given to the ports sector, mainly for small fishing
ports.

D. Past Bank Group Involvement in Ports
1.16      The proposed project is a continuation of the Bank Group's involve-
ment in the development of the Mogadishu Port from lighterage to alongside
operations. The proposed project will be the Bank Group's fourth port lending
operation, all of which pertain to the Mogadishu Port. Starting in November
1964 the Bank made a technical assistance grant of US$311,000 followed in
March 1969 by a Credit S5-SO in the amount of US$550,000 which provided en-
gineering and accounting consultancy services. In March 1973, these prepara-
tions resulted in a US$12.95 million IDA Credit 359-SO which together with an
EDF grant of US$12.50 million financed the construction of a sheltered deep-
water harbor at Mogadishu consisting of a breakwater, three berths, a dolphin
berth, sheds, buildings, livestock facilities, port operating equipment, and
engineering and management consultancy services. During execution of this
project a third IDA Credit 586-SO, in the amount of US$5.2 million was approved
in September 1975, for an additional 180 m berth and a corresponding extension
of the breakwater. Completion of the original Mogadishu Port project and its
extension was six months behind schedule. The Government had accepted this
in a July 1977 settlement with the contractor (IMPREGILO, Italy) which also
covered various claims under dispute. The total cost overrun is likely to
be approximately 10%. The numerous contractual disputes which arose during
construction, and any lessons that might be learned from this experience, will
be reviewed in the forthcoming Project Completion Report.
1.17      In spite of the difficulties arising between the Government and
the contractor, construction of the new port has been a successful venture,
soundly conceived and efficiently executed. To ensure that its future opera-
tions benefit the country's developing economy to the full, there remains a
need for continued assistance in strengthening its management function and
training its staff. This is inevitably a long-term undertaking, and is one
in which the Bank Group is prepared to continue its involvement.
II. THE SOMALI PORTS AUTHORITY
A. Port Facilities
2.01      A Bank Port Survey and Project Identification Mission visited
Somalia in December 1976.  Its findings and recommendations have been updated
by the December 1977 Appraisal Mission.
2.02      Somalia has three deep-water ports.  They are, in order of traffic
levels, Mogadishu, Berbera and Kismayo. Lighterage of bananas for export takes
place from a pier on the open coast at Merca. The Bank Group has financed the
deep-water port of Mogadishu, which was completed in late 1977, and replaced
an existing lighterage port. The new port consists of four general cargo
berths, of which two are equipped with transit sheds, and one livestock berth.
The maximum water depth is 12 meters. The port is protected from wave action



-6-
by a one-kilometer long breakwater. The port facilities in Berbera, which are
located in a natural sheltered location, were completed in 1969. They consist
of two deep-water berths of which one is equipped with a transit shed, and the
other with a pen for livestock. The breakwater-protected port of Kismayo,
which was also completed in 1969, consists of four deep-water berths, of which
two are equipped with transit sheds, and one with a banana storage shed.
Portal cranes on rails are only available in Berbera, but the two cranes which
were installed there in 1969 have never been used, as suitable electric power
supply is not available. The use of ships's gear for loading and unloading
general cargo is considered adequate.
2.03      Two harbor tugs, one financed under Credit 359-SO, and one provided
free of charge by Netherlands bilateral assistance, were acquired by SPA
during 1976-77. A portable dredger, mainly for maintenance dredging of the
port of Kismayo and its access channel was acquired by SPA in 1976. Available
cargo handling equipment consists mainly of mobile cranes, forklifts and
tractors with trailers.
B. Organization, Management and Staff
2.04      The Somali Ports Authority (SPA), an autonomous Government agency
was created in 1962, and reconstituted under Law No. 70 of December 1970 and
Law No. 1 of January 7, 1973. SPA has as its responsibilities the adminis-
tration, operation and maintenance of the country's main ports. Planning for
the expansion and development of the ports as well as the execution of the
ports' development projects is the responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Works, while provisions for the financing of these projects are incorporated
in the Centralized Capital Investment Budgets of the State as a whole. Com-
pleted projects are handed over to SPA ownership for the conduct of port
operations. Presently, SPA functions under the supervision of the Ministry
of Marine Transport and Ports, and possesses the necessary powers to carry
out its responsibilities within the overall restrictions imposed by the
Government. The restrictions include the arbitrary transfer of personnel,
compulsory assignment of personnel to participate in non-port related activi-
ties, etc., due to the general shortage of skilled and semi-skilled individ-
uals in the country as a whole (para. 2.09).
2.05      SPA is managed by a President and a General Manager.  Their respon-
sibilities are to some extent duplicated and although this has not caused any
overt conflict, the lines of demarcation are vague and inhibit the orderly
functioning of SPA. Such a situation has led to the General Manager being
unable to exercise fully his leadership role as the chief operating officer
of SPA. The management is weak in areas such as planning, information sys-
tems and accounting. There is a clear need for injecting sound management
practices in controlling and directing SPA's activities.
2.06      Under the previous Credit 359-SO for the construction of the new
Mogadishu deep-water harbor, provision was made for the appointment of
management consultants for effecting improvements in SPA. Price Waterhouse
Associates (UK) were appointed as the consultants, and they commenced work
in April 1976. The areas to be covered by them included:



- 7 -
-    Port operations and operational planning procedures;
-    Tariffs;
-    Financial and management accounting;
-    Cost accounting; and
-    Revaluation of fixed assets.
Their recommendations were sound, but because of the unavailability of suit-
able staff in sufficient numbers (as a result of the exodus to the neighbor-
ing oil producing countries), the successful implementation of these recom-
mendations is now in jeopardy. SPA should be required to appoint to its
general management team a recognized port management expert to advise and
assist in the satisfactory implementation of the consultants' recommendations
and an appropriate training program. Agreement was reached during negotia-
tions that SPA will retain such an expert for a period of two years beginning
no later than January 1, 1979. The European Development Fund has agreed in
principle with SPA to provide the necessary financing for this purpose.
2.07      SPA's functional activities are adequately organized under four
departments, namely, Technical, Planning and Coordination, Administration and
Finance, and Personnel. The planning activity is limited to annual investment
programs for equipment purchases and minor construction and maintenance works.
SPA's organization chart is attached.
2.08      SPA employs about 3,250 people of which about 970 are regular
staff and 2,280 are dock labor who are engaged on a contract basis through
workers' cooperatives. Relations with employees appear to be satisfactory.
C. Training
2.09      Somalia is facing a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower,
which is felt on a national level because of the exodus in large numbers of
educated and semi-educated Somalis to the neighboring oil producing countries.
The outline of a survey plan to identify the needs for manpower in specialized
areas such as public administration, accounting and commercial practice, is
now being prepared by an inter-ministerial committee in Somalia. Actual im-
plementation of the survey will be the responsibility of the Somali Institute
of Development Administration and Management. The Association is financing
the costs of providing experts for this project under Credit 738-SO for the
Third Education Project. The question of providing vocational training for
draftsmen, mechanics, electricians, etc. still remains to be addressed, and
should receive top priority. At present there are 19 technical and specialized
institutes and vocational training centers with a capacity of about 3,200
places, and in addition 6 new institutions with a capacity of 2,000 places
are to be established during the next five years (4 are under construction).
Although the institutional capacity is adequately planned, the shortage of
technical teachers and instructors is a constraint for its full utilization.

2.10      SPA does not prepare any training plans or conduct any training
programs, even though it has difficulty in finding the staff with at least
the basic minimum skills as do most other organizations in Somalia. Account-
ing and operational consultancy services provided under the previous Credit
359-SO included some training elements; however, because of shortage of
suitable staff the training could not be satisfactorily carried out. SPA's
personnel department should actively cooperate with appropriate training
institutions in the country for securing good graduates for employment and
take the initiative to arrange selective training for its staff, utilizing
existing overcapacity of these intitutions. It was agreed during negotiations
that SPA will prepare a training program in consultation with the Association,
for implementation not later than June 1, 1979, or such other date as shall be
agreed with the Association.
D. Operations
2.11      SPA is solely responsible for port operations in Somalia.  Cargo
handling operations are and should remain labor intensive. Three shifts
are presently worked, when necessary. High labor and equipment productivity
has been observed in the new Mogadishu deep-water harbor by the appraisal
mission and by previous supervision missions. However equipment availability
should be improved by scheduled preventive maintenance and by improved avail-
ability of spare parts. A cargo handling expert from the management consul-
tants (Price Waterhouse, UK) financed under Credit 359-SO, spent a month in
Mogadishu in early 1978 to assist in planning and execution of cargo handling
operations in the new deep-water port.
2.12      SPA has recently enacted comprehensive port regulations, which are
applicable to all ports under its jurisdiction. This was a requirement under
Credit Agreement 359-SO.

Export Traffic
2.14      Somalia exports bananas, livestock, hides and skins, canned meat,
and fish. The tonnages of hides and skins, meat and fish are insignificant
as far as demand on port capacity is concerned. Banana and livestock traffic
on the other hand has a much greater demand on port capacity. Banana traffic
reached its peak in 1972 but has since fallen as a result of both low prices
and the drought period between 1973 and 1975. In order to increase future
traffic a series of positive events have to take place simultaneously. These
are:
(a)  increasing the yield per hectare;
(b)  increasing the producing areas; and
(c)  increasing the export market share for Somali bananas.
2.15      The Government is aware of the complexity of the problem to increase
and market the banana production. However, implementation of these goals
is underway. The National Banana Board (NBB) has started its own plantations
and is trying to consolidate smaller and less efficient plantations into
optimum size plantations. More efficient use of irrigation and equipment is
envisaged and it is assumed that a larger market share can be secured in the
two principal markets, Italy and the Middle East. NBB has formed marketing
and production companies together with an Italian parastatal company.
2.16      Livestock traffic is concentrated in Berbera.  Practically all
sheep and goats and about 90% of the camels are exported through this port.
Although Berbera is still the biggest export port for cattle, its share is
expected to drop from 80% to 70% by 1980 in favor of Kismayo, where cattle
production and exports are expected to grow faster than in the north.
2.17      Livestock exports reached a peak during the drought period between
1973 and 1975 when animals had to be sold off. Exports will be less during
the next few years and will increase slowly to enable the herds to grow.
Import Traffic
2.18      Dry cargo imports have grown at an average annual rate of some 20%
between 1970 and 1975, if one disregards the exceptional imports of cargo
through Mogadishu for drought relief in 1975. Since then the growth rate
has been a more modest 10%. Some of the commodities (chemicals, fertilizer,
sawn timber, and iron and steel) have such low volumes that they have no sig-
nificant impact on port capacity. Cement is the largest single category of
dry cargo imports. However, a cement factory is under construction at Berbera.
Cement from Berbera can be transported to Mogadishu and Kismayo by coastal
shipping at a lower cost than by road.
2.19      Other bagged cargo includes cereals, flour and sugar.  Because of
the drought, sugar production went down and Somalia has recently had to import
some 25% of its sugar consumption. New development projects will increase
domestic sugar production by 1979 as well as other agricultural production,
and thereby reduce the reliance on imports.



- 13 -
2.20      The general cargo category includes equipment and materials for
numerous agricultural and industrial development projects, particularly in
the lower Juba region. The average annual growth is forecast to be about
two-thirds of what it has been in the past.
2.21      Somalia presently imports all its petroleum products, but a refinery
is being constructed just south of Mogadishu. Once completed Somalia will
import crude oil to Mogadishu and ship refined products to Berbera and Kismayo,
where separate port facilities of sufficient capacity for refined products are
already available.
F. Port Planning and Development Strategy
2.22      In view of the lack of sheltered locations for ports along the
coast of Somalia, and the high costs of providing breakwater protection
for ports, great care should be taken in coordinating ports development
with land transportation. Fewer and larger ports will in general be better
investments than more and smaller ports, because of the few locations where
relatively high population concentrations exist.
2.23      The Government's plans for ports development have so far been
limited to the following:
(a)   about ten small ports for fishing boats and/or coastal
shipping in addition to the existing ports of Mogadishu,
Berbera, Kismayo and Merca; and
(b)   a new breakwater-protected harbor at Merca to replace the
existing unprotected pier.
2.24      It is the Government's intention that a feasibility study for the
small ports should be undertaken probably with bilateral financing. The study
would probably result in a considerable reduction in the number of small ports,
unless they are limited to inexpensive piers without breakwater protection.
2.25      Expensive port facilities for Merca would not be warranted until
the new Mogadishu Port has been fully developed, which would mean at least
an additional four or five berths. The reason for this recommendation is the
relatively short distance of some 100 km between the two locations and the
good paved road connecting them.
2.26      The urgent need for an extension of Berbera Port has previously been
established by the Bank Port Survey Mission in 1976. The same mission also
established the overcapacity of existing fixed facilities in Kismayo. It is
expected that the proposed Technical Assistance Project for Somalia will
include financing of engineering preparations for the Berbera Port extension.

G. Budgets, Accounts, Audit and Insurance
Budgets
2.27      SPA's capital and operating budgets are prepared annually and
approved according to a Government requirement of initial approval by the
supervising minister, i.e. the Minister of Marine Transport and Ports and
final approval by the Minister of Finance. Capital budgets normally include
equipment additions and replacements, civil works for renewal and repairs
of port facilities, etc. Investment for major additions or new construction
of port facilities, including those financed by external assistance are
incorporated in the Centralized Capital Investment Budgets and administered
by the Ministry of Public Works. SPA does not make a practice of preparing
long-term or program budgets, its main concern being only one year at a time.
Accounts
2.28      SPA maintains a double entry bookkeeping system.  Price Waterhouse,
the consultants, studied the requirements of SPA in the financial, management
and cost accounting fields and devised new and improved systems. However,
their implementation has only been partly successful due to the shortage of
suitable staff. The newly introduced accounting and management information
systems are not kept on a current basis and are several months behind. This
is unsatisfactory. SPA should be required to have in operation a functioning
documentation and accounting system that would permit the keeping of profit
and loss and balance sheet accounts, and traffic statistics on a current
basis. Agreement was reached during negotiations that SPA will maintain
records that will reflect its operations and financial condition satisfac-
torily.
2.29      Training of staff was an essential element of the consultancy ser-
vices, but this was only partly achieved because of the shortage of counter-
parts and/or other trainable staff. The proposed training program (para.
2.10) will also cover accounting staff.
Audit
2.30      SPA's accounts are audited annually by the Magistrate of Accounts
who is an independent entity reporting to the Presidency, and who is the
equivalent of the Auditor General in other countries. The audit is routine
and not thorough, and is carried out long after the close of the year because
of pressure of work and lack of competent staff. Under Law No. 16 of April 1,
1970 governing the Autonomous Agencies and their Audit, the above audit is
compulsory for all parastatal bodies. There are no other audit agencies or
public accounting firms in Somalia.
2.31      While SPA's audit as conducted by the Magistrate of Accounts has
generally been satisfactory in the past, the audited statements for 1975 and
1976 contain some arithmetical errors. The audit practices employed by the



- 15 -
Magistrate need to be reviewed (particularly at the verification phase of the
work), and the Internal Auditing Department of the Bank Group intends to send
a representative to review the existing situation and assist in improving the
practices followed.
Insurance
2.32      The Project Agreements for Credits 359-SO and 586-SO required that
SPA take out insurance against risks such as fire, damage and loss of its
property. SPA has recently obtained the necessary insurance coverage.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01      Somalia and Iraq have constructed and will operate a refinery some
15 km south of Mogadishu on a fifty-fifty basis. The refinery is financed by
Iraq and will be operated by experienced Iraqi technicians while the Somali
personnel are trained in Iraq. It is expected that the refinery will operate
at full capacity, 500,000 tons per year, from the start (mid-1978) and that
the surplus which is not consumed within Somalia will be marketed abroad with
the assistance of Iraq. Present consumption in Somalia amounts to some 200,000
tons of petroleum products per annum. Imports of crude oil and exports of
refined petroleum products will temporarily be handled at a tanker facility in
the new deep-water port of Mogadishu. This facility is provided at the third
general cargo berth and limits the use of this berth for general cargo to only
half of its capacity.
B. Scope of Proposed Project
3.02      The project consists of a conventional tanker pier, located in the
Mogadishu deep-water harbor as shown on the port plan. It will be used for
inbound crude oil for the Mogadishu refinery and for outbound petroleum pro-
ducts. However, its layout and design will make provision for its possible
future use also for handling bulk grain, sugar and molasses. The existing
facilities for unloading of petroleum products from small tankers is located
in the open sea close to the rocky shore. It is very dangerous and ineffi-
cient, and its replacement has been required for some time. At the Govern-
ment's request, engineering preparations for the next extension of Mogadishu
harbor have been included as there are considerable savings in combining this
with engineering of the tanker terminal. It is also the intention to continue
the Bank's involvement with SPA's efforts to strengthen its management team
and to train its staff.



- 16 -
C. Choice of Terminal Type
3.03      The basic purpose of the project is to provide economical and safe
facilities for accommodating tankers carrying crude oil to the Mogadishu
refinery and smaller tankers transporting petroleum products from the refinery.
3.04      The technical and economic feasibility of the following alternatives
has been investigated by consultants (Danish Hydraulic Institute and Hostrup-
Schultz & Sorensen, Denmark, in joint venture with Van Houten Associates, USA)
and Bank staff. Comparisons have been made between:
(a) a conventional offshore multi-buoy mooring;
(b) a tanker pier in Mogadishu harbor (the chosen alternative);
and
(c) a single buoy mooring in deep water off Mogadishu Port.
3.05      A conventional multi-buoy mooring is not technically feasible
because of the existing wave climate. Tankers would frequently have to wait
a week or more for calmer seas. An analysis has been carried out, of the
total cost streams for the two other alternatives over a 25 year period,
including operating and maintenance costs, as well as freight rates for
crude oil from Iraq in 35,000 dwt tankers of the Iraqi national tanker fleet
for the conventional tanker pier, and in twice as large tankers for the
single buoy mooring. The conventional tanker terminal is the least cost
solution. Further it will be designed for future multi-purpose usage for
bulk grain, sugar and molasses handling.
D. Details of the Project
3.06      The project includes the following elements:
(a) a tanker pier for crude oil tankers of maximum 50,000 dwt
and for small products tankers. It consists of a loading!
unloading platform, berthing platforms and mooring platforms
connected to shore by a causeway and/or trestles which carry
a crude oil pipeline and petroleum products pipelines and a
roadway for light trucks. The platforms will either consist
of concrete caissons or be supported on steel piles.
(b) pipelines within the port limits;
(c) hydraulic model tests, site investigations, detailed en-
gineering, preparation of tender documents, assistance
during tendering and supervision of construction of the
tanker terminal by consulting engineers; and



- 17 -
(d) site investigations, detailed engineering, preparation of
tender documents and assistance during tendering by con-
sulting engineers for a 210 meter extension of the existing
banana quay in Mogadishu harbor for general cargo traffic,
the construction of which will be optional under the tanker
terminal contract, and will depend on the rate of traffic
growth. The option will be considered when completion of
construction of the tanker terminal is approaching.
3.07      The equivalent of US$0.5 million advanced under the Project Prep-
aration Facility for engineering services (see (c) and (d) above), will be
refinanced under the proposed Credit.
E. Cost Estimates
3.08      Cost estimates as of late 1977 for civil works have been developed
by the consultants who studied the technical feasibility and did the prelim-
inary engineering. Preliminary engineering is considered sufficient for
reliable cost estimates as these are also based on the experience from the
recently completed Mogadishu Port Project, financed under Credits 359-SO and
586-SO. Cost estimates for consultants' services are based on a lump sum
proposal without price escalation which has been submitted to the Ministry
of Public Works. The average man-month cost for consultant staff is US$6,000.
3.09      The total project cost, assuming that the required pipelines between
the refinery and the port have been installed, is So.Sh. 41.7 million (US$6.6
million equivalent). Of this amount, So.Sh. 3.3 million (US$0.52 million
equivalent) is for engineering of the banana berth extension. This consists
of consultants' services for site investigations, detailed engineering,
preparation of tender documents and assistance during tendering for a 210
meter extension of the existing 130 meter long banana berth sufficient for
two 170 meter long general cargo berths along this stretch of quay. The cost
estimates include a 10% physical contingency, which is considered adequate,
and price contingencies on civil works of 8% during 1978, 7.5% during 1979 and
7% from 1980. These worldwide price contingencies are considered valid for
the total cost, as 15% of the total cost or 75% of the local cost is for local
labor, the cost of which is estimated to increase by 7% per year.
3.10      The foreign exchange cost is estimated at So.Sh. 34.9 million
(US$5.53 million equivalent) including contingencies. Similarly the local
currency cost is So.Sh. 6.8 million (US$1.07 million equivalent). SPA,
the future owner and operator of the terminal, is exempt from local duties
and taxes on imports. Project costs are shown in more detail below.

F. Procurement and Disbursement
3.11      There will be only one contract for civil works.  It will be awarded
after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guide-
lines including pre-qualification of contractors. No local contractor will
be able to qualify as general contractor. However, one or more are likely to
become subcontractors or joint venture partners.
3.12      Disbursements from the proposed credit will be fully documented and
will be on the basis of 80% of the cost of civil works and 100% of expendi-
tures for engineering consultants' services. The estimated schedule of
disbursements is shown below:

Any surplus credit amounts should be cancelled.
G. Project Execution
3.13      Supervision of construction will be carried out by engineering
consultants reporting to competent staff of the Ministry of Public Works,
which will be responsible for project execution.
3.14      Implementation of the project will require 2-1/2 years and is
planned to take place as follows:
(a)  hydraulic model tests, site investigations, detailed
engineering and preparation of tender documents, the
latter overlapping with pre-qualification of contractors
from March through November 1978;
(b)  tendering, evaluation of tenders and award of contract
from December 1978 through March 1979; and
(c)  construction from June 1979 through October 1980.

H. Operational Targets
3.15      In order to improve the performance of SPA in regard to its opera-
tion of the new alongside general cargo facilities financed under Credits
359-SO and 586-SO, the following operational targets have been established
based on consultants' (Price Waterhouse, UK) studies:
Obiective
(a)  Port operations equipment availability          75% from 1979
(b)  Port operations equipment utilization          85% from 1979
(c) Gang shift productivity in tons
per eight hours:                          1978   1979   1980   1981
Bagged cargo                           105    120    135    150
General cargo                           56      64     72      80
Bananas                                112    128    144    160
(d) Average number of ships' hatches
worked simultaneously                     3 from 1978
These targets have been agreed to during negotiations.
I. Environmental Impact
3.16      The existing primitive facility for unloading petroleum products
presents considerable pollution risks. The new facility for unloading crude
oil from tankers and loading petroleum products into tankers will be designed
to avoid spills.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Methodology
4.01      When the refinery starts operating, in mid-1978, crude oil imports
and petroleum products exports will be handled over the third general cargo
berth. This is both a wasteful use of an expensive general cargo berth and
a hazardous operation. The project is therefore needed to provide efficient
and safe tanker terminal facilities.
4.02      The possible technical  solutions, as suggested in the feasibility
study conducted by consultants, were evaluated by discounting their cost
streams over a 25-year period at various interest rates. In addition an



- 21 -
analysis was made of non-quantifiable advantages and disadvantages such as
fire hazards, difficulty in operation and maintenance, possible utilization
of the tanker facility for other bulk commodities, change in availability
of certain tanker sizes, the risk of the project being underutilized, and
pollution. The different factors were assigned a weight and for each factor
the technical solutions were given a score from zero to ten.
4.03      The solution receiving the highest weighted score was also the
least cost solution for interest rates above 3%. At a 10% discount rate
the least cost solution is some 7% cheaper than the next best alternative.
4.04      The project, as defined by the least cost analysis and described
above (Para. 3.06) was then compared with the "without-the-project"
situation, in which the third general cargo berth is also used for crude
oil and petroleum products. The benefits, costs and economic return of
the project are given below.
B. Project Benefits
4.05      The quantifiable benefits of the project consist of cost savings
due to reduced ship waiting time as a result of released general cargo berth
capacity. Analytical relationships between berth occupancy factors and
waiting time for ships have been used. These cost savings are estimated
at US$5,000 per day, being the average cost per day for the typical 8,000-
12,000 dwt general cargo ship calling at Mogadishu. The even higher cost
per day for tankers is disregarded as a benefit since tankers are assumed to
get preferential berthing.
4.06      In calculating the economic return, only half of the benefits from
reduced ship waiting time have been considered. This is due mainly to uncer-
tainty about the extent to which these benefits will be passed on to the
economy of the country.
4.07      The total cost savings from reduced ship waiting time are expected
to increase with traffic from US$180,000 in 1981 to US$1.3 million in 1984,
after which they are kept constant since an additional berth will be economic-
ally justified by the mid-1980's according to present traffic forecasts.
4.08      The tanker terminal facility has no significant employment impact,
except during its construction.
C. Project Costs
4.09      For the purposes of calculating the economic return total project
costs have been adjusted by excluding price contingencies. Furthermore, a
shadow rate of 43% above the official rate has been applied to the project's
foreign exchange element, to reflect its estimated economic value.



- 22 -
D. Economic Return, Sensitivity and Risk
4.10      Based on the above benefits and costs, and assuming a 25-year life,
the project yields a quantifiable economic return of 15% in addition to the
important benefits of providing a safe and efficient tanker terminal. Without
shadow pricing foreign exchange the economic return is 14%. The return from
the project is sensitive to traffic developments, the extent to which the
benefits will accrue to Somalia, and to the cost of the project. If ship
waiting time benefits are assumed to be 20% less, the return from the project
will drop to 13%. A 20% increase in cost will also lower the return to 13%.
These returns are considered acceptable especially in view of the even greater
risks involved in not implementing the project (para. 4.01).
4.11      The weaknesses in SPA's management structure, coupled with the
transfer of operations from a lighterage port to the new deep-water facility,
clearly entail some risk in respect to the future effective working of the
port. The position is by no means so serious as to cast doubts on the wis-
dom of financing further investments in SPA, but it is nevertheless important
to continue to focus upon the institution-building aspects of the Bank Group's
involvement. As one specific measure, it is intended that a recognized port
management expert be appointed to assist in implementing sound management
practices (para. 2.06).
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Present Situation
5.01      SPA's operating results have been satisfactory and have provided
a dependable source of revenue for the Government. Under Credit 359-SO,
SPA was required to produce a 5% annual return on net fixed assets; however,
because of the extension under Credit 586-SO of the new Mogadishu deep-water
harbor and the resulting higher investment costs, the above rate was reduced
to 4.5% for 1977, though retained for subsequent years.
5.02      According to Law No. 58 of July 31, 1972, relating to the finances
of Public Enterprises and Agencies, SPA is obligated to make the following
remittances to the Government:
(a) Turnover Tax: The percentage to be assessed on turnover
is fixed by the Finance Minister each year. For SPA
this has resulted in an annual imposition of 5% on
gross income.



- 23 -
(b) Share of Profit: Net income is first computed after
allowing for provision for depreciation, bad debts and
turnover tax. Then appropriations are made for staff
bonus and welfare funds (15%) and for SPA's own capital
investments (excluding those financed under centralized
capital investments). The remainder is transferred to
the State Budget.
(c) Depreciation Fund: The Minister of Finance determines
annually, the percentage of SPA's annual depreciation
provision which SPA is to transfer to the State Budget
as its share of the national depreciation fund for
development. In 1973 and 1974 it used to vary between
50% and 60% of SPA's annual depreciation provision,
but from 1975 onwards the Ministry of Finance has been
allowing SPA to keep the full depreciation provision for
purposes of funding SPA's own annual capital investments.

5.03      The item ships' dues shows a considerably lower level of revenue
starting 1975 because the Government has been taking over the receipts from
charges such as anchorage and accostage fees into the State Treasury. This is
no longer an issue because the structure of ships' dues has since been changed
and all ships' dues now revert to SPA. The unusually high revenues from
cargo handling in 1975 were due to the high volume of traffic resulting from
the drought relief measures.

5.04      SPA's financial condition is good. As the Debt/Equity ratio shows,
SPA has virtually had no debt, financing its net fixed assets entirely with
equity capital. In addition, as the current ratio shows, SPA's liquidity
continues to be high.
5.05      SPA introduced new tariffs effective December 1, 1977, as a result
of the tariff revision studies undertaken by Price Waterhouse Associates, the
consultants under the previous Credit 359-SO. SPA followed the recommendations
of the consultants in general, although in some instances where the rates pro-
posed by the consultants were relatively high, SPA lowered the range within
acceptable levels. SPA's concern is that any immediate higher rates without
better quality of service would be unreasonable. SPA has given assurances that
as the expected operational improvements take place particularly in the new
Mogadishu Port, they will restudy the tariff situation and introduce such
changes as are necessary to maintain as well as improve its financial per-
formance.



- 25 -
B. Future Prospects
5.06      SPA's fixed assets were revalued recently and these together with
the new Mogadishu Port project costs are incorporated in SPA's fixed assets
effective January 1, 1978. The total cost of the new Mogadishu harbor
amounts to So.Sh. 221.3 million. An additional So.Sh. 3.7 million is in-
cluded in 1979 for storage facilities.
5.07      Projections of SPA's financial performance have been made through
1982. Projected operating revenues and operating expenses are given in the
Income Statement summarized below. Tariffs according to the recently revised
rates have been applied to the forecast traffic. Projected expenses for wages
include a 24% increase from 1977 to 1978 to provide for the coming into opera-
tion of the new Mogadishu Port, and a 10% increase for 1978 and annual increases
thereafter of 8% to cover inflation. Possible manpower requirements to handle
traffic growth after 1978 are assumed to be covered by increased productivity.
Maintenance and administration expenses include all other working expenses and
the projections include an annual increase of 10% in 1978 and 8% thereafter
to meet cost increases caused by inflation. The net results are satisfactory
inasmuch as the operating ratio improves from 76.3% in 1978 to 67.4% in 1982,
and the annual rate of return on net fixed assets in use shows an increase
from 5.0% in 1978 to 7.0% in 1982. The calculations for 1982 do not include
any provision for the completion of two additional berths in Berbera. If
these additional berths (costing about So.Sh. 120.0 million) were to be com-
pleted and were to be in use for the full year of 1982 the rate of return in
1982 will be reduced from 7.0% to about 6.0%.
5.08      The tanker terminal is expected to produce net operating income
of So.Sh. 1.2 million in 1981, the first full year of its operation. This
should result in an annual rate of return on the net value of the tanker
terminal alone of 5.5%. The forecast revenue is from handling of crude oil
and petroleum products only, and as the utilization of the tanker terminal
increases with its additional use for other bulk commodities, the financial
results should also improve. This could eventually produce an annual rate of
return of some 8% or more.

5.09      SPA's financial objectives should be that its operating revenues are
sufficient to (i) cover its cash operating requirements including maintenance
and administrative expenses, (ii) service its debt, (iii) meet its capital
additions and/or replacement expenditures including the local currency compo-
nent under the proposed project, and (iv) make remittances to the Government
in the form of turnover tax, share of profit, and reasonable contributions to
the depreciation fund. The following projected cash flow statement shows that
SPA should be able to achieve these objectives.

5.10      Upon completion the new tanker terminal will be owned and operated
by SPA. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the proceeds of the
Credit will be onlent by the Government to SPA at 7-1/2% interest per annum
for a term of twenty years. It was also agreed that if for any reason SPA
should be unable to cover the local currency expenditures under the proposed
project, the Government would make available all necessary funds to complete
the project.
5.11      In making the financial projections, SPA's likely capital additions
and/or replacement requirements including the local currency expenditures
under the proposed project have been taken into account. No major port devel-
opment programs are envisaged during the implementation period of the proposed
project. It was agreed during negotiations that the Association will be con-
sulted whenever capital investments in the port sector, beyond those included
in the proposed project during its implementation period, are estimated to
exceed So.Shs. 6.0 million per annum in total.
5.12      Projections of SPA's balance sheet are summarized below.  They show
that SPA will be well capitalized from 1978 to 1982, while the current ratio
shows a steady improvement in SPA's liquidity. The Debt-Equity ratio will
range from 52/48 to 56/44, reflecting Government loans of So.Sh. 221.3 million
in 1978, and So.Sh. 34.9 million in 1980.

5.13      The ongoing agreements specify an annual rate on net fixed assets
of 5.0%. Comments on SPA's financial projections summarized in paragraph
5.07 indicate that SPA should be able to achieve even higher rates of return.
However, the existing requirement of 5.0% is sufficient to meet the financial
needs of SPA such as debt service requirements, routine capital investment



- 29 -
needs and turnover tax payments. During negotiations agreement was reached
that the Government and SPA will take all necessary measures including adjust-
ments in rates to maintain a return of at least 5.0% per annum.
5.14      SPA's financial viability could be endangered if it were to incur
substantial additional debt. During negotiations, agreement was reached that
SPA will not incur any additional long-term debt without the Association's
prior agreement unless its net cash revenues for the fiscal year or the twelve
consecutive months immediately before the date of incurrence, whichever is
greater, would be at least 2.0 times its maximum debt service requirements of
any succeeding year on all SPA's debts.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and
SPA on the following matters:
(a)  appointment of port management expert (para. 2.06);
(b) training of SPA personnel (para. 2.10);
(c) maintenance of documentation systems on current basis
(para. 2.28);
(d) operational targets (para. 3.15);
(e) onlending terms (para. 5.10);
(f) investment limitation (para. 5.11);
(g) financial rate of return (para. 5.13); and
(h) debt limitation (para. 5.14).
6.02      Project progress and completion reporting requirements have been
agreed with the Government and SPA.
6.03      On the basis of the above, the proposed project provides a suitable
basis for an IDA Credit of US$5.5 million to the Government of Somalia.
