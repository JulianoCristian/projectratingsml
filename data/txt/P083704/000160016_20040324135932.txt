A. LILJustification

1. What i s to be learned (why the piloting)?

The main purpose of this Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)i s to test the effectiveness and
sustainability o f the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN), and more specifically,
a Development Learning Center (DLC) in Malawi as part of a global knowledge-sharing
network to strengthen the capacity of public, private and civil society decision makers to
design, plan, and manage social and economic development programs. The project will focus
on improving human development inMalawi, particularly regarding expenditure and financial
management skills and the capacity o f accountability institutions as outlined in the pillars 2
and 4 of the Malawi PRSP.

The Government has expressed interest in training courses that support ongoing civil service
capacity building initiatives and reforms in areas such as health, local government, legal, and
education, as well as in functions related to procurement, accounting, service delivery,
restructuring, budgeting, performance management. The training needs for the PRSP, the
FIMTAP and other Bank-financed projects cover technical, policy, and management areas
that can also be supported by the D L C without the high cost o f travel. Most of the World
Bank funded projects in Malawi support capacity building efforts at both the project and
program or sector wide levels. One of the best uses of the D L C will be to link these teams
with other teams in and out of Africa to share experiences.

The project will support government efforts in public sector reforms by improving access to
knowledge and trainings and thus buildingthe capacity of the decision-makers involved inthe
reforms process. Malawi has a limited number of training institutions that can effectively
respond to the local demand. Through the GDLN, the D L C will provide the public sector with
a high-quality and demand-driven training program which will address inter alia
development-related issues: good governance, decentralization, corruption, and financial
management - all of which, in turn, support the Government's Financial Management,
Transparency and Accountability Project. The main target audience o f the GDLN comprises
decision makers from the public sector and civil servants in general, to include training under
the FIMTAP training facility and for strategic and succession planning within Government.

The D L C i s a new concept for Malawi. Despite the presence o f numerous training institutions
in Malawi, there are no means of sharing information and exchanging knowledge with other
countries. This distance learning initiative will aim to: (i)
                                                            improve the implementation of the
PRSP and IDA-financed projects by strengthening the environment o f policy reform and
building the capacity in the public and private sectors; and (ii) coordinate local training
                                                                 help
institutions inregard to the national capacity buildingpolicy.

The training needs o f the NGOs, civil society and the private sector will be also taken into
account and the development o f a D L C sub-center in Blantyre will specifically respond to the
capacity building needs of the private sector.

                                                  2


2. How are the results going to be used (vis a vis CAS objectives and any follow-on
operation)?

Document number: 25906 MA1 Date of latest CAS discussion: 05/14/2003
The D L C will improve the effectiveness of the Malawian Civil Service, strengthen key areas
such as expenditure accountability, and generally address the paucity of capacity facing
Government o f Malawi.

3. Other countries or situations where similar efforts have shown promise.

The Global Development Learning Network Program has completed its third year o f
operation with some success in developing programming and content. Already operational in
eight countries in Africa and in more than fifty sites around the world, the Development
Learning Centers are today successful learning tools. For example, after two years of
operations, the D L C in Dakar has already reached the objectives of the third year in terms of
operating costs recovery, the learning program and the number of clients. The Centers o f
Tanzania and Uganda use their facilities daily and have reached a use rate of more than 50%
and recover around 60% of their operating costs.

With Mauritania, Kenya and Burkina Faso, Malawi will benefit from this new learning
network as part o f the third phase o f the GDLNdeployment. Moreover, the D L C in Lilongwe
will be part of an Anglophone African DL network including Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda.

B. Structure of the Pilot
1. How will learning take place?

The learning will take place through a structured pilot aimed at documenting the
effectiveness, efficiency, impact, relevance, and sustainability of the DLC. Success will be
determined by the achievement o f critical performance indicators such as the demonstration
o f financial viability, training relevance, learning, and application of skills. An M&E system,
performance indicator tools, and associated monitoring instruments will systematically
measure the extent to which success has or has not been achieved.

The D L C i s being created as an independent legal entity to share development knowledge and
information. It will be formally established by Government and constructed in Lilongwe on
the Malawi Institute o f Management campus during the first year of the project. Thereafter,
the project will support the operations of the DLC (with costs on a decreasing basis) over the
following four years.

Business Casefor Selection MIM as the Host Institution: The choice of MIM as the D L C
host institution i s the result o f (i)an evaluation o f all potential host institutions in Malawi;
and (ii) the experience learned in other countries where similar operations are implemented.
The Malawi Institute of Management (MIM) i s an independent training institution which
offers high quality short-term trainings to civil servants and decision-makers from the public
and private sectors. Therefore, it offers a similar type o f products and has the same target
audience as a DLC. The location of the future D L C within the MIMcampus will enhance the

capacity of both institutions by bringing to MIM content from abroad and by providing the
D L C with regular clients and partners. Its location in Lilongwe provides easy access for civil
servants, the key market segment for the DLC. MIM has a track record of good financial
management, project management experience and knowledge of World Bank and donor
programs. Moreover, MIM's campus has sufficient space to allocate a plot of land to build
the Center.

The Malawi GDLN project will be implemented in a medium risk environment. As outlined
in the recently completed CFAA, Malawi Public Expenditure Review and the Tracking
Poverty-Reducing Spending in HIPCs: Country Assessment and Action Plan for Malawi,
there are outstanding expenditure management and reporting issues in Malawi. There i s poor
linkage between policies that govern budget formulation and outputs from the same, less
transparent budget execution methods, inadequate assurance that allocated resources are used
economically and efficiently for the intended purposes and an absence of private sector
participation in the budget management system.

The above said, the Malawi Institute of Management has a good track record of project
implementation, financial management, and a good audit record. MIM serving as the host
institutions will help to ensure the project i s carried out in a medium risk environment, as
opposed to a highrisk environment.

2. Outcome-level test to be conducted

The establishment o f the DLC i s expected to result in an effective and sustainable global
knowledge-sharing institution that will provide relevant training opportunities and, ultimately,
enhance the capacities of civil servants and key decision makers inMalawi.

3. Steps involved in conducting the pilot

The Pilot will be undertaken utilizing the following steps: (i) identify the local needs in terms
o f trainings and capacity building; (ii) promote the content available on the GDLN; (iii) in
                                                                                           put
coherence the content offered by the local training institutions; (iv) develop additional
partnerships to meet the local needs; (v) assess the coherence o f the trainings and courses
offered by the DLC; (vi) review the financial activities of the DLC; (vii) conduct evaluation
of the D L C activities; and (viii) analyze and report results.

4. Learning expectations to be documented inthe pilot

x Financial          x Institutional       Environmental x Other


a) Economic

The project i s expected to demonstrate an economically viable method of delivering training
as compared to the current and expensive practice of sending officials abroad for specialized

                                                  4


training or the import of international trainers. Inaddition, more people should have access to
training in a wider variety of fields leading to a more effective use of government funds.

b) Financial

The D L C in Lilongwe i s expected to meet the operating expenses of the Center (excluding
amortization) up to 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively during the first four years from
generated income, and to ensure at least the financial equilibrium as early as the fifth year o f
operation. The sub-center in Blantyre will be supported by the project during 3 years of
operations and i s expected to meet its operating expenses up to 40% during the first year of
operation (third year of project implementation), 60% the second year, and 80% the fourth
year.

c) Technical

The project will introduce advanced communications technologies to the country. Through
the project's training and virtual discussion opportunities, awareness on information
technology and its value will be enhanced. The new state-of-the-art video-conferencing
facility   will    provide     practical   learning    opportunities    for   local   engineers/IT
technicians/instructors on its operations, maintenance, and installation.

d) Institutional

The success o f the LIL relies upon building the institutional capacity of the D L C to establish
an effective, efficient, relevant, and sustainable center which has impact. In addition,
institutional challenges for the project include building the capacity of project management,
establishing practical means with Government with which to support implementation of the
public service training strategy, establishing an effective and well represented Board
(consisting of private sector, government, civil society representatives) and ensuring
satisfactory working arrangements between OPC, MIM, and the DLC.

e) Participatory Processes

Participation i s required at various levels. This include:


         0  participation o f local and international training providers as users and in
            identifying training available, availing courses, and developing content. Their
            participation i s also important for the evaluation, planning, and review processes;
         0  participation from the client populatiodagencies - civil society, civil service,
            private sector, projects, etc. - as users and in training needs assessments, market
            surveys, and monitoring and evaluation;
            participation of donors as users o f the Center and in fund raising, knowledge
            sharing, and technical assistance.

                                                  5


f) MonitoringandEvaluation

The project has introduced M&Eas an important integratedinstitutional process rather than as
a discrete activity.    It is expected that useful information will be documented on the
usefulness o f the M&E implementation plan and where and how the process has changed to
improve evaluation practice and its value to the project.

5. Triggers for a follow-on operation

A follow-on of this technology, and expansion of the system to include other sites within the
country would bejustified if:


         0  the pilot institution reaches its financial sustainability by the fourth year o f
            operations;
            the surveys show the ability of the D L C to meet with the local demand;
            the surveys show the relevance o f the trainings offered by the GDLN;
            the project monitoring shows the consistency of the GDLNcurriculum and the
            local needs.

6. Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation System

Institutional Strengthening: M&E training for the newly recruited D L C team and the PCU
at MIM will be required to ensure adequate institutional M&E capacity. The DLC will
facilitate the development o f a M&E plan with .wider participation from key stakeholders in
World Bank, other partner organizations.

M&EScope, Objective andUse: A results-based management approach will be utilized and
supported by a practical M&E system that will generate information in the five areas of
performance - efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability and impact. It should enable
an in-depth understanding of key successes and failures and to allow for the use of lessons
learnt and experiences gained at local and global levels. It will also provide a means for
improving service delivery, planning, and allocating resources, assessing beneficiary
responses, and demonstrating results as part of accountability to key stakeholders. The
information generated will answer important evaluation questions at all levels of the project
design hierarchy.

It i s expected that much of the M&E information generation, analyses, and reporting, which
includes critical business information, will have to be conducted by the DLC, particularly at
the operational level. The PCU i s responsible for ensuring that M&E for the project as a
whole, whether it i s implemented by the D L C or the PCU, works successfully and produces
the desired results. The M&E plan will clearly indicate where, how, and when either the PCU
or the D L C i s responsible for a particular task. Most of the D L C activities are routine,
repeated and less costly than the tasks managed by the PCU. Activities managed by the PCU
include the processes involved in M&E training, development of the M&E plan and the
regular review o f the implementationperformance o f the M&Eplan. Consultants will be hired
by the DLC as the procurement responsibilities will be taken over by the DLC after its

establishment. Business plans and quarterly and annual progress reports, as well as annual
audit reports will form the main reporting mechanism for the project.

C. Project Componentsand ImplementationArrangements


1. LILComponents
This LILhas four components :

(i)     Main DLC constructionand developmentinLilongwe: This component will set up
the institutional, physical and human resource requirements for the DLC. I t will be
implemented by the Project Coordination Unit located within MIM.


(ii)    Support of the Main DLC operations: This component will in effect support the
D L C operations and assist in establishing its viability and training program. I t will be
implemented by the DLC.

(iii)   Equipment and Installation of the sub-DLC inBlantyre: This component will
comprise the development o f the sub-DLCfacilities inBlantyre and the support of its
operations duringthe first three years of implementation. It will be implementedby the DLC.


(iv)    Monitoring& Evaluation: This component will be carried out by MIMwith
considerable input and collaboration from the DLC.

The Credit will finance the DLC operations during the first four years of operations on a
decreasing basis. The first year, the Credit will cover 80% of the Center's operating costs. The
second year, it will cover 60%, the third year 40%, and the fourth year 20%.

The management staff o f the D L C will elaborate a business-plan which will describe the
management policy of the Center. The business-plan will help the D L C to reach financial
sustainability by the fifth year o f implementation

2. Implementation Arrangements

The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will be located within MIM and will both oversee the
overall implementation o f the project and implement the Parts A and D of the project. The
PCU will be responsible for financial management and procurement for component 1, after
which its role will be to oversee the implementation o f the components 2 and 3 of the project.
The Project Coordinator, supported by an Accountant and Procurement Officer will manage
the PCU's responsibilities. DLC's core responsibility i s to set up and run an effective DLC
that i s self sustaining in consultation with the Board. D L C i s directly responsible for
Components 2 and 3, while working in close collaboration with MIM on Component 4.
Component 4 will be undertaken by MIM in close consultation with the DLC. A Subsidiary
Grant Agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities will be drawn between the Borrower
(GOM) and MIM first, and then between the Borrower (GOM) and the D L C once it i s
created. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) clearly delineating the respective
responsibilities of MIMand the D L C will also be entered into once the D L C i s established.

After its inception, the D L C will ensure the successful performance of the project, consolidate
the annual project accounts, ensure the timely submission of annual audits, process the annual
GOM budget allocation for the project in coordination with the responsible Government
Agency, promote effective linkages with the civil service needs, and for monitoring and
evaluation



a. Procurement

The procurement for the activities identified in Component 1of the Project will be carried out
by the PCUlocated within MIM.Once the DLC i s operational, the procurement responsibility
of the Project will be led by the DLC.

b. Financial Management

Inthe initial stage the Accounting Unitinthe PCU (MIM)will provide financial management
services for Component 1 until the D L C becomes operational. Once it i s established and
operational, the D L C will provide financial management services for the whole project and
will manage the project Special Account.

Financial reporting, analysis and verification of financial transaction through audits will be
undertaken periodically and timely corrective actions taken where weaknesses are identified.

By Component:

Project Component 1      - US$1.65 million
Establishment of the DLC:

Objectives& Institutional Arrangements
The objective of this component i s to set up the DLC's institutional, physical, and human
resource requirements during the first year o f the project and prior to the start up of the DLC's
operations (year 2-5) as described below in Component 2. The Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) located at MIMi s responsible for implementing this component.

Activities
The following activities will commence upon project effectiveness:

(a) Based on a review of needs and experience from DLCs inother countries, the Center will
be designed and constructed with the following:

        1.      Offices for:(i) a Director; (ii)an Administrative Assistant (with waiting room);
                (iii)Trainingcoordinator;(iv)anAccountant;and(v)anITSpecialist.
                     a
        2.      (i)Videoconference room (30 seats and including two translator booths); (ii)
               Multimedia room (30 seats); (iii)CommunicatiodTechnical room; (iv)

Support to the DLC Operations:

Objective& Financing
This component aims to assist the DLC inestablishing operations andbecoming financially
viable. It includes:

(i)     financing of operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first four years of
         operation;
(ii)    purchase of vehicles to facilitate transport and marketing services;
(iii)   technical assistance for staff training;
(iv)    the establishment of financial management systems and annual audits

 This component will be implementedby the newly established DLC.

Institutional Arrangements DLC Board, DLC management, PCU, MIM
                               -

The D L C will be governed by an independent Board comprising of representatives from
Government, MIM, academic institutions, the private sector and civil society. The Board will
oversee project implementation, through an executive committee. The Board will be charged
with monitoring management and deciding on development policy, approving the annual
business plan and program of activities, assessing the Center's financial statements and
providing recommendations to help it become financially self-sustaining.

 Daily management o f the Center will be entrusted to the Director selected on the basis of
 proven experience in enterprise management or management of a similar educational
 institution.   He/she will be open to innovation and will have a strong capability for
 communication and marketing in the area of service provision. The Director will be assisted
 by a team comprising, but not restricted to: an IT Officer for the management of the
 equipment (electronics - computer specialist), a Training Coordinator to organize the
 courses/workshops and assist the participants, an Accountant, and an Office Assistant.

Upon taking office, the Director will prepare a business plan based on a market study
identifying training needs from the public and private sectors and taking into account the
Capacity BuildingPolicy and the PRSP. The business plan, to be submitted to the Board for
approval and to IDA for advice, will include: market data, budget and sources of financing,
training, and other services to be provided (lectures, seminars, etc), source and programming
o f training, rates for the different types of training and financial projections in the form of
budget, operating account and market strategy.         The business plan will be updated and
approved by the Board on an annual basis. To this effect, the Center will continue to assess
demand, identify and program appropriate training courses, market the services o f the Center,
and increase its visibility inMalawi and abroad.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the host institution and the DLC shouldbe
adopted as soon as the Director i s in post. Lessons from other countries indicate that caution

                                                  18


i s required to ensure that MIM participates in the D L C without inhibiting its growth. Thus,
while MIMwill provide the site and will execute an agreement with the D L C Board on which
it will be represented, MIM can also offer content for training and paying participants to the
DLC. In this regard MIM will be like any other training institution, agency, or private sector
entity that can buy or sell its services to the DLC.

 The DLC Director will be expected to meet the operating expenses of the Center (excluding
 amortization) up to 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively during the first four years from
 generated income, and to ensure financial equilibrium as early as the fifth year of operation.
 Although the Center will be run on a business basis to promote sustainability, it must also
 take into account that it was created as a public good to share development knowledge and
 information.    Therefore, an appropriate balance i s required between the not-for-profit
 intention and the need for viability.

Stakeholders/TrainingInstitutions/Development Partners

The Director will build close relationships with other Malawi-based institutions involved, or
potentially involved in the provision of ICT-facilitated distance learning. An important
objective of the DLC i s to build local institutional capacity to use the GDLN as a means o f
delivering activities from Malawi to other members o f the network.

Duringfirst component implementation members of the donor community will be consulted.
The PCU and the D L C Board will discuss at the earliest stage o f the project the role the
donors could play to help the GDLN to develop and how donors can benefit from the GDLN
as users of the network (global communication tool), as participants in DL sessions, or as
partners of the GDLNProgram.

                                                 19


 Training

 A Memorandum of Understanding between the DLC and GDLNwill be signed. Many of the
 courses offered by the D L C will be sourced from local or international providers. However,
 the Center will have dedicated funds for developing its own contents for new courses. These
 funds should be used to develop both content and distance learning pedagogical skills to
 enable MIM and other Malawi-based institutions and local experts to deliver distance
 learning activities effectively through the network, helping to meet both Malawian and
 network-wide demand for learning activities. The funds also give the D L C flexibility to
 provide programs that are biased towards and related to civil servants' needs as well as an
 opportunity to promote customized, performance related, and demand-driven supply.

Links with the PRSP and the Capacity-BuildingActivities

 The D L C will actively support training required by projects (FIMTAP, MASAF, MAP, etc.)
 and the national capacity building efforts. Efforts will also be made to facilitate training for
 ministries, departments and agencies for specific types and volumes o f training that can be
 provided over a given time. The D L C should make every effort to consider its potential
 support to the Government's PRSP, including the IT component of the PRSP. It should also,
 following a review, link training programs to ongoing capacity building initiatives in the
 public sector, e.g. procurement, budget management, M&E, etc.




The proposed M&E model will make use o f performance indicators (qualitative and
quantitative) to measure the level o f achievement o f set objectives and the efficiency of the
D L C management.       Specifically, the indicators will measure project impacts, outcomes,
outputs and inputs and will also be used later to evaluate the projects success. The M&E
system will help the Director to evaluate the performance o f the business plan and, in
particular, efficiency, effectiveness, relevance, sustainability and impact.

Institutional Arrangements Sub-DLC, host institution
                               -

The sub-DLC will likely be located within the premises of an existing training institution in
Blantyre. Daily management of the Center will be entrusted to a Manager and a small team of
specialists. Upon taking office, the Manager will work closely with the D L C Director and will
manage the sub-DLC basing its marketing on the market study results and the D L C Business
Plan. He/She will identify training needs from all the sectors but will mainly target the private
sector.

The sub-DLC will be organizationally part of the main DLC. The sub-DLC staff will be
appointed by the D L C Director. The D L C will sign a M o U with the host institution in
Blantyre.

Business Planfor Sub-DLC

Upon taking office, the DLC Director with the help of the sub-DLC Manager will prepare a
business plan based on the market study and the business plan of the DLC, identifying
training needs from the public and private sectors. The business plan will mainly focus on the
private sector and will include: market data, budget and sources of financing, training, and
other services to be provided (lectures, seminars, etc), source and programming of training,
rates for the different types of training, the monitoring and evaluation plan (including the
learning expectations), and financial projections in the form of budget, operating account and
market strategy. The business plan will be updated and approved by the D L C Board on an
annual basis. To this effect, the sub-center will continue to assess demand, identify and
program appropriate training courses, market the services o f the Center, and increase its
visibility in the Blantyre region and abroad. The Manager i s expected to meet the operating
expenses of the sub-center (excluding amortization) up to 40%, 60%, 80% respectively
during the first three years from generated income, and to ensure at least the financial
equilibrium as early as the fourth year of operation.

Monitoring and Evaluation:

Objectives& WorkingArrangements

The overall Monitoring and Evaluation component will be carried out by MIM. An
appropriate M&E model will be developed in collaboration with key stakeholders.              The

                                                 21


purpose of the model will be to provide a means for incorporating lessons learnt, improving
service delivery, planning and allocating resources, and demonstrating results as part of
accountability to key stakeholders. Any baseline studies identified during the design of the
M&Eframework will belaunched prior to effectiveness andwith the support of consultants.

The M&E i s expected to assess and provide feedback on, for example: (i)          the needs o f the
target population and the relevance o f the training; (ii) the viability of the Center and the sub-
Center; (iii) progress in promoting a coherent and complimentary training approach among
training institutions, target beneficiaries. and the national training strategy; and (iv) the effects
of the program on performance and the design, planning and management of development
policies. It i s anticipated that the quality and relevance of the curriculum will be monitored
through continuous surveys completed by clients once the D L C (and the sub-DLC) i s
operational.    A situation analysis conducted during preparation may provide some useful
comparative data on improving ranking or performances o f the civil servants. The possibility
of using evaluation & test scores and performance improvement assessments prepared by
MIMwill also be explored.

A market study conducted during component 1 implementation will provide initial
information on the demand and type of training needed. This market study will be repeated at
least once a year. Quarterly and annual performance reports from D L C and sub-DLC will
monitor the Centers' financial viability and overall use o f the two Centers. During project
preparation, this information - i.e. who collects the monitoring information, how, what and
when - has been elaborated on and incorporatedinto the M&Edesign.

                       MALAWI: DevelopmentLearning Center project

OverallAssessment

The Malawi GDLN project will be implemented in a low to medium risk environment. As
outlined in the recently completed CFAA , Malawi Public Expenditure Review and the
Tracking Poverty-Reducing Spending in HIPCs: Country Assessment and Action Plan for
Malawi, there are outstanding expenditure management and reporting issues in Malawi.
There i s poor linkage between policies that govern budget formulation and outputs from the
same, less transparent budget execution methods, inadequate assurance that allocated
resources are used economically and efficiently for the intended purposes and an absence of
private sector participation in the budget management system.

The above said, the Malawi Institute of Management has a good track record of project
implementation in financial management, and a good audit record having successfully
implemented IDP Iand IDP 11. MIM serving as the host institutions will help to ensure the
project's component 1 i s carried out in a medium risk environment, as opposed to a highrisk
environment. There i s no major risk associated with the project from a financial management
capacity assessment conducted except for a significant staff turnover of the staff that are
conversant with World Bank guidelines and procedures from previous operations in the
accounts department.

While a project of this size i s considered small, there i s need to develop a new simple
accounting system to interface with the current MIM accounting system which does not have
project accounting facilities. Such a system should ensure that it captures costs relating to
components o f the project and i s interlinked to both physical and procurement status.

A financial management manual for the project will be developed by effectiveness. This
manual will clearly stipulate the systems to be used, the job descriptions o f staff in the
accounts department, the levels o f internal control, reporting formats of the project at MIMin
the first year, and at the D L C for the rest o f the life o f the project.

Financial laws and regulations in Malawi are adequate and accounting standards generally
meet international standards. In January 2001, Malawi adopted the International accounting
standards promulgated by the International Federation o f Accountants (IFAC) without
amendment as a basis of disclosure and preparation o f accounts o f entities operating in
Malawi. The public sector, however, does not yet utilize these standards. There i s a
professional association of accountants (The Society o f Accountants in Malawi-SOCAM) and
Malawi i s a member of both IFAC and regionally Eastern, Central and Southern Federation of
Accountants (ECSAFA). The accounting profession i s well developed, especially in the
private sector although the number of qualified accountants i s still very small, with the public
sector accounting capacity being very inadequate. The new Public Finance Management Act
i s what governs all matters relating to public sector financial management.

                                               26


FinancialReportingFormats

The project will use traditional disbursement procedures. Consequently, the quarterly
financial monitoring reports will be used solely for purposes of monitoring progress in Project
implementation. The reports will include statement showing for the period and cumulatively
cash receipts by sources and expenditures by main expenditure classification, supporting
schedules comparing actual and planned expenditures. The expenditures being reported on
should follow a chart o f accounts. The specific format - form and content of the reports has
been agreed upon during negotiations.

Malawi moved to program budget classification from fiscal year 2001/2002. The budgets are
consolidated by the Ministry o f Finance and approved by Parliament. The Principal Secretary
for each ministry, who i s the controlling officer, i s responsible for executing the budget.
External audit for all government institutions i s required by statute. Though very weak, each
ministry has an internal audit function which checks compliance with prescribed systems.

Action Plan to Zncrease Capacityfor Financial Management

It has been agreed that supervision frequency will be increased from the standard two
missions to three times per annum for the DLC. In addition the PCU at MIM and then the
D L C subsequently, will ensure:

        Hiringof a qualified financial management specialist acceptable to IDA-This will be
        done before effectiveness date
        Financial management training for accounting staff-Before effectiveness
        Updating the Accounting Manual on a regular basis-Continuous
    e   Conducting, jointly with the World Bank, a one year review of financial management
        for the DLC-to be done in September 2005
    e   Advertisement for the posts of project Accountant and project procurement officer-By
        Board date.

Budgetary and Accounting Systems

Guidance for budgeting of GOM entities i s currently governed by the Finance and Audit Act
Chapter 37:Ol assisted by Treasury circulars.        The Act stipulates accounting and audit
requirements from government entities and government managed projects in general. The
instructions define responsibilities and level of authority within the Ministry. The Treasury
Instructions and circulars require all Government ministries to submit expenditure returns at
the end of each month outlining expenditures incurred during the month, commitments made
and cash balances in their holding accounts at the Reserve Bank at the end of such months.
The project will follow a blend of instructions emanating from the newly designed system and
instructions from government.

                                              21


Counterpart Contribution and StandardDisbursement Percentage

Counterpart funds contribution has been a problem in the Malawi portfolio in the past, but the
GDLN was included in the FY04 budget and it is expected that counterpart funds will be
made available in a timely fashion. The counterpart funds will be transferred through the
Ministry of Finance to the appropriate account within a timely fashion following each budget
approval cycle. The standard disbursement percentage categories for consultant services have
been concluded in Malawi, with foreign consultancy expenditures be financed out o f IDA
funds at 100%and local expenditures at 80%. Percentages for other categories relevant inthis
project have also been concluded.

Audit Arrangements

Audit of Public Enterprises which includes Government projects i s the responsibility of the
National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO uses International Organization of Supreme Audit
Institutions (INTOSAI) standards when carrying out its audits. Annual audits of MIMand the
DLC will be carried out by the NAO or by an external auditor suitable to the World Bank.
The Terms of Reference for the annual audit of the project will be agreed upon and will be
included in the Project Implementation Manual and will ensure that the audit will assess
whether: a) the information i s fairly presented for the specified period and cumulatively for
the period with regard to project accounts and statement o f sources and applications o f funds;
and b) reported disbursements were made in accordance with the Development Credit
Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document.

Based on the change in the World Bank policy, the World Bank will accept a single audit
opinion on the annual financial statements for this project instead of requiring separate
opinions on statements o f expenditure and special accounts provided such statements reflect
the transactions and balances associated with such statements o f expenditure and special
accounts. Bank staff will not be required to undertake SOE reviews on projects where the
audit scope, auditor quality, and audit report are considered acceptable. However, the Bank
will retain the right to conduct SOEreviews.

SpecialAccount and Flow of Funds

Funds will be withdrawn from the Credit account using form 1903. Once drawn, such funds
will be deposited in a Special Account to be opened in a local commercial bank or an offshore
bank usually CitiBank. These funds will then be routed through the Reserve Bank of Malawi.
Upon receipt and notification of this event, a Credit Ceiling Authority (CCA) will be issued
by the Accountant General. This authority allows the project to issue checks up to the amount
of the ceiling as the dollar cash amounts received from the off shore account are not
transferred to the local operational bank account of projects to avoid creating excess liquidity
inthe economy.

The project will have one Special Account (SA) which will be opened through a commercial
bank. This account will be managed by the PCU at MIM during the implementation of
component 1.Once the D L C i s operational, and although there will be a sub D L C inBlantyre,

all payments from the project will be done by the main D L C in Lilongwe. The Special
Account will be managed by the DLC. All requisite disbursement documentation whether
relating to reimbursement through statements of expenditures, direct payments, special
account replenishments, or special commitments documentation will be initiated and kept by
the PCU first and the DLC once it i s operational. IDA will be informed o f the account opened
in the commercial bank and will deposit funds with the account once the project is effective.
The size o f the Special Account will be US$ 250,000.

In the first year, withdrawal application for reimbursement, direct payment instructions, and
other disbursement requests will originate from the office of the PCU and be endorsed by the
Ministry o f Finance's Claims Unit to the World Bank. Payment instructions direct to
suppliers will be sent through the same route through commercial banks as pursuant to World
Bank instructions.

Upon review and approval of submitted withdrawal applications, or payment instructions, the
World Bank's Treasury department will pay credit funds being reimbursed into the project's
Special Account at a commercial bank. Such funds will then be transferred from the Special
Account. The bank where the project account i s maintained shall submit a letter of comfort
on Bank funds from its headquarters to the World Bank.

Upon receipt of such funds by the commercial bank from the World Bank through the Special
Account, the bank shall immediately notify the Ministry of Finance about the receipt. The
Ministry of Finance shall immediately issue a note called Credit Ceiling Authority (CCA) to
the project's bank totaling the sum received. The purpose of the note i s to inform the local
commercial bank that the project i s allowed for the period to issue out checks not exceeding
the amount advised-pending receipt o f some more funds which would necessitate issuance of
another credit limit increasing the limit for expenditure for the project.

Payments paid through the local account and all related documentation will be maintainedby
the PCU during the first year of implementation and by the D L C thereafter, for review by
auditors and World Bank implementation support missions. Upon receipt o f the commercial
bank statements, the project's financial accountant shall reconcile the accounts before
submitting the withdrawal application to the Ministry o f Finance for onward transmission
through the commercialbank to the World Bank.

                  Annex 6: ProcurementandDisbursementArrangements

                      MALAWI:DevelopmentLearningCenter project


A. Procurement

Malawi has a new Procurement Law, the Public Procurement Act N o 8 of 2003 which was
passed by Parliament on May 22, 2003 and became effective on August 1, 2003. The law,
which i s modeled on the UNICTRAL Model Law, decentralizes procurement decision
making to Ministries, Departments and Parastatals and creates the Office o f Director of Public
Procurement (DoPP). However, the Office has not yet been operationalized.

Procurement Guidelines

Procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for
procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (published in 1995 and updated in January
and August 1996 and in September 1997 and January 1999). The Bank's standard bidding
documents for goods and civil works will be used for ICB. Consultant services contracts will
be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Selection of consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (published in January 1997 and updated in September 1997, January 1999 and in
May 2002). The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals will be used and forms of contracts as
needed as well as the Sample Form of Evaluation Report for Selection of Consultants.

ProcurementNotices

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) with pertinent information on estimated contract
opportunities scheduled during the next twelve months will be published in the UN
Development Business (UNDB) after Board approval. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN)
for goods and works contracts can be used and be advertised in a national paper of wide
circulation and the UNDB where appropriate. Individual contracts for consulting firms are
estimated below US$200,000, consequently, the request for expression of interest will be
published only in a national newspaper o f wide circulation. However, if foreign firms express
interest, they will not be excluded from consideration.

ProcurementImplementationArrangements

Procurement services will be carried out by the Project Coordination Unit (located within
MIM) during the first component implementation. Once the DLC is established, all
procurement services and responsibilities will be transferred to the DLC.

Capacity assessment

The capacity of the PCUat MIMwas assessed.The Procurement Specialist of MIMwill carry
out procurement services during the first component implementation. He will be trained
adequately prior to the effectiveness. As all major procurement will be under the first

                                                  31


component, it i s expected that procurement under second component (implemented by DLC)
would be minimal and will involve very small amounts. Mitigating measures to address the
risks include (i) hiring at D L C before component 2 implementation of a procurement
                   the
specialist or the training o f a D L C staff in procurement; (ii)
                                                               training on contract management
and on the new features of Bank procedures related to the hiring of Consultants; (iii)    proper
coverage o f procurement under the D L C Operational Manual. In addition, most procurement
carried out by D L C will be done through shopping procedures. D L C shall have a proper filing
system to ensure that all records are properly maintained for easy retrieval and review by
supervision missions and auditors. A second capacity assessment will be carried out once
D L C i s inplace.

Civil Works

Main civil works are financed under component 1.The procurement and supervision o f works
will be conducted by the PCU. These contracts estimated to cost more than $600,000
equivalent, would be procured under ICB.

The main civil works component under components 2 and 4 will be the maintenance and
improvement of the D L C facilities. Those contracts estimated to cost less than US$30,000,
equivalent, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors invited in writing to bid. The
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion date, a basic form o f agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings
where applicable. The awards will be made to the contractors who offer the lowest price
quotation for the required work, provided they demonstrate they have the experience and
resources to complete the contract successfully.

The main civil works component under component 3 will be the installation o f the sub-center
in Blantyre. These contracts estimated to cost less than US$600,000, equivalent, would be
procured under NCB.

Goods

Most goods will be procured under Component 1. Satellite and informatic equipment will be
procured under ICB with the assistance of ISG department o f the World Bank. Furniture and
other goods necessary to the Center installation will be procured under NCB. Goods financed
under the project's Credit would include a vehicle, additional computers, and equipment for
the implementing agency. Prudent shopping based on written price quotations obtained from
at least three reliable suppliers can be used for small quantities o f goods, provided that these
goods cannot be grouped into packages o f at least US$50,000 equivalent.

Consulting services and Training

The project will finance consultants' services provided by firms to assist the D L C to: (i)
organize workshops and seminars; (ii) assistance in the Monitoring and Evaluation,
                                           provide
and (iii) the key personnel's salaries. Except as otherwise indicated, The Quality- and
          finance

                                                 32


Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) method will be used for consulting assignments carried out by
firms. Services for supervision of works contracts, and the organization of a National
Workshop and other training assignments to be carried out by firms or training institutions,
estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000, may be awarded based on Consultant
Qualifications. For audit contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000,
the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) will be the most appropriate method: the firm with the lowest
price will be selected, provided technical proposals received the minimal score.

Short-lists of consultants for contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
US$lOO,OOO may be comprised entirely of national consultants, if a sufficient number of
qualified firms (at least three) are locally available at competitive cost.

Services for small assignments, studies, organization of or lecturing at seminars, workshops or
study tours which can be carried out by individual consultants including consultants recruited
as DLC key staff, will be selected through comparison o f qualification and experience among
those expressing interest inthe assignment or approached directly.

OperatingCosts

The project will finance the DLC operating costs on a decreasing basis. The credit will cover
80% of the D L C operating costs the first year, 60% the second year, 40% the third year, and
20% the fourth year. The operating costs will include: (i) support staff salary; (ii)
                                                                 the                       the
payment of the satellite bandwidth; (iii) maintenance of the NetworWCommunication
                                              the
equipment; (iv) the purchase of office supply; (v) the maintenance and operation of the
vehicles.

IDA reviews

Goods contracts estimated to cost the equivalent o f US$150,000 or more and works contracts
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more, will be subject to prior review by
IDA.All other contracts will be subject to post review duringsupervision missions and audits.

Consultant services: All contracts with consulting firms exceeding US$lOO,OOO equivalent;
and with individual consultants exceeding US$50,000 equivalent will be subject to prior
review. All other contracts will be subjected to post review. However, this exception for prior
review will not apply to terms o f references of such contracts, to single-source selection of
consultants, amendments o f contracts with firms raising the contract value to US$100,000,
amendments of contracts with individuals raising the contract value to US$50,000, and to
contracts for audits. For training abroad or in the country, the program containing names of
candidates, cost estimates, courses, period of training and institutions selected would be
reviewed by IDA semi-annually. Selective post-review o f contracts awarded below the
threshold levels will apply to about one in five contracts during supervision missions, and
procurement audits.

The PCU will submit to IDA: (a) a Project Operations Manual with a specific section on
procurement detailing (i)    procedures for planning, calling for bids, selecting contractors,
suppliers and consultants, and (b) a Project Implementation Plan. A procurement plan has
been prepared at the appraisal stage and will be updated on a yearly basis and submitted for
IDA'Sreview.

The PCU and DLC will: (a) use the Project Operations Manual and Project Implementation
Plan for Project Implementation; (b) use Bank standard bidding documents for ICB, and
requests for proposal and models o f contracts for consultant services; (c) apply the
procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents; and (d) revise
and submit on a yearly basis to IDA approval an updated Procurement Plan. The Government
has agreed on the principle that the Manual of Procedures will only be modified with prior
IDA approval.
