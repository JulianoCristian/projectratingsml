(see 
Annex 
1) 
Vilniaus 
Energija 
(VE), 
the 
new 
management 
of 
the 
Vilnius District 
Heating 
Company, 
took 
charge 
of 
district 
heat 
supply 
to Vilnius on 
April 
1, 
2002. 
VE 
is 
undertaking 
a 
long-term 
and capital-intensive 
investment 
program 
aimed 
at 
modernizing 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
through 
a 
fundamental 
design 
change 
to 
the 
district 
heating 
network 
and 
introduction 
of 
new 
equipment. VE's investments 
will 
be 
made, 
first 
and 
foremost, 
in 
substation 
network 
decentralization 
designed 
to reduce 
losses 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
district 
heat 
supply. 
Moreover, 
VE 
would 
like 
to 
become 
part 
of 
the 
emerging 
energy 
efficiency market 
by 
launching 
a 
new 
activity 
directly 
at 
the customer's 
level 
- 
an 
apartment-level 
demand-side management 
(AL 
DSM) 
program. 
This includes 
the 
introduction 
of: 
(a) 
thermostatically 
controlled radiator 
valves 
enabling automatic 
and 
consumer-controlled 
use 
of 
heat, 
and 
(b) 
electronic 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
on room 
radiators enabling consumption-based 
billing 
of 
apartments 
for 
heat. 
The 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
(VCM) 
has 
expressed 
a 
strong interest 
in 
implementing 
building-envelope 
improvements 
of 
the 
residential housing stock 
of 
the 
City. 
In 
combination with 
VE's 
energy 
efficiency 
program 
for 
the 
heating 
system, 
VCM's initiative 
allows 
to 
implement 
a 
comprehensive 
heat 
demand management 
program 
in 
the 
City 
of 
Vilnius. 
The 
GEF 
Heat 
Demand 
Management 
Proiect 
would 
support 
and supplement 
the 
programs 
pursued 
by 
both 
VE 
and 
VCM. 
Under 
the 
Project, 
the 
GEF 
would 
contribute 
US$6.5 
million 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
broader 
and 
more 
sustainable 
Energy 
Conservation 
Program 
(ECP) 
for 
the 
City 
to 
support 
demand-side energy 
efficiency 
in 
residential buildings 
connected 
to 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
and 
engage 
VE 
and 
VCM 
in 
the development 
of 
an 
energy 
efficiency 
market. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
Project 
is 
to 
reduce 
the emissions 
of 
greenhouse 
gases 
from 
the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating 
System 
through reducing 
the 
barriers 
to, and 
implementing, 
financially 
sustainable 
and 
replicable 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
in 
the 
residential 
sector 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
City. 
This 
would 
be 
achieved 
by: 
co-financing 
VEs 
demand 
management 
program 
which would 
demonstrate 
the 
benefits 
of 
automatic 
and consumer-controlled 
use 
of 
heat 
in 
homes 
and 
consumption-based 
billing 
at the 
apartment 
level; 
limited 
grant 
(or capital 
subsidy) 
financing 
from 
the 
GEF 
would 
cover 
the 
cost 
of 
the downpayments 
(connection 
fees) 
for 
AL 
DSM 
equipment 
- 
particularly, 
for low-income 
customers. 
creating 
a 
commercially 
sustainable 
(revolving) 
financial 
facility 
- 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
- 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
investments aimed 
at 
reducing 
heat 
losses 
from 
the 
City's 
housing 
stock; 
the 
facility 
would 
provide both financing 
and 
technical 
assistance 
for 
such 
investments, 
mobilizing 
additional 
financing 
from 
commercial 
sources 
as 
appropriate. 
implementing monitoring, 
evaluation, 
and 
information 
dissemination 
activities 
aimed 
at 
facilitating 
the 
replication 
of 
the 
Project's 
experience. 
It 
is 
expected that the 
Project 
would 
enable 
VE 
to compete more effectively 
in 
the 
heating 
market, 
supporting 
the development 
of 
heat 
supply 
at 
least cost 
while improving 
customer satisfaction. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Project 
would 
promote broader 
and 
deeper 
penetration 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
markets, 
address 
the barriers 
to 
sustainability 
in 
energy 
conservation 
and 
test 
the 
possibilities 
for 
achieving the 
benefits 
of 
energy 
conservation 
in 
the 
residential 
sector 
on 
a 
financially 
sustainable 
basis.

Key 
performance 
indicators: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
performance 
monitoring 
indicators for 
the 
Project 
need 
to 
serve 
the 
purpose 
of 
quantifying 
the 
energy 
savings 
and 
associated 
GHG 
savings. 
However, 
due 
to 
the 
methodological 
complexity 
of 
direct 
monitoring 
of 
these 
outcomes, 
certain 
auxiliary 
indicators 
would 
have 
to 
be 
relied 
upon 
such 
as 
heat 
consumption 
per 
square 
meter 
of 
residential 
floor 
area, 
and 
the 
level 
of 
penetration 
of

technology 
(building-level 
substations, 
AL 
DSM 
devices such 
as 
heat

etc.) 
over time. 
The

and 
per 
GJ 
of

the 
end-users) 
will be 
monitored 
on 
an 
annual 
basis 
as 
a broad 
indicator 
of 
evolving 
trends 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
district

system, 
part 
of 
which 
should 
be 
attributable 
to 
the 
Project. 
The performance 
of 
the 
VCM-implemented 
Commercial 
Fund 
component 
would 
be 
measured 
primarily 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
volume 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
investments, rates 
of 
return 
on 
the 
investments 
made, 
and 
sustainability 
of 
the 
fund’s 
operation 
in 
light 
of 
the 
emerging 
repayment 
patterns. 
The 
co-financing 
ratio 
for 
GEF 
funds 
utilized 
would 
measure 
the 
success 
in 
attracting co-financing. 
To 
gauge 
the 
extent 
of 
the 
market transformation impact, 
the trends 
in 
the 
supply 
and 
prices of 
DSM 
equipment and 
services 
in 
Vilnius would 
be 
monitored. The 
success 
of 
the 
demonstration, 
public 
outreach, 
and 
information 
dissemination 
efforts 
would 
be 
assessed 
based 
on 
the 
information 
about 
similar 
projects 
emerging 
elsewhere 
in 
Lithuania 
as 
well 
as 
in 
other countries 
of 
the

Country 
Assistance 
Strategy 
for 
Lithuania 
is 
designed 
to 
deepen the 
reforms 
with 
a view 
to 
EU 
Accession, 
to 
build 
capacity 
in 
municipal 
and 
local 
institutions 
and to support 
the 
social 
areas 
which 
are 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
immediate requirements 
for 
accession. 
This 
Project largely 
focuses 
on 
capacity 
building 
at the 
local 
level 
through commercialization 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
functions 
in 
Vilnius. 
Improving 
the 
financial 
viability 
and decreasing 
the 
cost 
of 
heat supply 
will 
help 
residents 
in 
Vilnius 
by 
decreasing the 
fiscal

la. 
Global Operational 
strategyh'rogram 
objective 
addressed 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
GEF 
Operational Program 
5 
- 
Removal 
of 
Barriers 
to 
Energy 
Efficiency 
and 
Energy Conservation. Section 
5.7 
of 
OP-5 
includes support 
for 
activities 
that 
lead 
to 
sustainable 
results 
that demonstrate 
local, national, 
and 
global 
benefits 
through removal 
of 
barriers. 
Despite 
potentially high 
economic returns, 
measures 
to 
improve 
energy 
efficiency 
in 
the 
district heating 
system and 
in 
the 
housing 
sector 
are 
facing substantial 
challenges. 
Lithuania's 
National 
Communications 
(NCs) 
on 
Climate 
Change 
characterize 
the 
district 
heating 
sector 
as 
an 
area 
of 
focus 
with 
respect 
to 
increasing energy 
efficiency 
and 
bringing down 
emissions 
of 
greenhouse 
gases 
(GHG). 
The NCs 
indicate 
that 
it 
takes 
twice 
as 
much 
energy 
to 
heat 
one 
square 
meter 
of 
residential 
space 
in 
Lithuania 
as 
in 
Denmark. 
The 
main 
reason 
is 
poor 
insulation 
and heat 
losses 
in 
the network, 
as 
well 
as 
lack 
of 
possibility 
for 
consumers 
to 
control 
heating. 
The 
second 
NC 
estimates 
that 
it 
would 
be 
possible to 
save 
up 
to 
45% 
of 
energy 
used 
for 
building 
heating 
if 
buildings 
were 
properly insulated 
and 
modern heating 
systems 
were 
installed. 
The 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
through 
this 
GEF-supported 
Project 
are 
the 
barriers 
that 
stand 
in 
the way 
of 
deeper 
and 
broader 
market 
penetration 
of 
modern 
energy 
efficient 
technology 
(see 
Section E-3). 
The 
market 
transformation 
agenda. 
Both 
the 
VE 
and 
VCM 
components 
will 
have 
their 
role 
in 
transforming the 
Lithuanian 
market 
into 
a 
more 
energy 
efficient 
one. 
VE's 
heat management 
program 
will 
provide 
an 
essential push 
to 
the 
development 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
market 
in 
Lithuania's 
residential 
sector 
through creating more 
buyers and suppliers 
of 
AL 
DSM 
equipment. 
At 
present, 
the 
limited 
size 
of 
the 
market 
is 
a 
barrier 
that 
contributes 
to high 
costs 
of 
the 
equipment. 
In 
addition, 
a 
powerful 
demonstration 
effect 
is 
expected 
from 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
a demand-side management 
program 
in 
the 
district 
heating 
sector, 
with 
the 
heat 
supplier 
itself 
playing 
an 
active 
part 
in 
supporting 
the 
demand-side 
conservation 
measures. 
The 
ECP 
Commercial Fund 
would 
operate 
on 
a 
commercial 
basis 
(although 
the 
need 
for 
targeted 
government support 
to 
the 
poor 
households 
may remain). 
Achieving 
commercial 
viability 
of 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund would 
demonstrate 
its replicability, 
sending 
an 
important signal 
to 
the market. 
To 
the 
extent 
that the 
Fund 
will 
leverage 
co-financing 
from 
commercial 
sources, 
the 
private 
sector 
financiers 
will 
become 
increasingly active participants 
in 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
market. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The 
strategic development 
of 
the 
energy sector 
is 
largely 
driven by 
Lithuania's desire 
to 
accelerate 
its 
EU 
Accession program, 
requiring 
a 
liberalization 
of 
the 
gas 
and 
electricity 
markets. 
Government 
energy 
policy 
in 
the energy 
sector emphasizes 
economic 
pricing, 
the 
fostering 
of 
competitive 
markets and 
the 
commercialization 
of 
energy companies, 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
both 
reliable 
supply and 
economy 
in 
the 
use 
of 
energy 
resources. 
Within 
this 
policy 
envelope, 
the 
district 
heating 
sub-sector 
has 
long 
been a source 
of 
concern 
since 
meeting 
district 
heating 
losses has been 
the 
single largest element 
of 
fiscal 
support 
to 
the energy sector. 
Heat 
prices, 
until 
recently, have 
not 
been cost-based. 
At 
the 
same 
time, the 
costs 
of 
supply have 
been 
unnecessarily 
high 
due 
to 
losses. 
In 
Vilnius, 
as 
much 
as 
28% 
of 
heat 
produced by 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
is 
lost 
in 
the 
heat 
distribution 
network. 
Profit 
taxes 
have been usually 
negligible 
because 
of 
the 
low profitability 
of 
the 
DH 
companies. 
Finally, 
the Government 
has 
to 
bear 
the costs 
of 
supporting 
low-income 
households 
who 
receive 
utility 
subsidies 
if 
district 
heating 
and 
hot 
water 
bills 
-4- 
Page  9
exceed 
25% 
and 
5%, 
respectively, 
of 
household income.

Background 
of 
the 
District 
Heating 
Service 
in 
Vilnius 
us, 
which 
is 
Lithuania's 
capital 
and largest 
city, 
has 
a 
population 
of 
579,000,  and 
a 
residential 
housing stock 
of 
dings, 
of 
which 
85% 
are 
supplied 
with 
heat 
by 
the 
district 
heating 
system. 
The 
average 
year-round 
mperature 
is 
6.4 
degrees 
Celsius, 
making 
heat supply 
an 
essential service. 
Energy 
consumption 
for 
purposes 
is 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
western 
countries 
with 
similar 
climates 
due 
to 
the 
relatively poor condition 
of 
nstruction 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
network 
in 
Vilnius 
started 
in 
the 
mid-l950s, 
with 
most 
of 
the 
system 
ion 
taking 
place 
in 
the 1965-1988 period. 
Because 
of 
the general economic 
circumstances, 
expansion 
was 
ted 
in 
1989 
and 
maintenance 
has 
been 
limited. 
There 
are 
about 
460 
km 
of 
pipeline 
in 
the existing 
system, 
most 
of 
ch 
is 
between 
20 
and 
35 
years 
old, 
but 
is 
reasonably 
well 
maintained. 
Corrosion 
is 
relatively 
low 
due 
to 
good 
er 
quality, 
The 
failure 
rate per 
km 
of 
pipeline 
is 
high 
by 
Western 
European 
standards, 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
age 
of 
at demand 
of 
the 
city 
was 
2,471 
GWh 
in 
1999, 
with 
a 
peak 
demand 
of 
1,130 
MW. 
This 
demand 
was 
met 
by 
a 
bination 
of 
Combined 
Heat 
and 
Power 
Plants 
(CHPs) 
and 
Heat 
only Boilers 
(HOBs) operating 
predominantly 
or 
ral 
gas. 
The 
city 
has 
two 
combined 
heat and 
power 
plants, 
CHP-2 
and CHP-3. 
CHP-2 
was 
built 
in 
the 
1950s 
an 
electric capacity 
of 
24 
MW 
and a 
thermal capacity 
of 
960 
MW. 
CHP-3 
was 
built 
in 
the mid-1980s 
and has 
st-cost source 
of 
energy 
as 
it 
supplies 
electricity 
to 
the 
grid 
and 
heat 
to 
the 
district 
heating 
network. 
Five 
HOBs 
currently 
in 
operation 
in 
Vilnius. 
Two 
of 
these 
HOBs 
service 
isolated 
loads 
in 
the outskirts 
of 
Vilnius. 
The 
aining 
three 
HOBs 
have 
a 
thermal supply capacity 
of 
624 
MW. 
an 
electric capacity 
of 
360 
MW 
and 
thermal 
capacity 
of 
570 
MW. 
During 
the heating 
season, 
CHP-3 
is 
the 
are 
two 
types 
of 
consumer 
connections 
to 
district 
heating: 
block 
(or 
group) 
substations 
and 
building-level 
tions, 
of 
which 
there 
are 
161 
and 
2,311, 
respectively. 
The 
block 
substations, 
in 
turn, 
supply 
2,513 
building 
ations, 
for 
a 
total 
of 
4,824. 
Block 
substations 
provide 
heat 
to 
roughly 60% 
of 
district 
heat 
consumers. 
The 
40% 
are 
using 
heat 
from 
substations 
in 
their 
buildings; 
these 
substations have 
an 
average 
age 
of 
22 
years. 
The 
ntrol 
valves 
in 
these 
substations 
are 
manually 
operated. 
One 
of 
the legacies 
of 
the supply-oriented 
system 
of 
the 
st 
is 
the 
production-controlled operation 
based 
on 
constant 
flow 
of 
water through the pipes, 
with 
the supplier 
anging 
the 
water temperature 
in 
response 
to 
weather conditions. 
This 
design 
means 
that 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
not directly 
respond 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the customer. Replacing most 
of 
the group 
substations 
with building-leve 
stations 
with 
demand-side temperature 
control 
and 
converting 
the 
system 
from 
constant 
to 
variable 
flow 
is 
nsidered the best 
solution 
to 
this problem. 
ent 
years, 
the former 
management 
of 
the 
Vilnius District 
Heating 
Company 
(VDHC) 
sought support 
from 
the 
for 
the replacement 
of 
block 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations 
(BLS). Under 
a recent 
VDHC 
Municipality 
approved 
a 
raise 
in 
the 
fixed 
cost component 
of 
the 
heat 
tariff 
to 
cover 
VDHC's 
losses 
in 
hot 
water network. 
This 
increase resulted 
in 
a 
net 
increase 
in 
the heating 
bill 
for 
about 
60% 
of 
the 
DH 
customers 
currently 
served 
from 
block 
Substations). 
With 
the 
introduction 
of 
BLS, 
the 
heat 
bill 
1 
be 
based 
on 
the 
full 
cost 
of 
heat 
supply 
incorporating 
the metered amount 
of 
heat 
used 
for 
domestic 
hot 
water 
aration. 
Thus, 
the 
majority 
of 
customers 
risk 
facing 
higher 
utility 
bills, 
unless energy 
efficiency 
measures 
uding 
in 
the apartments) 
are 
implemented. 
Heat 
meters 
at 
the 
building level 
have been 
installed 
in 
virtually 
all 
residential buildings 
by 
1999, 
which 
has 
allowed 
HC 
to 
switch to 
billing 
for 
heat 
based 
on 
metered data 
at 
the 
building 
level. 
Homeowners' Associations 
(HOAs) 
the 
only 
group 
of 
heat 
consumers 
that 
are 
allowed 
to 
self-manage the heat supply 
to 
their 
buildings, however, 
the 
rent 
technology seldom allows 
for 
customer-controlled 
operation. 
For 
the rest 
of 
the 
customers, 
the company 
has 
tained 
heat 
supply contracts 
on 
an 
apartment-by-apartment 
basis. 
At 
the 
apartment 
level, heat 
meters 
are 
ally 
not 
available, and the 
billing 
for 
heat 
is 
based 
on 
the metered heat consumption 
of 
the 
building 
allocated 
to 
apartment 
in 
proportion 
to 
its 
floor 
area.

The 
poor 
financial 
condition 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
companies 
during 
the 
1990s 
resulted 
in 
a 
worsening 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
service 
provided. 
Consumers, 
dissatisfied 
with 
the service 
provided 
by district 
heating 
utilities, 
have 
been 
turning to alternative forms 
of 
heat 
which 
are 
in 
many 
cases 
less 
desirable from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
national 
economy 
and 
the 
environment. 
The 
current 
situation 
in 
Vilnius 
is 
typical 
of 
this 
post-Soviet 
environment. 
During 
the 
late 
1990s 
- 
early 
2OOOs, 
the 
Vilnius District 
Heating 
Company 
(VDHC) 
was 
losing about 
3% 
of 
its 
customer 
base 
per 
year, 
as 
consumers were 
driven 
to 
alternative 
sources 
of 
supply by 
the 
problems 
outlined 
above. 
This 
not only 
caused 
the 
revenue 
base 
to 
contract, but 
also damaged the 
competitiveness 
of 
district 
heating 
which 
relies 
on 
dense 
heating 
loads 
to be cost-effective.  Furthermore, 
the 
corporate 
culture 
tended 
to 
be 
more 
supply 
than 
customer 
focused. 
The 
economic 
and 
environmental 
gains 
to 
be 
achieved 
through 
network modernization 
and 
introduction 
of building-level 
substations 
are 
massive. 
The 
outdated housing stock 
of 
Vilnius 
provides 
opportunities 
for 
similar 
gains 
through 
measures 
such 
as 
better 
insulation, 
introduction 
of 
thermostatic 
valves and 
heat 
meters 
in 
apartments. The 
potentially 
high 
economic 
benefits, however, 
do 
not 
guarantee 
that 
these 
measures 
would 
be 
delivered 
due 
to 
a number 
of 
barriers 
(see 
Section 
E-3). 
To 
achieve 
the 
full 
set 
of 
desired 
improvements 
requires active promotion, attractive financing, 
and 
direct 
incentives 
to 
some 
customers. 
In 
2001, 
the 
Vilnius 
City Municipality (VCM) 
conducted 
a 
tender 
for 
a  15-year 
lease 
of 
VDHC 
to 
a 
private 
operator, 
in 
an 
effort to bring 
the 
company 
to 
profitable 
operation. 
In 
November 
2001, 
the 
French 
company 
Dalkia won 
the 
tender 
for 
the 
lease. 
The 
new management 
of VDHC, 
Vilniaus 
Energija 
(VE), 
owned  by 
Dalkia, 
officially 
took  charge 
of 
VDHC's 
operations 
on 
April 
1, 
2002. 
Under the 
lease 
agreement 
with 
the 
Municipality, 
most 
of 
the 
VDHC 
staff 
has 
been 
transferred 
to 
VE. 
VDHC 
continues 
to 
own 
the 
assets. 
VE's 
overall investment 
program 
The 
main 
components 
of 
VE's 
long-term 
investment 
program 
are: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Rehabilitation 
of 
the 
HOBS; 
0 
0 
Substation 
modernization 
including 
the 
replacement 
of 
all 
block 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations 
in 
residential buildings; 
New 
connections 
and 
network 
development; 
Replacement 
of 
part 
of 
the 
network; 
Construction 
of 
a 
gas 
pipe 
interconnecting CHP-2 and CHP-3; 
The 
rehabilitation 
of 
CHP-3 and the 
district 
heating 
pumping 
station 
at 
CHP-2. 
Moreover, 
as 
already 
noted, 
VE 
would 
like 
to 
become 
part 
of 
the 
emerging energy efficiency 
market 
by 
launching 
a 
new 
activity directly 
at 
the customer's 
level 
- 
an 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Program 
which 
would 
consist 
of 
apartment-level 
demand-side 
management 
(AL 
DSM) 
measures. 
To 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program, 
VE 
has 
created an 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Fund 
(EEF) 
under 
the 
lease 
agreement 
with 
the 
Municipality 
and 
is 
prepared 
to 
contribute 
LTL 
20 
million 
(about 
US 
$6 
million) 
into 
a 
GEF-supported 
energy 
efficiency program 
and 
to 
pursue 
a 
further 
expansion 
of 
the 
program 
if 
the 
initial 
phase 
proves 
successful.

Implementation 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Climate 
Change Convention 
Lithuania 
ratified 
the 
UNFCCC 
on 
March 
24, 
1995, 
signed 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol 
of 
the UNFCCC 
on 
21 
September 
1998 
and 
ratified 
it 
on 
January 
3, 
2003. 
Under 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol, 
the 
three 
Baltic 
states 
are 
obliged 
to reduce 
their 
GHG 
emissions 
by 
8% 
from 
the 1990 
level. 
Lithuania 
has 
been 
assisted 
by 
international 
experts 
in 
developing a 
National 
Implementation 
Strategy 
for 
the 
Climate 
Change 
Convention. 
Among 
other 
multilateral 
agencies, 
UNDP 
is 
actively 
promoting 
sustainable development 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
has 
a US$264,600 renewable 
(wind) 
energy 
project 
for 
the 
Baltic region. 
However, 
UNDP 
is 
much 
less 
involved 
in 
the 
area 
of 
energy 
efficiency. 
Lithuania 
is 
one 
of 
the 
five 
countries 
participating 
in 
the 
GEF-supported regional 
project 
entitled 
Commercializing 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Finance 
(CEEF), 
which 
is 
implemented 
by 
the 
IFC. 
CEEF 
provides 
partial 
risk 
guarantees 
for 
financial 
intermediaries 
(FIs) 
financing 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
in 
several sectors. 
Eligible 
transactions 
are 
investments 
in 
projects 
and 
equipment 
aimed 
at 
improving 
efficiency 
of 
energy 
use 
in 
buildings, 
industrial 
processes, 
municipal facilities 
and 
other 
energy end-use 
applications 
(e.g., 
lighting, boiler 
and 
cogeneration 
systems, 
energy 
management 
control 
systems, 
efficient 
and 
variable 
speed 
drive 
motors, 
power factor correction, 
waste heat 
recovery, 
etc). 
The 
Lithuanian 
residential 
sector 
is 
presently problematic 
for 
CEEF 
due 
to 
unfavorable 
regulatory 
framework and 
lack 
of 
guidelines 
which 
would 
facilitate 
rapid 
decision-making 
by 
cooperative 
owners 
as 
well 
as 
provide clear 
collateral security 
to 
enable 
borrowing. 
Thus, 
CEEF 
is 
not anticipating 
commercial 
loans 
to 
homeowners 
to 
emerge 
in 
the 
Lithuanian 
market 
until: 
1) 
procedural 
law 
enables homeownsers' 
associations 
(HOAs) 
to 
make 
decisions 
with 
a workable 
majority 
of 
flat 
owners, 
and 
2) 
the associations 
are 
empowered 
to 
commit 
common 
property 
and 
establish obligations 
for 
the 
association 
as 
a whole 
as 
security 
in 
loan 
agreements. 
These 
regulatory 
issues 
are 
being 
addressed 
by 
the 
Bank 
through 
policy 
dialogue 
with 
the Government 
- 
particularly, through 
the 
Housing 
Strategy 
(National 
Strategy 
for 
Sustainable 
Housing), 
which 
is 
currently 
under discussion between the 
Lithuanian 
Government 
and the 
World 
Bank.

Increasing 
Energy 
Efficiency 
of 
District Heating 
Lithuania 
has 
virtually 
no 
primary 
energy 
resources, 
apart 
from 
wood, and 
thus 
relies 
heavily 
on 
imports 
of 
oil 
and 
gas 
from 
Russia 
for 
its 
energy 
needs. 
Although 
commercial 
energy 
use 
has 
decreased 
nearly 
50% 
during 
the 
1990s, 
the 
GDP 
(based 
on

per 
unit 
of 
energy

in 
the 
Lithuanian

remains 
low 
at $2.6/kgoe, 
which 
is 
40% 
of 
the 
average 
for 
EU 
countries 
and 60% 
of 
the

in 
the economy 
as 
well 
as 
sustained 
economic 
growth. 
However, 
a 
more 
immediate 
impact 
can 
be 
established by 
focused energy 
efficiency 
measures. 
A clear candidate 
for 
this 
approach 
is 
finding 
ways 
to 
reduce the energy 
required 
to 
heat 
buildings, 
including 
the 
introduction 
of 
building-level 
substations 
(BLS), 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
(TCV) 
and 
metering 
devices 
such 
as 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
(HCA) 
in 
the 
apartments, 
as 
well 
as 
building 
envelope improvements 
(replacement 
and 
retrofitting 
of 
windows, better 
insulation 
of 
walls 
and 
roofs, 
etc.). 
District 
heating 
systems, 
when 
well 
designed and 
run efficiently, 
can be 
very 
energy-efficient. 
Power 
plants 
have 
efficiencies 
of 
about 
40% when 
used 
just for 
electricity, 
but 
can 
be 
up 
to 
90% 
efficient 
when 
run 
as 
combined 
heat 
and 
power 
(CHP) plants 
in 
district 
heating 
systems. 
District 
heating, 
when 
provided from 
such 
plants, 
is 
economically 
attractive 
in 
locations 
with 
a 
high 
heat 
load 
density.

Typically, 
larger 
cities 
in 
colder climates, 
like 
Vilnius, 
are 
ideally 
suited 
for 
district 
heating. However, 
the 
Vilnius 
DH 
system 
has 
been 
losing 
its 
customers 
to 
suppliers 
of 
other forms 
of 
heat 
such 
as 
building-level 
gas 
boilers 
because 
the 
service 
has 
been 
so 
poor 
in 
the past. 
The 
GEF-supported Energy Conservation Program 
will 
help 
the 
district 
heat 
supplier 
to 
regain 
and 
consolidate 
its 
customer 
base 
and 
will

fundamental 
design

more attractive. Simultaneously, 
VE 
is 
reducing 
potential 
resistance 
of 
the 
customers 
to 
the implementation 
of 
its 
substation replacement program. 
This 
resistance, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
decentralized structure 
of 
ownership 
and 
decision-making, 
lead 
to 
high 
transaction costs 
of 
obtaining 
the 
agreement 
to 
implement 
the 
needed 
investments. The 
Project 
addresses 
these 
barriers 
through creating a 
collaborative 
engagement 
of 
public 
authorities 
from 
the 
Municipality 
and 
private participants 
in 
the 
market 
working 
together 
to promote 
the 
heat 
demand management program. 
By 
utilizing 
the 
means 
of 
the 
subsidy 
fund 
of 
the 
ECP, 
the 
Project 
enables 
all 
customers 
to 
afford 
the 
"first-cost" 
associated 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
TCVs 
and 
HCAs. 
Otherwise, many 
low-income 
consumers 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
this 
initial 
cost 
of 
equipment 
that can 
make 
the 
whole 
system operate 
more 
efficiently. 
By 
setting up a 
financial facility to 
support 
building-envelope 
improvements 
and 
other 
DSM 
investments 
by 
the 
homeowners, 
the 
Municipality 
addresses 
such 
a 
barrier 
as 
lack 
of 
commercial credit for 
energy 
efficiency 
in 
the 
residential 
sector. 
The 
lack 
of 
commercial credit 
to 
the 
sector 
is 
in 
part 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
collateral 
against 
the 
risk 
of 
default. The 
Commercial 
Fund 
Manager 
selected 
by 
the 
Municipality 
will 
be 
asked 
to

with 
limited 
collateral 
requirements.

The 
Substation 
Modernization 
Component 
Substation 
Modernization 
(Component 
A) 
- 
US$26.1 
million. 
This 
component 
of 
VE's investment 
program consists 
of 
substation 
modernization 
including 
the 
replacement 
of 
all block 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations 
in 
residential buildings. 
VE 
plans 
to install 
2,286 
building-level 
substations 
(most 
of 
them 
over 
the 
next 
four 
or 
five 
years) 
in 
buildings currently 
served 
from 
block 
substations. 
The 
implementation 
of 
this 
component 
is 
of 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
DH 
system 
into 
a modern, 
customer 
friendly, 
and energy 
efficient 
system. 
This 
is 
also 
an 
essential technical 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
demand-side management 
measures 
at 
the 
apartment and 
building 
level 
and 
thus 
ties 
in 
most 
closely 
with 
the 
GEF-supported 
components. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
components 
of 
VE's 
investment 
program 
(such 
as 
rehabilitation 
of 
heat 
generation 
facilities 
and

Energv Conservation Program 
Apartment-Level 
Demand-Side 
Management 
(AL DSM) 
component 
- 
US$ 
10 
million 
(Component 
B) 
would 
be 
a 5-year program covering 
some 
500-600 
apartment 
buildings 
in 
Vilnius, 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
expanding 
the 
program 
to 
another 
similar 
number 
of 
buildings 
in 
the 
following 
years. 
The 
AL 
DSM 
investments 
would 
include 
the 
supply 
and 
installation 
services 
for 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
(TCV) 
and heat 
cost 
allocators 
(HCA) on 
room 
radiators, remote 
readers 
for 
hot 
water 
meters, 
and 
works 
for balancing the heat 
flow 
in 
the 
risers connecting 
the 
substation 
to 
the 
radiators. 
These 
measures 
will 
allow 
VE 
to introduce 
billing 
based 
on 
the 
actual 
heat 
consumption 
by 
apartment. 
Thus, 
the 
incentives 
for 
the 
residents 
to 
conserve heat 
would 
be 
substantially 
enhanced. 
However, 
the 
potential 
level 
of 
acceptance 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
installation 
program 
by 
the 
Vilnius 
residents 
is 
uncertain. 
To 
increase 
the 
chances 
of 
successful market penetration, 
the 
GEF 
will 
participate 
in 
this 
component 
by 
financing 
a 
$2.5 
million 
"subsidy 
fund" 
(to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
of 
$1.25 
million 
each, 
the second tranche 
being 
contingent 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
co-financing for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
program 
by 
VE). 
The 
subsidy 
fund 
will 
allow 
VE 
to 
forgive 
the 
low-income 
inhabitants 
of 
the 500-600 
buildings 
all 
or 
most 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
downpayment (connection 
fee) 
on 
the 
AL 
DSM 
equipment, 
thus 
addressing 
the 
barrier 
of 
up-front 
cost 
affordability. 
During 
the 
years 
of 
the 
GEF 
project duration 
(2003-2007), 
the 
co-financing 
by 
VE 
is 
expected to 
equal 
at 
least 
LTL 
20 
million 
(roughly 
$6 
million), 
with 
the homeowners 
contributing 
about 
$2.5 
million 
through 
connection 
fees. 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
- 
US$3 
million 
(Component 
C). 
This 
component 
would 
capitalize 
a 
revolving 
fund 
(run 
by a 
firm 
contracted 
by 
the 
Municipality 
- 
see 
Component 
D) 
through 
$3 
million 
worth 
of 
demand-side 
management 
investments 
in 
2003-2007. 
The 
fund 
would 
operate 
on 
a 
financially 
sustainable 
basis and 
would 
be 
used 
for 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
as 
long 
as 
demand 
exists. 
The Municipality 
envisages 
that 
most 
of 
the 
investments 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
building-envelope improvements 
(including 
window 
replacement). 
However, 
the 
final 
decision 
on 
the type 
of 
the investments made 
by 
the 
Commercial 
Fund 
will 
be 
made 
upon 
the 
completion 
of 
the tender 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
fund 
under 
the 
ECP 
Management Contract. The 
intent 
is 
to 
solicit 
the most 
effective 
and 
innovative 
proposals 
(business 
plans) 
from 
the 
firms 
competing 
for 
the 
Contract. 
The 
ECP 
Management Contract 
- 
$0.5 
million 
(Component 
D) 
- 
would 
create 
an 
institutional 
and 
operational 
basis 
for 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
investment 
program 
pursued 
by 
the 
Municipality. 
A 
commercial 
firm 
- 
preferably, 
with 
credentials 
of 
an 
ESCO 
- 
would 
be 
selected 
by 
the 
Vilnius 
Municipality 
through a 
competitive 
tender. 
The 
firm 
would 
implement 
the business 
plan 
that 
it 
will 
have 
developed 
for 
the 
tender, 
including 
the operation 
of 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
in 
a 
financially 
sustainable 
manner 
through 
profitable 
investments 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
in 
the 
residential 
sector. Annex 
13 
contains a 
draft 
TOR 
for 
the 
ECP 
Management Contractor 
(to 
be 
agreed 
upon 
with 
VCM 
by 
the 
time 
of 
presentation 
of 
the 
project 
to 
the 
Board). 
Administration 
of 
ECP 
by 
the 
Municipality 
- 
up 
to 
$0.3 
million 
- 
would 
cover 
some 
of 
the 
costs 
to 
Vilnius 
Municipality 
associated 
with 
the 
management 
of 
ECP during 
the 
five 
years 
of 
GEF 
project 
implementation. 
This allocation 
would 
cover 
Incremental 
Operating 
Costs 
(US$ 
100,000) 
helping 
VCM 
to 
meet 
the 
expenditures 
for contractual staff, 
office 
supplies, transportation, advertising, 
marketing, 
public 
relations 
and 
other 
public 
outreach efforts, 
as 
well 
as 
training for financial 
staff. 
In 
addition, 
the 
costs 
of 
financial audits 
of 
the 
GEF 
project 
accounts 
will 
be covered 
by 
a 
consultant 
services 
allocation 
of 
$100,000, and 
an 
allowance 
of 
$100,000 
for individual 
consultants 
will 
be 
made.

Monitoring 
& 
Evaluation 
of 
Global Environmental 
Benefits 
and Information 
Dissemination 
for 
Replication 
- 
$0.2 
million. 
The 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the achievement 
of 
the 
global 
environmental 
objective would 
focus 
on 
quantifying 
the 
GHG 
savings 
associated 
with 
energy savings 
and the 
performance 
of 
ECP. 
The 
M&E 
would 
include 
a 
mid-term review 
(planned 
for 
June 
2006), 
which 
would 
place 
a 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
ECP 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
GHG 
reduction 
impact 
as 
well 
as 
market penetration 
and 
financial 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Commercial Fund. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
M&E 
of 
GHG 
reductions 
and the 
ECP 
performance, 
this 
component 
would 
include 
information 
dissemination 
activities 
aimed 
to 
realize 
the 
Project's 
replication 
potential 
to 
the 
maximum 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
some 
more 
details). 
2. 
Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by 
the 
project: 
This 
project 
is 
designed to 
support many 
of 
the 
Government's 
national 
objectives 
in 
the energy 
field 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
using 
Vilnius to 
set 
the 
example 
as 
it 
is 
the 
largest 
city 
and 
has 
the 
requisite 
implementation 
capacity.  The 
project 
will 
assist 
the 
Vilnius 
district 
heating 
utility 
to 
make 
the 
transition 
from 
being 
part 
of 
a 
centrally-directed monopoly 
to 
being 
a 
commercial 
provider 
of 
heat 
in 
a 
competitive 
marketplace. 
VE 
is 
expected 
to 
reduce the 
dependence 
of 
the 
heating 
sector 
on 
subsidies and 
become 
a 
profitable operation 
under 
municipal, 
mixed 
or private 
ownership. 
It 
will 
improve 
energy 
efficiency, 
provide 
the 
appropriate 
economic 
incentives 
for 
the 
consumers 
to 
limit 
heat 
consumption, 
and 
reduce 
costs. 
To 
achieve 
these goals, 
the 
project 
would 
build on 
the 
existing 
pricing 
policy 
framework 
and 
introduce 
new incentives 
for 
energy 
conservation. This includes ensuring 
full 
cost 
recovery 
of 
heating and 
hot 
water 
services, 
and removing remaining 
barriers 
to 
billing 
for 
heat 
and 
hot 
water based 
on 
metered 
data. 
The 
project 
will 
seek 
to 
demonstrate 
to 
the 
Government 
(as 
well 
as 
to 
the consumers) the 
effectiveness 
of 
AL 
DSM 
and 
consumption-based 
billing 
at 
the 
apartment 
level. 
One 
of 
the 
demonstrated impacts 
would 
be 
a 
reduced need 
for 
subsidies 
to 
low-income 
people 
to 
afford 
district 
heating. 
While 
the need 
for 
support 
to 
low-income 
households 
would 
probably 
remain, the 
Municipality 
will 
be advised 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
incentives 
for 
energy 
saving, 
eventually increasing the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system, 
and 
benefiting 
both 
the consumer and 
the 
municipal 
budget. 
This 
strategic emphasis 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
subsidy 
restructuring proposals developed 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Lithuanian 
Housing 
Strategy 
(currently 
under 
discussion 
with 
the 
Government). 
The 
initial 
phase 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
component 
by 
VE 
and 
its 
impact on 
the 
energy 
bills 
would 
help 
the 
Municipality 
develop 
a 
further 
plan 
of 
action. 
The 
Municipality 
may 
find 
broader 
introduction 
of 
TCV, 
HCA 
and 
apartment-based 
billing 
preferable 
to 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
existing 
policy of 
compensating 
households 
for 
the 
recurring 
and 
often 
unnecessarily 
high 
costs 
of 
heat 
consumption. 
The 
Municipality might 
then decide 
to 
introduce 
a targeted 
capital 
subsidy 
for 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
(thus 
taking 
over 
the 
limited 
contribution 
by 
the 
GEF 
Subsidy 
Fund), 
or 
perhaps 
mandate 
the 
introduction 
of 
TCV, HCA, 
and 
consumption-based 
billing 
at 
the apartment 
level 
for 
the 
whole 
City 
(following 
the 
example 
of 
Bulgaria).

3. 
Benefits 
and target 
population: 
The 
primary 
project 
benefits 
will 
be 
through 
the 
reduction 
of 
the cost 
of 
supply, 
reduced 
environmental 
impact 
and 
improved 
quality 
of 
supply. 
An 
improvement 
in 
the 
financial 
viability 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
will 
benefit 
both 
the 
Municipality 
(as 
the 
shareholder 
of 
the 
company 
and 
the 
immediate 
provider 
of 
the heat 
subsidies) and 
the 
national Government 
(as 
the 
beneficiary 
of 
increased 
profit 
tax 
revenues 
and 
the ultimate 
provider 
of 
funds 
for 
the heat 
subsidies). 
The 
building-level 
substations and 
apartment-level 
DSM 
measures 
will 
support a 
decrease 
in 
energy 
consumption and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
supply through 
improved 
temperature 
control 
in 
people's 
homes. 
Decreasing 
heat 
supply 
costs 
will 
have 
a 
larger 
impact 
on 
the 
poor than on 
other 
segments 
of 
the 
population 
as 
heat 
costs 
represent a 
disproportionately large component 
of 
their 
income 
(based 
on 
a 
Social 
Assessment 
undertaken 
during project 
design). 
In 
addition, 
the 
poor 
have 
less 
disposable 
income 
available 
to improve 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
of 
their 
apartments, 
resulting 
in 
disproportionately 
high 
heat 
consumption.  Income 
limitations 
also 
restrict 
their 
ability 
to 
switch 
to 
other 
sources 
of 
heat supply 
as 
the 
investment 
costs 
of 
new equipment 
are 
prohibitive. The 
GEF-financed 
components 
will 
address 
the 
demand-side 
management 
measures 
and expand the 
benefits 
of 
energy 
conservation 
into 
low-income 
families, 
where 
ability 
to 
pay 
for 
such 
equipment 
is 
an 
issue despite 
attractive 
economic 
returns. 
The 
GHG 
emission reduction 
from 
the 
Vilnius 
district 
heating 
system 
is 
a 
direct 
global 
environmental 
benefit 
from 
the 
project. 
It 
is 
estimated that this can reach 
about 
1.5 
million 
tons 
of 
C02 
over 
the 
20-year 
life 
cycle 
of 
the 
investments 
made 
under 
the 
project. 
Further 
indirect/downstream 
GHG 
emission 
reductions 
would 
be expected 
due 
to 
the 
demonstration 
and 
replication 
effect 
of 
the project, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
impact 
on 
the 
market prices 
for 
DSM 
equipment 
and 
related 
services. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The implementation responsibility 
for 
each 
component 
is 
specified 
in 
Section C-1. 
Two 
separate 
GEF 
Grant 
Agreements 
will 
govern 
the 
VE-implemented 
and 
VCM-implemented 
parts 
of 
the Project, 
respectively. The 
management 
responsibility for 
the 
VE-implemented 
components 
will 
be 
mainly 
with 
the 
existing staff 
of 
VE. 
The 
VE 
department 
of 
Marketing 
and Business 
Development 
will 
play 
a 
key 
role. 
The 
Municipality, 
on 
the other 
hand, 
will 
use 
the 
assistance 
of 
a 
specially selected ECP 
Management Contractor (Fund Manager) 
to 
operate 
the 
Commercial 
Fund 
and 
some 
consulting 
services 
to 
implement 
the 
analytical 
and 
supervisory 
components 
of 
the 
ECP. 
The 
institutional/technical 
assistance 
components 
would 
have a 
total 
budget 
of 
$1 
.O 
million. 
The 
remaining 
$5.5 
million, 
earmarked 
for 
energy 
conservation 
investments, 
will 
be 
split 
between 
a 
$3 
million 
commercial 
fund 
and a 
$2.5 
million 
subsidy 
fund, 
managed 
by 
VCM 
and 
VE, respectively. 
The commercial 
fund 
- 
a 
revolving 
facility 
supported 
by 
repayments 
from 
customers 
for 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
(the 
specific operational 
modalities 
of 
the 
facility 
would be defined 
in 
the 
business 
plan 
of 
the 
ECP 
Management 
Contractor) 
- 
would 
be 
supported through 
the 
purchase 
and 
installation 
of 
a 
$3 
million 
worth 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
equipment 
and 
would 
be 
used 
for 
subsequent 
energy 
efficiency 
investments. 
The 
$2.5 
million 
subsidy 
fund 
would 
be 
used 
as 
an 
incremental grant 
from 
the 
GEF to 
stimulate 
the 
introduction of 
AL 
DSM 
and 
consumption-based 
billing 
at 
the apartment 
level. 
One-half 
of 
the subsidy 
fund 
would 
be used 
as 
a 
contingent 
grant, released 
only 
if 
conditions 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
program 
are 
met 
by 
VE. 
The 
public 
oversight 
and 
decision 
making 
process 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Commercial 
Fund's 
operations 
would 
be conducted 
through 
a 
Management 
Board 
(or 
"ECP Coordination Committee"). 
The 
Board 
- 
12- 
Page  17
would 
include 
representatives 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
(Chair), 
VE, 
and 
other reputable 
representatives 
of 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
business 
as 
appropriate. The 
Board 
would 
hire, under 
a 
performance contract, 
a 
professional 
Fund 
Manager 
(ECP 
Management Contractor) 
who 
would 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
administering daily 
activity 
of 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
and 
identifying, 
evaluating, 
developing and 
financially 
structuring 
energy 
efficiency projects 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
the Board. 
The 
Fund 
Manager 
would 
assure 
a 
sound 
project 
portfolio 
for 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
in 
terms 
of 
risks 
and 
returns. The 
qualified 
Manager 
would 
be 
selected 
competitively. 
More 
details 
on 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
both 
the 
VCM-implemented part 
and 
the 
VE-implemented 
part are available 
in 
Annex 
2. 
Financing 
Plan 
The 
total project 
cost 
is 
estimated 
at 
$40.1 
million 
- 
including 
the 
substation 
modernization 
component 
but excluding 
the 
repayments 
from 
the homeowners 
for 
the 
investments financed 
from 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund. 
VE 
is 
expected 
to 
fund 
about 
$33.6 
million 
of 
project 
costs 
from 
its 
internal 
resources, 
commercial 
bank borrowings, 
and cost 
sharing 
contributions 
from 
the 
homeowners. 
The 
GEF 
is 
requested 
to 
provide 
$6.5 
million. 
Of 
this, 
$5.5 
million 
would 
finance 
heat 
demand 
management 
investments 
through 
the 
Energy Conservation 
Program. 
The remaining 
$1 
.O 
million 
would 
finance 
the 
institutional 
components 
including 
M&E 
of 
global 
environmental benefits, 
information 
dissemination 
directed 
at 
replication, 
the 
ECP Management Contract, and incremental operating 
costs 
of 
ECP 
administration 
by 
the 
Municipality. 
Lending 
Arrangements 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
Energy 
Conservation 
Program. 
The 
proposed 
ECP 
would 
be funded by 
a 
$6.5 
million 
GEF 
grant, 
portions 
of 
which 
($2.5 
million 
and 
$4.0 
million, 
respectively) 
would 
be extended 
to 
VE 
and 
VCM. 
A 
$3 
million 
Commercial 
Fund 
and a 
$2.5 
million 
Subsidy 
Fund 
would 
finance 
energy 
efficiency 
investment 
operations. 
The 
GEF 
would 
capitalize 
the 
Commercial 
Fund 
initially 
(by 
financing 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
investments under 
the 
VCM-implemented 
part 
of 
the 
project), 
but 
the 
long-term 
goal 
of 
the 
fund 
would 
be 
to 
demonstrate a 
sufficient 
rate 
of 
return. 
VCM 
will 
be 
responsible for 
transferring 
GEF 
funds 
to 
the 
appointed 
Fund 
Manager. 
The 
cash 
balance at 
any 
time 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
a 
separate 
bank account and 
identified 
as 
the 
property 
of 
the 
municipally-owned Energy 
Conservation 
Program 
(ECP) 
Revolving 
Fund. 
The 
Subsidy 
Fund 
(or grant 
fund) 
would 
also be 
capitalized 
initially 
by 
GEF 
- 
through 
partial 
grant-financing 
of 
AL 
DSM 
equipment 
- 
to 
help 
VE 
demonstrate 
to 
the 
customers 
and 
to 
the 
Government 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
AL 
DSM 
and consumption-based 
billing 
at the 
apartment 
level 
(see 
Section 
C-2 
above 
for 
the 
policy 
rationale). 
The 
disbursement 
modality 
of 
the 
two 
funds 
would 
include 
disbursement 
categories 
in 
the 
two 
GEF 
Grant 
Agreements, 
from 
which 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
would 
be 
financed 
on 
commercial 
terms 
and 
on 
grant 
terms, 
respectively. 
Supervision, 
Monitoring 
and 
Reporting 
The 
assessment 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Bank 
indicates that 
VE 
is 
a 
company 
capable 
of 
implementing 
its 
component 
of 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
is 
also 
capable 
of 
implementing 
its 
components 
with 
the 
support 
of 
foreign 
and 
local 
consultants. 
Still, 
a 
significant 
supervision effort 
will 
be 
required, 
particularly during 
the 
first 
two 
years 
when procurement, disbursement and financial 
management 
practices 
are 
established. 
It 
is 
expected that 
about 
20 
staff-weeks 
of 
effort 
each 
year 
for 
the 
first two 
years 
and 
about 
15 
staff-weeks 
each 
year 
thereafter 
would 
be 
required 
for 
supervision 
by 
the 
- 
13- 
Page  18
Bank. 
Project 
monitoring would 
rely 
largely 
on 
the 
standard 
financial monitoring 
reports (FMRs) 
designed 
mostly 
to 
reflect the key financial information 
on 
the 
project 
under 
implementation, 
but 
also 
including 
physical 
output 
and 
procurement 
monitoring 
modules. 
The 
Bank 
would 
carry 
out 
a 
mid-term 
review 
of 
the 
project 
planned for 
June, 
2006. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
topics 
covered 
under 
the 
financial 
monitoring 
reports (FMRs), 
the 
mid-term 
review 
would include 
an 
in-depth 
review 
of 
the 
economic 
viability of 
the 
project 
components, 
based 
on 
actual 
costs 
and 
benefits 
achieved 
to 
date, 
and 
of 
the 
overall institutional 
and 
financial 
viability 
of 
the 
Project. 
The 
mid-term 
review would place 
a 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
ECP 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
market 
penetration 
and 
financial 
sustainability 
and 
would 
evaluate: 
(i) 
fund 
performance; 
(ii) 
subsidy 
trendsheeds; 
and 
(iii) 
market 
development 
trendsheeds. 
Based 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
mid-term 
review, 
measures 
would 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
the 
efficient 
completion 
of 
the 
project. 
Procurement 
All 
procurement financed 
by 
the 
GEF 
grant 
would 
be 
conducted 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank 
Guidelines for Procurement under 
IBRD 
loans 
and 
IDA 
Credits, 
January 
1995, 
revised 
January 
and 
August 
1996, 
September 
1997 
and 
January 
1999, 
and 
using 
the 
Bank’s 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents. 
Consulting 
services 
would 
be 
procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Guidelines 
for Selection 
and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers, 
January 
1997, 
revised 
September 1997, 
January 
1999, 
and 
May 
2002. 
A 
General 
Procurement 
Notice 
containing 
information 
about 
bidding 
opportunities 
was 
published 
in 
the October 2001 
issue 
of 
Development 
Business 
(No. 
569) 
in 
accordance 
with 
paras 
2.7 
and 
2.8 
of 
IBRD 
Guidelines 
and 
will 
be updated. 
Specific 
Procurement Notices 
will 
also 
be 
published, 
as 
appropriate, 
in 
Lithuanian 
newspapers 
of 
national circulation. 
The 
AL 
DSM 
Component 
WE-implemented) 
The procurement under VE-implemented component 
is 
represented 
by 
supply and 
installation 
of 
equipment for 
demand-side energy 
efficiency 
measures 
in 
the 
apartments. 
The 
measures 
cover 
installing 
thermostatic 
valves and cost 
allocators 
on room 
radiators, remote 
readers 
for hot 
water 
meters, and 
water 
flow 
balancing 
of 
the risers connecting 
the 
substation 
to 
the 
radiators. 
The 
procurement would 
be 
done 
by 
VE 
in 
two 
supply 
and 
installation 
packages 
($5 
million 
each). 
The 
GEF 
contribution 
would 
be 
not 
more than 
$2.5 
million 
(of 
which 
$1.25 
million 
would 
be released 
only 
after 
a 
satisfactory mid-term 
review 
). 
The 
VCM-implemented 
Components 
The 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
(US$3 
million) would 
require 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
works, 
and 
installation 
services 
for 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements 
in 
buildings. 
These 
investments 
would 
capitalize 
the 
revolving 
fund 
owned 
by 
the 
Municipality 
and operated 
by 
the 
ECP 
Management 
Contractor 
(see 
below). 
Consultants 
Services 
The 
following 
consulting 
services 
will 
be 
procured 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Quality- 
and 
Cost-based 
Selection 
(QCBS). 
- 
14- 
Page  19
The 
ECP 
Management 
Contract 
(US$500,000) 
is 
needed 
to 
assist 
the 
Municipality 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Commercial Fund. 
The Management 
Contractor 
(MC) 
would 
be 
selected 
according 
to 
QCBS 
and 
would 
have 
procurement 
specialists 
familiar 
with 
the 
Bank‘s procurement guidelines. Preferably, 
an 
energy 
service 
company 
(ESCO) 
would 
be 
hired 
to 
work 
as 
the Management 
Contractor. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
of 
Global Environmental 
Benefits 
(US$200,000) 
would 
be 
carried out 
under the 
Municipality’s 
oversight 
to 
focus 
on 
quantifying 
the energy savings and associated 
GHG 
savings 
and 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
ECP. 
Information 
dissemination 
for 
barrier 
removal 
would 
be an 
integral 
element 
of 
this 
component. 
Administration 
of 
ECP 
by 
the Municipality 
(US$300,000). This 
allocation 
would 
cover Incremental 
Operating Costs 
(US$ 
100,000) 
helping 
VCM 
to 
meet 
the expenditures 
for 
contractual staff, 
office 
supplies, 
transportation, advertising, marketing, 
public 
relations 
and 
other 
public 
outreach 
effort, 
as 
well 
as 
training 
for 
financial 
staff. 
In 
addition, 
the 
costs 
of 
financial 
audits 
of 
the 
GEF project 
accounts 
will 
be 
covered 
by 
a consultant 
services 
allocation 
of 
$100,000, 
and 
an 
allowance 
of 
$100,000 
for 
individual 
consultants 
will 
be 
made. 
Financial 
Management 
Arrangements 
Implementing 
entities. 
VE 
and 
VCM 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
of 
their 
respective 
components and 
will 
utilize 
their existing staff 
and 
accounting 
systems, 
albeit 
with 
some 
modifications 
both 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with

based 
upon payment

or 
from 
the 
Bank 
to 
VE 
on 
a reimbursement 
basis 
to 
reimburse 
VE 
for 
eligible 
expenditures. 
VE 
will 
provide 
counterpart 
funds 
from 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Fund. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VCM 
components, 
GEF 
funds 
will 
flow 
from 
the 
Bank, either 
via 
a single Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the basis 
of

or 
by 
direct

on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct

The GEF 
funds for 
the 
ECP Commercial

will 
be 
transferred 
from 
the

Disbursement 
The 
Project 
will 
utilize 
the 
Bank‘s transactional disbursement 
methods 
based 
on 
evidence 
of 
expenditure. 
The so-called 
report-based disbursement 
(or 
disbursement 
based 
on 
expenditure 
forecasts) 
will 
not 
be 
utilized mainly 
due 
to 
the 
difficulties 
in 
ensuring 
reliable 
forecasting 
as 
the 
expenditures under 
the 
Project 
will 
be 
demand-driven.

D. 
Project 
Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
The 
project 
implementation 
structure 
consisting 
of 
two 
Implementing 
Agencies 
(VE 
and 
VCM), 
is 
considered 
optimal 
since 
it 
allows 
to 
implement a 
more 
comprehensive 
energy 
efficiency 
program for 
the 
City. 
E.g., 
VE 
alone 
would not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
provide 
the 
residents 
with 
new 
energy-efficient 
windows 
as 
well 
as 
better 
thermal 
insulation for walls 
("building 
envelope" 
improvements). 
The 
scope 
of 
in-building 
(apartment-level) 
heating 
system 
improvements 
as 
currently 
proposed (see Section 
E-3), 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
new 
BLS, 
is 
considered a 
reasonable 
scope 
of 
investments 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
a 
district 
heating 
company, 
while 
the 
building-level 
improvements should 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
Municipality. 
The 
proposed 
arrangement also gains strength 
from 
both public 
and 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
one 
program 
beneficial 
for 
the 
city. 
The 
rationale 
for 
co-financing the 
AL 
DSM 
program with limited 
GEF 
grant support 
is 
the 
following. 
The 
provision 
of 
capital 
grant support 
to 
the 
consumers 
is 
potentially 
replicable 
without 
resort 
to 
GEF 
Once 
it 
is 
demonstrated that 
demand-side 
improvements can eventually 
benefit 
not only 
the 
consumers, 
who 
will 
be 
increasingly 
willing 
to pay 
for 
these 
improvements, 
but 
the 
DH 
companies 
themselves. 
This 
is 
due 
not only to 
the 
consolidating 
impact 
on 
the 
customer 
base, 
but 
also 
due 
to 
reduced 
losses 
and 
costs 
of 
supply 
- 
especially, 
during 
periods 
of 
peak 
demand. 
Already 
at 
present, 
there 
are 
clear 
signs 
that 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
operator 
(VE) 
appreciates 
the 
benefits 
of 
heat 
demand 
management 
despite 
the 
potential reduction 
in 
heat 
sales. 
With 
modest 
GEF 
co-financing, 
VE 
is 
willing 
to 
finance 
a 
sizable 
heat demand 
management 
program. 
The 
limited 
capital 
subsidy 
for 
connection 
fees 
for 
low-income 
people 
is 
a temporary 
measure 
aiming 
to 
enhance 
penetration 
during the 
crucial first 
phase 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program. 
The 
rationale 
for 
setting 
up 
a 
Commercial 
Fund, 
rather than a 
credit 
guarantee 
facility 
to 
underwrite 
commercial 
bank 
loans, 
is 
as 
follows. 
In 
the 
residential 
sector, 
private 
sector 
financing 
is 
still 
too 
scarce, 
even 
if 
the 
financial 
sector 
is 
robust, 
and even 
if 
there are 
potential profits to 
be 
made 
on 
household 
energy 
savings. 
In 
the 
current 
circumstances, 
an 
energy 
efficiency 
fund 
dedicated 
to 
the 
sector 
is 
an 
appropriate 
response. 
The 
fund 
would 
help 
fill 
the 
financing 
gap 
and 
help 
mobilize 
some 
commercial 
co-financing 
for 
the 
sector. 
A 
guarantee 
facility could 
be 
more 
appropriate 
in 
a 
project 
focusing 
on 
investments 
in 
such 
sectors 
as 
industry, 
where 
commercial 
borrowing 
and 
lending 
is 
already quite 
active. 
Over 
time, 
one 
of 
the 
intended impacts 
of 
ECP 
is 
to 
make 
the 
residential 
sector 
a 
more 
familiar 
territory 
for corrlmercial 
banks 
so 
that instruments 
like 
credit 
guarantees 
can 
be 
effectively 
applied 
here 
as 
well. 
The 
rationale 
for separating the 
Commercial 
Fund 
from 
the Subsidy 
Fund 
of 
the 
ECP 
is 
based 
mostly 
on considerations 
of 
replicability 
and demonstration. 
The 
replication 
potential 
of 
both 
funds 
would 
depend 
on 
their demonstrated performance according 
to 
relevant criteria. 
If 
both 
funds 
prove 
successful, 
the 
replication potential 
is 
large. 
The demonstration 
of 
the 
long-term 
financial 
viability 
of 
the 
Commercial 
Fund could 
be 
a 
powerful 
lesson 
for 
replicating 
the 
same 
type 
of 
investments 
elsewhere. 
The 
possibility 
of 
using 
the 
LTL 
20 
million 
contribution 
from Dalkia 
to 
increase the size 
of 
the 
GEF-supported Commercial 
Fund 
was 
considered. However, 
the 
lease agreement 
between 
the 
VE 
and 
- 
16- 
Page  21
the 
Municipality 
makes 
it 
explicit 
that 
this 
money 
will 
be 
provided 
on 
a grant 
basis 
(although 
co-financing 
by 
homeowners 
is 
acceptable). 
This 
reflects 
the 
Municipality's 
preference 
for 
making 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
more 
affordable 
for 
the 
residents, 
as 
well 
as 
DalludVEs 
appreciation 
of 
the 
fact that 
the 
provision 
of 
these 
funds 
to 
the homeowners 
on 
a 
grant 
basis 
can 
well 
be 
considered 
an 
investment 
in 
its 
customer 
base. 
The 
pay-off 
on 
this 
investment 
will 
be 
through 
VE's 
improved 
competitive 
position 
vis-a-vis 
other 
forms 
of 
heat supply 
such 
as 
autonomous 
gas 
boilers 
and through 
faster 
implementation 
of VEs 
substation 
decentralization program.

mainly 
in 
Sofia 
and 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
GEF 
resources 
will 
not 
be 
used 
to 
cover 
the 
costs 
of 
substation replacements. 
Instead, 
the 
GEF 
contribution to 
the 
AL 
DSM 
component 
would 
facilitate 
the 
introduction 
of 
consumption-based 
billing 
at 
the 
apartment 
level 
and 
thus 
facilitate 
VEs 
program 
of 
substation 
replacements. 
In 
this 
context, 
the 
introduction 
of 
AL 
DSM 
is 
seen 
a 
measure 
to 
reduce a 
key 
barrier 
to 
broader 
introduction 
of 
BLS 
such 
as 
passive resistance 
by 
the homeowners 
to 
VE's 
substation 
replacement 
program 
(see 
Annex 
11 
for 
details). 
The rationale 
for 
publicizing 
the 
project's 
results outside 
Lithuania 
is 
that 
the 
project 
would aim 
at 
creating a 
replicable 
model 
demonstrating 
how 
government 
agencies, 
private 
sector, 
and 
other 
stakeholders 
can 
successfully 
work 
together 
to 
implement 
energy 
efficiency 
investments and 
save 
taxpayer 
money 
by 
lowering 
energy 
use. 
Ultimately, 
awareness 
of 
the 
potential for 
reducing 
heat 
losses 
in 
the 
networks 
and 
in 
the buildings 
is 
expected 
to 
replace 
calls 
for 
new 
generating 
capacity. 
This 
has 
particular 
relevance 
for 
Lithuania 
given 
international 
discussions 
with 
the 
Government 
on 
direct 
and 
indirect 
costs associated 
with 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
plant 
closure, 
but 
also 
for 
other 
ECA 
countries 
where the replacement 
of 
the outdated 
energy 
stock 
is 
imminent.

depth 
of

A 
social 
assessment 
undertaken 
during project 
preparation 
has 
helped 
deal 
with 
this 
issue 
by 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
limitations on affordability. 
As a 
result, 
the

for

has 
been 
lowered 
and 
is 
believed 
to 
be

Another essential 
lesson 
is 
that, 
by 
optimizing 
the 
district 
heating 
cycle 
from production 
to 
consumption, 
considerable 
energy 
savings 
can be 
achieved. 
Data collection 
from 
networks and customer plants 
results 
in 
more 
efficient

for

service 
for 
the 
consumer. 
The 
application 
of 
remote metering integrated 
with 
an 
administrative 
system 
for

is 
a 
powerful 
comprehensive 
approach 
to district 
heating 
which 
represents 
the state-of-the-art 
in 
the 
industry. 
The 
Banks 
Energy 
Efficiency 
and

Pilot 
(EEHP) 
Project 
in 
Lithuania 
was 
very 
helpful 
in 
guiding 
the 
design 
of 
the Energy Conservation 
Program. 
The 
EEHP 
project 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
homeowners 
are 
able and 
willing 
to 
invest 
in 
energy 
retrofitting 
in 
their 
buildings 
if 
provided 
with 
a support 
package 
addressing 
legal, 
institutional, 
technical 
and 
financial 
barriers. However, 
obtaining 
a 
permission 
from 
the 
homeowners 
is 
time-consuming when 
the 
decisions concern 
building-level 
improvements 
since 
this 
must 
be 
taken 
by 
a 
formal 
meeting 
of 
homeowners 
of 
each 
building. 
The 
EEHP 
demonstrated that 
significant 
educational and advisory support 
is 
required 
to 
bring 
homeowners 
to 
the 
decision-makmg 
point. 
VE's 
energy 
efficiency 
program supported through 
ECP 
would 
focus 
on 
apartment-level improvements, 
and 
the decisions 
will 
be 
made 
on 
a 
consumer-by-consumer 
basis. 
The 
Municipality, 
which 
is 
better 
equipped 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
issues 
involved 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
HOAs, 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
building-level 
investments 
under 
the

Commercial 
Fund 
component. 
Valuable 
lessons 
are 
also available 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
Dallua, 
the 
mother 
company 
of 
Vilniaus 
Energija. 
Dalkia 
is 
present 
in 
30 
countries and 
has 
37,000 
employees. 
Its 
business 
is 
to 
provide 
energy 
management 
services 
for 
industry, commercial 
customers, 
and large 
community 
facilities. 
Dalkia 
operates 
heating 
systems 
and 
has 
a 
long 
experience 
with 
Energy Service Companies 
(ESCOs). 
Under 
long-term 
contracts, the 
ESCO 
introduces 
efficiency 
measures 
to 
reduce 
energy 
costs. The 
savings 
are 
shared 
between 
the 
ESCO 
and 
the 
client. 
In 
Poland, 
Dalkia 
has 
taken 
over 
DH 
operations 
in 
several 
- 
18- 
Page  23
towns. 
After 
network 
modernization, 
the 
tariff 
remains 
the 
same, 
and 
savings 
are 
used to 
pay 
back 
the 
investment. 
In 
partnership 
with 
EBRD, 
Dalkia 
International, 
a 
leading 
multinational 
energy company, 
has 
made 
a 
commitment 
of 
€100 
million 
to 
raise 
energy 
efficiency. 
The investment aims 
to 
support 
Dalha's 
work 
in 
Hungary, 
Lithuania, 
Poland, 
Romania 
and 
the 
Slovak Republic, 
and 
to 
help 
it 
expand 
to 
other 
countries 
such 
as 
Bulgaria, Croatia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and Russia. 
Dalkia 
has 
already created 
ESCOs that 
operate 
district 
heating networks 
for municipalities 
and reduce energy 
consumption 
in 
buildings or 
facilities. 
The 
EBRD 
has 
already 
invested 
€50 
million 
in 
projects developed 
by 
Dalha 
over 
the 
past 
five 
years, 
resulting, 
for 
example, 
in 
success 
for 
the 
MSW 
Hospital 
in 
Krakow, 
Poland, 
which 
was 
able 
to 
cut 
its 
energy 
bill 
by 
38 
percent.

it 
is

structured

this 
product  unattractive 
for 
commercial 
banks. 
Other financial products 
could 
be 
more 
effective 
in 
mobilizing 
energy 
efficiency 
investments. 
With 
respect 
to 
individual 
heat 
control 
and 
metering, 
Bulgaria 
offers 
an 
instructive 
example 
of 
the 
role 
that the 
government 
may have 
in 
contributing 
to 
market transformation. 
After 
the 
Bulgarian 
Government 
mandated 
the 
introduction 
of 
individual 
billing 
in 
buildings 
connected 
to 
district 
heating, 
the 
development 
of 
a 
market 
for 
TCVs 
and 
HCAs 
proceeded 
rapidly 
and 
the forces 
of 
competition 
have 
rapidly 
reduced 
the 
market 
price 
of 
this 
equipment. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
and 
recipient 
commitment and 
ownership: 
The 
Vilnius 
City 
administration 
has 
expressed a 
keen interest 
in 
the 
speedy 
implementation 
of 
the 
project, emphasizing 
its 
special 
role 
in 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
City's 
outdated 
housing 
stock and 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
gains 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the process. 
Earlier, 
the 
Mayor 
of 
Vilnius 
initiated critical 
steps 
toward 
fundamental 
re-orientation 
of 
the 
City's 
district 
heating 
utility 
toward commercial 
operation, 
including 
the 
long-term 
lease 
of 
its 
assets 
to 
DalkidVE. 
The 
Mayor 
has 
also 
indicated 
his 
willingness 
to 
support 
the 
privatization 
of 
municipal 
maintenance 
companies, 
which 
would 
increase 
competition 
and 
open 
up 
new 
opportunities for 
the 
commercial 
operators 
including 
the 
emerging energy service 
companies. 
VE 
has 
a strong 
stake 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
GEF 
project 
as 
it 
allows 
to 
take 
its 
own 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Program 
to 
the 
next level. 
The 
start 
of 
implementation 
of 
VE's Energy 
Efficiency 
Program 
was 
announced 
in 
January 
2003, 
so 
the 
company 
is 
under considerable 
time 
pressure 
to 
bring 
the 
GEF 
financing 
on 
stream.

The

of 
Lithuania 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
moving to 
a 
non-borrowing 
relationship 
with

World Bank 
but 
has 
expressed 
a consistent

5. 
Value added 
of 
Bank 
and 
Global 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
primary 
value 
of 
the 
Banks involvement 
to 
date 
has 
been 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
broader 
economic 
reform 
agenda, 
to 
help 
focus 
the 
project 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
issues 
of 
affordability 
and 
financial 
viability 
are 
adequately 
addressed. 
The 
early 
project 
preparation 
effort 
focused on 
improving 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
(particularly 
pricing) 
framework 
and 
enabling 
a 
fair 
competitive 
environment 
among 
energy 
suppliers. 
The 
Bank 
team 
has also 
helped 
the 
Municipality 
to develop 
a 
program 
to 
make 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
financially 
viable 
without 
state 
support. 
VE's investment 
program 
is 
largely 
following 
the 
same 
path 
with 
the 
notable addition 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
component. 
DalkiaNE 
financial 
contribution 
to 
this 
new 
component 
might 
not 
have 
materialized 
without 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
Bank 
in 
the 
review 
of 
VE's 
lease 
agreement 
with 
the 
Municipality. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
Bank, 
as 
an 
Implementing Agency 
of 
the 
GEF, 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
it 
is 
well 
placed to introduce the environmental dimension 
into 
the 
decision making 
process 
of 
a 
major 
Lithuanian 
energy 
utility.

The 
type 
of 
economic 
analysis 
relevant 
to 
this 
GEF 
project 
is 
mostly 
the 
Incremental 
Cost 
Analysis 
(Annex 
11). 
Some 
other 
elements 
of 
economic 
analysis implemented 
at 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
preparation 
are 
also 
helpful 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
broader 
context 
(Annex 
4). 
The Incremental Cost Analysis 
is, 
essentially, 
a 
cost-effectiveness 
analysis 
based 
on 
the 
calculation 
of 
present 
values 
of 
total 
costs 
keeping 
the 
outputs 
(such 
as, 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
final 
demand 
for 
heat 
by 
the 
customers 
using 
the services 
of 
the 
Vilnius' 
district 
heating company 
Vilniaus Energija) 
at 
the 
same 
level 
for 
all 
alternatives. Alternatives 
were compared 
to 
the 
baseline 
(or 
"without project" 
scenario) 
to 
assess 
the 
incremental 
cost and 
reduced carbon 
emissions. 
The alternatives considered 
involved 
various 
levels 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
modernization 
of 
the 
heat-exchanger substations, 
various 
levels 
of 
penetration 
of 
apartment-level 
demand-side management 
equipment such 
as 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
and 
heat 
cost allocators, 
and 
various levels 
of 
penetration 
of 
investments supported 
by 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
fund 
(such 
as 
window 
renovations 
and 
other 
measures 
to 
reduce 
energy 
losses 
in 
buildings). 
Baseline. 
The 
baseline scenario 
was 
built 
on 
the assumption that 
VE 
would continue 
replacing 
group 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations, 
but 
the progress 
of 
the 
program 
would 
be 
hampered 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
incentives for 
the homeowners 
to 
accept 
the replacements 
(as 
noted 
before, 
the 
heating 
bill 
would 
increase 
for 
the 
majority 
of 
the customers 
currently receiving 
heat 
from 
group substations 
- 
i.e., 
for 
60% 
of 
the 
DH 
customers 
in 
Vilnius). 
This 
would 
result 
in 
the 
replacement 
of 
about 
100 
group 
substations 
by 
some 
1,500 
new 
building-level 
substations 
(in 
about 
60% 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
buildings) 
by 
2015. 
This 
estimate 
is 
somewhat 
higher than 
the 
VDHC's 
original 
plan 
to 
replace 
the 
group substations 
by 
2015 
(50%), 
but 
lower 
than the 
one 
under 
the 
GEF project 
scenario 
as 
the substation 
replacement 
program 
- 
20 
- 
Page  25
would 
still 
be 
passively 
resisted 
by 
a substantial number 
of 
customers. 
The 
penetration 
of 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves and 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
would 
be 
limited 
to 10% 
of 
the 
apartments 
of 
the 
City 
(most 
likely, 
concentrating 
in 
the 
homes 
of 
high-income families). 
Other 
demand-side 
energy 
conservation 
measures 
would 
also 
be 
practiced 
on 
a 
limited 
scale. 
Broader 
penetration 
of 
these 
measures 
would 
be 
constrained 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
incentives 
for 
such 
measures 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
individual 
billing 
and 
customer-controlled 
heat 
supply 
at 
the 
apartment 
level. 
The 
proposed 
GEF 
project 
has 
a 
(discounted) 
investment 
cost 
of 
US$40.6 
million 
and 
an incremental 
investment cost 
of 
US$26.9 
million. 
The economic benefits 
from 
these 
investments are 
coming 
primarily 
in 
the 
form 
of 
reduced 
cost 
of 
fuel for 
the 
district 
heating 
system. 
The incremental costs 
savings 
to be 
made 
as 
a 
result 
are estimated 
at 
US$3 
1.4 
million. 
The 
total 
incremental benefits 
exceed 
the 
incremental 
costs, 
resulting 
in 
a negative incremental 
costs 
of 
about -$2.2 
million. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
GEF 
Operational 
Program 
5, 
which 
supports 
“win-win“ 
energy 
efficiency 
projects 
through 
barrier 
removal. 
The 
projected 
direct 
impact 
of 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
in 
terms 
of 
C02 
emission 
reductions 
achieved over 
the 
period 
until 
2020 
as 
a result 
of 
investments implemented 
under 
the 
project 
is 
estimated 
at 
about 
1.5 
million 
tons 
of 
C02. 
The 
unit 
abatement 
costs 
(UAC) 
resulting 
from 
the 
described investments 
and 
GHG 
reductions 
can 
be 
represented 
in 
three 
different 
ways. 
The 
economic value 
of 
the 
unit 
abatement 
cost 
is 
negative 
at 
US$ 
-5.24 
per ton 
of 
carbon equivalent 
(tCe), 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
“win-win” 
nature 
of 
the 
investments 
supported 
by 
the project. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
UAC 
can 
be 
calculated 
as 
a 
ratio 
of 
GHG 
reductions 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
GEF 
resources 
utilized 
in 
the 
project. 
Then, 
if 
the 
entire 
US$6.5 
million 
GEF 
budget 
for 
the 
project 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
cost, 
the 
UAC 
equals 
US$15.62/tCe. 
However, 
it 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
mind 
that 
less 
than 
half 
of 
this 
would 
be 
provided 
on 
a grant 
basis 
to 
the 
final 
beneficiary, 
with 
the remainder 
being 
extended 
on 
a commercial 
basis 
with 
an 
obligation to 
repay 
into 
the 
revolving 
fund. 
If 
the 
commercial 
part 
of 
the 
GEF contribution 
is 
netted 
out, 
the 
UAC 
for 
GEF 
can 
be 
calculated 
as 
US$8Al/tCe.

Annex

NPV=US$ 
million;

(see 
Annex 
4) 
In 
1997 
the 
Vilnius 
district 
heating 
system-like 
district 
heating 
systems across 
Lithuania-was 
separated 
from 
Lithuanian 
Power Company (LPC) 
and 
incorporated 
as 
a 
special 
purpose 
stock 
company 
owned 
by 
Vilnius 
City Municipality 
(VCM). 
As 
part 
of 
the separation arrangements, 
the 
new 
company, 
VDHC, 
assumed 
ownership 
of 
the 
relevant 
assets 
as 
well 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
the 
long-term 
debt 
of 
LPC. 
From 
the outset 
it 
suffered 
from 
an 
inadequate 
tariff 
as 
well 
as 
cost burdens 
imposed 
by 
its 
obligation 
to 
supply 
heat (at 
the 
same 
tariff) 
to 
a number 
of 
smaller, unconnected communities, 
distant 
from 
the 
city 
of 
Vilnius. 
In 
addition, 
the 
condition 
of 
its 
balance 
sheet 
and 
municipal 
budget 
status 
prevented 
it 
from 
accessing 
economical 
sources 
of 
long-term 
finance. 
This 
situation seriously affected 
the 
company’s 
ability 
to 
provide 
high-quality customer 
service 
and 
compete 
effectively 
with 
other 
heat 
suppliers. 
It 
was 
unable 
to 
invest 
enough 
in 
its 
networks, production 
facilities 
and 
customer-level equipment 
to 
ensure 
reliable 
supplies 
of 
heat and 
hot water 
in 
the 
manner 
required 
by 
the 
customer. 
In 
multi-storey 
buildings, residents 
were 
increasingly 
finding 
it 
economical 
and 
effective 
to install 
individual 
building-level 
gas 
boilers 
and 
to 
disconnect 
(either 
formally 
or simply 
by 
ceasing 
to 
use 
it) 
from 
the 
district 
heating 
system. 
The erosion 
of 
the 
customer 
base ate 
into 
the 
company’s 
gross 
margin. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
tariff 
did 
not 
fully 
cover 
costs and 
debt 
service 
requirements 
were 
onerous. 
Net 
losses, 
or negligible 
profits 
were earned 
in 
the 
years 
following 
separation.  This 
was 
despite 
a 
tariff 
increase 
(to 
LTL 
0.1088kWh) 
in 
1998 
and 
the 
separation 
from 
the 
company 
in 
2000 
of 
-21 
- 
Page  26
the eight unconnected communities 
where the cost 
of 
supply 
significantly 
exceeded 
the 
tariff. 
In 
the 
period 
1998-2000 
the 
company 
developed 
a 
rehabilitation 
program 
to 
improve 
its 
cost 
base 
and 
customer 
service capacity: 
it 
was 
calculated that 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
such a 
program 
it 
would 
enter 
a 
phase 
of 
progressive 
financial 
decline 
and 
the 
erosion 
and 
ultimate 
destruction 
of 
its 
equity. 
Assistance 
to 
VEs AL 
DSM 
program 
Assistance 
to 
VCM 
housing 
Drogram 
VDHC's 
owner, 
VCM, 
was 
not 
able 
to 
assist 
the 
company 
as 
it 
was 
itself 
very 
resource-constrained. 
Like 
other 
State 
and 
municipal 
authorities, 
its 
revenue 
base 
had 
been 
hit 
by 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
1998/99 
Russian crisis. 
It 
had no 
borrowing 
capacity 
and 
so 
little 
financial 
leeway 
that 
it 
was 
itself 
a 
major 
debtor 
to 
the 
district 
heating 
company. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
housing infrastructure 
in 
Vilnius 
was 
desperately 
in 
need 
of 
investment 
(like 
other 
elements 
of 
infrastructure) 
and the 
municipality 
has 
important residual 
responsibilities 
in 
this 
area. 
While 
new social housing 
is 
part 
of 
these 
responsibilities, 
the major 
issue 
has 
been 
the 
upgrading, modernization 
and maintenance 
of 
privatized 
dwellings. 
Improved 
energy 
efficiency 
is 
a 
key 
element 
of 
such 
enhancements, 
involving 
both 
apartment-level (thermostatic 
valves, 
cost 
allmators, 
new 
windows) 
and 
building-level 
(new sub-stations, 
new roofs, 
improved 
insulation) 
investments. 
Most 
residents 
have 
had 
insufficient 
financial 
capacity 
to 
undertake these improvements 
themselves. 
US$ 
million 
2.5 
3.0 
It 
was 
in 
this 
context 
that 
the 
World 
Bank, 
the 
GEF 
and 
other co-financiers proposed 
a 
loan 
and grant 
package 
totaling 
$43 
million 
to 
part-fund 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
company's 
facilities. 
However, before 
the 
loan 
became 
effective, 
VCM 
concluded 
a 
leasing 
arrangement 
for 
the 
company's 
assets 
with 
Dalkia. 
The new operator 
of 
the 
facilities, 
Vilniaus 
Energija 
(VE), 
decided 
not 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
loan 
but 
to 
fund 
necessary 
rehabilitation 
from 
other 
sources. 
However, 
VE 
had 
also 
created 
an 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Fund 
(EEF) 
and 
committed 
itself 
in 
the lease agreement 
with 
VCM 
to 
an 
expenditure 
of 
LTL 
20 
million 
on 
energy-efficiency 
measures 
focused 
on 
residents and 
home-owners' 
associations 
and wished 
to 
supplement 
its work 
in 
this 
regard 
with 
GEF 
grant financing. 
Management

The GEF project now 
proposes 
to 
assist 
both 
the 
very specific 
energy economy 
program 
developed 
by 
VE 
to 
cater 
for 
apartment-level 
demand-side 
measures 
(AL 
DSMs), 
and 
the 
wider 
agenda 
of 
VCM 
designed 
to 
improve 
the 
comfort 
and 
energy 
efficiency 
of 
the 
city's 
housing stock. 
This 
will 
be 
achieved 
by 
means 
of

will 
initially 
devote 
LTL 
20

to 
this 
program 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
irrevocable 
grant, 
supplemented 
by 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
GEF. 
While 
GEF 
will 
allocate 
$2.5

to 
the 
program, 
the 
initial 
funding 
will be 
$1.25 
million, 
equivalent 
to 
approximately 
LTL 
4 
million. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program 
will 
modernize the heating controls 
in 
apartments 
in 
120 
buildings 
each 
year 
for 
five 
years. 
Residents, 
other than 
those 
classified 
as 
low-income, 
will 
be 
expected 
to 
contribute 
25% 
of 
the 
gross 
cost 
including 
VAT. 
Since 
this 
contribution 
would 
be 
provided 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
installation 
of 
equipment, 
this 
will 
be 
characterized 
as 
a 
"Downpayment" 
or 
"Connection 
Fee". 
This 
fee 
will 
be 
waived or reduced 
to 
a 
nominal 
level, 
e.g. 
5%, 
in 
the 
case 
of

residents. 
A 
matter to 
be 
agreed 
by 
VE 
and 
VCM 
will 
be 
the 
definition 
of 
“low-income’’ 
households. 
The decision 
on 
this 
will 
influence 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
program. 
For 
example, 
in 
the 
illustration 
below 
20% 
of 
residents 
are 
assumed 
to 
be 
low-income 
and 
therefore 
entitled to 
completely free 
installation. 
If 
it 
were decided 
to 
increase 
the number 
of 
households 
entitled 
to 
free installation, 
this 
would 
reduce 
the 
total funding 
available 
and thus 
the number 
of 
apartments 
covered 
by 
the 
program. 
An 
illustration 
of 
how 
the 
fund 
might 
operate 
is 
set 
out below.

While 
no 
further contribution 
to 
the costs 
of 
the 
program 
beyond the connection fee 
would 
be expected 
from 
residents, 
it 
is 
intended that 
all 
residents 
of 
apartments 
in 
which 
these 
AL 
DSM 
investments 
have 
been 
installed should 
sign 
maintenance 
agreements 
with 
VE, 
at 
a 
likely 
monthly 
cost 
of 
LTL 
0.1 
per 
square 
meter. 
It 
is 
intended that 
the 
second 
$1.25 
million 
tranche 
of 
GEF 
financing to 
VE 
will 
be 
made 
available 
at 
a 
time 
to 
be 
determined 
when 
VE 
commits further grant 
or 
non-grant 
funding 
to 
the extension 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program 
to 
other 
buildings 
in 
Vilnius. 
It 
would 
be 
intended 
to 
seek 
approximately 
the 
same 
5:l 
ratio 
between 
VE 
and 
GEF funding 
as 
is 
inherent 
to 
the 
first 
tranche. 
The 
VCM-implemented 
component 
of 
ECP 
The 
remaining 
US$3 
million 
of 
the 
GEF grant 
would 
be 
made available 
to 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
to 
establish 
a 
so-called ECP 
Commercial Fund 
to 
finance 
further 
energy-saving investments 
in 
the 
city’s 
housing 
stock. 
The fund 
fits 
well into 
VCM’s 
strategy 
for 
the refurbishment 
and 
upgrading 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
residential housing 
in 
Vilnius. 
It 
will 
finance 
building-envelope 
improvements 
(such 
as 
insulation 
of 
walls 
and 
roofs) 
as 
well 
as 
window 
refurbishments 
and 
installation 
of 
new windows, focussing 
initially 
on 
the 
short- 
to 
medium 
payback 
measures. 
As 
the 
fund 
is 
intended to 
be 
self-sustaining, 
it 
follows 
that the revenue 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
the 
equipment 
and 
works financed 
by 
it 
should revert to the 
fund 
and re-enter the 
cash 
float. 
These 
“reflows” 
will 
consist 
of 
down 
payments and 
instalment payments 
by 
residents, 
and 
they 
will 
be used 
to 
finance 
the 
purchase 
and 
installation 
of 
further energy-saving equipment.

As 
the 
commercial 
nature 
of 
the 
ECP 
is 
a 
critical 
element 
of 
the 
program, 
it 
is 
not intended 
to 
be 
prescriptive 
as 
to 
the 
modalities 
of 
its 
operation, 
but rather to 
invite 
detailed 
operational 
proposals 
from 
commercial 
parties 
interested 
in 
becoming 
the 
appointed 
Fund 
Manager. 
Such 
competitive 
proposals 
should 
cover, 
inter 
alia, how 
it 
is 
proposed 
to 
deal 
with 
institutional 
and 
legal 
aspects 
(buildings 
where 
there 
is 
or 
is 
not 
a home-owners' association), 
the 
prioritization 
of 
investment 
packages, 
the 
pricing 
of 
packages, 
the 
profit 
margin 
sought, 
payment 
terms, 
energy 
efficiency 
targets, 
the 
nature 
of 
contractual 
arrangements, 
how 
maintenance 
will 
be 
dealt 
with, 
and 
other 
areas 
which 
will 
have an impact 
on 
the 
market 
penetration 
or acceptability 
of 
the 
program. 
VCM 
will 
be 
responsible for 
transferring GEF 
funds 
to 
the appointed 
Fund 
Manager. 
The 
cash 
balance 
at any 
time 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
a 
separate 
bank account and 
identified 
as 
the 
property 
of 
the 
municipally-owned 
Energy 
Conservation Program 
(ECP) 
Revolving 
Fund. 
Fiscal 
Impact: 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
the 
project 
will 
yield 
fiscal 
benefits 
to 
the 
Government 
by 
increasing 
the 
taxable 
profits 
of 
VE 
and 
by 
reducing 
the number 
of 
households 
which 
require the 
heat 
and 
hot 
water 
subsidies. 
Since 
the 
commercial 
viability 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
will 
be 
improved, 
privatization 
of 
the 
VDHC 
assets 
may 
become possible 
in 
the 
future. 
3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
follows 
a 
detailed technical 
feasibility 
study 
conducted 
in 
1999-2000 
by 
AF-International 
AB, 
Sweden. 
The 
recommendations 
of 
the study 
are 
still 
largely 
valid 
and 
applicable 
to 
the 
technical 
modernization 
program 
pursued 
by VE. 
The technical solutions 
selected 
for 
eliminating 
group 
substations 
and 
installing 
building-level 
substations 
represent technology that 
has 
been 
successfully 
used 
in 
the 
neighboring 
countries 
of 
Eastern Europe. The apartment-level 
DSM 
component 
was 
not 
envisaged 
in 
the 
original feasibility 
study. 
However, 
the 
technical expertise available 
from VE's 
mother 
company 
Dallua 
(France) 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
VE 
staff recruited 
from 
the 
Lithuanian 
ESCO 
company Litesko 
allows 
to 
expect 
a 
very satisfactory 
treatment 
of 
the 
technical 
issues 
involved. 
DSM 
and 
metering 
are 
seen 
by 
VE 
as 
essential elements 
of 
an 
Integrated Supply 
and 
Demand 
scheme. 
It 
is 
essential 
that the actual 
and 
predicted 
demand 
is 
clearly 
identified 
to 
the 
generator. 
Only 
then 
can 
energy 
efficient 
generation programs 
be 
planned 
and executed. 
Data acquisition 
from 
the. 
large network 
of 
building-level 
substations envisaged 
in 
Vilnius 
will 
benefit 
from 
the 
state-of-the-art 
telemetering 
technology. 
The 
substations 
installed 
by 
VE 
would 
be 
equipped 
with 
a 
GSM 
feature 
to collect 
the 
metering 
data 
from 
the substation 
to 
VE's central 
offices. 
At 
present, 
space 
heating 
systems 
in 
multi-storey apartment 
buildings 
in 
Vilnius 
are 
usually 
operated 
as 
inefficiently 
as 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
former Soviet 
Union. The 
chief 
"technology" 
for 
temperature 
control 
is 
usually 
an 
open 
window or 
"fortochka", 
a 
small 
window 
built within 
the frame 
of 
a 
surrounding 
larger 
window. 
This 
leads 
to 
very 
high 
energy 
losses. 
Apartment-Level 
DSM 
Improvements 
Thermostatically controlled 
valves 
(TCVs, or 
thermostats) 
on 
radiators can reduce energy 
use 
and 
increase 
comfort 
by 
automatically 
regulating 
heat 
to provide 
a 
constant 
indoor 
temperature. 
These 
valves 
control room 
temperature 
by 
modulating 
the 
flow 
of 
hot 
water 
through 
the 
radiator. 
Essentially, 
it 
allows 
the 
hot 
water 
to 
flow 
only to 
the 
rooms 
that 
need 
heat. 
Thermostatic 
radiator 
valves 
are 
available 
at 
a 
unit 
price 
of 
$30 
to 
$35 
in 
the 
international 
markets. 
TCVs 
can 
help 
achieve dramatic 
reduction 
in 
energy 
consumption 
for 
a 
modest 
outlay. Generally, 
in 
the 
US 
and Western Europe, 
they 
have 
a payback 
period 
- 
24

Page  29
of 
about 
3 
years. 
Heat 
cost 
allocators. 
Currently, 
individual 
apartments 
in 
multi-apartment 
buildings 
with 
central 
space 
heating 
systems 
are rarely 
metered. 
Heat 
billing 
is 
typically 
based 
on 
the 
distribution 
of 
building-level 
consumption 
data 
in 
proportion 
to 
apartment 
size. 
Therefore, 
there 
is 
no 
direct 
financial 
incentive 
for 
efficient operation 
(such 
as 
using radiator 
valves 
rather than windows to 
control 
temperature). 
The 
introduction 
of 
individual 
apartment 
metering 
based 
on 
the 
installation 
of 
HCA 
will 
provide 
data 
from 
which 
residents 
could 
be 
charged 
for their actual consumption, 
and 
could 
be 
financially 
rewarded for 
efficient operation. 
Studies have 
shown 
that 
energy 
consumption drops 
by 
about 
10% 
after 
individual 
unit 
meters are added. 
Remote 
readers 
for 
hot 
water meters 
allow 
to more accurately 
and 
efficiently monitor 
the 
hot water 
consumption 
data 
and to dramatically 
reduce 
the 
incidence 
of 
undetected 
tampering 
with 
the 
hot 
water 
meters. 
Considering 
that 
domestic 
hot 
water 
consumption 
represents 
a substantial 
portion 
of 
heat 
demand, these 
devices 
can 
considerably 
reduce 
the 
non-technical 
losses 
for 
the 
utility. 
Balancing 
the 
radiator 
circuit 
risers 
connecting 
the 
radiators to 
the 
substation distributes 
the 
heat 
more 
evenly 
among 
the 
risers 
and 
thus 
among the apartments 
as 
well. 
About 
5 
to 
10 
% 
of 
a 
building's 
heat 
demand can be saved 
as 
a result. 
This 
can be achieved 
either 
by installing 
balancing valves (manually 
set 
on 
a 
fixed 
value 
or 
of 
a self-actuating 
type, 
which 
keep a 
preset 
differential 
pressure) 
or 
by 
performing 
periodic 
adjustment 
of 
the 
circulation 
regime 
to 
achieve 
optimal 
balance. 
VE 
has 
opted 
for 
the 
latter 
measure, 
saving 
the option 
of 
installing 
balancing 
valves 
for 
the 
future. 
4. 
Institutional: 
The 
VDHC 
(locally 
known 
as 
SP 
AB 
Vilniaus 
Silumos 
Tinklai, 
or 
VST) 
is 
a special purpose 
joint-stock 
company 
which 
is 
wholly 
owned 
by 
the 
Municipality 
of 
Vilnius. 
In 
the 
recent 
past, 
the 
Municipality has 
shown a strong interest 
in 
attracting 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
heat, 
learning 
from 
the 
successful 
examples 
in 
similar 
sectors 
such 
as 
water 
supply. Therefore, 
the 
Municipality 
has 
considered 
a 
range 
of 
options that 
would 
increase 
private 
sector 
participation including: 
(a) 
divestiture 
of 
its 
ownership 
stake; (b) 
concession 
or 
leasing 
arrangements; 
(c) 
management 
contracts; and/or, 
(d) 
spin-off 
of 
some 
assets 
or 
services. 
Eventually, the 
option 
of 
a 
15-year lease 
was 
chosen. 
In 
February 
2002, 
the 
lease 
agreement 
was 
signed 
by four 
parties: 
VDHC, 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality, 
the energy 
company 
Dalkia 
of 
France, 
and 
the 
new 
locally 
registered 
and 
100% 
Dalkia-owned 
company 
UAB 
Vilniaus 
Energija 
(VE). 
Under 
the 
lease 
agreement, 
VE 
undertakes 
to 
operate the 
facilities 
of 
VDHC 
and 
make investments 
envisaged 
in 
the 
long-term 
investment 
plan 
with 
a 
view 
to achieving the 
targets 
of 
reduced 
production 
costs, 
improved 
technical 
condition 
of 
the 
facilities, 
and 
improved 
responsiveness 
to 
the 
customer. 
The 
latter objective 
is 
supported, 
i.a., 
by 
the establishment 
of 
an 
Efficient 
Energy 
Consumption 
Fund 
(Energy 
Efficiency 
Fund) 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
set 
up 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
LTL 
20 
million. 
The 
lease agreement 
also 
requires 
that 
VE 
must 
support the 
commercial 
and 
financial 
viability 
and 
status 
of 
VDHC, 
retain 
the 
existing 
and 
attract 
new 
customers. 
Dalkia's 
role 
is 
that 
of 
a guarantor 
of 
VE's 
obligations 
under 
the 
lease 
agreement, 
which 
states 
that, 
as 
VE's 
full 
owner, 
Dalkia 
is 
jointly 
liable 
for 
VE's 
discharge 
of 
its 
obligations. VDHC 
continues 
to 
own 
the 
assets 
but 
the 
majority 
of 
its 
staff 
has been 
transferred to 
VE. 
The 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
GEF 
project 
are 
being 
put 
in 
place 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
reorganization 
of 
VDHC 
under 
VE's 
management. 
This 
is 
both 
a 
challenge 
and 
an 
opportunity 
as 
the 
previous 
arrangements 
did 
not 
allow 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a dedicated 
group 
of 
staff 
dealing 
with 
demand-side 
energy 
efficiency. 
Under the 
lease 
agreement, 
this 
is 
a necessity for 
VE 
since 
it 
- 
25 
- 
Page  30
is 
obliged to 
organize 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Energy 
Efficiency Fund 
(EEF) 
including 
evaluation, 
preparation, administering, 
selection, and 
implementation 
of 
efficient 
energy 
consumption 
projects. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
ECP co-financed 
by 
EEF 
and 
GEF 
will 
co-operate 
with 
the 
Lithuanian 
and 
European 
public 
and 
private 
funds related to 
the 
effective 
energy 
consumption 
projects, 
programs 
supporting 
energy and 
infrastructure projects 
in 
the 
states 
of 
the European 
Union and 
other 
countries. 
The expectation 
is 
that 
these 
programs may 
contribute further financing 
to 
support 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
ECP 
in 
the 
future. 
The 
residential 
housing 
in 
Vilnius 
is 
now 
mostly 
(93%) 
privately 
owned. Year 
2000 legislation 
provides 
for 
the establishment 
of 
Homeowners' Associations 
(HOAs) 
or, 
in 
cases 
where 
residents 
fail 
to 
agree 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
associations, 
two 
other 
arrangements 
are 
possible: 
(b) 
arrangement 
of 
civil-code 
based 
joint 
agreements 
of 
owners; 
and 
(c) 
city 
appointed 
building 
administrator. 
There 
are 
about 
176,000 
family 
apartments 
in 
Vilnius, 
of 
which 
some 
50,000 
belong 
to 
families 
organized 
into HOAs. 
The 
exact 
functioning 
of 
these 
arrangements 
is 
being 
clarified, 
so 
that 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
is 
not held 
up 
by 
doubt 
or 
disagreement 
as 
to 
where 
responsibility 
for 
installations 
and their 
maintenance 
lies. 
The 
upgrading 
of 
the 
substations, and 
the 
move 
away 
from 
block 
substations, 
adds 
urgency 
to 
the 
issue, 
and discussions 
between 
VE 
and 
VCM 
are 
underway. 
Another 
important 
institutional 
issue 
is 
the manner 
in 
which 
the 
municipality 
exercises 
its 
prerogatives 
as 
owner 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company. 
According 
to 
the lease agreement, 
the 
initial 
price 
of 
heat 
for 
Vilnius city 
residents 
was 
set 
at 
LTL 
0.10332/kWh 
(VAT 
excluded), about 
5% 
lower 
than 
the 
price 
before 
VE 
took 
over. 
A 
formula included 
in 
the 
lease agreement 
states 
however 
that 
this 
price 
will 
be 
revised 
to reflect 
changes 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
natural 
gas, 
cold 
water, and 
average 
wages 
in 
Lithuania. 
It 
will 
be 
fundamental 
to 
the 
commercial 
evolution 
of 
the 
district 
heating company 
that 
the municipality 
does 
not interfere 
in 
the 
management 
or 
decision-making 
of 
VE. 
Specifically, 
it 
will 
be 
critical 
to 
the 
development 
of 
governance structures 
that the 
Municipality 
not involve 
itself 
in 
the 
pricing 
policy 
of 
the 
company, 
in 
its 
dealings 
with 
the 
Energy 
Pricing 
Commission, 
in 
the 
control 
of 
its 
costs, 
or 
in 
any 
other 
commercial 
area. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
and 
VE 
will 
be 
the 
Implementing 
Agencies 
for 
the 
proposed 
project. 
VE 
is 
wholly 
owned 
by 
Dalha, 
France, 
and 
is 
registered 
in 
Lithuania. The 
company 
is 
a 
legal 
entity 
with 
full 
economic, financial, 
legal 
and 
organizational 
independence. 
Its 
activity 
is 
regulated 
by 
its 
by-laws, 
laws 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Lithuania 
and 
Governmental resolutions. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
VE-implemented 
part. 
VE, 
in 
the 
person 
of 
its 
President, 
will 
designate 
its 
Department 
of 
Marketing 
and Business 
Development 
with 
the 
responsibility for implementation 
of 
the 
VE-implemented 
part 
of 
the 
Project, 
including 
executing 
an 
external communications program, marketing, 
sales, 
maintenance 
of 
Project 
accounts, 
preparation 
of

etc. 
It 
will 
be the President's 
responsibility 
to 
ensure 
the adequate 
staff 
and 
resources 
to 
fulfill 
VE's 
responsibilities 
with 
respect 
to 
Project 
implementation. 
VCM-implemented 
part. 
VCM 
shall establish 
and 
maintain 
an 
ECP Management 
Board 
- 
a special 
working 
group 
with 
the 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
coordinating, supervising, 
and 
monitoring 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Project. 
VCM

necessary 
to implement 
these 
investment proposals 
on

(vii) 
operating 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
in 
a 
financially 
prudent 
and sustainable 
manner, 
realizing 
a 
sufficient 
return 
on 
the 
investments 
to 
enable the 
Fund's operation 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis 
(see 
draft 
TOR 
for 
the 
Commercial 
Fund 
Manager 
in 
Annex 
13). 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
VCM 
will 
follow 
the procurement rules 
of 
the 
World 
Bank to 
buy 
goods, 
works, 
and 
services 
(including 
the 
services 
of 
the 
ECP 
Management 
Contractor (Fund Manager)). The selection 
of 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
initiated prior 
to 
presentation 
of 
the 
project 
to 
the 
Banks 
Board 
and completed 
by 
the 
time 
of 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
GEF 
grant 
agreement 
with 
VCM. 
The 
selection 
of 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
disbursement 
of 
GEF 
proceeds 
for 
the 
Commercial Fund 
Component. 
For 
the 
works 
and 
equipment financed 
from 
the 
Commercial 
Fund 
of 
ECP, 
the 
procurement 
arrangements 
may 
proceed 
under 
the 
national 
competitive 
bidding 
(NCB) 
method 
with 
certain modifications 
to 
allow 
for 
"rate contracts" 
(i.e., 
contracts 
for 
price 
without specifying 
the 
quantity) 
followed 
by 
additional 
contracts 
for supply 
of 
specific quantities concluded between 
the 
Fund 
and 
the 
suppliers. 
VE's 
preferred approach 
to 
procurement 
is 
to 
apply 
its 
own 
procurement rules, 
which 
were 
first 
presented 
to 
the 
Bank 
for 
review 
in 
April 
2002. 
During 
negotiations 
(April 
2003), 
it 
was 
clarified 
that 
VE 
would 
proceed 
with 
the 
tender 
for 
the 
supply and 
installation 
of 
equipment 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
to 
limit 
the 
number 
of 
tenders 
to 
not 
more 
than 
two, 
totaling 
an 
estimated 
US$10 
million. 
The 
methods 
of 
procurement 
agreed between 
VE 
and the 
Bank 
include: 
International Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB) 
in 
case 
VE 
would 
like 
to 
have 
only 
one 
contract, and 
own 
procedures 
of VE 
for 
contracts 
for 
goods and works 
in 
amounts 
not 
exceeding 
US$5 
million, 
provided 
that 
these 
procedures 
will 
ensure 
a transparent 
competitive 
process 
of 
seelung 
bids 
and 
evaluation 
of 
bids 
based 
on 
pre-disclosed clear 
bid 
evaluation 
criteria 
for 
award 
of 
contract 
to 
the 
lowest 
evaluated responsive bidder. The contractors 
and suppliers 
selected 
for 
award 
should 
have 
adequate 
financial 
and 
technical 
resources 
to 
perform 
the 
contract 
satisfactorily. 
VE 
and any 
of 
its 
affiliates 
and 
shareholders 
are 
not eligible to 
bid 
for 
the contracts. 
The 
Bank 
will 
review 
the 
procurement 
documents 
for 
compliance 
with 
these 
principles. 
4.4 
Financial 
management issues: 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment. 
The 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
As 
explained 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
PAD, 
notably 
in 
section 
C4 
and Annex 
6(B), 
prior 
to 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
Fund 
Manager, 
the 
VCM 
will 
assess 
and 
seek 
the Bank's 
no-objection 
to 
the 
Fund 
Manager's 
financial 
management arrangements. 
Disbursement 
by 
the 
Bank 
to 
VCM 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
component 
is 
conditional upon 
the selection 
of 
a 
Fund 
Manager 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank.  Further details regarding 
the 
project's financial 
management arrangements, 
including 
the 
project's auditing 
and 
financial reporting 
arrangements, 
may be 
found 
in 
Annex 6(B). 
Country 
issues. 
In 
2002, 
the 
Bank 
conducted 
an 
Accounting 
and 
Auditing 
Report 
on 
the 
Observance 
of 
Standards and 
Codes 
(ROSC) 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
concluded, amongst 
other 
things, 
that although 
compliance 
with 
IAS 
(International 
Accounting 
Standards, 
including 
International 
Financial 
Reporting 
Standards) 
is 
required by 
law 
for listed 
companies, 
banks 
and 
other 
public 
joint 
stock 
companies, 
the 
enforcement and 
monitoring 
of 
compliance 
with 
IAS 
needed 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
In 
addition 
the 
ROSC 
confirmed 
that 
the 
audit 
of 
such 
financial 
statements 
must 
be 
carried out 
by 
qualified 
auditors 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
Lithuanian 
standards 
that are 
based 
on 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
(ISA). 
Finally, 
the ROSC 
concluded that 
whilst 
many audit 
firms 
make 
efforts 
to 
carry 
out 
audits 
in 
accordance 
with 
ISA, 
there 
are 
variations 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
such 
audits and 
the 
quality 
of 
some 
audits 
is 
affected 
by 
- 
27 
- 
Page  32
enterprises' 
attitudes 
and 
misconceptions 
about the 
role 
of 
audits. 
In 
recognition 
of 
these 
issues, 
it 
has 
been agreed 
that 
VE 
and 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
will 
prepare 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
IAS 
and, 
along 
with 
the 
project, 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with 
ISA by 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
accordance 
with 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank.

The 
banking 
sector 
in 
Lithuania 
has 
made 
substantial 
progress and undergone 
continued 
consolidation 
since 
the 
1995 
banking 
crisis. 
The 
tighten supervision exercised 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
Lithuania 
(Central 
Bank) 
and tougher 
regulatory 
framework 
have 
proved 
beneficial. Accordingly, 
VCM 
will 
open 
its 
Special 
Accounts 
and 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
will 
open the bank accounts 
for 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
components 
in 
commercial 
banks 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1  Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and 
disclosure) 
and the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
project 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
receive 
any 
IBRD 
or GEF financing for 
investments 
in 
the 
generation, 
transmission, 
or 
distribution 
facilities 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system. These 
components, 
including 
the 
replacement 
of 
all 
block 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations 
in 
residential 
buildings, 
have been 
absorbed 
by VE's 
own 
investment program. The current 
GEF project 
deals 
with 
investments 
at 
the 
apartment 
level, 
including 
supply and 
installation 
services 
for 
thermostatic 
valves 
and 
cost 
allocators 
on 
room 
radiators, 
and 
balancing 
valves 
for 
the 
risers connecting the substation 
to 
the radiators. 
Under 
the 
VCM-implemented 
Commercial 
Fund 
component, energy 
efficiency 
improvements such 
as 
better 
insulation 
of 
walls, 
roofs, 
and 
replacement 
of 
window 
are 
envisaged. 
These 
improvements 
will 
take 
place 
inside 
the 
residential 
buildings, 
and 
their  environmental 
impact 
will 
be 
negligible. 
The 
apartment 
owners 
and 
their associations 
(where 
available) 
will 
be 
the 
main 
stakeholders.

Major 
Environmental 
Issues 
There 
are 
no 
major 
environmental 
issues 
associated 
with 
the 
project. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the project 
will 
improve 
air 
pollution 
levels 
by 
reducing 
energy 
consumption 
and, 
hence, 
burning 
of 
fuels. 
Other 
Environmental 
Issues 
Minor 
environmental 
issues 
associated 
with 
construction 
activities include 
dust 
and 
noise 
associated 
with 
the movement 
of 
men, machines, 
and 
materials and 
with 
solid 
waste 
management. 
Asbestos insulation 
is 
present 
in 
some 
components 
which 
are 
to 
be 
replaced under 
the 
project. 
At 
the 
CHP 
facilities, 
there 
is 
a 
possibility 
that 
transformer coolants may 
be 
present that 
contain 
unacceptable 
levels 
of 
PCB. 
Preinsulated 
replacement 
pipes 
might 
be 
manufactured 
with 
CFCs 
or 
HCFCs. 
During 
operation, 
minor 
issues 
include 
atmospheric emissions 
of 
NOx, 
and 
S02. 
The 
efficiencies realized 
by 
project 
implementation 
will 
reduce 
all 
these 
emissions 
(as 
well 
as 
C02) 
compared 
to current 
values.

The 
project 
is 
in 
full 
compliance 
with all 
environmental requirements 
of 
the Government 
of 
Lithuania, 
Vilnius 
Municipality, 
World 
Bank 
policies 
and procedures (OP/BP/GP 4.01 
: 
Environmental 
Assessment), 
appropriate 
EU 
Directives 
concerning 
the 
environmental performance 
of 
boilers, 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Lithuania's 
international commitments under 
the 
Montreal 
Protocol 
concerning 
Depletion 
of 
the 
Ozone 
Layer. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
Regarding the 
EMP, 
see 
also 
Section 
7.2. 
The Grant Agreement contains 
the 
requirement to 
implement 
the EMP. The 
EMP 
meets 
World 
Bank 
requirements 
as 
specified 
in 
OP 
4.01 
Annex C. 
As 
such, 
it 
includes: 
(a) 
a 
mitigation 
plan, 
(b) 
a 
monitoring 
plan, 
(c) 
institutional 
strengthening, 
(d) schedule, 
and 
(e) 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
environmental 
management. 
According 
to 
the 
mitigation 
plan, 
the 
construction 
activities 
will 
be 
conducted 
during 
daytime hours 
and 
planned 
in 
a manner 
to minimize 
disruption 
to 
existing 
population 
activity 
patterns. 
Dusty 
areas 
will 
be 
sprinkled 
with 
water. 
Asbestos 
will 
be 
removed and 
transported 
by companiedunits 
duly 
licensed 
to 
perform 
this 
work, 
and disposed 
of 
in 
an 
appropriate 
manner 
at 
sites 
officially 
approved 
by 
the 
Government to receive 
such 
material. 
If 
transformer 
oils 
are 
present, 
they 
will 
be 
tested 
for 
PCBs 
and, 
if 
contaminated, 
they 
will 
be disposed 
of 
in 
accordance 
with 
Lithuanian 
standards. 
Preinsulated replacement 
pipes 
will 
have 
foam 
insulation 
prepared 
with 
either 
carbon 
dioxide or 
cyclopentane 
foaming 
agents. 
Bid 
documents 
will 
be 
required 
to 
include 
this 
specification. 
Low 
NOx 
burners and 
lower 
sulfur 
fuel oils 
will 
be 
used 
to 
assure 
that 
S02/NOx 
emission 
levels 
will 
comply 
with 
Lithuanian 
standards, 
World 
Bank 
Guidelines, 
and 
EU 
Directives.  Proper 
housekeeping 
measures 
will 
be 
instituted 
to 
minimize 
occurrence 
of 
leaks and 
subsequent 
contamination 
of 
soil 
and groundwater. 
5.3 
For 
Category 
A 
and 
B 
projects, 
timeline 
and 
status 
of 
EA: 
This 
timetable 
refers 
to 
the competed 
EA 
for 
the 
original 
project. The 
resulting 
EMP 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
InfoShop 
on 
March 
21,2001 
and 
disclosed 
in-country 
on March 
22, 
2001. 
No 
new 
EA 
is 
required 
for 
the 
current self-standing GEF project. 
5.4 
How 
have stakeholders been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan? Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation 
that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were 
consulted? 
A 
household 
survey 
was 
undertaken 
in 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
project 
preparation 
(May 
1999) 
for 
use 
in 
project 
design. 
The project 
design 
was based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment, 
takmg 
into 
account 
the 
primary 
concerns 
of 
the 
consumers 
(largely 
cost and 
reliability 
of 
supply). 
Environmental 
issues 
are 
limited 
as 
the 
project 
is 
confined 
to 
repairing 
and upgrading 
existing 
assets. 
The 
key 
features 
of 
environmental 
protection 
and 
mitigation 
were 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
project 
design 
(particularly 
with 
regard to 
decreasing 
air 
pollution 
impact 
by 
improving boiler 
and burner 
efficiency). 
After 
the 
draft 
feasibility 
study 
was 
completed 
a 
meeting 
was 
held 
on 
May 
25, 
2000 
with 
NGOs 
to 
present 
the 
findings 
and 
to 
address 
their 
concerns. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have been 
established 
to monitor 
and evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives and results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
As 
part 
of 
the 
EMP, 
the 
monitoring plan 
has 
been 
designed 
in 
a manner consistent 
with 
the 
mitigation 
plan. 
Issues 
which 
are 
to 
be 
mitigated 
during 
construction include 
dust, 
noise, 
and materials disposal 
(hazardous and non-hazardous) 
and 
issues 
to 
be 
mitigated during 
operation 
include 
emissions 
of 
S02, 
NOx, 
water 
leaks, 
and 
fuel 
oil 
spills. 
The 
monitoring 
plan 
addresses 
all 
these issues. 
During 
construction, 
monitoring 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Chief 
of 
VEs 
Construction 
Department and 
during 
operation, 
it 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Chief 
of 
the 
Technical Production 
Department. 
Monitoring 
results 
are 
normally 
reviewed 
and 
analyzed 
monthly 
by 
the 
Production 
Department. 
If 
the 
data 
indicate 
abnormalities, 
a 
report 
is 
sent 
to 
the 
Chief 
of 
the 
Technical 
Department. 
Any 
necessary 
actions 
are the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Date 
of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
March 
21,

6. 
Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to the 
project 
objectives, and specify the 
project's 
social 
development outcomes. 
The 
safety 
net 
review 
was 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Banks 
Second 
Structural Adjustment 
Loan; 
the 
Government 
introduced 
several 
improvements 
in 
its 
social 
assistance 
mechanisms 
and 
appears 
to 
be 
reasonably 
successful: 
low-income 
households 
are 
protected 
from 
the impact 
of 
heat 
supply 
costs 
that 
exceed 25% 
of 
household 
income through 
targeted subsidies 
from 
the 
Municipality. 
Important 
additional 
laws 
in 
the 
area 
of 
social 
protection 
are 
currently 
under preparation, 
including 
a 
new 
Cash 
Social 
Assistance 
Law 
(submitted to 
Seimas 
in 
November 
2002). 
The 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
assist 
the 
poor 
by 
reducing 
the 
cost 
of 
heat 
supply 
in 
the 
longer 
term 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
service.  The benefits 
will 
accrue 
to 
a 
greater extent 
to 
the 
poor 
as 
the 
wealthier 
segments 
of 
the 
population have 
been 
able 
to 
afford 
alternative (more expensive 
but currently 
more convenient) forms 
of 
heat. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
For 
the 
project 
originally 
proposed 
by VDHC, 
a survey 
was 
undertaken to 
help 
design 
the 
project based 
on 
their customers' views. The 
project 
was 
(and 
still 
is) 
designed 
to 
decrease 
the 
cost 
of 
supply, 
which 
will 
benefit 
all 
groups 
but particularly 
the 
poor 
as 
heating 
absorbs 
a 
disproportionate component 
of 
their 
household income. 
VDHC 
introduced 
the 
project 
to 
the 
public 
through television 
interviews, newspaper 
and magazine 
articles. 
VDHC 
also 
prepared 
a 
brochure describing the 
energy 
efficiency 
component 
of 
the 
project (focusing 
on 
the substations) 
and made 
it 
available 
to 
the 
public. 
With 
the 
introduction of 
apartment-level 
DSM 
into 
the 
project 
design, the 
homeowners 
will 
become 
even 
more directly 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
since 
they 
will 
be 
purchasing 
(or 
co-financing) the 
DSM 
equipment. 
Thus, 
the 
new 
management 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
(VE) 
will 
have to undertake 
a serious 
marketing 
effort 
in 
order 
to 
succeed 
in 
this 
new 
market. 
VE's 
Marketing 
Department 
is 
responsible for: 
(a) 
developing and executing 
an 
external 
communications program 
including 
promotional material 
(brochures, 
letters, 
etc.), 
direct mail, advertising and 
other activities 
targeted to current 
or 
potential 
customers; (b) 
coordinating 
public information 
campaigns 
on 
energy 
efficiency 
with 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
representatives, 
in 
particular 
when the campaign 
is 
targeted 
to 
low-income 
households. 
Under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
Marketing 
Department, three 
Client 
Service 
Centers 
have 
been 
set 
up 
staffed 
by 
a 
total 
of 
117 
staff 
who 
report 
to 
the 
Commercial 
Director. 
The 
Centers 
are 
located 
at the 
VE 
Head 
Office 
(39 
staff), CHP-2 (34 staff) 
and 
RK-8 
(Baltupiai 
- 
34 staff), respectively. 
Heat Managers 
comprise 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
Client 
Service Center 
staff 
and 
act 
as 
the 
point-of-sale 
contact 
and 
primary 
customer 
service 
contact.  They 
are 
responsible 
for 
meeting 
targets 
in 
sales 
of 
heat 
(heat 
contract) and 
maintenance 
services. 
Under 
the 
Project, 
they 
promote the 
implementation 
of 
the 
demand-side 
management 
program 
for 
the 
VE 
customers. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
A 
meeting 
with 
NGOs 
took 
place 
on 
May 
25, 
2000 
based 
on 
a 
project 
description 
that 
was 
circulated 
to 
them 
earlier. 
Their overwhelming 
concern 
was 
the 
cost 
of 
district 
heat. 
In 
addition 
they 
expressed 
concerns that 
those 
who 
take 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
new 
substations 
should 
also benefit 
from 
this 
through 
cost 
reductions. 
During 
the 
discussions 
with 
the 
NGOs, 
it 
became 
clear that 
the 
communication 
program 
that had 
already 
been 
implemented had 
not 
reached a 
broad enough audience 
and 
needed 
to 
be 
refocused. 
As 
a result, 
two 
efforts 
have 
been 
undertaken: 
a 
revised 
information 
campaign 
and a 
pilot 
scheme 
which 
includes 
information 
dissemination 
as 
a 
component.

What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
primary 
social 
objectives 
that need 
to 
be 
addressed 
are 
cost 
reductions 
and 
improved 
service. 
Both 
of 
these 
elements 
are 
distinct 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
that 
will 
be 
monitored 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social development outcomes? 
Monitoring 
indicators 
were designed 
to 
address 
the 
key social 
assessment 
concerns. 
VE 
will 
be 
asked 
to 
report 
on 
these 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis.

Describe

made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable safeguard policies. 
An 
environmental 
mitigation 
plan 
has 
been 
developed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
EMP. Key 
elements 
of 
this 
plan 
(largely 
the 
proper disposal 
of 
wastes) 
will 
be 
monitored during project 
supervision. 
The 
EMP 
was 
developed when 
rehabilitation 
of 
CHPs, 
HOBS, 
Substation 
and 
Distribution Network 
was considered 
an 
integral part 
of 
the 
project. Therefore, the 
EMP 
is 
much more 
comprehensive than the 
scope 
of 
the 
current self-standing 
GEF 
project 
might 
require. The 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
address 
the 
construction 
phase 
of 
the 
project. 
Issues 
include 
dust, 
noise, and 
proper disposal 
of 
non-hazardous 
wastes. 
The 
EMP 
includes testing 
for 
hazardous 
materials 
(PCBs) 
and, 
if 
found 
in 
levels exceeding 
standards, 
appropriate 
measures 
for 
management 
are 
to 
be taken. 
F. 
Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The 
Project 
supports 
a 
fundamental design 
change 
in 
the 
district 
heating 
system, 
including 
the 
installation 
of 
building-level 
substations and 
AL 
DSM 
equipment, 
which 
will 
increase 
consumers' 
control 
over 
their 
consumption 
of 
energy and 
make 
them 
more 
aware 
of 
options 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
of 
heat 
consumed. 
In 
this 
way 
the 
Project 
addresses 
the 
root 
cause 
of 
the 
past 
unsustainable 
operation 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system. 
The devolution 
of 
responsibility 
for 
regulating 
heat supply 
to 
the 
customer 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
billing 
based 
on 
metered consumption 
simplifies 
the 
incentives, increases 
"ownership" 
and 
thus 
is 
expected 
to 
increase 
sustainability. 
This 
is 
particularly 
apparent 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program 
which 
supports 
the 
introduction 
of 
billing 
for 
heat 
on 
an 
apartment-by-apartment 
basis. 
-31 
- 
Page  36
Further, under 
the 
VE-implemented 
AL 
DSM 
component 
including 
the 
introduction 
of 
consumption-based 
billing 
by 
apartment, 
the 
positive 
results 
achieved, 
combined 
with 
public 
outreach 
and 
dissemination 
efforts, 
will 
help 
VE 
strengthen 
the 
supplier-customer relations 
and 
consolidate 
the 
customer 
base. 
This 
may, 
in 
turn, 
accelerate 
the 
substation 
modernization 
program 
pursued by VE. 
As 
the 
new substations 
would 
enable 
the 
installation 
of 
AL 
DSM 
measures, 
it 
is 
expected that more 
demand 
for 
these measures 
in 
residential buildings 
would 
be 
generated, 
thus 
completing 
the 
self-reinforcing loop 
("virtuous 
cycle").  The 
overall 
scheme 
is 
intended 
to 
"push" 
the 
market early 
on 
and 
then 
allow 
a 
transition 
to 
a 
commercial 
market 
as 
both 
the 
technical 
possibility 
and the 
incentives 
would 
be 
in 
place 
for 
both 
the 
homeowners 
and emerging 
ESCOs 
to 
implement further 
energy 
saving 
investments 
in 
buildings equipped 
with 
modern 
building-level 
substations and 
consumption-based 
billing 
of 
apartments 
for 
heat. 
Moreover, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
provide 
a 
sufficient 
impetus 
to 
the 
AL 
DSM 
market 
to 
bring 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
equipment down through creating more 
buyers 
and suppliers. Eventually, 
this 
will 
reduce 
the 
costs, 
alleviating 
the 
up-front 
cost 
barrier 
for 
many 
potential 
buyers 
of 
AL 
DSM 
equipment. 
This impact 
also 
has 
"virtuous 
cycle" qualities, 
reinforcing 
the 
positive 
results and 
making 
them 
more 
sustainable. 
The 
long-term sustainability 
of 
the 
overall 
Energy Conservation Program 
(ECP) 
would 
be 
supported 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
($3 
million) 
that 
would 
operate 
on 
a 
revolving 
basis. 
The 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Commercial Fund 
itself would 
depend 
on 
its 
default rate 
and 
terms 
on 
which 
the 
DSM 
measures 
will 
be 
offered 
to 
the 
homeowners. 
The 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
the 
impact 
made 
by 
the 
operation 
of 
the ECP commercial 
fund 
will 
depend 
on 
the effectiveness 
of 
the 
program 
in 
producing 
a 
leveraging 
effect 
in 
terms 
of 
attracting 
co-financing 
from 
the 
commercial 
banking 
sector. 
One 
of 
the 
goals 
is 
to 
stimulate commercial 
bank 
co-financing 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
investments under 
ECP 
and, 
eventually, make commercial 
banks 
and 
private 
investors the 
primary 
source 
of 
financing 
for 
such 
investments. 
la. 
Replicability: 
The 
modernization 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating 
System 
supported 
by 
VE 
promotes 
energy 
efficiency 
of 
both 
the 
supply 
and 
demand 
sides. 
The 
GEF 
support 
emphasizes 
the 
demand-side 
measures 
implemented 
by 
both 
VE 
and 
the 
Municipality 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
residents. 
Only 
with 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the demand-side 
efficiencies 
into 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
project, 
can 
its 
full 
economic 
and 
environmental 
benefits 
be 
achieved 
utilizing 
the 
synergy 
between 
the 
two 
sides 
of 
the process. 
This 
approach 
is 
highly 
replicable 
throughout Eastern Europe 
and 
the 
Former 
Soviet 
Union 
where many 
district 
heating 
systems 
as 
well 
as 
the 
housing stock 
are 
in 
need 
of 
a 
fundamental 
modernization 
to 
improve 
energy 
efficiency, 
and where 
investments 
in 
energy saving 
at 
the 
customer 
level 
have been 
lacking. 
Potentially, 
heat demand 
management 
and 
energy 
efficiency 
is 
an 
attractive 
market 
opportunity, 
and 
demonstrating 
its 
commercial 
viability 
is 
one 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
project. 
An 
initial 
grant injection 
is 
appropriate 
only for 
a 
specific application that removes 
a 
barrier 
and 
promotes 
a 
sustainable 
Outcome 
(such 
as 
the 
introduction 
of 
billing 
for 
heat 
based 
on 
actual apartment-level consumption). 
The 
replication 
is 
potentially 
possible 
without 
resort 
to 
GEF 
or 
other 
grants once 
it 
is 
established 
that 
demand-side 
improvements 
can 
eventually 
benefit 
the 
DH 
companies and/or 
other participants in 
the 
emerging 
energy 
efficiency 
market. 
This 
is 
due 
not 
only 
to 
the 
consolidating 
impact 
on 
the 
customer 
base, 
but 
also 
due 
to 
reduced 
losses 
and costs 
of 
supply 
- 
especially, 
during periods 
of 
peak 
demand. 
The 
replication potential 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
apartment-level 
billing 
based 
on 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
technology 
is 
particularly 
large 
in 
the 
CIS 
countries. 
While 
this 
technology 
is 
not 
new 
in 
Eastern 
Europe, 
the 
capital 
of 
Lithuania 
will 
be 
first 
to 
introduce 
this 
technology 
in 
the 
Baltic 
States 
and 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union. 
Thus, 
there 
is 
a large 
untapped 
market 
for 
this 
technology, 
which 
is 
the 
most essential 
pre-requisite 
for 
replication 
of 
this 
project. 
- 
32

Page  37
The 
replication 
potential 
for 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
is 
also 
large 
as 
there 
are 
many 
markets 
in 
the 
ECA 
countries where 
potential 
energy 
savings are 
large 
but 
commercial 
financing 
is 
not readily available 
due 
to 
a 
number 
of 
institutional, 
regulatory, 
and 
other barriers. 
While 
removing 
such 
barriers through 
regulatory 
reform 
is 
probably 
the 
best 
possible 
solution 
that 
will 
allow 
the 
commercial 
banks 
and 
private 
financiers 
to 
enter 
these 
markets, 
the 
provision 
of 
targeted 
financing 
can be 
an 
appropriate 
response 
in 
many 
cases. 
The 
practical 
experience 
of 
processing 
the transactions 
in 
a 
way consistent 
with 
market 
principles 
is 
an 
important 
capacity 
building 
exercise 
for 
both 
the 
"borrowers" 
and 
"lenders", 
which 
can 
in 
turn 
result 
in 
increased 
mobilization 
of 
commercial 
capital 
- 
first, 
as 
co-financing, then 
as 
the 
primary 
source 
of 
financing.

The 
new 
BLS

does 
not allow 
for 
customer-controlled 
heat 
supply, 
and/or 
VE 
is 
not 
willing 
to 
give control 
of 
the 
BLS 
to 
the 
homeowners. 
The fuel 
savings 
due 
to 
the 
installation 
of 
BLS 
and 
AL 
DSM 
are 
insufficient to 
produce the expected 
GHG 
savings. 
The 
customer-controlled operating 
mode 
of 
the 
new 
BLS 
alone 
provides 
sufficient 
incentive 
for 
the 
homeowners 
to 
appreciate 
the 
substation modernization 
program 
(hence 
no 
additional 
BLS 
penetration 
is 
due 
to 
AL 
DSM 
program). 
The 
AL 
DSM 
program under 
ECP 
makes 
little 
or 
no 
contribution 
to 
consolidation 
of VEs 
customer 
base 
(keeping

not effective 
in 
removing

to 
energy

as 
lack 
of 
commercial credit for 
many 
uncollateralized

Possible 
Controversial 
Aspects: 
The 
provision 
of 
grant-capitalized financing 
from 
the 
GEF, 
if 
not properly 
structured, 
may 
have 
unintended 
impacts 
on 
the 
financial 
sector. 
In 
the 
process 
of 
public 
information 
campaign by 
the 
Municipality 
(as 
well 
as 
through 
the 
network 
of 
field 
offices 
set 
up by 
IFC 
under the 
CEEF 
project), 
it 
should 
be 
clearly 
explained 
that 
the 
revolving fund 
proposed 
to 
be 
set 
up 
under 
the 
Municipality's 
purview 
is 
expected to 
finance 
demand-side 
management measures 
on commercial 
terms and 
exclusively 
in 
the 
residential 
sector, 
which 
is 
an 
area 
of 
relatively 
low priority 
for 
the 
commercial 
banks 
- 
in 
part, 
due 
to 
existing 
regulatory 
uncertainties. 
These 
uncertainties 
are 
being 
addressed by the 
Bank 
through 
the 
Lithuanian 
Housing 
Strategy. 
By 
stimulating 
co-financing 
of 
projects 
in 
the 
residential 
sector, 
the 
revolving 
fund 
catalyzes 
and 
facilitates 
the 
lending 
to 
the sector 
on 
commercial 
terms 
rather 
than 
suppressing 
such 
lending.

[from 
Objective 
to

The 
barrier removal 
efforts 
under 
ECP 
result 
in 
long-lasting impacts 
such 
as 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
and 
more 
competitively

The 
results achieved 
under 
ECP 
are 
acknowledged 
and 
promoted 
by 
government 
and 
Dther 
stakeholders. 
(from 
Outputs 
to 
Objective) 
The 
new 
BLS 
technology 
allows 
for 
customer-controlled 
heat 
supply; 
and 
VE 
is 
willing 
to 
give 
control 
of 
the 
BLS 
to 
the 
homeowners. 
The 
fuel 
savings 
due 
to 
the 
installation 
of 
BLS 
are 
sufficient 
to 
produce 
the 
expected 
GHG 
savings. 
The

Detailed 
Project 
Description 
LITHUANIA: 
Vilnius Heat Demand Management 
Project 
Project Implementation 
Arrangements 
The VCM-implementedpart. 
The 
key 
guiding principle 
of 
this 
part 
of 
the 
project 
is 
the need 
to 
demonstrate a 
profitable 
operation 
based 
on 
energy 
efficiency 
savings 
in 
the 
residential 
housing 
sector. 
The 
approach 
to 
defining 
the 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
VCM 
and 
its 
key 
contractor 
is 
not 
intended 
to 
be 
overly 
prescriptive 
at 
this 
time. 
Rather, the 
plan 
is 
to 
have 
VCM 
conduct 
a tender and 
invite 
detailed operational 
proposals 
from 
commercial parties interested 
in 
becoming 
the appointed 
Commercial 
Fund 
Manager (ECP 
Management Contractor). 
Such 
competitive proposals should cover, 
inter 
alia, 
how 
it 
is 
proposed 
to deal 
with 
institutional 
and 
legal 
aspects 
(buildings 
where there 
is 
or 
is 
not 
a 
home-owners’ 
association), 
the 
prioritization 
of 
investment 
packages, 
the 
pricing 
of 
packages, 
the 
profit 
margin 
sought, 
payment 
terms, 
energy 
efficiency 
targets, 
the 
nature 
of 
contractual 
arrangements, 
how 
maintenance 
will 
be 
dealt 
with, 
and 
other 
areas 
which 
will 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
the 
market 
penetration 
or 
acceptability 
of 
the 
program. 
Annex 
13 
contains 
a 
draft 
TOR 
for 
the 
ECP Management Contractor 
(to 
be 
finalized by 
VCM). 
The 
activities aimed 
at 
the 
replication 
of 
the 
project’s 
concept, 
approach, 
and 
delivery 
mechanisms 
would 
be 
carried out 
through 
the 
GEF-funded 
Monitoring 
& 
Evaluation 
of 
Global 
Environmental 
Benefits 
and 
Information 
Dissemination 
for 
Replication 
component. The consultant 
engaged 
by 
the 
Municipality for 
this 
task 
would 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
Marketing 
Department 
of 
VE 
and 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality. 
The 
information 
disseminated through 
these 
activities 
would 
include: 
(i) 
the 
role 
of 
the ECP 
in 
supporting the 
Vilnius 
district 
heating 
company’s 
evolution 
from 
its 
historical 
role 
of 
a 
supply-driven 
heat 
provider 
to 
the new 
role 
of 
provider 
of 
energy services 
and 
DSM 
to 
meet 
the 
comfort 
needs 
of 
the 
customer; 
(ii) 
technical performance 
of 
the heat demand 
management 
equipment; 
(iii) 
commercial 
viability 
and 
institutional 
sustainability 
of 
the 
revolving fund 
created under 
ECP; 
(iv) 
the 
role of 
the 
local 
community 
in 
making 
decisions about 
their 
energy 
saving options. 
The 
specific 
arrangements 
for 
the 
delivery 
of 
this 
information would 
include: 
(i) 
producing 
fact 
sheets 
about 
the 
Project; 
(ii) 
presenting 
the 
experience 
of 
VE 
and 
VCM 
at 
a 
workshop 
for 
government 
officials, 
community 
leaders, 
private 
sector 
interests, 
NGOs, 
etc.; 
and 
(iii) 
developing 
a 
published 
case 
study 
in 
English, Lithuanian, 
and 
Russian, 
to 
use 
with 
municipal 
governments, 
ministries 
of 
energy and 
communal 
services, 
etc. 
As 
a 
possible forum, 
one 
of 
the 
regular 
meetings 
under 
the 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Demonstration 
Zones 
Program 
of 
the 
UNECE could 
be used 
to 
present 
the 
case. 
UNECE’s 
website 
could 
be 
utilized 
for 
electronic 
publication 
(in 
addition 
to 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
standard 
press 
releases).

Project 
Components 
In 
the 
following 
description, 
the 
first 
two 
Components 
(A 
and 
B) 
are 
proposed 
to 
be 
implemented 
by 
VE, 
while 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
Components 
are 
implemented by 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
aided 
by 
appropriate 
consultancy 
support. 
The 
investments 
included 
in 
the 
description 
would 
take 
place during 
the 
period 
2003-2007. 
By 
Component: 
Project Component 
1 
- 
US$26.10 million 
The 
Substation 
Modernization 
- 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
table 
in 
Section 
C-1 
as 
Component 
A. 
This 
component 
is 
part 
of 
VE's investment program 
and 
it 
consists 
of 
substation modernization 
including 
the 
replacement 
of 
all 
block 
substations 
with 
building-level 
substations 
in 
residential buildings. 
VE 
plans 
to 
install 
2,286 
building-level 
substations 
(most 
of 
them 
over 
the 
next 
four or five 
years) 
in 
buildings 
currently 
served 
from 
block 
substations. 
The 
implementation 
of 
this 
component 
is 
of 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
transformation 
of 
the 
Vilnius 
DH 
system 
into 
a 
modern, 
customer 
friendly, 
and energy 
efficient 
system. 
This 
is 
also 
an 
essential prerequisite 
for 
the 
technical 
feasibility 
of 
the 
demand-side 
management 
measures 
at 
the 
apartment 
and 
building 
level 
and 
thus 
ties 
in 
most 
closely 
with 
the 
GEF-supported 
components.

Propram 
Project Component

- 
US$lO.OO 
million 
Apartment-Level 
Demand-Side 
Management 
(AL 
DSM) 
component 
- 
is 
shown 
in 
the 
table 
in 
Section 
C-1 
as 
Component 
B. 
The 
AL 
DSM 
program 
would 
be 
a 5-year 
program, and 
it 
would cover 
some 
500-600 
apartment 
buildings 
in 
Vilnius, 
with 
the 
possibility 
of 
expanding 
the 
program 
to 
another 
similar 
number 
of 
buildings 
in 
the 
following 
years. 
The 
AL 
DSM 
measures 
would 
include 
the 
supply 
and 
installation 
services 
for thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
(TCV) 
and 
heat cost 
allocators 
(HCA) 
on 
room 
radiators, remote 
readers 
for 
hot 
water 
meters, 
and 
balancing 
works 
for 
the 
risers 
connecting 
the 
substation 
to 
the radiators. 
These 
investments 
will 
allow 
VE 
to 
introduce 
billing 
based 
on 
the 
actual 
heat 
consumption 
by 
each 
apartment where the 
AL 
DSM 
equipment 
is 
installed. 
Thus, 
the 
incentives 
for 
the 
residents 
to 
conserve heat 
would 
be 
substantially 
enhanced. 
However, 
the 
potential 
level 
of 
acceptance 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
installation 
program by 
the 
Vilnius 
residents 
is 
uncertain. 
To 
increase the 
chances 
of 
successful 
market penetration, 
the 
GEF 
will 
participate 
in 
this 
component 
by 
financing 
a 
$2.5 
million 
"subsidy 
fund" (to 
be 
disbursed 
in 
two 
tranches 
of 
$1.25 
million 
each, 
the 
second 
tranche 
being 
contingent 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
co-financing 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
program 
by 
VE). 
The 
subsidy 
fund 
will 
allow 
VE 
to 
forgive 
the 
low-income 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
500-600 
buildings 
all 
or 
most of 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
downpayment 
(connection 
fee) 
on 
the 
AL 
DSM 
equipment, 
thus addressing 
the 
barrier 
of 
up-front 
cost 
affordability. 
During 
the 
years 
of 
the 
GEF 
project duration 
(2003-2007), 
the co-financing 
by 
VE 
is 
expected to 
equal 
at 
least 
LTL 
20 
million 
(roughly 
$6 
million), 
with 
the homeowners 
contributing 
about 
$2.5 
million 
through connection 
fees.

ECP 
Commercial Fund 
(Component 
C). 
This 
component 
would 
capitalize a 
revolving 
fund 
(run 
by 
a 
firm 
contracted 
by 
the 
Municipality 
- 
see 
the 
ECP 
Management 
Contract component 
below) through 
a 
$3 
million 
worth 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
(demand-side 
management) 
investments 
during the 
years 
of 
the 
GEF 
project implementation 
(2003-2007). 
The 
fund 
would 
operate 
on 
a 
financially 
sustainable 
basis 
and 
would 
be 
used 
for 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
as 
long 
as 
demand 
exists. The 
Municipality 
envisages 
that most 
of 
the investments 
will 
be 
made 
in 
the 
building-envelope improvements 
(including window 
replacement). 
However, 
the 
final 
decision 
on 
the 
type 
of 
the 
investments 
made 
by 
the Commercial 
Fund 
will 
be 
made 
upon 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
tender 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
fund 
under the 
ECP 
Management 
Contract. 
The 
intent 
is 
to 
solicit 
the 
most 
effective 
and 
innovative 
proposals 
(business 
plans) 
from 
the 
firms 
competing 
for 
the 
Contract. 
To 
ensure 
an 
integrated 
approach 
with 
the 
investment 
program pursued 
by 
VE, 
one 
of 
the 
conditions 
will 
be that the 
ECP Commercial Fund 
would 
only extend 
its 
services 
only 
to 
buildings 
connected 
to 
district 
heat 
and 
receiving 
either 
building-level 
substations 
and/or 
AL 
DSM 
equipment. 
Project Component 
4 
- 
US$0.50 
million 
The 
ECP 
Management Contract 
would 
be 
an 
essential 
component 
of 
the 
Project 
which 
would 
create 
an 
institutional 
and 
operational 
basis 
for 
the energy 
efficiency 
investment 
program 
pursued by the 
Municipality. 
A 
commercial 
entity 
(consulting 
firm 
- 
preferably, 
with 
credentials 
of 
an 
ESCO) 
would 
be 
selected 
by 
the 
Vilnius Municipality 
through a 
competitive 
tender. 
Under 
the

for 
Replication. 
The 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
global environmental objective 
would 
focus 
on 
quantifying 
the 
GHG 
savings associated 
with 
energy 
savings 
and 
the 
performance 
of 
ECP. 
The 
M&E 
would 
include 
a 
mid-term 
review 
(planned 
for 
June 
2006), 
which 
would 
place a 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
ECP 
from 
the perspective 
of 
GHG 
reduction 
impact 
as 
well 
as 
market 
penetration 
and 
financial sustainability 
of 
the 
Commercial 
Fund. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
M&E 
of 
GHG 
reductions 
and 
the ECP performance, 
this 
component 
would 
include 
information 
dissemination 
activities 
aimed 
to 
realize 
the 
Project’s 
replication 
potential 
to 
the 
maximum. 
Lithuania would 
be 
the 
initial 
target 
area 
for 
replication, 
where the 
information 
dissemination 
can 
be 
facilitated 
through 
the 
several 
existing 
Housing 
Advisory 
Centers 
which 
have 
experience 
with 
DSM 
programs 
including 
the 
Lithuania 
EEHP. 
Replication 
outside 
Lithuania would 
be 
achieved 
through 
disseminating 
the 
information 
through 
the 
existing 
networks 
of 
experts 
and 
agencies engaged 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
projects 
- 
e.g., 
the 
network 
of 
energy

within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Energy

Economic Analysis Summary 
LITHUANIA: 
Vilnius Heat 
Demand 
Management 
Project 
Least-Cost 
Analysis. 
District 
heating options were considered 
relative 
to 
individual 
gas-fired boilers 
and 
electricity-based heat 
supply. 
Generally, 
district 
heating 
is 
economically 
viable 
if 
the 
density 
of 
heat 
demand 
is 
high 
(above 
5 
MWh/year 
per 
meter 
of 
pipe) 
and 
if 
heat 
as 
a 
by-product 
from 
a 
power 
plant 
is 
used 
to 
meet 
part 
of 
the 
supply. 
Vilnius 
has 
two 
CHP 
plants 
that can be 
used 
as 
a 
source 
of 
low-cost 
heat, 
thus 
meeting 
one 
of 
the 
criteria. 
Most 
of 
Vilnius 
meets the heat 
density 
criterion, 
if 
not 
all. 
Consultants 
undertook 
an 
analysis 
of 
each 
of 
the 
24 
districts 
within 
Vilnius to 
assess 
which 
districts 
should 
be 
retained 
as 
market 
areas 
for district 
heat. 
Of 
the 
24 
districts, 
15 
met 
the 
criteria 
with 
the 
remaining nine 
requiring 
a 
detailed 
analysis. 
Of 
these 
nine, 
one 
district 
(A. 
Paneriai) 
was 
proposed to 
be 
disconnected 
from 
the 
centralized 
heat 
supply 
system. 
In 
three 
other districts, 
some 
design 
changes 
and 
limited 
disconnection 
will 
make 
district 
heating supply economically viable. 
In 
the 
remaining 
five 
districts, 
centralized 
heat 
is 
least-cost 
due 
to 
their 
proximity 
to 
a 
transit 
pipe 
to neighboring 
districts. 
Part 
of 
the 
problem 
with 
the 
financial 
viability 
of 
district 
heating 
stems 
from 
cross-subsidies 
in 
gas 
prices. 
Household 
gas 
prices remain 
below 
their 
economic levels 
while 
larger customers pay 
relatively 
high 
prices than 
can 
be 
economically 
justified. 
The 
Energy 
Pricing 
Commission 
(EPC) 
has 
been 
gradually 
eliminating 
these 
cross-subsidies, 
but 
further 
adjustments need 
to 
take 
place. 
This 
issue 
is 
of 
particular importance 
to 
district 
heating 
companies 
as 
gas 
is 
both 
their 
primary 
supplier 
and primary 
competitor 
(at 
the 
household level). 
As a 
result, 
their 
input price 
subsidizes the 
price paid 
for 
the 
primary 
competitor 
to 
district 
heat 
- 
individual 
boilers. 
This 
issue 
was 
addressed 
with 
the 
VDHC, 
EPC 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy 
at 
the 
time 
of 
preappraisal, 
when 
it 
was 
agreed 
that 
it 
would 
be 
addressed 
through 
the 
regulatory 
process. 
Cost-Benefit 
Analysis 
focused 
on 
the 
returns that 
could 
be 
achieved 
based 
on 
tariffs 
as 
a 
proxy 
for 
valuing 
benefits. 
This 
underestimates 
the 
economic returns, 
which 
is 
a 
conservative 
approach. The 
project 
benefits consist 
of 
the 
following: 
decreased 
fuel 
consumption 
from 
energy 
savings 
caused 
by 
improved 
temperature 
control 
at 
consumer substations and 
in 
the 
apartments; 
decreased 
fuel 
consumption 
from CHP 
and 
HOB 
upgrades; 
improved 
supply 
reliability from 
equipment replacement at 
the 
CHP 
and 
HOBS; 
decreased 
water 
losses 
as 
a 
result 
of 
new 
substations; 
decreased 
electricity 
consumption 
by 
lowering pumping 
loads; 
decreased 
maintenance 
costs; 
lower 
staffing 
requirements; and 
decreased 
emissions 
(including 
C02). 
Only 
components that 
have 
a 
real 
incremental 
financial return 
greater 
than 
10% 
have 
been 
considered 
for 
the 
project 
because 
of 
the 
need 
to 
decrease 
the 
cost 
of 
supply. 
All 
project 
components have 
an 
individual 
EIRR 
exceeding 
11% 
with 
a 
total project 
EIRR 
of 
13% 
(excluding 
environmental benefits). 
The replacement 
of block 
substations 
with 
BLS 
is 
expected 
to 
have a 
high 
rate 
of 
return 
(in 
excess 
of 
15%), 
consistent 
with 
the 
experience 
in 
Bank-funded projects 
in 
other countries. 
The 
primary 
source 
of 
savings 
comes 
from 
the 
fundamental design 
change 
from 
a 
constant 
flow, 
variable temperature 
design 
(as 
was 
the 
case 
in 
all 
of 
the 
Former Soviet 
Union) to 
a 
variable 
flow 
design 
as 
is 
the 
norm 
in 
Western 
European countries. 
This 
design 
change enables 
heat 
losses 
to 
be 
dramatically reduced. 
Water 
meters 
at 
the 
building 
level 
enable 
a 
reduction 
in 
nontechnical 
losses 
while piping 
improvements 
decrease 
the 
technical 
losses. 
Furthermore, 
it 
also 
enables 
new 
markets 
to 
develop 
by 
extending 
the 
season 
for 
those 
customers 
willing 
to pay 
for 
this 
service. 
Lower 
electricity 
and maintenance 
costs 
have 
a 
minor 
impact 
on 
the 
project 
benefits.

Annex 
5: 
Financial 
Summary 
LITHUANIA: 
Vilnius 
Heat 
Demand 
Management Project 
Factors 
relevant 
to 
the 
financial 
analysis 
of 
VE 
include: 
The single-part 
tariff 
in 
Vilnius 
set 
in 
1998 
was 
LTL 
108.8 
per 
MWh 
for residential 
customers. 
The 
company 
is 
aware that 
the 
current 
tariff 
structure 
does 
not 
cover 
its 
real 
costs 
(particularly 
cost 
recovery 
of 
fixed 
costs 
during 
warm 
winters).  The 
introduction 
of 
a two-part 
tariff 
structure 
is 
expected 
to 
improve 
this. 
The 
competitive 
environment 
within 
which 
VE 
operates 
is 
difficult 
because 
of 
the 
sharp 
challenge 
to 
district heating 
presented by 
suppliers 
of 
alternative 
heat 
sources, 
particularly 
gas. 
The 
research 
conducted 
on 
the company’s 
behalf 
confirms 
that 
it 
is 
likely 
to 
lose 
customers 
at 
an 
increasing rate 
if 
tariffs 
for 
heat 
rise 
faster 
than 
the 
consumer 
price 
index.  A 
key 
element 
of 
its 
survival 
strategy, 
therefore, 
will 
be 
to 
seek 
to 
use 
targeted 
investment 
to 
transform 
its 
cost 
paradigm 
so 
that 
tariffs 
can 
remain 
at 
or 
below 
their 
present 
level 
in 
real 
terms. 
By 
law, 
the 
Municipality 
of 
Vilnius 
constitutes 
the 
heating authority, 
and 
tariff 
applications to 
the 
Energy 
Price 
Commission 
(EPC) 
come 
from 
it 
rather than 
from 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
operator. 
This 
arrangement 
allows 
for 
a 
degree 
of 
political 
input 
into 
VE’s 
pricing 
strategy 
which 
could, 
in 
certain 
circumstances, 
prevent 
it 
from 
maintaining 
prices 
in 
real 
terms. 
The 
district 
heating 
company operated 
by 
VE 
is 
a reconstituted 
VDHC, from which 
its 
regional 
branches 
(serving communities 
which 
are 
physically 
separated 
from 
the 
Vilnius 
infrastructure) 
have 
been 
separated. 
While 
separation 
will 
pose 
major 
strategic and 
financial 
problems 
for 
the smaller 
communities 
(the 
transition 
will 
be 
supported separately 
by 
an 
ESMAP 
study), 
it 
has 
greatly 
assisted 
the 
financial 
position 
of 
VE. 
Financial 
Problem 
Areas 
Despite 
the 
recent 
signs 
of 
financial 
profitability, 
VE 
is 
still 
facing a 
number 
of 
legacy problems 
and 
it 
faces 
new 
challenges. 
If 
not 
countered, the 
combination 
of 
these 
is 
likely 
seriously 
to 
compromise 
its 
future financial 
performance, and 
could 
lead 
to 
an 
inability 
to 
fully 
service 
its 
debt 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance. 
Technical 
shortcomings: 
the 
impact 
of 
the technical characteristics 
of 
the 
company’s 
assets, 
including 
its 
CHP 
plant, 
its 
distribution 
networks and 
its 
substations, 
will 
be 
increasingly 
felt 
in 
financial 
terms. 
Shortcomings 
in 
the 
original 
design, 
compounded 
by 
the 
technical 
deficiencies 
of 
the 
heat 
installations 
within 
buildings 
will 
lead 
to 
increased operating 
costs, 
particularly 
maintenance 
costs, 
and 
to 
significant opportunity 
costs 
arising 
from 
the 
limited 
availability 
of 
the 
CHP 
plant 
to 
sell 
power 
to 
the 
national grid. 
Competition: 
VE 
is 
encountering new and 
increasingly effective 
competition 
from 
providers 
of 
alternative 
sources 
of 
heat, 
particularly 
natural 
gas. 
The 
greater 
flexibility 
and 
control 
which 
gas 
boilers 
provide 
to 
consumers 
will 
increasingly 
dislodge 
district 
heating customers 
from 
the 
network 
and erode 
VE’s 
revenue 
base. 
Research 
conducted 
by 
the 
consultants indicates that 
the 
disconnection 
rate 
would 
probably 
be 
1% 
of 
consumers 
per 
annum 
without 
improvements 
to 
the 
existing 
assets. 
The actual 
experience 
during 
2000 
suggests 
that disconnections 
are 
currently 
occurring 
at 
a 
substantially higher rate.

Tariff limitations: 
In 
these 
competitive conditions 
VE 
can 
not 
regard 
itself 
as 
having 
monopoly 
status 
in 
the 
Vilnius 
heat 
market, 
and 
will 
not 
be 
able 
to 
rely 
on 
regular 
tariff 
increases 
in 
real 
terms 
to cover 
the 
increased 
unit 
costs 
which 
will 
result 
from 
both 
of 
the 
above 
factors 
-- 
higher 
fixed 
operating 
costs 
and 
a narrower 
customer 
base. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
only 
pricing 
stance 
which 
will 
be 
compatible 
with 
VE’s 
profitable 
operation 
will 
be 
a 
strategy 
of 
unchanged 
real 
prices 
over 
the 
medium 
term. 
In 
order 
to 
provide 
incentives for 
customers 
to 
economize 
heat 
consumption 
(while 
not 
compromising 
VE’s 
ability 
to 
recover 
its 
fixed 
costs, 
particularly 
during 
mild 
winters), 
it 
will 
also 
be 
necessary 
to 
achieve 
continued 
real 
price 
stability 
within 
a two-part 
tariff 
environment 
of 
instead 
of 
the 
current single-part 
scheme. 
The 
impact 
of 
the 
Project 
on 
the 
financial 
position 
of 
VE 
The impact 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program on 
VE’s 
financial 
position 
is 
difficult 
to 
quantify 
at 
this 
stage, 
On 
the one 
hand, 
if 
15% 
or 
so 
of 
the 
households 
in 
Vilnius 
are 
enabled 
to control 
their 
heat 
consumption, 
there 
may 
be 
some 
tendency 
towards 
reduced heat 
sales. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
consumer 
preferences 
for 
greater 
comfort, 
at 
the 
discretion of 
the 
consumer, may 
tend 
to 
maintain 
consumption levels, 
particularly 
if 
the 
proposed 
two-part 
tariff 
has 
a 
high 
fixed 
element. 
Furthermore, 
the 
program 
may 
play 
an 
important 
part 
in 
affecting consumer perceptions 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
in 
Vilnius 
and 
thus 
help 
to 
slow 
down 
the 
rate 
of 
disconnections 
and/or 
facilitate 
the 
substation 
replacement 
program 
pursued 
by 
VE. 
The 
projections 
made 
by 
the 
consultants 
who 
prepared the 
earlier 
World 
Bank-financed 
rehabilitation 
project calculated 
that 
VDHC 
could 
expect 
significantly improved financial 
performance 
as 
a 
result 
primarily 
of 
rehabilitation 
investments 
in 
substations, 
heat-only 
boilers 
and the 
CHP 
facilities. 
At 
net 
profit 
level 
the 
improvement 
was 
projected 
to 
be 
of 
the 
order 
of 
LTL 
20 
million 
annually 
following 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
program, 
rising 
in 
later 
years 
as 
the 
customer 
base was 
stabilized 
and 
tariffs 
rose 
faster than operating 
costs. 
In 
general 
it 
seems 
likely 
that 
the 
factors mentioned 
above 
in 
relation to 
AL 
DSM 
investments 
will 
balance out, 
so 
that 
VE’s 
operating environment should 
be 
at 
least 
as 
good 
as 
was 
previously 
projected 
for 
VDHC, 
perhaps 
substantially 
better 
if 
the 
promised 
improvements 
in 
management 
performance, 
particularly 
in 
marketing 
and 
customer 
care, are

A 
General 
Procurement 
Notice 
containing 
information 
about 
bidding 
opportunities 
was 
published 
in 
the 
October 
2001 
issue 
of 
Development

(No.

in 
accordance 
with 
paras 
2.7 
and 
2.8 
of 
IBRD 
Guidelines 
and 
will 
be 
updated. 
Specific 
Procurement 
Notices 
will 
also 
be published, 
as 
appropriate, 
in 
Lithuanian 
newspapers 
of 
national 
circulation. 
Under 
the 
VCM-implemented 
Commercial 
Fund 
component, 
the 
procurement 
methods 
for 
goods 
and 
works 
are 
defined 
by 
the 
need 
for 
quick 
turnaround 
capability 
and the 
need 
to 
keep 
the 
transaction 
costs 
to 
a 
reasonable 
limit. 
In 
particular, 
the 
need 
for 
quick 
turnaround 
is 
key, 
given 
that 
the 
final 
contracting 
should 
be 
done 
in 
response 
to 
customer 
demand. 
The 
AL 
DSM 
Component WE-implemented) 
Supply 
and 
Installation 
The 
goods 
to be 
procured 
under 
ECP 
are 
represented 
by 
equipment 
and 
related 
incidental 
services 
(including 
installation) 
for 
demand-side 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
in 
the 
apartments. 
The 
measures 
cover 
installing 
thermostatic 
valves 
and 
cost 
allocators 
on 
room 
radiators, remote 
reading 
devices 
for 
hot 
water 
meters, 
and 
water 
flow 
balancing 
of 
the 
risers connecting the substation 
to 
the 
radiators. 
VE 
would 
like 
to 
proceed 
with 
the tender 
for 
the 
supply 
and 
installation 
of 
equipment 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
to 
limit 
the 
number 
of 
tenders 
to not 
more 
than 
two, 
totaling 
an 
estimated 
US$10 
million. 
The 
methods 
of 
procurement agreed between 
VE 
and 
the 
Bank include: International Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB) 
in 
case 
VE 
would 
like 
to 
have 
only 
one 
contract, 
and 
own 
procedures 
of 
VE 
for 
contracts 
for 
goods 
and 
works 
in 
amounts 
not 
exceeding 
US$5 
million, 
provided 
that 
these 
procedures 
will 
ensure 
a 
transparent 
competitive 
process 
of 
seelung 
bids and evaluation 
of 
bids 
based 
on 
pre-disclosed 
clear 
bid 
evaluation 
criteria 
for 
award 
of 
contract 
to 
the 
lowest evaluated responsive bidder. The 
contractors 
and 
suppliers 
selected for 
award 
should 
have 
adequate 
financial 
and 
technical 
resources 
to 
perform 
the 
contract 
satisfactorily. 
VE 
and 
any 
of 
its 
affiliates 
and 
shareholders 
are 
not eligible 
to 
bid 
for 
the 
contracts, 
The 
Bank 
will 
review 
the 
procurement 
documents 
for compliance 
with 
these 
principles. 
The 
GEF 
contribution 
would 
be 
not 
more 
than 
$2.5 
million 
(of 
which 
$1.25 
million 
would 
be 
released 
only 
after 
a 
satisfactory 
mid-term 
review). 
The 
VCM-imolemented 
Components 
Works 
(and 
Goods) 
The 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
(US$ 
3 
million) 
would 
finance investments 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements 
in 
buildings. 
These 
investments 
would 
capitalize 
the 
revolving 
fund 
owned 
by 
the 
Municipality 
and 
operated 
by 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
Manager (Management 
Contractor, 
see 
below). 
The works to be procured 
by 
the 
ECP 
Management 
Contractor 
on 
behalf 
of 
VCM 
are 
represented 
by 
demand-side 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
in 
the 
residential buildings 
and 
apartments. 
The 
measures 
would 
- 
49 
- 
Page  54
cover 
replacement 
and 
refurbishment 
of 
windows, thermal 
insulation 
of 
walls and 
roofs, 
etc. 
The 
supply 
will 
include 
materials 
and 
goods 
(e.g., 
new windows) 
as 
necessary. 
The 
exact 
scope 
of 
investments 
will 
be 
chosen 
based 
on 
the proposals 
received 
under 
the 
tender 
for 
the 
ECP Management 
Contractor 
and 
will 
ultimately depend 
on 
the 
demand 
by 
the apartment owners, 
who 
would 
select 
the 
content 
of 
the 
investments 
for 
which 
they 
are 
paying. 
The 
recipient 
of 
the 
GEF 
grant 
(VCM) would follow 
national 
competitive 
bidding 
procurement 
methods 
modified 
to 
meet 
the 
above-mentioned 
special 
needs 
of 
ECP. Under 
this 
modified 
NCB 
method, 
ECP Management Contractor acting 
on 
behalf 
of 
VCM 
would 
annually 
publish 
a procurement 
notice 
nationally, 
inviting 
bidders for 
rate 
contracts 
for 
standard 
works and 
goods 
(with 
installation) 
as 
appropriate. 
Rate 
contracts 
would 
not 
specify quantities 
to 
be 
procured, 
but 
estimates 
may 
be 
specified, 
if 
practical. The 
bidders would 
be 
asked 
to 
indicate 
unit 
prices 
(without 
any 
assurance 
of 
quantities that 
may 
be 
awarded 
as 
the 
quantities 
are 
not 
known 
at the 
time 
of 
invitation) valid for 
a 
period 
not 
less 
than 
one year, 
and 
ECP 
Management 
Contractor 
would 
enter 
into 
rate contracts 
with 
the 
first 
three 
lowest 
responsive 
bidders 
that 
are 
within 
15% 
of 
the 
lowest 
bid.  The 
Management Contractor 
would 
conclude 
separate 
contracts 
for 
specific quantities when 
demand 
arises 
during 
the 
rate contract period.  The 
Management 
Contractor 
will 
assist 
the homeowners 
in 
obtaining 
the 
equipment and related 
incidental 
services 
from one 
of 
the 
three 
firms 
that 
has 
a rate contract 
with 
Management Contractor, 
on 
terms 
and 
conditions 
specified 
in 
the 
rate contract. 
Each 
beneficiary 
would 
thus 
not 
have 
to 
negotiate contract 
terms 
with 
multiple 
suppliers. 
This 
approach 
would 
allow 
Management Contractor to 
limit 
the 
frequency 
of 
tendering 
to 
one 
time 
a 
year and 
to 
benefit 
from 
the economies 
of 
scale. 
The 
total 
aggregate amount 
of 
equipment procured under 
NCB 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
$3 
million. 
Consultants Services 
The 
consulting 
services 
will 
be 
procured 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Quality- 
and 
Cost-based 
Selection 
(QCBS). 
Least-cost selection 
will 
be 
allowed 
for 
financial 
audits 
up 
to 
an 
aggregate 
limit 
of 
$100,000, 
and 
a 
separate 
allowance 
of 
$100,000 
will 
be 
made 
for individual 
consultants. 
The 
ECP 
Munagement Contract 
(US$500,000) 
is 
needed 
to 
assist 
the 
Municipality 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Commercial 
Fund. 
The 
Management 
Contractor 
(MC) 
would 
be selected 
according 
to 
QCBS 
and 
would 
have 
procurement 
specialists 
familiar 
with 
the 
Bank's procurement guidelines. 
Preferably, 
an 
energy 
service company 
(ESCO) 
would 
be 
hired 
to 
work 
as 
the 
Management Contractor. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
of 
Global 
Environmental 
Benefits 
(US$200,000) 
would 
be 
carried out 
under 
the 
Municipality's 
oversight 
to 
focus 
on 
quantifying 
the 
energy savings and associated 
GHG 
savings 
and 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
ECP. 
Information 
dissemination for 
barrier removal 
would 
be 
an 
integral 
element 
of 
this 
component. 
Administration 
of 
ECP 
by 
the Municipality 
This 
allocation 
would 
cover: 
(a) 
the 
Incremental 
Operating 
Costs 
(US$ 
100,000) 
to 
help 
VCM 
to meet 
the 
expenditures 
for 
contractual 
staff, 
office 
supplies, 
transportation, advertising, 
marketing, 
public 
relations 
and other 
public 
outreach 
effort, 
as 
well 
as 
training for financial 
staff; 
(b) 
the 
costs 
of 
financial 
audits 
of 
the 
GEF 
project 
accounts 
(up 
to 
$100,000 
for 
consultant contract under LCS); 
and 
(c) 
individual 
consultant 
services 
for 
a 
total 
of 
up 
to 
$100,000. 
Institutional 
Capacity 
Building 
in 
Procurement 
An 
assessment 
of 
VE 
capacity 
to 
implement project 
procurement 
was 
completed 
in 
2002, 
and 
a 
similar 
review 
was 
undertaken 
in 
April 
2003 
for 
VCM. 
This 
review 
addressed 
the 
legal 
aspects, 
procurement 
Page  55
cycle 
management, organization 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
PIU, 
support and 
control 
systems, 
record 
keeping, 
and 
staffing. 
Based 
on 
the 
assessment, 
VE 
and 
VCM 
have 
adequate 
capacity to conduct procurement 
under 
this 
project, 
and 
the 
risk 
level 
is 
average. 
Prior 
Review 
For 
the 
VE-implemented part, 
the 
Banks prior 
review 
would 
include 
the 
full 
review 
of 
all 
contracts 
(in 
practice, 
this 
will 
be 
limited 
to two 
contracts executed 
under 
VE's 
own 
procurement rules 
or, 
alternatively, 
one 
comprehensive 
ICB 
contract). 
For 
the 
VCM-implemented 
part, 
prior 
review 
would 
apply 
to 
the 
first 
three contracts 
in 
the 
first 
year 
and 
the 
first 
contract 
in 
the 
following 
years 
procured under 
the 
modified 
NCB 
procedure, and 
all 
the 
consultant 
contracts 
procured through QCBS. The 
Bank 
will 
also 
review, 
regardless 
of 
the 
value 
and 
the 
financier, 
terms 
of 
reference 
of 
all 
consultants.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
The 
financial 
management 
assessment 
was 
performed and 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
are 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Country 
Issues. 
In 
2002, 
the 
Bank conducted 
an 
Accounting 
and 
Auditing 
Report 
on 
the 
Observance 
of 
Standards and 
Codes 
(ROSC) 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
concluded, 
amongst 
other 
things, 
that 
although 
compliance 
with 
IAS 
(International 
Accounting 
Standards, 
including 
International 
Financial 
Reporting 
Standards) 
is 
required 
by 
law 
for 
listed 
companies, banks 
and other 
public 
joint 
stock 
companies, 
the 
enforcement 
and 
monitoring 
of 
compliance 
with 
IAS 
needed 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
In 
addition 
the 
ROSC 
confirmed 
that 
the 
audit 
of 
such 
financial 
statements 
must be carried out by 
qualified 
auditors 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
Lithuanian 
standards 
that 
are 
based 
on 
International 
Standards 
on 
Auditing 
(ISA). 
Finally, 
the 
ROSC 
concluded 
that 
whilst 
many 
audit 
firms 
make 
efforts 
to carry 
out 
audits 
in 
accordance 
with 
ISA, 
there 
are 
variations 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
such 
audits 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
some 
audits 
is 
affected 
by 
enterprises’ 
attitudes 
and misconceptions about the 
role 
of 
audits. 
In 
recognition 
of 
these 
issues, 
it 
has 
been agreed 
that 
VE 
and 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
will 
prepare 
financial 
statements 
in 
accordance 
with 
IAS 
and, 
along 
with 
the 
project, 
be 
audited 
in 
accordance 
with ISA by 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
accordance 
with 
terms 
of 
reference acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
The 
banking 
sector 
in 
Lithuania 
has 
made 
substantial 
progress 
and 
undergone 
continued 
consolidation 
since 
the 
1995 
banking 
crisis. 
The 
tighten supervision exercised 
by 
the 
Bank 
of 
Lithuania 
(Central 
Bank) 
and tougher 
regulatory 
framework 
have 
proved 
beneficial. 
Accordingly, 
VCM 
will 
open 
its 
Special 
Accounts 
and 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
will 
open the 
bank 
accounts 
for 
the 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
components 
in 
commercial banks 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Strengths 
and 
weaknesses. 
Strengths 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
arrangements include 
the 
oversight 
of 
VE 
by 
its 
parent 
company 
as 
well 
as 
the 
review 
of 
the 
VCM 
by 
its 
internal control 
department. 
Weaknesses 
relate to 
the 
uncertainty regarding 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
of 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund. 
Implementing 
entities. 
VE 
and 
VCM will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
of 
their respective 
components 
and 
will 
utilize 
their 
existing staff 
and 
accounting 
systems, 
albeit 
with 
some 
modifications 
both 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the Bank’s disbursement requirements 
and 
to 
enable 
project-specific reporting. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
to 
be 
hired by 
VCM 
during project 
implementation 
to 
implement 
the 
ECP 
Commercial Fund component 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management arrangements 
of 
that 
component. 
Prior 
to 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
Fund 
Manager, 
the 
VCM 
will 
assess 
and 
seek 
the 
Bank’s no-objection 
to 
the 
Fund 
Manager’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements. 
Disbursement 
by 
the 
Bank 
to 
VCM 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
ECP Commercial Fund 
component 
is 
conditional 
upon 
the 
selection 
of 
a 
Fund 
Manager acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Funds 
flow. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VE 
components, 
Bank 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
either 
directly 
from 
the 
Bank to 
suppliers 
based 
upon 
payment requests 
from 
VE 
or 
from 
the 
Bank 
to 
VE 
on 
a 
reimbursement 
basis 
to 
reimburse 
VE 
for eligible 
expenditures. 
VE 
will 
provide 
counterpart 
funds 
from 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Fund. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VCM 
components, 
GEF 
funds 
will 
flow 
from 
the 
Bank, either 
via 
a 
single 
Special 
Page  61
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications. The 
GEF 
funds 
for 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
will 
be 
transferred 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
to 
a 
special purpose 
bank 
account 
in 
commercial bank acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
that 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
Fund 
Manager 
but 
retained 
in 
the 
name 
of 
VCM. 
Repayments 
associated 
with 
the 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
will 
be 
accumulated 
in 
a 
separate 
bank 
account 
and 
will 
be 
used 
for 
further 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
on 
a 
revolving 
basis. 
Counterpart 
funds 
will 
be 
provided 
by VCM, 
final 
beneficiaries, 
commercial 
banks, and 
international 
donors. 
Audit Report 
Staffing. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VE 
components, 
the 
vice president for 
financial 
matters 
is 
responsible for 
the 
project's 
financial 
management. 
He 
is 
also 
supervising 
the 
Financial Director, 
Chief 
Accountant 
and 
the 
Head 
of 
the 
Billing 
Department.  The 
organizational structure 
of 
the 
financial 
division 
is 
also 
supported 
by 
the 
Financial 
Controller. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VCM, 
the 
VCM 
has 
identified 
three accountants 
who 
will 
be 
specifically 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
and 
who 
appear 
to 
have 
appropriate credentials. 
Due 
Date 
Accounting 
policies 
and procedures. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VE 
components, 
accounting 
books 
and 
records 
are 
maintained 
on 
an 
accruals 
basis 
and 
VE 
has 
documented 
its 
accounting 
policies, 
procedures 
and 
internal controls 
in 
a 
project financial 
accounting 
manual. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
VCM, 
accounting 
books 
and 
records 
are 
maintained 
on 
a 
modified 
cash 
basis 
and 
it 
has 
also 
documented 
its 
accounting 
policies, 
procedures 
and 
internal 
controls 
in 
a 
separate 
project financial 
accounting 
manual.

Reporting 
and 
Monitoring. 
The 
information 
systems 
of 
both 
VE 
and 
VCM 
will 
enable 
them 
to 
produce 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs) every 
three 
months throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project 
in 
accordance 
with 
indicative 
formats 
agreed 
upon during 
negotiations 
and 
included 
with 
their 
respective 
accounting manuals. 
Information 
systems. 
VE 
has 
a 
relatively 
new 
information 
system 
that 
includes 
functionality 
enabling 
it 
to 
create 
separate 
activity 
codes 
to identify 
project-specific 
transactions, 
generate 
a 
trial 
balance 
for 
the 
project, 
and 
produce 
project 
financial 
statements. 
VCM 
also 
has 
a 
relatively 
new 
accounting 
and 
management 
information 
system 
introduced 
in 
2000 
that 
enables 
it 
to create separate 
activity 
codes 
and 
track 
and 
report 
on 
the 
project. 
Supervision 
Plan. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
the 
Bank 
will 
supervise 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
in 
two 
main 
ways: 
(i) 
review 
the 
project’s quarterly 
financial 
management 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
the 
project’s 
annual 
audited 
financial 
statements and 
auditor’s management letter; and 
(ii) 
during 
the 
Bank’s 
supervision 
missions, 
review 
the 
project’s financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
SOEs 
and movements 
on 
the 
Special 
Account) 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Banks minimum 
requirements. 
As 
required, 
a 
Bank-accredited 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
will 
assist 
in 
the 
supervision 
process.

Audit 
Arrangements 
See 
above 
3. 
Disbursement Arrangements 
The 
project’s 
flow 
of 
funds 
are 
described elsewhere 
in 
this Annex. 
Bank 
funds 
for 
the 
VE 
components 
will 
be 
disbursed either 
directly from 
the 
Bank 
to suppliers 
based 
upon 
payment 
requests 
from 
VE 
or 
from 
the 
Bank to 
VE 
on 
a 
reimbursement 
basis. 
Bank 
funds 
for 
the 
VCM 
components 
will 
be 
disbursed under 
the 
Bank’s  transactional  procedures 
including 
SOEs 
and 
direct 
payments. 
Supporting documentation 
for 
SOEs, 
including 
completion 
reports 
and 
certificates, 
will 
be 
retained  by 
the 
Borrower 
and 
made 
available  to  the 
Bank 
during 
project 
supervision. 
Disbursements 
for 
expenditures 
above 
the 
SOE 
thresholds 
will 
be 
made 
against 
presentation 
of 
full 
documentation 
relating 
to 
those 
expenditures. 
There 
is 
no 
plan to 
disburse 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
periodic 
reports 
for 
either 
the 
VE 
or 
VCM 
components.

Incremental 
Cost 
Analysis 
Summary 
LITHUANIA 
Vilnius 
Heat Demand 
Management 
Project 
Scope 
of 
Analysis 
The 
incremental 
cost 
analysis 
implemented to 
justify 
the 
GEF 
support 
to 
the 
project 
focuses 
on 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
on 
the 
demand side. 
The 
energy savings are 
categorized 
as 
direct 
and 
indirect 
(or 
downstream) 
energy 
savings. 
The direct 
savings 
are 
due 
to 
investments 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
project 
such 
as: 
(i) 
improvements 
to 
the 
apartment-level heating 
systems 
(thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
and 
heat 
cost 
allocators) 
with 
simultaneous 
introduction 
of 
billing 
based 
on 
actual heat consumption 
by 
each 
apartment; and 
(ii) 
building-envelope 
improvements, 
including window 
replacement 
and 
better 
insulation 
of 
walls 
and 
roofs. 
These savings have been 
estimated 
in 
this 
analysis. 
The 
indirect 
energy 
savings are 
due 
to 
additional 
benefits 
as 
a result 
of: 
(i) 
accelerated implementation 
of 
VE's 
core 
program 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
building-level 
substations 
(BLS) 
coming 
to 
replace 
the 
group 
(or 
block) substations 
with 
the simultaneous 
reconfiguration 
of 
the 
distribution 
network 
from 
a 
four-pipe 
system 
to a 
two-pipe 
one; 
(ii) 
accelerated 
implementation 
of 
VE's 
program 
of 
upgrading 
of 
old-type 
building-level substations 
by 
replacing 
of 
tube heat exchangers 
with 
plate heat-exhangers 
and 
introduction 
of 
automatic 
temperature 
control; 
(iii) 
savings due 
to 
avoided 
disconnections 
from 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
as 
it 
is 
believed 
that 
district 
heat 
is 
the most 
energy-efficient 
option 
in 
a 
high 
heat 
load 
density 
area 
such 
as 
Vilnius 
City; (iv) 
stimulating impact 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
market 
of 
DSM 
equipment 
in 
Lithuania 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which, 
when 
the 
initial 
seed 
money 
from 
GEF 
and 
EEF 
is 
spent, 
the 
market 
price 
of 
DSM 
equipment 
and services 
will 
decrease 
to 
a 
level 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
broader 
introduction 
of 
DSM 
on 
a 
fully 
commercial 
basis; 
(v) demonstration 
effect 
of 
the 
project 
leading 
to 
its 
replication 
that 
results 
in 
further 
GHG 
reductions. 
Of 
these 
indirect 
savings, 
the 
first two 
have 
been 
estimated. 
The 
other 
three 
are 
believed 
to 
be 
similar or 
larger 
in 
magnitude 
but 
too 
difficult 
to 
quantify 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
analysis. 
The 
global environmental 
impact 
from 
the 
project 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fuel 
and 
associated 
GHG 
emission 
savings that 
would 
not 
have 
been 
feasible outside 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
relationship 
with 
the 
supply-side 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
is 
based 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
these 
savings 
on 
the 
heat 
production 
needs 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
(VE). 
The 
costs 
of 
VE's 
program 
of 
investments 
in 
the 
generation 
capacities 
such 
as 
the 
CHP 
rehabilitation 
and 
the 
replacement 
of 
HOBS 
are 
considered 
not 
to 
be 
affected 
and 
remain 
outside 
the system 
boundary 
of 
the analysis. 
The current 
fuel 
mix 
used 
by 
the 
district 
heating 
system 
(about 
90% 
gas 
and 
10% 
heavy 
fuel 
oil) 
is 
potentially 
subject to fluctuations depending 
on 
the 
relative prices 
for 
gas 
and 
oil 
products. 
However, 
both 
the 
project 
and 
the 
baseline 
(the 
"without-project" 
scenario) 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
uncertainty 
in 
this 
respect and 
thus 
the 
impact 
of 
this variable 
on 
the 
incremental 
cost 
analysis 
is 
considered 
minimal. 
Baseline 
The 
baseline 
scenario 
is 
built 
on 
the 
assumption 
that 
VE 
would 
continue 
its 
operation 
in 
the 
conditions 
of 
a 
declining 
demand 
for 
its 
heat. 
The company 
would 
continue 
replacing 
group substations with 
building-level 
substations, 
but 
the progress 
of 
the 
program 
would 
be 
hampered 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
incentives 
for 
the homeowners 
to 
accept 
the 
replacements 
(as 
noted before, the 
heating 
bill 
would 
increase 
for 
the 
majority of 
the 
customers 
currently receiving 
heat 
from 
group substations 
- 
Le., 
for 
60% 
of 
the 
DH 
customers 
in 
Vilnius). 
This 
would 
result 
in 
the 
replacement 
of 
about 
100 
group substations 
by 
some 
1,500 
new 
building-level 
substations 
(in 
about 
60% 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
buildings) 
by 
2015. 
This 
- 
66 
- 
Page  71
estimate 
is 
somewhat 
higher than 
the 
VDHC's original plan to 
replace 
the 
group substations 
by 
2015 
(50%), 
but 
lower 
than 
the one 
under 
the 
GEF 
project 
scenario 
as 
the 
substation 
replacement program 
would 
still 
be 
passively 
resisted 
by 
a 
substantial 
number 
of 
customers. 
Higher 
replacement 
rates have 
been 
modeled 
as 
sensitivity 
analysis 
cases. 
The 
50% 
success 
rate 
was 
based 
on 
experience 
over 
the 
past 
three 
years 
in 
substation 
replacements 
of 
about 
3-5 
group substations 
per 
year, 
each 
group 
substation 
being 
replaced 
with 
15 
building-level 
substations 
on 
average. 
In 
addition, 
230 
building-level 
substation 
upgrades 
(or 
about 
10% 
of 
the 
potential total 
number) 
would 
be 
implemented 
by 
VE 
(and 
possibly 
other 
actors 
in 
the 
market) 
in 
the 
buildings 
currently supplied 
from 
old-type 
buildling-level 
substations 
without 
temperature 
control. 
The penetration 
of 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves and heat 
cost 
allocators 
would 
be 
limited 
to 
10% 
of 
the 
apartments 
of 
the 
City 
(most 
likely, 
concentrating 
in 
the 
homes 
of 
high-income 
families). 
Other 
demand-side energy 
conservation 
measures 
would 
also be 
practiced 
on 
a 
limited 
scale. 
Broader 
penetration 
of 
these measures 
would 
be constrained 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
incentives 
for 
such 
measures 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
individual 
billing 
and 
customer-controlled 
heat 
supply 
at 
the 
apartment 
level. 
GEF 
Proposed 
Project 
The 
GEF 
project's 
objective 
is 
to 
reduce 
the 
emissions 
of 
greenhouse 
gases 
(GHG) 
from 
the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating 
System through 
a targeted 
effort 
to 
remove 
the 
existing 
barriers 
to 
energy 
conservation. 
This 
would 
be 
achieved by 
means 
of 
introducing 
demand-side 
management 
(DSM) 
measures 
such 
as 
thermostatically 
controlled radiator 
valves 
and 
heat 
meters 
in 
Vilnius 
households 
to 
enable 
consumption-based 
billing 
at 
the 
individual 
apartment 
level, 
as 
well 
as 
building-envelope 
improvements 
to 
reduce 
energy 
losses 
from 
the 
residential housing stock supported 
by 
a 
specially 
created 
commercially 
sustainable 
(revolving) 
financial 
facility. 
As discussed 
above 
(under "Scope 
of 
Analysis"), 
besides 
direct 
emission 
reductions 
from 
these measures, 
additional 
benefits 
are 
expected 
through accelerated 
implementation 
of 
VE' 
s 
core 
program 
of 
modernizing 
the heat 
exchanger 
substation 
network, 
through 
avoided disconnections 
from 
the 
district 
heating 
system, 
and through 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
market price 
of 
DSM 
equipment and 
services, 
which 
will 
decrease 
to 
a 
level 
sufficient 
to 
enable 
broader introduction 
of 
DSM 
on 
a 
fully 
commercial 
basis. 
VE-implemented Apartment-level 
DSM 
(AL 
DSM) 
component. 
The 
barrier 
removal effort 
will 
begin 
with 
GEF's 
support to VE-implemented 
introduction 
of 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves 
(TCV), 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
(HCA) 
and 
billing 
based 
on 
the 
actual consumption 
by 
each 
apartment. 
Thus, 
both 
the 
technical 
possibility 
and 
incentives 
will 
be 
created 
for 
the homeowners 
to 
save 
heat. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
AL 
DSM 
devices 
will 
first 
be 
introduced 
in 
500-600 
buildings 
over 
five 
years 
(2003-2007), 
and 
then 
VEs 
program 
will 
be 
expanded 
to 
a 
similar 
number 
of 
buildings 
in 
the 
following 
several 
years. The 
direct 
GHG 
savings 
from 
this 
intervention 
are 
estimated 
at 
about 
240,000 
tons 
of 
C02. 
The 
indirect 
impacts 
could 
produce 
further 
emission reductions: 
(i) 
The active 
participation 
of 
the 
heat 
supplier 
in 
this 
heat 
demand 
management 
program 
would 
have a 
powerful 
demonstration 
effect and 
would 
set 
a 
replicable 
example for 
district 
heat 
suppliers 
elsewhere; 
(ii) 
The 
participation 
of 
other 
suppliers of 
AL 
DSM 
will 
be 
facilitated 
by reduced prices 
resulting 
from 
the 
initial 
push 
that 
the 
VE/GEF 
program 
will 
have 
on 
the 
market. 
These 
impacts 
are 
likely to 
produce 
similar 
or 
greater 
GHG 
emission 
reductions 
downstream than 
the 
direct 
reductions. 
Higher 
penetration 
rate 
of 
the 
VE-implemented 
substation 
modernization. 
Surveys have 
shown 
that 
more 
customers 
are 
willing 
to 
accept 
the 
substation replacement 
program 
when 
it 
is 
combined with 
the 
improvements at 
the 
apartment-level (thermostatic valves and 
heat 
cost 
allocators), 
which 
enables 
billing 
based 
on 
the 
actual 
heat 
consumption by 
each 
apartment. 
Thus, 
the 
GEF 
support 
to 
the 
AL 
DSM 
component 
is 
expected 
to 
increase the 
penetration rate 
of 
the substation replacement program, 
resulting 
in 
the 
replacement 
of 
a 
larger number 
of 
group substations than 
would 
be 
the 
case 
in 
the 
baseline 
- 
67 
- 
Page  72
scenario. 
In 
the 
project 
scenario, 
the replacement 
of 
90% 
group 
substations 
currently 
owned 
by 
the 
City 
with 
about 
2,260 
new 
building-level 
substations 
would 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
year 
2008. 
Lower 
replacement 
rates 
have 
been 
simulated 
in 
the 
sensitivity 
analysis. As a 
result 
of 
the 
faster 
and 
broader 
expansion 
of 
the 
substation modernization 
program, the 
losses 
in 
the 
heat 
supply 
networks 
will 
be 
reduced, 
with 
major 
fuel 
and 
GHG 
emission 
savings. 
The 
upgrades 
of 
the 
existing 
BLS 
to 
modern 
technology can 
also 
be 
expected 
to 
expand, 
with 
about 
690 
upgrades 
implemented 
by 
2008. 
The 
simulation 
model 
predicts 
possible 
emission 
savings 
of 
up to 
0.9 
million 
tons 
of 
C02 
over the 
period 
until 
2020 
due 
to 
the 
stimulating impact 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
AL 
DSM 
on 
the 
substation 
modernization 
program. 
Demand-side 
management 
measures 
in 
buildings 
and 
apartments. 
Once 
the 
building-level 
substations 
are 
installed, 
the 
customer-controlled mode 
of 
operation 
of 
the 
substations 
enables 
further 
energy savings 
in 
the 
buildings 
and 
in 
the apartments. 
These 
savings 
are 
only 
possible after 
the 
substation 
replacements 
and 
thus 
they 
depend, 
first 
of 
all, 
on 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
replacements. 
Further, 
the 
AL 
DSM 
and 
individual 
consumption-based 
billing 
enhance 
the incentives for 
energy saving. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
most 
basic 
energy 
conserving behavior 
(such 
as 
avoiding 
keeping 
the 
windows 
open 
when 
not 
necessary) 
would 
be practiced 
widely 
(in 
80% 
of 
apartments 
in 
buildings 
where 
modern 
BLS 
are 
installed). 
For 
further 
cost-effective 
measures 
(such 
as 
weatherization 
of 
windows 
and 
further 
expansion 
of 
the 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
installation 
program), 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
VCM-contracted ECP 
Manager 
will 
offer 
its 
services 
paid for 
by 
the 
customers 
through 
a 
crediting 
scheme 
with 
the 
repayment 
fees 
going 
from 
the 
homeowners 
into 
the 
revolving 
Energy 
Conservation 
Fund 
(ECF). Measures 
with 
relatively 
high 
capital 
costs 
and 
longer 
payback 
(replacement 
of 
windows 
to install 
new 
energy-efficient 
windows; 
insulation 
of 
walls 
and roofs, 
etc.) 
would 
be 
demanded 
by 
the customers 
and supported 
by 
the 
ECP 
only 
if 
found 
commercially viable. 
From 
the 
customer's 
perspective, 
this 
would 
be the 
case 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
value 
derived from 
the investment 
(including 
savings 
on 
the energy 
bill) 
would justify 
the 
investment 
costs 
involved. 
In 
aggregate, 
emission 
savings 
of 
more than 
0.6 
million 
tons 
of 
C02 
are 
expected 
over 
the 
period 
until 
2020 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
DSM 
measures 
in 
buildings 
and 
apartments. 
The 
table 
below 
summarizes 
the 
projected direct 
impact 
of 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
in

of 
C02 
emission reductions 
achieved 
over 
the 
period 
until 
2020 
as

of 
investments implemented

project.

The 
Costs 
of 
Barrier 
Removal 
The 
lack 
of 
acceptance 
of 
the 
VE-implemented 
substation 
replacement program 
by 
the 
homeowners 
is 
the 
main barrier 
to 
BLS 
penetration 
as 
the customers 
who 
do 
not 
introduce additional 
DSM 
measures 
are 
generally 
facing 
higher 
energy 
bills. This 
resistance, 
as 
well 
as 
the decentralized structure 
of 
ownership 
and 
decision-making 
lead to 
high 
transaction 
costs 
of 
obtaining 
the 
agreement 
to 
implement 
the 
needed 
investments. 
To 
stimulate 
the 
customer 
buy-in 
to 
the 
substation replacement program, 
VE 
will 
offer 
to 
the 
homeowners 
standard 
packages 
of 
heating 
system 
improvement 
(including 
TCV 
and 
HCA) 
at 
the 
apartment-level. 
To 
help 
VE 
bear 
the 
financial 
burden 
of 
these 
improvements 
and 
partially 
compensate 
VE 
for 
the 
possible 
loss 
of 
sales 
revenues 
resulting 
from 
these 
DSM 
improvements, the 
CEF 
is 
asked 
to 
provide US$2.5 
million 
designated 
for 
grantdsubsidies under 
the 
Energy Conservation Program. 
The 
introduction 
of 
individualized 
billing 
for 
heat 
that 
will 
accompany 
the 
introduction 
of 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
will 
provide 
a 
further 
incentive 
to 
the 
homeowners to 
accept the 
BLS, 
without 
which 
the 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
would 
not 
be 
technically 
possible. 
By 
utilizing 
the 
means 
of 
the 
subsidy 
fund 
of 
the ECP, 
VE 
also 
addresses 
another 
key 
barrier 
- 
that 
of the 
inability 
of 
many low-income 
consumers 
to 
pay 
the 
full 
price 
of 
the 
apartment-level 
DSM 
equipment 
that 
will 
make 
the 
whole 
system 
more 
efficient 
in 
the 
long 
run. 
The 
GEF 
contribution 
of 
$2.5 
million 
would 
be 
provided 
on 
the 
condition 
of 
co-financing 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program 
by 
VE 
at 
a 
high 
leveraging 
ratio 
(about 
15). 
In 
the 
pilot 
phase 
starting 
in 
2003, 
$1.25 
million 
from 
the 
GEF 
will 
leverage about 
US$6 
million from 
VE. 
Another 
essential 
incremental cost component supported 
by 
GEF 
is 
the cost 
of 
administration 
of 
the 
Energy Conservation 
Program. 
This 
consists 
of 
the 
ECP 
management costs 
for 
the 
Municipality 
(US$0.3 
million) 
and 
the 
costs 
of 
services 
of 
the ECP 
management 
contractor 
(US$0.5 
million). 
Finally, 
Monitoring 
Evaluation 
and 
Information 
Dissemination 
(US$0.2 million) 
bring 
the 
total 
GEF 
grant 
amount 
(excluding 
the 
capital 
of 
the 
revolving 
fund) 
to 
US$3.5 
million:

These

be

by 
the 
GEF. 
They 
address 
the

that 
stand 
in 
the way 
of 
deeper 
and 
broader market penetration

Energy Conservation 
Fund 
(ECF). 
The 
revolving fund 
created 
from 
the customers’ repayments 
for 
the 
VCM-administered 
part 
of 
the 
project would 
ensure 
the 
continuity 
of 
the 
Energy 
Conservation 
Program. 
By 
setting up a 
financial 
facility 
to support 
DSM 
investments by 
the 
customers, 
the 
Municipality 
addresses 
such 
a 
barrier 
as 
the 
lack 
of 
commercial 
credit 
for 
many customers 
who have 
no 
collateral 
against the 
risk 
of 
default. 
The 
GEF 
funding 
through 
the ECP, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
money accumulated 
in 
the 
fund 
from 
the 
return 
cashflow 
from 
the 
homeowners, 
would 
be 
used 
to finance 
additional 
energy 
conservation 
measures. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
Project 
will 
sustain 
the 
collaborative 
engagement 
of 
public 
authorities 
(the 
Municipality) 
and 
private participants 
in 
the 
market 
working 
together 
to 
promote a comprehensive 
heat 
demand 
management 
program 
for 
the 
Vilnius 
City. 
Project 
investments 
Substation investments 
The 
inclusion 
of 
the barrier removal 
measures 
estimated 
to 
cost about 
US$3.5 
million 
(without 
discounting) 
allows 
increasing 
the 
market penetration 
of 
the 
BLS 
technology. The 
relationship 
between 
the 
costs for 
barrier 
removal 
and 
the 
market 
penetration 
of 
BLS 
has 
not 
been 
quantified 
precisely, 
but 
the 
incremental cost 
model utilized 
for 
this 
analysis 
helps estimate 
the basic 
dimensions 
under 
certain 
working 
assumptions. 
Additional 
replacement 
of 
group 
substations 
with 
BLS 
and 
upgrades 
of 
old-type 
BLS. 
The 
return 
on 
the 
marginal 
investment to replace group 
substations 
with 
BLS 
is 
about 16-19%. 
As 
noted 
above, 
the 
installation 
of 
some 
1,500 
BLS 
replacing 
group substations 
is 
considered part 
of 
the baseline 
scenario. 
Achieving 
a target 
of 
2,260 substations 
would 
bring 
an 
additional reduction 
of 
C02 
emissions 
by 
about 
700,000 
tons 
due 
to 
the 
additional network 
loss 
reductions 
(see 
Table 
A4-1 
above). 
The 
upgrades 
of 
the 
existing 
BLS 
to 
modern technology 
can also be 
expected to 
expand. 
An 
increased 
penetration of 
the 
upgrades 
from 
230 
buildings 
to 
690 buildings 
(10% 
and 
30% 
of 
the 
market, 
respectively) 
brings 
emission reductions 
of 
about 
210,000 tons 
of 
C02. 
Even 
though 
the 
rate 
of 
return 
is 
above the 
discount 
rate 
of 
12%, the 
additional 
substation 
replacement 
investments 
(including 
the 
barrier 
removal 
costs) 
are 
considered part 
of 
the 
project 
costs 
rather 
than 
the 
baseline. The 
assumption 
of 
additionality 
of 
these 
costs rests 
on 
the 
following 
considerations: 
(i) 
the 
initial 
increase 
of 
the 
heat 
bill 
for 60% 
of 
the 
DH 
customers 
is 
a 
barrier 
for 
the 
acceptance 
of 
the 
program 
by 
the 
customers; 
(ii) 
the nature 
of 
the 
barrier 
removal 
measures makes 
them 
unlikely 
to 
be 
implemented 
outside 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
proposed 
project.

The 
high 
economic 
return 
on 
the 
substation 
investments should 
not 
mask 
the 
fact 
that, 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
reduced 
losses 
in 
the 
system, 
the 
introduction 
of 
modern 
BLS 
opens 
up 
the opportunities 
for 
the 
consumers 
to 
reduce 
heat 
consumption 
and 
thus 
heat 
sales 
for 
VE 
- 
particularly, 
when 
coupled 
with 
individual 
billing 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
TCV 
and 
HCA 
in 
the 
apartments. 
Even 
the 
most 
basic 
demand-side 
conservation 
measures 
are 
estimated 
to 
reduce 
the 
DH 
company’s sales 
by 
US$ 
10 
- 
15 
million 
in 
terms 
of 
present 
value 
(assuming that 
the 
company 
has 
no 
possibility 
to 
compensate 
for 
this 
loss 
by raising 
the 
tariff). 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
no 
direct 
investment 
of 
GEF 
resources 
is 
envisaged 
for 
the 
replacement 
of 
group 
substations, 
and 
the 
expanded 
penetration 
of 
this 
market 
is 
expected 
only 
due 
to 
the 
barrier removal 
activities described 
above. 
VE-implemented 
Apartment-Level 
DSM 
measures 
(TCV 
and 
HCA) 
240,000 tons 
of 
additional 
C02 
emission 
reduction 
can be 
achieved by 
a 40% 
penetration 
of 
thermostatically 
controlled 
valves and 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
into 
the 
homeowners’ 
market 
(against a 
baseline 
of 
10% 
penetration). There 
is 
a synergy 
between 
these measures 
and 
the 
substation 
modernization 
program 
since: 
(i) 
these measures 
only 
become 
technically possible 
after 
the 
introduction 
of 
BLS; 
(ii) 
the 
possibility 
of 
demand-side 
conservation 
is 
an 
important 
factor 
contributing 
to 
the 
acceptance 
of 
the 
substation replacements 
by 
the 
homeowners. 
As 
shown 
above, 
the 
project 
may 
allow 
the 
possibility 
of 
expanding 
the 
penetration 
of 
BLS 
from 
1,500 
to 
2,260 
(90% 
of 
the 
buildings 
currently 
served 
from group 
substations) 
and 
an 
increased 
penetration 
of 
the 
BLS 
upgrades 
from 
230 
buildings 
to 
690 buildings, 
resulting 
in 
some 
910,000 tons 
of C02 
abatement 
until 
the 
year 
2020. 
Basic 
energy 
conservation 
measures 
at the apartment 
level 
No-cost 
and 
low-cost 
apartment-level 
measures 
at 
the apartment 
level 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
practiced 
more 
widely 
due 
to 
the introduction 
of 
individual 
heat 
consumption accounting accompanying 
the 
introduction 
of 
TCV 
and 
HCA. 
No-cost 
measures 
such 
as 
avoiding 
keeping the windows 
open 
when 
not 
necessary 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
practiced 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
households 
(80% 
penetration) 
eliminating 
about 
160,000 
tons 
of 
C02 
relative 
to 
the 
baseline 
of 
40% penetration 
of 
these measures. 
Low-cost 
measures 
such 
as 
weatherization 
of 
windows 
(e.g., 
refurbishment 
of 
window 
frames 
and 
applying 
durable 
tape 
to 
the 
perimeter) 
are 
projected 
to 
expand 
from 
25% 
to 
50% 
penetration, 
bringing 
an 
additional 
reduction 
of 
about 
100.000 
tons 
of 
C02. 
Further 
apartment-level 
and 
building-level 
investments 
Further 
carbon 
savings 
can be 
realized 
on 
the 
next 
level 
of 
the demand-side 
management program, 
which 
will 
be supported 
through 
the 
crediting 
scheme 
administered 
by 
VCM. 
By 
achieving 
a 
market 
penetration 
of 
30% 
for 
energy-efficient windows 
(against a 
baseline 
of 
10% penetration), a 
further 
120,000 tons 
of 
C02 
can 
be 
saved. 
Finally, 
more capital-intensive 
building-envelope 
investments 
(such 
as 
insulation 
of 
walls 
and 
roofs), 
if 
they reach a 
penetration rate 
of 
25% 
(against a baseline 
of 
lo%), 
can 
save 
another 
150,000 tons 
of 
C02. 
The latter 
investments, 
however, have 
not 
been 
included 
in 
the 
estimates 
below 
as 
their 
financial 
profitability 
is 
marginal. 
Unit 
Abatement 
Costs 
The 
unit 
abatement 
costs 
(UAC) 
resulting 
from 
the 
described investments 
and 
GHG 
reductions 
are 
summarized below. The 
unit 
abatement cost 
of 
the 
Project 
can 
be represented 
in 
three different 
ways. 
As 
-71 
- 
Page  76
shown 
below, 
the 
economic value 
of 
the 
unit 
abatement 
cost 
is 
negative 
at 
US$ 
-5.24 
per ton 
of 
carbon 
equivalent 
(tCe), 
consistent 
with 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
GEF 
Operational Program 
5, 
which 
supports 
"win-win'' 
energy 
efficiency 
projects through barrier removal. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
UAC 
can 
be 
calculated 
as 
a 
ratio 
of 
GHG reductions 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
GEF 
resources 
utilized 
for 
the 
project. 
Then, 
if 
the 
entire 
GEF 
budget 
for 
the 
project 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
cost, 
the 
UAC 
equals 
US$15.62/tCe. 
However, 
it 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
mind 
that 
less 
than 
half 
of 
this 
would 
be 
provided 
on 
a grant 
basis, 
with 
the 
remainder 
being 
extended 
on 
a commercial 
basis 
with 
an 
obligation 
to 
repay 
into 
the 
revolving 
fund. 
If 
the 
commercial part 
of 
the 
GEF 
contribution 
is 
netted 
out, 
the 
UAC 
for 
GEF 
can 
be 
calculated 
as 
US$8.41/tCe.

An 
increase 
in 
the 
price 
of 
natural 
gas 
increases 
the 
economic 
return 
on 
the 
proposed 
investments. 
However, 
it 
would 
take 
a 
much 
higher 
price 
for natural 
gas 
to 
change 
the 
ranking 
of 
the 
investments. 
The 
analysis shows 
that 
the 
investments 
for which 
the economic 
return 
decreases 
with 
an 
increasing 
scale 
(penetration 
level) 
remain 
so 
even 
when 
substantially 
higher 
shadow 
prices 
are 
assigned 
to 
natural 
gas. 
Conversely, 
the 
investments 
which 
increase the 
economic 
return 
at 
the 
margin 
do 
so 
even 
at 
the current 
level 
of 
gas 
price 
(US$83.8 
per thousand 
cubic 
meters 
for CHP 
plants 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
system). 
The 
capital-intensive 
demand 
side 
measures 
belong 
to 
the 
former category 
of 
investments, 
while 
substation 
replacements 
represent 
the 
latter.

The 
review 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Project 
Brief 
dated 
2 
March 
2001 
and 
familiarity 
with 
the 
project 
based 
on an 
earlier 
review 
of 
a Project Concept Note. The 
issues 
raised 
in 
the 
review 
of 
the 
Project 
Concept 
Note 
have 
been 
adequately 
addressed 
in 
the 
Project 
Brief 
and 
in 
the 
response 
of 
the 
Project 
Team. 
Summary/Conclusion 
The 
total project 
is 
relevant 
and 
justified. 
The 
GEF 
component 
js 
particularly important 
and 
valuable 
in 
that 
it 
addresses 
end-use energy 
efficiency 
and the 
transformation 
of 
VDHC 
into 
an energy 
services 
company. 
Without 
the 
GEF 
component, 
the 
technical performance 
of 
VDHC 
would 
improve, but 
not 
necessarily 
the 
overall 
business 
performance 
and 
longer 
term 
commercial 
viability 
of 
the 
company. 
General 
comments 
and 
observations 
The 
Project 
Concept 
Note 
review 
concluded that 
the 
project 
is 
relevant, 
justified 
and should 
be 
given 
high priority. 
The 
same 
can 
be 
concluded 
for 
the 
Project 
Brief. 
The 
project 
adequately 
meets 
or 
addresses 
basic 
requirements 
and 
issues, 
for 
example: 
It 
is 
clearly 
relevant 
and 
should 
be 
given 
high priority 
Objectives 
are 
valid 
and 
clearly 
stated 
Adequate background 
and 
justification 
is 
provided 
The 
situation 
is 
well 
analyzed and 
understood 
Activities 
and 
institutional 
arrangements are adequate 
and 
balanced 
Sustainability, 
replicability 
and 
innovativeness 
is 
satisfactory 
It 
is 
consistent 
with 
GEF 
objectives 
These 
and 
other 
issues 
were 
assessed 
in 
the 
review 
of 
the 
Project 
Concept Note. 
Given 
that 
the 
Project 
Brief 
meets such basic 
requirements, 
this 
review 
is 
limited 
to 
making 
some 
general observation 
that 
may 
be 
useful 
in 
finalizing 
the 
proposal 
and 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
One 
of 
the 
greatest 
challenges 
in 
the 
project 
is 
probably 
to 
transform 
VDHC 
into 
a 
business 
and 
customer 
oriented 
energy 
services 
company 
in 
a 
reformed 
energy 
market. 
DSM 
measures 
will, 
of 
course, 
be 
seen 
by 
VDHC 
as 
a "cannibal", 
reducing 
energy 
sales 
and 
income 
(incidentally, 
energy 
efficiency 
services 
may 
be 
a better term 
than 
DSM 
which 
is 
often 
associated 
with 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
load 
management 
in 
regulated monopoly 
markets). 
However, 
unless 
VDHC 
develop the 
energy 
(efficiency) 
services 
market 
on 
its 
own 
or 
in 
partnership 
with 
another 
company, 
other 
actors 
will 
(for 
a U.S./Western Europe 
parallel 
see 
for example Enron 
Energy 
Services 
activities, 
or 
Siemens 
Landis&Staefa's performance 
contracting 
concept).

side 
improvements) 
and 
will 
improve 
technical 
performance. 
The 
GEF financing 
thus 
constitutes 
a very 
important 
complement targeting 
mainly 
investments that 
are 
relevant 
to 
end-use 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
promoting 
the 
transformation 
of 
VDHC into 
an 
energy 
services 
company. 
USD 
2.5 
million 
is 
allocated 
to 
technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
Marketing, 
Outreach, 
and 
Education, and 
Training 
for 
Market 
Analysis, 
Measurement and 
Evaluation. 
A 
large 
part 
of 
this 
will 
be 
used 
for 
aiding 
or 
promoting 
the 
transformation 
of 
VDHC. 
Detailed 
comments 
and 
observations 
Present 
and 
future 
fuel for 
the 
CHP 
and 
HOBS 
is 
not 
explicitly 
discussed 
but 
understood 
to 
be 
natural 
gas? 
Has the 
prospects 
and 
potential 
for 
alternative fuels and 
fuel 
switching, 
now 
or 
in 
the future, 
been 
explored 
(biofuels, 
biogas, energy 
from 
waste)? 
Should 
(has?) 
micro-CHP 
be 
considered 
instead 
of 
one 
or 
several 
of 
the 
Heat 
Only 
Boilers, 
perhaps 
mainly 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
demonstrating new technology? 
The development 
of 
more complex 
tariffs 
is 
mentioned 
(page 
26). 
Please 
note that 
a 
tariff 
with 
a 
large 
share 
of 
fixed 
charges 
will 
discourage 
end-use energy 
efficiency.

project 
will

VDHC 
to make 
the

of 
a 
centrally-directed 
monopoly 
to 
being 
a 
commercial 
provider 
of 
heat 
in 
a 
competitive 
marketplace." 
It 
would 
be 
better 
yet 
if 
VDHC 
becomes a 
commercial 
provider 
of 
energy services 
(including 
efficiency 
services, 
e.g., 
outsourcing, 
performance 
contracting, 
etc.). 
Then 
VDHC 
need 
not 
exit 
from 
areas 
where 
DH 
does 
not 
have an 
advantage, 
but 
be a 
supplier 
of 
heat 
(and other services) 
based 
on other 
supply 
technology.

Which 
is 
correct? 
Project results and experience

I 
would 
like 
to reiterate 
(from 
the 
Concept 
Note 
review) the value 
and 
importance 
of 
involving 
relevant 
academic 
institutions, for 
the 
purpose 
of 
capacity 
building. 
Response 
of 
the 
Project 
Team 
to 
the 
STAP 
Review 
of 
07-Mar-01 
The 
project 
team appreciates the comments 
and conclusions 
made 
in 
the 
first 
two 
sections 
of 
the 
review. 
We 
feel 
that 
your 
review 
has 
been 
excellent 
and 
insightful. 
The observation 
that, 
unless 
VDHC 
itself 
becomes 
active 
in 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
market, 
other 
actors 
will, 
is 
precisely 
on 
target. 
The 
"mission" 
of 
the 
ECF 
is, 
effectively, 
a 
win-win 
proposition 
since 
energy 
savings and associated 
GHG 
reductions 
will 
be 
achieved 
whether 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
investments are 
made 
by 
VDHC 
(through 
the 
ECF) 
or 
by 
its 
competitors 
in 
the 
energy 
efficiency 
market.

Regarding the 
detailed 
comments 
and 
observations, 
the team 
would 
like 
to 
respond 
as 
follows: 
The current 
fuel 
mix 
used 
by 
the 
VDHC 
for 
heat 
generation 
is 
about 
90% 
gas 
and 
10% 
heavy 
fuel 
oil, 
and 
this 
is 
potentially 
subject 
to fluctuations 
depending 
on 
the 
relative 
prices 
for 
gas 
and 
oil 
products. 
However, 
both 
the 
project 
and the 
baseline 
(the 
"without-project" 
scenario) 
are 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
uncertainty 
in 
this 
respect and 
thus 
the 
impact 
of 
this 
variable 
on 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
is 
considered 
minimal. 
The 
option 
of 
bio-fuel 
was 
examined 
by 
COW1 (Denmark), 
subcontractor 
of 
AF-International, 
for 
one 
of 
the 
communities 
in 
the 
Vilnius 
area. 
However, 
this 
turned 
to 
be 
too 
expensive 
in 
operation. 
In 
the 
future, 
it 
is 
possible that  alternative  fuels 
will 
be 
displacing 
gas 
- 
especially, 
in 
the 
suburban 
areas 
around 
Vilnius 
which 
have 
been 
recently 
(Summer 
2000) 
separated 
from VDHC, 
as 
the 
gas 
prices 
for 
smaller 
consumers do 
not 
currently 
reflect the 
full 
economic 
cost 
of 
supply 
and are 
likely 
to 
increase. 
Wood 
chips, 
for 
example, 
may 
become 
economically 
attractive. 
Micro-turbines 
and 
fuel 
cells 
in 
CHP 
mode 
have 
been 
considered 
as 
a supply 
option 
for 
Vilnius 
and 
are 
an 
integral  component 
of 
the 
ESMAP 
study  for 
the 
eight 
outlying 
towns 
around 
Vilnius, 
These 
technologies 
do 
not 
appear 
technically ready 
or 
commercially 
attractive 
as 
yet. 
The 
proposed 
ESMAP 
study 
will 
address 
these 
issues 
and 
consider 
the 
option 
of 
developing 
these 
options 
on 
a 
pilot 
basis 
afterward. 
The 
market 
potential for 
increasing power capacity 
is 
limited 
because 
of 
the 
excess 
power 
generation 
capacity 
available 
for 
the 
next 
five 
years. 
Regarding 
the 
share 
of 
fixed 
charges 
lowering 
energy 
efficiency 
incentives 
- 
generally, 
we 
agree 
with 
this 
point 
and 
feel 
that 
this 
will 
be 
an 
important 
aspect 
of 
tariff 
design. 
The 
fixed 
fee 
must 
exist 
in 
order 
to 
reflect 
heat 
supply 
costs 
and 
keep the 
company's 
financial stability 
in 
the 
case 
when 
savings 
on 
customer side 
are 
expected. 
The 
fixed 
charge, 
however, should 
only 
be enough 
to 
cover 
the 
fixed 
costs, 
not 
more, 
while 
the 
marginal 
cost 
of 
heat 
faced 
by 
the 
consumer 
should 
be 
reasonably 
close 
to 
the 
variable 
cost 
component 
of 
heat supply. 
The 
relevant comparison 
for 
energy 
saving 
incentives 
is 
how 
well 
the 
latter 
part 
is 
optimized 
in 
the 
new 
tariff 
structure and 
not 
how 
the 
new 
tariff 
compares 
with 
the 
old 
one, 
which 
may 
have 
not reflected either 
of 
the 
cost 
components 
properly. 
Also, 
from 
a 
practical 
perspective, 
it 
is 
likely 
that the end-user's 
decisions 
to 
save 
energy 
are 
driven 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
by 
the 
total 
energy 
bill. 
Few 
customers 
will 
bother 
to 
subtract 
the 
fixed 
cost 
component 
even 
if 
they 
do 
then 
divide 
the 
total 
bill 
by 
the 
number 
of 
GJ 
consumed. 
Thus, 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
tariff which 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
old 
one because 
the 
fixed 
costs 
are 
included 
may 
in 
fact 
increase the 
incentives 
to 
save 
energy 
rather 
than 
lower 
them. 
EEHPP 
is 
the 
Energy Efficiency Housing 
Pilot 
Project 
in 
Lithuania. 
This 
will 
be 
spelled 
out 
when 
the 
acronym 
is 
first 
used 
in 
the updated 
Project 
Brief. 
Regarding 
the 
possibility 
of 
VDHC 
providing 
energy services 
outside 
the 
city 
of 
Vilnius, 
it 
should 
first 
be 
noted that 
it 
would not 
be 
economically prudent 
for 
VDHC 
to 
operate 
these 
systems 
jointly. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
if, 
in 
the 
future, 
VDHC 
becomes 
commercially 
effective, 
they 
could 
play 
a 
management 
role 
there 
- 
either through a 
management 
contract 
or 
concession. 
This 
is 
not 
expected 
to 
be 
the 
case 
in 
the 
near 
term, 
however. 
Regarding 
the 
point 
that 
VHDH 
should become a commercial 
provider 
of 
energy 
services 
including 
performance contracting, 
etc. 
- 
the 
idea 
is 
absolutely 
valid, 
and 
moving 
in 
this 
direction 
is 
one the 
project's 
key objectives. However, 
it 
will 
take 
time to 
implement 
such 
a 
transformation. 
In 
a 
World-Bank 
supported 
project 
in 
Krakow, 
where 
such 
a service 
company 
(ESCO) 
was 
established 
in 
2000 
as 
a 
daughter company 
of 
the 
central 
heat 
supplier, 
this 
had taken 
several 
years 
to develop. 
The 
GEF 
project 
in 
Vilnius 
offers 
an 
opportunity for 
VDHC 
management 
to 
start 
this 
process 
by 
helping 
it 
to 
establish 
a 
Page  83
customer-friendly, 
outward-loolung organization 
and 
modestly 
expand 
its 
product 
line. 
SODRA 
is 
the 
Lithuanian 
social security 
system. 
The acronym 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Lithuanian for 
State 
Social 
Insurance 
Fund 
Board. 
Regarding 
whether 
20% 
or 
25% 
of 
income 
is 
the 
luck-in 
level 
for 
the  subsidies, 
our 
current 
information 
is 
that 
it 
is 
20% 
for 
heat and 
25% 
for 
heat and domestic 
hot 
water. 
We 
shall double-check 
this during 
appraisal. 
We 
agree 
that 
the 
project 
results 
may be 
valuable 
input to 
Joint 
Implementation discussions. 
Opportunities 
for 
such 
projects 
certainly 
exist 
- 
especially, 
in 
the 
disconnected 
communities 
around 
Vilnius 
(see 
our 
comment 
on 
alternative fuels 
above). 
Regarding 
cooperation 
with 
academic 
institutions, 
we 
agree 
that 
involving 
academic 
institutions 
may 
be 
increasingly appropriate 
as 
the 
Government 
becomes 
more 
involved 
in 
such 
aspects 
of 
the 
project 
as 
M&E 
and 
information 
dissemination. However, 
the 
current focus 
of 
the 
project 
is 
on 
the 
commercialization 
of 
VDHC, 
and 
thus 
cooperation 
with 
partners 
such 
as 
Helsinki 
Energy 
is 
more 
critical 
for 
capacity 
building 
purposes 
at 
present.

Summary 
The review 
is 
based 
on 
the 
Project Concept 
Note 
and 
the 
Aide 
Memoire. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
relevant, 
justified 
and 
should 
be 
given 
high priority. 
Still 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
Project Concept 
Note, 
several 
parts 
of 
the 
project 
remains 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
greater 
detail. 
The 
close 
links 
to the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating Rehabilitation 
Project 
and 
the 
Energy 
Efficiency 
Housing 
Pilot 
Project 
(EEHPP) further 
strengthens the 
proposal. 
One suggestion 
is 
to 
strengthen 
capacity 
building 
through 
involving 
a 
Lithuanian 
university(ies). 
1. 
Overall 
impression 
Overall 
this 
is 
an 
important 
and 
relevant project. The 
main 
component 
in 
the 
proposed project 
is 
to 
remove barriers 
and 
replace 
existing 
group 
substations 
with 
new 
in-building 
substations that 
facilitate 
heat 
control 
at 
the 
building 
level 
(and 
presumably better measurement/monitoring 
although 
the 
present 
ways 
of 
measuring and 
billing 
are 
not 
detailed 
in 
the 
project 
concept note). 
Measurement and 
control 
is, 
of 
course, 
an 
important prerequisite 
for 
realizing 
future 
energy 
efficiency improvements 
from 
other 
demand-side 
measures. 
There 
is 
not 
enough 
detail 
and data 
in 
the 
proposal 
to comment 
on 
the 
viability 
of 
achieving 
the 
proposed 
savings. 
For 
example, 
it 
is 
stated 
that 
it 
takes 
450 
kWh 
to 
heat one 
square 
meter 
of 
residential 
space 
and 
that: 
"The main 
reason 
is 
poor 
insulation 
and heat 
losses 
in 
the network, 
as 
well 
as 
lack 
of 
possibility 
for 
consumers 
to 
control 
heating." There 
is 
no detail on 
where the 
losses 
occur 
or what 
percentage 
of 
final 
energy 
(i.e., 
energy 
delivered 
to 
the 
building) 
that can 
be 
saved 
through 
the 
substation installations. 
However, more 
data 
and references 
to 
other reports 
are 
found 
in 
a 
background document 
(The 
Aide 
- 
79 
- 
Page  84
Memoire) 
indicating 
a 
solid 
foundation 
for 
the 
estimates. 
2. 
Relevance 
and 
priority 
The 
pro-ject 
is 
relevant 
and 
should 
be 
given 
high 
priority 
given 
the 
widely 
recognized 
need 
to 
improve 
the 
performance 
of 
district 
heating 
systems 
in 
Central 
and 
Eastern 
Europe. 
If 
present and 
potential customers 
are 
lost 
to other 
heating 
options, 
the 
possibility 
of 
low-polluting 
and 
energy 
efficient 
CHP 
may 
also 
be 
lost. 
It 
is 
a 
common 
misconception 
not 
only 
in 
Vilnius 
that energy 
conservation 
in 
buildings 
with 
district 
heating 
is 
not 
viable 
3. 
Project 
approach 
The 
approach 
is 
to 
give 
loans and 
grants 
to 
substation 
installations through a 
GEF 
supported 
Energy 
Conservation 
Fund, 
do 
marketing, 
outreach 
and 
education, and 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating 
Company. A 
reasonable 
mix 
of 
carrots 
and 
sticks (through 
lobbying 
for regulatory 
changes) 
is 
proposed. 
It 
should 
be 
a 
strength 
that the 
project 
is 
undertaken 
as 
a 
part 
of 
a 
greater 
project 
to 
modernize 
the 
heat 
and 
power 
production 
in 
the 
district 
heating 
system. 
A 
key 
barrier 
is 
the 
perceived 
lack 
of 
financial incentive 
for 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
to 
participate 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
efforts. This 
is 
perhaps 
the 
greatest 
challenge 
in 
the project. 
As 
a 
result, 
it 
is 
a 
(necessary!) 
risk 
to 
establish certain functions 
at 
the 
district heating 
company and 
it 
is 
crucial 
that 
the 
company 
can 
be 
turned 
around to 
see 
the 
financial 
benefits 
(from 
reduced 
peak 
demand, 
better 
competitiveness against other heating options, 
and 
developing 
an energy 
services 
market). 
It 
is 
not 
clear 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
Energy Conservation 
Fund 
willkan 
finance 
also 
other 
energy 
efficiency 
measures 
(windows, 
insulation, 
etc.) 
in 
addition 
to substation 
installations. 
Co-ordination 
and 
co-operation 
with 
the 
ongoing Energy 
Efficiency 
Housing 
Pilot 
Project 
(EEHPP) 
as 
indicated strengthens 
the 
proposal. 
Combining 
or co-ordinating substation 
installations 
with 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements 
(without which 
the 
installations 
may 
result 
mainly 
in 
reduced 
bills from 
lower 
comforthdoor 
temperatures) 
can 
improve 
customer 
acceptance. 
4. 
Objectives 
The 
stated 
objectives 
are 
valid but 
there 
is 
not 
enough 
detail 
in 
the proposal 
(e.g., 
background 
data 
or 
quantified 
goals 
and penetration levels) 
to 
comment 
on 
the 
prospects 
for 
achieving 
the objectives. 
5. 
Background 
and 
justification 
As 
noted 
there 
is 
little 
technical 
detail provided 
in 
the 
proposal. 
Apart 
from 
that, 
the 
proposal 
is 
well 
justified 
and 
other background 
information 
is 
presented. 
Additional 
background and 
justification 
mainly 
on 
the 
institutional/organisational 
and 
economic 
aspects 
is 
presented 
in 
the 
Aide 
Memoire. 
6. 
Critical 
analysis 
of 
the 
situation 
The 
Project Concept 
Note 
and the 
Aide Memoire 
gives 
the 
impression 
that 
the situation 
has been 
well 
analyzed 
and 
is 
well 
understood 
based 
on 
previous 
experiences, 
discussions 
with 
several 
stakeholders, 
etc. 
7. 
Activities 
An 
appropriate 
and 
logical 
set 
of 
activities 
is 
proposed 
(The 
GEF 
supported 
Energy 
Conservation 
Fund; 
marketing, 
outreach 
and 
education; 
technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
Vilnius 
District 
Heating 
Company). 
The 
exact 
organization 
and 
administration 
of 
the 
activities 
is 
yet 
to 
be determined. A 
very 
close 
link 
to, 
or

suggested) 
establishment 
at 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
is 
suitable. 
8. 
National 
priorities 
and 
community 
participation 
The 
project 
appears to 
be 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
national 
priorities 
and 
involves 
community 
participation 
in 
various 
ways. 
The 
project, 
however, 
does 
not 
address 
the 
needs 
in 
rural 
areas. 
9. 
Institutional 
arrangements 
The exact 
final 
institutional 
arrangements 
are 
not 
determined 
in 
the 
proposal 
but 
reasonable 
suggestions 
are made 
concerning 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
district 
heating 
company, 
requirements 
on 
ownership 
of 
installations, etc. 
The 
involvement 
of 
local 
banks and 
other 
actors 
is 
not 
explicitly 
discussed 
in 
the 
Project 
Concept 
Note 
but 
the 
Aide Memoire 
makes 
reference 
to 
the 
training 
of 
consultants 
and 
banks 
on 
servicing 
the 
market, indicating 
that 
building 
a 
lasting 
institutional 
capacity 
will 
be 
an 
important 
part. 
Project 
evaluation 
is 
mentioned 
but 
not 
specified. 
It 
would 
be 
valuable 
to involve 
local 
academic 
institutions 
(the 
University 
of 
Vilnius) 
to 
facilitate 
local 
capacity 
building 
on 
this 
and 
various 
other 
relevant 
aspects 
of 
the 
project. 
(To my 
knowledge, 
the 
(Technical?) 
University 
of 
Kaunas 
is 
stronger 
in 
the 
area 
of 
energy 
and 
environment 
and 
may 
be 
a stronger candidate) 
10. 
Time frame 
The 
time 
frame 
is 
reasonable 
although 
it 
may 
be 
slightly 
optimistic 
that 
25% 
of 
the substations 
can 
be 
converted 
in 
the 
first 
year. 
11. 
Funding 
The 
level 
of 
funding 
appears 
to 
be 
appropriate 
and there 
should 
be 
synergies 
from 
being 
linked 
to 
the 
World 
Bank-led 
Vilnius District 
Heating Rehabilitation Project 
as 
well 
as 
the 
EEHPP. 
The 
proposed 
sum 
(7.5 
million 
USD) 
divided by 
2,400 
substations 
(=3,125 
USD) 
is 
slightly 
higher 
than 
what 
is 
indicated 
in 
Annex 
2 
(1,800 
plus 900 
USD 
from 
GEF 
in 
year 
1-2 and 
1,800 
plus 
450 
USD 
in 
year 
3-4). 
This 
is 
due 
to 
administrative 
costs? 
There 
is 
no 
detail 
on 
how 
the 
unit 
abatement 
cost 
of 
-2.9 
USD 
per 
ton 
of 
C02 
was 
calculated. 
Presumably 
the 
District 
Heating Rehabilitation project 
will 
include 
fuel 
switching 
if 
coal 
is 
the 
predominant 
fuel? 
Funding for 
marketing, 
outreach, and 
education 
is 
2 
million 
USD 
equivalent 
to more 
than 
800 
USD 
per 
substation 
(2,400 substations), 
or 
8% 
of 
cost 
of 
installation. 
The 
activities 
under 
this 
sub-component 
are 
not 
detailed 
in 
the 
Project 
Concept 
Note 
and 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
assess 
whether 
this 
funding 
allocation 
is 
appropriate. 
Is 
evaluation 
included 
here also? 
In 
my 
view, 
the 
value 
and 
importance 
of 
evaluation 
(pre-, 
during, 
and 
post-project) 
is 
often 
underestimated. 
12. 
Innovative 
featuresheplicability 
The 
project 
is 
innovative 
(technically 
and 
institutionally) 
from 
a 
Lithuanian 
perspective 
and 
should 
be 
replicable 
in 
similar 
settings. 
In 
many 
cases 
the 
situation 
in 
each 
countrykity 
may 
be 
quite 
unique 
in 
many 
respects. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
project 
should 
provide 
valuable 
lessons-learned 
for 
future 
applications 
(if 
not 
replications). 
13. 
Sustainability 
The 
risk 
that 
the 
Energy 
Conservation 
Fund 
does 
not 
reach cost-recovery 
is 
considered 
low 
in 
the 
proposal. Various options 
for 
the 
exit 
strategy are 
mentioned, 
including 
the 
continued use 
of 
recovered 
costs 
for 
other 
energy 
investments.

14. 
Development 
dimensions 
and 
rationale 
for 
GEF 
support 
The 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
objectives 
of 
GEF 
operation program 
5 
Removal 
of 
Barriers 
to 
Energy 
ESficiency 
and 
Energy 
Conservation 
through 
removing 
various barriers, 
including 
barriers 
to 
future 
additional 
energy 
efficiency 
investments. 
15. 
Additional 
comments 
or 
questions 
It 
may be 
argued that 
the substation 
project 
(and 
certainly 
the 
"total" project 
including 
rehabilitation) 
is 
concentrating 
on 
supply 
side 
improvements 
in 
the system 
although 
demand 
and 
customer orientation 
is 
discussed. 
Nevertheless, upgrading 
the 
system 
and 
installing 
substations 
is 
important 
for 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements through future 
demand-side measures. 
With 
or 
without 
the 
project, 
the 
district 
heating 
company 
should 
be 
prepared 
for 
decreasing 
heat 
loads. 
Through modernizing 
the system 
and 
becoming 
a 
more 
customer 
oriented 
energy 
service 
provider 
the 
company can be 
competitive 
and 
profitable 
in 
the 
future. 
Without 
the 
project, 
the 
company risk 
losing 
(especially 
wealthy) 
customers, and 
energy service 
business 
to 
other 
actors. 
The 
possibility 
or 
likelihood 
of 
decreasing 
heat 
loads 
should 
be 
an 
important 
concern also 
in 
the associated 
District 
Heat 
Rehabilitation Project. Closing 
or 
moth-balling 
plants can 
be 
an alternative 
to rehabilitation 
and 
replacement 
if 
energy 
efficiency 
investments 
are 
more cost-effective.

on 
the

of 
the current Project

3. 
Project Approach 
Lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
EEHPP 
project 
showed 
an 
increased interest 
in 
energy 
efficiency 
after 
the 
initial 
investment 
is 
implemented. 
A 
significant 
proportion 
of 
all 
investments 
included 
substation 
installation. 
The 
types 
of 
investments 
that 
are 
eligible 
under the 
EEHPP 
and 
would be 
eligible 
under 
the 
proposed 
ECF 
are: 
(i) 
modernization 
of 
the 
heat 
substation 
in 
the 
building, which 
typically 
includes 
replacement 
of 
the 
heat 
elevator (ejector 
circulation 
pump) 
by 
an 
electric 
circulation 
pump, 
automatic 
temperature 
control for 
space 
heating 
and 
domestic 
hot 
water, and heat exchangers 
for 
space 
heating 
and 
domestic 
hot 
water. 
In 
addition, 
demand side 
investments 
include 
thermostatic 
radiator 
valves 
and 
heat 
cost 
allocators 
on 
the 
radiators improvement 
of 
windows, 
staircase 
renovation, 
wall 
insulation 
and 
roof 
repair 
(if 
justified).

The

with 
developing 
a 
strategy 
for

network 
and 
installing 
alternative 
sources

10. 
Time 
frame 
The 
target 
number 
for 
substation 
replacements 
in 
the 
first 
year may have 
to 
be 
revised 
by 
the 
time 
of 
submission 
of 
the 
proposal 
for 
CEO 
endorsement. 
This 
is 
not 
going 
to 
change 
the 
results 
of 
the 
economic 
analysis 
materially. 
The current assumption 
is 
that 
the 
full 
number 
of 
substation replacements 
will 
occur 
by 
2006, 
which 
is 
considered feasible. 
11. 
Funding 
The 
cost estimates 
for substation replacement 
given 
in 
Annex 
2 
of 
the 
initial 
Project 
Concept 
Note 
(PCN) 
were 
preliminary. 
A 
more 
complete and 
accurate 
calculation 
summarized 
in 
Annex 
4 
of 
the 
current 
project 
brief 
is 
now 
available. The economic 
cost 
per substation replacement, 
including 
a 
physical 
contingency, 
is 
about 
$1 
1,680. 
In 
addition, 
the 
administrative/transaction 
costs 
have 
been 
estimated 
at 
about 
$1,500 
per 
substation. 
For 
the 
financial 
calculation, 
the 
GEF-financed 
cost 
per 
substation 
is 
a 
useful 
point 
of 
reference, 
but 
it 
should 
be 
kept 
in 
mind 
that the 
full 
picture 
of 
financial

involved 
in 
GEF’s 
financing 
of 
the 
substation 
replacements 
through 
the 
Energy 
Conservation 
Fund 
is 
more 
intricate 
and involves 
a 
different 
mode 
of 
calculation. 
The 
options 
presented 
in 
last 
November’s

are 
relevant 
in 
that respect.

I. 
Background 
The 
Global 
Environment 
Facility 
(GEF) 
has 
provided 
a 
grant 
to 
the 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
and 
Vilniaus 
Energija, 
the 
provider 
of 
district 
heating 
to 
Vilnius 
residents, 
to 
support 
the reduction 
of 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
by 
increasing market penetration 
of 
energy 
efficiency equipment 
in 
residential 
buildings. 
The 
benefits 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
technologies 
are 
well known 
among 
the 
energy 
conservation 
community 
in 
Lithuania, 
but 
are 
not 
attractive to 
residents 
due 
to 
a 
variety 
of 
reasons 
that 
are 
endemic 
of 
heating 
markets 
in 
the region. 
The 
GEF 
supported 
project 
comprises 
two 
components: 
(i) 
Apartment 
Level 
Demand-Side 
Management: 
A 
$2.5 
million 
GEF 
"subsidy 
fund" 
would 
go 
to 
VE 
to 
support 
its 
AL 
DSM 
program 
(valves, 
heat 
allocators, balancing 
valves) 
by buying down 
the 
connection 
fee 
(equal 
to 
25% 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
equipment 
and installation) for low-income 
people. 
The program 
would 
cover 
notionally 
533 
buildings or 
about 
21,000 
apartments, 
representing 12% 
of 
the 
total 
number 
of 
apartments 
(Le. 
176,000 
apartments) 
connected 
to 
VE's 
district 
heating 
system. 
$1.25 
million 
of 
GEF support 
would 
cover 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
downpayment 
for 
low 
income 
residents. 
The remaining 
$1.25 
million 
would 
be 
made 
available 
for 
a 
follow 
on 
AL 
DSM 
program 
if 
VE 
demonstrates 
the 
availability 
of 
additional 
resources 
so 
the 
overall 
size 
of 
the 
AL 
DSM 
program 
can be 
doubled. 
(ii) 
ECP 
Commercial 
Fund: 
A 
$3.00 
million 
GEF 
supported 
"commercial 
fund" 
would 
be 
established 
by 
the 
Vilnius City 
Municipality 
to 
operate 
a 
commercially 
sustainable 
business 
that 
makes 
energy 
efficiency 
improvements 
in 
the 
residential 
sector 
of 
the 
Vilnius City. 
The 
Municipality 
will 
competitively 
hire 
an 
ECP Commercial 
Fund 
Manager 
to 
operate 
the 
business 
and 
manage 
the 
GEF 
funding. 
Some 
GEF 
support 
$0Sm 
may 
be 
made available 
for 
administrative 
services 
provided 
by 
the ECP 
Commercial 
Fund 
Manager. 
In 
addition, 
the 
GEF 
would 
support 
technical 
assistance 
to 
monitor 
and evaluate the 
global 
environmental 
benefits 
accrued. 
The 
Vilnius 
City 
Municipality 
is 
soliciting 
proposals 
from 
privately-owned 
firms 
to 
introduce 
innovative 
business 
plans 
that 
would 
improve 
energy 
efficiency 
in 
buildings.  There 
have 
been 
many 
pilot 
efforts undertaken 
across 
Central 
and East 
Europe 
as 
well 
as 
in 
the 
European 
Union 
to 
address 
market 
penetration 
of 
energy 
efficiency 
equipment 
in 
the 
residential 
sector. 
Most 
programs 
have 
been 
heavily 
subsidized 
such 
as 
through 
capital 
grants, 
tax exemptions, soft 
loans, 
etc.
