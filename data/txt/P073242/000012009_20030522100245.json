(GEF)\n            Heat Demand Management Project will support a broader, and\n            more sustainable Energy Conservation Program (ECP) for the\n            City of Vilnius, by promoting demand-side energy efficiency\n            in residential buildings connected to the district heating\n            system, and develop an energy efficiency market. The\n            objective of the Project is to reduce the emissions of\n            greenhouse gases from the Vilnius District Heating System by\n            reducing barriers, and implementing, financially sustainable\n            and replicable energy efficiency investments in the\n            residential sector of the Vilnius City. This would be\n            achieved by: co-financing demand management programs which\n            would demonstrate the benefits of automatic, and\n            consumer-controlled use of heat in homes, and\n            consumption-based billing at the apartment level; a limited\n            grant (or capital subsidy) financing from the GEF, that\n            would cover the cost of down-payments (connection fees) for\n            Apartment Level Demand Side Management equipment -\n            particularly, for low-income customers. A commercially\n            sustainable (revolving) financial facility will be created -\n            ECP Commercial Fund - to support the implementation of\n            investments aimed at reducing heat losses from the\n            City's housing stock. The facility would provide both\n            financing, and technical assistance for such investments,\n            mobilizing additional financing from commercial sources as\n            appropriate. Moreover, monitoring, evaluation, and\n            information dissemination activities will be implemented,\n            aimed at facilitating the replication of the Project's experience."}, "docdt": "2003-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
