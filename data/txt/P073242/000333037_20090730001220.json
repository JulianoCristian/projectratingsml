{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Vilnius Heat Demand\n            Management Project for Lithuania were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            energy efficiency improvements in multi-apartment buildings\n            of the Soviet era are a challenging undertaking that\n            requires collective decision making by homeowners. It takes\n            a concerted effort and a long-term partnership between the\n            government and the private sector to successfully promote\n            energy efficiency in these buildings. Key ingredients will\n            be: information campaigns, support to Homeowners'\n            Association (HOA) creation and access to preferential,\n            long-tenor loans and/or subsidies. Under the Vilnius City\n            Municipality (VCM) implemented components, the project has\n            demonstrated a model of a municipal-level facility capable\n            of operating in a commercially oriented fashion to finance\n            residential energy efficiency. Creating the incentives for\n            commercial banks to enter the scheme is the key to scaling\n            up a program using such a facility. However, the project\n            also demonstrated that building envelope investments remain\n            costly, and energy savings alone may not be sufficient to\n            generate a reasonable economic payback on them. For a\n            national-level housing renovation program to be successful,\n            it will be necessary to find ways to reduce the capital\n            costs of building renovations."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
