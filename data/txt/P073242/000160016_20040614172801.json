The Vilnius District Heating Company had\n            suffered financially over the decade prior to project\n            preparation, resulting in loss of market share of an\n            environmentally prudent form of heat supply by using waste\n            heat from power plants. The project was designed to stop the\n            worsening financial performance of the company and physical\n            deterioration of the network and support heat supply in a\n            sustainable manner. Based on Bank experience in preparing\n            for concession arrangements in other countries (particularly\n            for water supply in Asia and Latin America) it was expected\n            that it would take at least two years to engage the private\n            sector participation. The project was designed to ensure\n            that the heating system and the company would not\n            deteriorate further during that time period and would fund\n            high priority investments that would be attractive to any\n            future investor. However, the Municipality of Vilnius was\n            able to attract private investment much faster than had been\n            the experience in other countries. As a result, a concession\n            arrangement was finalized within six months after Board\n            presentation, much less than the two years originally\n            expected. Although the winning bidder had identified\n            investments that were consistent with the Bank-funded\n            project, the loan was not signed. The Government did not\n            want to use its limited guarantee capacity for private\n            projects and the bidder was able to arrange alternate\n            financing on attractive terms and without having to follow\n            Bank procurement procedures.  Despite the fact that the loan\n            was never signed and was, at the request of the guarantor,\n            withdrawn in March 2003, the developmental impact of the\n            Bank intervention is expected to be fully met."}, "docdt": "2004-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
