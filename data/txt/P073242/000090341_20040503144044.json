The Project will focus\n            district heating investments in areas where VDHC has a\n            competitive advantage as well as related energy efficiency\n            investments in households. A fundamental design change in\n            heat supply would be facilitated by investments in\n            substations designed to improve the quality of district\n            heating supply by enabling temperature control by the\n            consumer. The Project will also support demand-side\n            investments to enable decreases in heat losses and further\n            improvements in temperature control. Following are some of\n            the negative impacts and mitigating measures. Due to\n            constructions there will be some noise, dust, disposal of\n            solid materials, and water leakage. Mitigating measures will\n            include: activities in apartments to take place during\n            daytime in order to avoid noise at night time, and minimize\n            the presence of children, and shall conform to noise\n            ordinance and regulations. During cutting/welding process,\n            measures of natural ventilation will be taken. Metal parts,\n            if any, will be removed from the apartments and sent for recycling."}, "docdt": "2003-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
