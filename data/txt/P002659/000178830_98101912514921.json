would provide a 20 MW\n            hydroelectric generating facility on the Little Usutu River\n            to help Swaziland meet a growing demand for power and reduce\n            dependence on electricity imports from the Republic of South\n            Africa. It would consist of a 40-meter high rockfill dam and\n            a hydraulic system leading to a powerhouse with two 10 MW\n            turbine generators. Consulting services for studies of the\n            utility's tariff structure, resettlement of some 300\n            people in the reservoir area, bid evaluation and\n            construction supervision, and its implications for human\n            health and fish resources would be included in the Project.\n            The Project would have no special technical or economic risks."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
