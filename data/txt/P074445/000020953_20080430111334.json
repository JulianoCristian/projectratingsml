 capacity of the public sector; and 3) enhancing\n            Zambia's growth opportunities while improving its\n            poverty impact. The FY04-07 CAS envisages that over the\n            four-year period of CAS implementation, there could be two\n            multi-tranche Development Policy Lending Operations or one\n            multi-tranche plus two single tranche development policy\n            operations (DPOs) to support CAS implementation. IDA and the\n            Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that achieving\n            these objectives in part depend on the implementation of\n            specific reforms in the areas of: (i) public sector\n            management; (ii) macro economic management including the\n            reduction of arrears and the establishment of a credit\n            rating bureau; (iii) agriculture; (iv) infrastructure; and\n            (v) business environment."}, "docdt": "2008-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
