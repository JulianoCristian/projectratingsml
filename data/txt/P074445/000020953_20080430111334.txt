                     CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                             REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA

        SECOND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GROWTH CREDIT

Borrower              Republic of Zambia.

Implementing Agency   Ministry of Finance and National Planning.

Amount                SDR 6.3 million (USD10.0 million equivalent).

Terms                 Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and a 10-year grace
                      period.
Tranching             One Tranche to be released at effectiveness.

Description           The Credit of USD10 million is the second Development Policy
                      Lending Operation (DPO) to support policy and institutional reforms
                      as outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FT04-07
                      (Report No. 27654-ZA). The FY04-07 CAS envisages that over the
                      four-year period of CAS implementation, there could be two multi
                      tranche Development Policy Lending Operations or one multi tranche
                      plus two single tranche DPOs to support CAS implementation. This
                      credit's reform program and objectives aim to facilitate Zambia:

                      · To maintain and deepen Zambia's macroeconomic framework
                         conducive to robust growth;
                      · To strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public
                         sector;
                      · To enhance Zambia's growth opportunities while improving its
                         poverty impact.

                      In addition, the expected results of the Credit are embedded in the
                      CAS for FY08-11 and contribute to its goals and objectives.

                      IDA and the Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that
                      achieving these objectives in part depend on the implementation of
                      specific reforms in the areas of: (i) public sector management; (ii)
                      macro economic management including the reduction of arrears and
                      the establishment of a credit rating bureau; (iii) agriculture; (iv)
                      infrastructure; and (v) business environment.

Benefits and Results  The actions and outcomes under the development policy operation
                      will help deepen and consolidate the macroeconomic gains that
                      Zambia has registered over the last three years , will contribute to the
                      sustainability of the reform process in the area of public sector
                      management, financial sector development and private sector
                      development. In addition, it will also contribute towards the bridging
                      of a financing gap that exists in the implementation of Zambia's Fifth
                      National Development Plan and it will contribute towards improving

                    aid effectiveness by being part of a harmonized approach to budget
                    support.
                    More specifically the operation aims to contribute to (i) improved
                    management of public resources and credibility of Government vis-à-
                    vis domestic suppliers by reducing arrears; (ii) timely payment of
                    pensions by Zambia's Public Pension Fund (PSPF); (iii) availability of
                    creditworthiness information of borrowers to Commercial Banks;
                    (iv)improved ability to execute in year programs and reduced
                    disconnect between plans and budget execution; (v) improved quality
                    of data maintained in Zambia's civil service Payroll Management and
                    Establishment Control (PMEC) system; (vi) a simplified institutional
                    framework to reduce bureaucratic procedures for businesses; (vii) the
                    reaching of consensus on the roles and mandates of each actor, public
                    and private, in the agricultural marketing sectors; and to (viii) the
                    ability of the road agencies to operate their statutory tasks.

Risks               Given that the proposed DPO is a one-tranche operation, the main risk
                    is sustainability of the implemented reforms. This is mitigated
                    through the fact that the operation is embedded in a medium term
                    program that is aligned with the country's own development strategy
                    and is undertaken in conjunction with all donors, which are providing
                    budget support.
                    Political Risk. The outcome of the elections in the fall of 2006 has
                    shown that the current regime is susceptible and vulnerable to
                    populous ideas. This can affect the attention needed to stay the course
                    with the ongoing economic reform efforts to further strengthen the
                    effectiveness of the public sector and the commitment to work towards
                    a more private sector friendly economic environment. To mitigate
                    these challenges some of the macroeconomic and public sector
                    management areas supported by the proposed operation are also
                    supported, though from a different angle, by the IMF's PRGF
                    arrangement.
                    Macroeconomic stability. Even though fiscal discipline has taken root
                    in Zambia, ineffective public expenditure management processes and
                    populist tendencies can generate risks for macroeconomic
                    performance.
                    External Developments. The country is vulnerable to terms of trade
                    shocks and droughts. The upsurge in copper prices might re-ignite the
                    hope that Zambia once more can count on the copper sector for
                    economic success. A reoccurrence of a drought would harm the recent
                    gains in food security and could see a surge in the need for food
                    imports.
                    Malaria and HIV/AIDS pandemic. Malaria and HIV/AIDS remain the
                    most significant health threat to Zambia's population and hence to its
                    prosperity. The impact of these diseases is increasingly visible in all
                    spheres of Zambia's society and economy. With prevalence rates
                    remaining in double-digit figures, the potential damage is enormous.

                              PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
 PROPOSED SECOND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND GROWTH CREDIT
                             TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA

                                    I.       INTRODUCTION


1.      This program document presents a proposed Development Policy Operation
(DPO) to the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) for SDR 6.3 million (USD10
million equivalent) to finance a second Economic Management and Growth Credit
(EMGC II) to support the Government's reform program in support of Zambia's Fifth
National Development Plan (FNDP). The proposed operation is part of a collective effort
by the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) and Poverty Reducing Budget
Support (PRBS) donors1 to provide predictable and performance related annual budget
resources to support the Government's effort to implement its Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS)/Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP), which covers the period 2006-
10.


2.      The focus and scope of the FNDP covers numerous important areas for Zambia's
development, which are reflected in the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) (see
Annex 2), which is jointly prepared by GRZ and PRBS donors. This credit selectively
assists the economic reform efforts of GRZ in three areas. The included areas from the
PAF are (i) public sector with a focus on reforms that strengthen management of public
resources and improve quality and accuracy of data maintained in Zambia's civil service Payroll
Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system; (ii) macro economic management
with a focus on reducing arrears to general contractors and to Zambia's public service
pension fund (PSPF), and on improving Zambia's credit culture; (iii) wealth creation with
a focus on developing a market friendly Agricultural Marketing Act (AGM), ensuring
that the newly created road agencies are appropriately staffed, and on assisting GRZ to
reduce bureaucratic procedures that negatively affect the investment and business
practices of the private sector.

3.      Economic management reforms in each of these areas are to contribute to
prolongation of the durable improvements made in the country's macroeconomic
environment, enhance its growth opportunities, and improve the poverty reduction impact
of Zambia's growth. These actions build on and expand upon past achievements and
lessons learned in the area of economic management that were supported by a two
tranche Economic Management and Growth Credit (EMGC) of USD40 million approved
in December 2004 and fully disbursed in December 20052. The EMGC was the first of
two DPOs that were identified in the baseline lending scenario of the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for FY04-07 to assist GRZ with policy and institutional reforms. The
proposed operation is in many ways a continuation of the previous DPO as it aims to
maintain and expand on the positive strides made. In addition, the proposed operation is

also to extend Zambia's track record of policy and institutional reform and thus sets the
stage to move towards a programmatic approach under the new CAS FY08-11 to support
the policy and institutional reform agenda identified in the FNDP and incorporated in the
PAF.

4.                                 In addition, the proposed operation builds also on an earlier three-tranche Fiscal
Sustainability Credit of USD170 million approved in May 2001 and fully disbursed in
June 2002 and complements implicit budget support provided under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), which became effective in July 2006. Other critical inputs to
the proposed operation are provided through the Public Service Management Project
approved in January 2006 and a variety of economic sector work (ESW). The ESW
includes a Public Expenditure Management and Accountability Report (PEMFAR), a
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), a
Foreign Investment Advisory Services' (FIAS) Administrative Barriers to Investment, a
Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA), as well as the diagnostic work on pro-poor
growth undertaken by the Poverty group in PREM. In addition, the credit draws on
reports and evaluations carried out by GRZ such as Zambia: Public Financial
Management Performance Report and Performance Indicators.

5.                                 Recent Economic Developments. Macro economic performance supported by
the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) has been positive with the
notable exemption of the exchange rate, which appreciated sharply in November 2005
and has shown a certain degree of volatility since then (see figure 1). GDP growth has
remained robust in 2007; inflation has remained in single digits, and high copper prices
and additional debt relief through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) have
improved Zambia's external position significantly. See table 1 for Zambia's key
economic indicators.

6.      Zambia is experiencing a robust growth period with positive broad based GDP
growth for nine consecutive years. GDP growth has been particularly strong in
construction and services, while mining has shown a very strong rebound during these
last nine years. This experience contrasts sharply with the early period of reform in
1991-1998 (see figure 2). Consequently, the overall poverty headcount has declined
from 73 percent in 1998 to 64 percent at the end of 2006.3 Even though this decline is
less than needed to reach the poverty related Millennium Development Goal (MDG), the
decline is a welcome outcome after many decades of decreasing incomes and increasing
poverty. Real GDP growth is estimated to have equaled 5.7 percent for 2007 and GDP
growth for 2008 is projected to remain around 6 percent as rainfall has been favorable
and production of copper is to rebound from a small contraction in 2007.

7.      These positive growth and poverty developments are supported, and for a large
part driven, by favorable external developments. Zambia's terms of trade improved over
100 percent since 2004. This has lead to an enormous improvement in the current
account balance (including grants) from a negative seven percent of GDP in 2004 to a
projected positive balance of around 3 percent in 2006. The main source of this
improvement is the exceptional rise in copper prices since 2003 by approximately 300
percent. This, combined with a recovery in copper production, has allowed growth of
export proceeds to outperform increases in imports. Imports rose sharply during this
period as well triggered by rising fuel costs and imports of mining related investment
goods in particular. Non-copper exports have also grown rapidly amounting to a USD1.2
billion for 2007, up from USD330 million in 2000. As a result, overall export levels in
2006 amount to USD4.5 billion, more than six times the level of exports in 2000.

8.      These improvements in the external situation have resulted in a much needed
increase in international reserves which stood at 2.5 months of imports at the end of
2007. Reserves are still at a relatively low level, but up from less than 1 month of
imports at the beginning of this millennium. The favorable external developments have
also impacted the kwacha, which has been appreciating in real effective terms by
approximately 8 percent annually in 2003 and 2004, and appreciated excessively in the
second half of 2005. Even though in 2005, no serious negative impact on Zambia's
competitiveness had become evident as the nominal appreciation occurred in
November/December 2005, the profitability of producers of non-copper exports has been
negatively affected. The depreciation of the kwacha in nominal as well as real terms in
the second half of 2006 (see Figure 1) has helped restore some of their viability. This can
be seen from a still healthy increase in export revenues by the non-copper sector.

9.      After years of weak fiscal policy implementation, the authorities have improved
overall budget execution and reduced their domestic financing needs drastically. The
main adjustment was made in 2004, when domestic borrowing was reduced from 5.1
percent of GDP in 2003 to 0.8 percent of GDP. This has crowded in credit resources
available to the private sector and reduced yields on bonds and T Bills significantly. In
2006, the overall fiscal deficit was 2.9 percent of GDP, while the preliminary outcome


3The Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (Report No 32573-ZM), which is based on the LCMS02/03,
estimates poverty at 55 percent of the population. However, the LCMS06, which is dynamically
comparable to the LCMS98 but not to the LCMS02/03, provides the figures quoted in the text.

for 2007 was 0.2 percent of GDP. The decrease in the deficit in 2007 was caused in part
by higher revenues, in particular from the mining sector, as well as from delays
encountered in the implementation of capital projects.

10.       The reduction of the fiscal deficit has taken the fiscal angle out of inflation. Tight
monetary policy, assisted by lower food prices, due to a recovery in food production after
the drought during the 2004/5 planting season, has reduced inflation to single digit for the
first time in over three decades in 2006. Inflation at the end of 2006 stood at 8.2 percent,
significantly lower than the 15.9 percent recorded for inflation at the end of 2005.
Inflation has remained subdued and equaled 8.9 percent at the end of 2007. The reduced
domestic borrowing requirements by the public sector has allowed strong domestic credit
expansion. At the end of 2007, loans and advances to the private sector by commercial
bank equaled 11.2 percent of GDP up from 7.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2005.

to allow for further expansion of domestic resources available to the private sector; and
(iv) increase the coverage of official gross reserve to at least three months of imports in
2008, reaching comfortable levels of four to five months of imports by the end of 2009.
This is to be supported by improving financial and exchange rate stability, while
sustaining a viable balance of payments, and external and domestic debt position (see
Table 2). See Box 1: Zambia's Growth and Poverty Reduction Potential for a more
detailed discussion.


                                       Box 1: Zambia's Growth ­ Poverty Reduction Potential

During 1999­2007 real GDP grew at an average rate of 4.6 percent a year. This stronger performance
has not translated into significant declines in poverty. This can be seen in Figure A: the overall poverty
headcount has declined from 73 in 1998 to 64 at the end of 2006. While the depth and severity of poverty fell
rapidly during the 1990s, this downward trend has tapered off, suggesting that the poorest population has not
benefited considerably from recent growth. One explanation for the weak growth-poverty relationship is that
recent growth has been concentrated in mining, construction and whole sale and retail trade which are rather
capital intensive and urban based and which are less pro-poor than the expansion of agriculture (see figure B
and C).

 path driven by capital intensive and urban-based activities, poverty is projected to decline to approximately 62
 percent by 2010. For a more rapid decline in poverty rates, there is a need to focus on expanding those sectors
 that create employment and income opportunities for the poor, in particular in the rural areas. Hence, the need
 to focus on the agricultural sector, traditional and nontraditional crops, which have strong potential to be
 exported. This is the most effective way to enhance inclusive growth (see Figure B and C). The pro-poor


4In November of every year, the Ministry of Finance and National Planning issues a so-called Green Paper,
which articulates its fiscal framework for the following three years. The Green Paper also includes since
2005 indicative expenditure allocations by head for Personal Emoluments (PE) and other PE related
expenditures and non-PE expenditures.

 outcomes of agricultural expansion would be greatly enhanced if market access through investment in (feeder)
 roads were increased on a large scale. Improving the condition of the road network and extending the network
 to remote areas is a key step not only to increasing growth but also to ensure growth reduces rural poverty.
 Therefore, successful implementation of the FNDP based strategy could further reduce poverty by another 2-3
 percentage points by 2010. Even under this scenario, Zambia will not be able to halve poverty until after
 2030. This is not sufficient; Zambia needs to move to a much higher growth path--estimated to be between
 9-10 percent per annum--to reach this particular MDG.

A recently completed country study** exploring what the constraints are in Zambia to inclusive growth found
that despite a positive, relatively broad-based and stable growth record in recent years and immense untapped
potential in agriculture, mining and services, Zambia's poverty rates have not declined significantly and remain
high. It concluded that income growth is limited by the absence of positive coordination externalities due to
poor access to domestic and international markets, inputs, extension services and information. High indirect
costs ­ most of which attributable to infrastructure service-related inputs into production including energy,
transport, telecom, water, but also insurance, marketing and professional service ­ undermine Zambia's
competitiveness, limit job creation and therefore serve as a major constraint to inclusive growth. The study also
mentioned that continued real appreciation is another serious threat to the competitiveness of export-oriented and
import-competing sectors and to job creation. Consequently, for Zambia to stay competitive and sustain the
growth momentum, the study mentions that it will be critical to improve productivity ­ including the
productivity of its labor force, and to lower indirect production costs related to basic services. Carefully crafted
monetary and fiscal policies will also be critical in responding to the real appreciation pressures. Improving the
quality and access to secondary and tertiary education is essential if the poor are to benefit from future growth of
the non-farm economy.

PRGF program for 2008-11, envisages the need to reduce further net domestic financing
to anchor stabilization. Increased tax revenues, through higher taxes mainly from the
mining sector, and increased VAT revenues, will facilitate a further reduction in domestic
borrowing. Scaling up by bilateral donors is not foreseen until 2008-2009 when many
bilateral agencies are to revisit their multi year programs. Major increases in public

investment to support the FNDP investment program will have to be financed from
additional domestic resources e.g., increased mining revenues, or from debt service
savings made available by HIPC and MDRI.

13.     Monetary policy will need to remain firm to ensure that the gains made in
inflation translate into a further reduction of inflation to international comparable levels.
In addition, a large portion of the Bank of Zambia's (BoZ) holdings of non-marketable
Government securities has recently been converted into marketable securities. This will
increase BoZ's capacity to carry out open market operations with an aim to sterilize
excess liquidity.

14.     Debt sustainability. Zambia reached HIPC completion in April 2005 and became
eligible for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative as of July 1, 2006. This has greatly
reduced Zambia's external debt obligations, which currently stand at less than ten percent
of GDP. Nevertheless, Zambia will need to remain prudent with regard to its external
borrowing strategy in order to not fall back. The Government is preparing a debt
management strategy that encompasses external as well as domestic debt and has recently
completed a validation of its on-lending operation. Both activities aim to assist GRZ to
maintain a viable level of indebtedness.

15.     A Low Income Countries Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) was completed
in 2007 as part of the IMF's Article IV consultations. It concluded that Zambia faces a
low risk of debt distress.5 At the end of 2006, to al large extent because of HIPC and
MDRI, Zambia's NPV of public external debt was estimated to equal 16 percent of
exports and 6 percent of GDP at the end of 2006. Zambia's external debt ratios are
projected to remain well below the risk threshold for the period covered by the LIC DSA
i.e., 2007-27. The NPV of total public debt equaled 25.9 percent of GDP at the end of
2006. In the baseline scenario of the LIC DSA, Zambia's public debt is expected to

decline over the 20 year projection period. The NPV of domestic debt would decline
from 18.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to 10.4 percent by 2027. Because of this and the
decline in external debt, the NPV of public debt to GDP is projected to drop to 16 percent
by 2027. The sensitivity analysis as well as alternative scenarios, including a more rapid
decline in copper prices, shows that the outlook for public debt sustainability is benign.



                       III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

16.     Introduction. GRZ has articulated its long term development objectives in the
National Vision 2030, which stipulates that Zambia wants to become "a prosperous
middle income country by the year 2030." The vision calls for economic and expenditure
policies plus institutional reforms that accelerate growth and leads to sustained poverty
reduction. The FNDP, covering 2006-10, is an important tool in reaching the goal set by
the National Vision 2030.6 The topic of the FNDP is "Broad Based Wealth and Job
Creation through Citizenry participation and technological Advancement," with a
strategic focus on developing Zambia's economic and human infrastructure.

17.     Zambia's FNDP covers over twenty economic and social sectors. It identifies
macroeconomic stability, including proper public expenditure management and financial
accountability processes as a pre-requisite, while recognizing governance, HIV/AIDS,
environment, and gender as cross cutting issues. The FNDP states further that `good
governance' plays a critical role in realizing the objectives set in the FNDP.
Accountability, political and administrative, as well as financial and budgetary, are all
seen as important building blocks that will help the nation improve governance and
contribute to a reduction in corruption. Improvements in administrative and financial and
budgetary accountability are anchored in two pillars of public sector reform, i.e. Public
Sector Management reform and Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability programs.

18.     The Government's program identifies the need to make Zambia's growth more
inclusive. The FNDP has identified two critical areas on which public expenditure
programs should focus if growth is to be accelerated and reach the poor more strongly.
These two main areas are: (i) strengthening Zambia's physical and human infrastructure,
with a particular focus on (rural) roads; and (ii) enhancing agriculture and rural
development. These priorities need to be accompanied by reforms that improve the
business and investment climate in Zambia and strengthen public sector management to
ensure effective delivery of public services.

19.     Recognizing that accelerating the pro-poor impact of growth will require
supporting diversification of the economy, the growth and poverty reduction strategy
articulated in the FNDP focuses in particular on supporting rural development, especially
agriculture, encouraging linkages between agriculture and agro-processing, stimulating
tourism, and strengthening Zambia's manufacturing base through investment promotion,

6The Fifth National Development Plan and its accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note, Report No.
40127-ZM, were discussed in August 2007 with the Executive Board.



                                                 12

development of the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, and economic
empowerment. The FNDP recognizes the importance of a well functioning financial
sector geared not only towards providing financial services to the established business
sector, but also to the SME sector, which is hampered by a relatively unknown credit
history.

20.       The FNDP, supported by the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), jointly
prepared by GRZ and its cooperating partners, including IDA, identifies four areas that
are crucial to a successful implementation of the FNDP and which lend themselves to
direct budget support. These broad areas are: (i) public sector reform; (ii)
macroeconomic management; (iii) wealth creation; and (iv) social equity.

21.       The remainder of this section will discuss the Government's program that deals
with reforms in those four areas and identify the prior actions supported by the proposed
credit.

A. Improving Public Sector Management

22.       In the early 1990s, the Government identified that its public service was bloated,
inefficient, ineffective, and inadequately responsive to the needs of the public. In
addition, it was characterized by poor discipline and inadequate professionalism and
accountability, resulting in poor service delivery. To redress this situation, the
Government embarked on implementing the public service reform program (PSRP) in
1993 as a systematic long-term measure to reform the public service. In 2000, the
Government commenced the implementation of the Public Service Capacity Building
Project (PSCAP) in order to facilitate, sustain, and revitalize the reform efforts. The
initial phase focused on rightsizing and pay reform; improved financial management,
accountability and transparency; improved capacity of the judicial and legal systems; and
decentralization and participatory governance.

23.       In 2003, GRZ acknowledged the need to focus on three main aspects of its PSRP
i.e., (i) Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA); (ii)
Public Sector Management (PSM); and (iii) Decentralization as means to improve the
accountability, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of its expenditure programs and
service delivery. For each of these broad areas strategies were prepared, implementation
plans developed, and institutional structures to monitor and facilitate implementation put
in place.

24.       Strengthening public service management. GRZ has completed its
rightsizing/restructuring exercise (i.e., ensuring that ministries and institutions have staff
complements that are appropriate to their agreed mandates and affordable). Under the
FNDP, it now embarks on the rightsizing/restructuring of provinces and districts as well
as local authorities. The restructuring of provincial and district administration is
supported under the PAF. In 2006 and 2007 a comprehensive implementation plan,
which includes the development of strategic plans, organization structures, and results
oriented job descriptions, has been developed. It is expected that over the next two years
several provinces and districts will be restructured.



                                              13

25.     The PAF will also support the Government's efforts to institute service delivery
charters as a means to ensure that all ministries and institutions are managing
performance effectively within an agreed framework, and are taking action to bring their
service delivery up to those standards. The Ministry of Lands and the Department of
Immigration will pilot the service delivery charters and formally adopt them in 2008.
Additional institutions will be identified over the next two years to develop and adopt
service delivery charters as a means to improve and strengthen service delivery by the
public administration.

26.     Another important component under public service reform is progress with the
preparation and implementation of a comprehensive pay policy. Pay levels for civil
servants remain an issue of contention, as they are considered inadequate and inconsistent
with performance, meaning the public service is unable to attract and retain essential
technical and professional staff. A diagnostic study with a focus on these issues has been
initiated and will be undertaken and completed in 2008. This is to translate into a new
and adopted public service pay policy in 2008, whose implementation will commence
soon thereafter. An important supporting step to be completed in 2008 or early 2009 is a
job evaluation of all public servants.


27.     Building on the achievements under EMGC I, the operationalizing of the Payroll
Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system will focus on improving
direct access by human resource departments of line ministries and their department.
All the line ministries were brought into the system in 2005. However, at the time access
was limited to officers at Zambia's Cabinet Office. The PAF foresees that central
spending agencies will be able to access the PMEC system directly from their location.
In 2006 and the first part of 2007, the Zambia Police, Public Service Management
Division, Ministry of Finance and National Planning, Ministry of Works and Supply,
Ministry of Home Affairs, and Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives have been
connected directly to the PMEC system from their own location. This should lead to
improved quality and timeliness of the data in the Payroll and Establishment
Management Control system. This process is to continue and by 2009, about 23 central
spending agencies and six provinces are to be directly connected to the main PMEC
system.

28.     Public finance management. The Government's program in the area of public
expenditure management supported by the PAF focuses on budget execution, internal
and external accountability, and clearing of arrears, with an aim to improve the
credibility of the budget process and to measure progress of the PEMFA program that
GRZ is implementing as part of the underlying principles used by the cooperating
partners to evaluate Zambia's readiness to receive budget support (see section IV:
Collaboration with other donors).

29.     The specific indicators chosen to monitor budget execution are: (i) percent of
quarterly budget releases are between 95 and 105 percent of the budget allocation
identified in the spending agencies quarterly allocation plan. In 2006, over 70 percent of
agencies should have received their budget releases between these limits up from a low
25 percent in 2005. This is to rise to 80 percent in 2007 and to 90 percent in 2008.


                                             14

However, due to a revenue shortfall of close to one percent of GDP, which was caused by
an unanticipated appreciation of the kwacha in the first half of 2006, and measures
introduced during the last quarter of 2006 to reduce bunching of releases at the end of the
year, quarterly releases compared to expenditure plans submitted at the beginning of the
year were off by a large margin. The result was that this indicator only improved to 28
percent, well off its intended target of 70 percent; (ii) percentage of expenditure variance
between original budget and total expenditure for selected sectors. The baseline value
stood at almost 20 percent for this indicator in 2005. Given that MoFNP has revised its
financial management system to include all aid inflows into its 2007 budget, no
benchmarks have initially been set in the PAF. However, this indicator improved to 15.6
percent in 2006, indicating that the execution of the budget approved by parliament is
improving; and (iii) percent of heads that has calculated annual expenditure7 between 95
and 105 percent of total annual funding. In 2005, this number stood at 27 heads out of
49, which equals 55 percent. In 2006, this indicator improved to 69 percent i.e., 34 out of
48 heads. To strengthen further the monitoring of the execution of the budget, the
Government revised its quarterly budget execution report. The revised quarterly budget
execution report includes now an analysis of budget provision, releases, and
expenditures.

30.      To improve the effectiveness of the annual external audit report, the Government
has agreed for the period that the PAF covers, i.e., 2006-08, to act on 95 percent of the
recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in parliament. Indeed, for
2006 all recommendations by the PAC on the 2004 annual audit report have been acted
upon.

31.      Government has struggled for some time to find the financial resources to clear
arrears with its contractors. Many of the arrears stem from the less than optimal
commitment control system that was operational before 2004. The Government program
includes reduction of arrears from a level of ZK533 billion in 2005, which is equal to 1.6
percent of GDP, to zero by 2009. The decline in arrears in 2006 to ZK491 billion, which
is equal to 1.2 percent of GDP, was less than anticipated in the PAF for 2006. However,
during 2007, government reduced these arrears to ZK370 billion, or 0.8 percent of GDP
The budget for 2008 and the MTEF/Green paper for the period 2008-2010, reconfirm
Government's commitment to reduce supplier arrears to negligible levels. The approved
2008 budget has a provision of ZK350.5 billion to further dismantle the arrears with
suppliers of goods and services.

32.      To reduce the ability of new arrears to accumulate, the Government has embarked
on an implementation plan that will strengthen the commitment control system by
integrating the following stand alone financial management modules, the activity based
budgeting, funding, and cash flow forecasting and expenditures modules, into the overall
Financial Management System.



7In Zambia, total releases do not include fees and donor funding that comes to a spending agency outside
of the budget. However, these figures are reconciled on an annual basis by the office of the accountant
general.



                                                    15

33.     Performance under EMGC I. With support from EMGC I, the government, in
its effort to improve the functioning of the public sector undertook several actions in the
area of civil service reform. Government transferred the payroll for civil servants to the,
at that time, newly introduced PMEC system; a new annual performance appraisal system
was implemented for all management positions, which made annual salary increments
dependent on employee performance, and cabinet approved the new structure of those
ministries that had not finalized their restructuring plans. This was part of a reform
program to ensure that functions and structures of the Government would meet better the
demands of a market-oriented economy.

34.     To increase the credibility of the budget process and its execution, parliament
approved the revised Finance Act that strengthens Zambia's financial management and
accountability. MoFNP has since then prepared implementation regulations to make the
new act operational. A major effort is being made to create a Treasury Department
within the MoFNP. Once the Treasury Department has been established, one of the first
tasks it will take on is to gradually move towards a single treasury account for
Government resources, which will reduce vulnerability to corruption and improve cash
management. MoFNP has continued to prepare MTEF/Green Paper in the 4th quarter of
each calendar year by which the ministry outlines a three-year forward looking fiscal
framework. This includes not only the impact of the projected macro framework on the
fiscal position but also articulates indicative budget ceilings per head, including ceilings
for personal emoluments.

35.     The ministry also submitted a proposal to the Constitutional Review Committee
(CRC), which among others would allow presentation of the budget to parliament prior to
the start of the fiscal year for which it is prepared and would restrict retroactive approval
of supplementary appropriations. In the interim, cabinet continues to fund unbudgeted
expenditure requirements to the limits of the contingency resources indicated in the
budget or only after cabinet has approved any changes, by finding compensatory funding
within the approved budget resources. The reduction of general arrears, excluding
pension arrears, has progressed and has been reduced from 2.6 percent of GDP at the end
of 2004 to 1.6 percent at the end of 2005 during the EMGC I implementation period.8

36.     Although not directly supported through the EMGC I operation, government
made progress with the introduction of the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS), which was, however, part of the HIPC program. After a
protracted period, the contract to rollout the IFMIS was signed at the end of 2006.
Implementation, supported through the joint donor PEMFA project, has started and
piloting of the system has been expanded from the four spending agencies initially
targeted to eight. A prototype of the system has been developed and the initiation of the
IFMIS system in the pilot spending agencies has commenced




8Note that under EMGC I, the reduction of arrears was treated as an issue of correcting macroeconomic
imbalances. Since the level has been reduced significantly, the issue is now being assessed as one of
budget execution.



                                                   16

37.      EMGC II supported measures. Under the public sector management component
the proposed operation has supported the further roll-out of the PMEC system to another
six central spending agencies. The proposed operation has assisted GRZ in the area of
public finance management with the implementation of the following two milestones:

·   (i) MoFNP has ensured more predictability of budget execution by providing to 34
    out of 49 budget heads with annual calculated expenditures of between 95 percent
    and 105 percent of the total funding for fiscal year 2006; and

·   (ii) MoFNP has reduced domestic arrears to suppliers with: (i) stocks diminishing
    from ZK532.8 billion at the end of 2005 to equal or less than ZK491.8 billion at the
    end of 2006; (ii) ZK147 billion released to further pay down the arrears in 2007; and
    (iii) a commitment expressed in the 2008-2010 MTEF/Green paper and the 2008
    budget to reduce these arrears to negligible levels by 2009.

B. Macroeconomic Management.

38.      Government and cooperating partners are aware of the importance that the
macroeconomic environment has for growth and poverty reduction. Zambia's
macroeconomic environment has improved significantly over the last three years with
inflation in the single digits for the first time in almost three decades and a budget deficit
below three percent. The Government has indicated that maintaining and building on
these achievements is an important objective of the FNDP. The IMF has provided
assistance to GRZ through its PRGF arrangement to reach this positive position. The
PRGF arrangement has formally expired in September 2007. GRZ has indicated that it
has reached agreement with the IMF on a new (low access) three-year PRGF
arrangement that is to be discussed with the IMF executive board in the second quarter of
2008.


39.      Financial sector development. Zambia's financial sector is characterized by
relatively high cost of borrowing, thin capital markets, the absence of financial services
in most of the rural and peri-urban areas, and a relatively poor payment culture.
Zambia's Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP), which builds upon the
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), focuses therefore
on developing capital markets, enhancing the role of micro finance, developing of rural
finance, strengthening of banking and non-bank financial institutions, and introducing
mechanisms to monitor debtor's payment history. Zambia's credit culture, which has
been undermined by non-timely servicing of financial obligations, is seen as one serious
shortcoming. To overcome this deficiency, the authorities have taken the initiative and
prepared the legal and regulatory regime that allows for the operation of a private sector
credit reference bureau. The PAF for 2006 monitored this initiative and by the end of
2006, a credit reference bureau was established. The credit reference bureau is now in
the process of signing service level agreements with commercial banks and financial
institutions to govern the sharing and treatment of information.

40.      Public Service Pension Fund. As articulated in the FNDP (and in the program
document of EMGC I), the two public sector pension funds, i.e. PSPF and Local


                                                17

Annuities Superannuation Fund (LASF) are both insolvent, although both hold some
assets and are owed sizeable amounts in contribution arrears.9 However, to correct the
imbalance between contribution and benefit accrual rates, article 124 of the Constitution,
which specifically protects accrued benefits, will need to be revised. These needed
revisions are included in the proposed amendments to the Constitution prepared by the
Constitutional Review Commission (CRC). Once adopted, a revision of benefits can be
implemented and PSPF and LASF can be put on a sound financial footing. To ensure
that PSPF can continue to pay benefits until the amendments have been adopted, MoFNP
has agreed to: (i) to reduce annually during the 2007-09 period its contribution arrears to
PSPF; and (ii) not accumulate any significant new pension arrears.

41.     Performance under EMGC I. As noted previously, the Government maintained
a satisfactory macro economic framework during the implementation of the EMGC I
supported measures. EMGC I supported various measures to improve the soundness of
the financial system. This include, finalizing the FSDP, resolving state-owned NBFIs,
strengthening the governance structure of the Bank of Zambia, and improving Zambia's
overall credit culture. In each of these areas the authorities made progress: The FSDP
continues to be the guiding strategy for Zambia's financial sector, the state-owned NBFIs
are being supervised by the supervision department of the Bank of Zambia and progress
is being made to bring them under the Companies Act; and the legal and regulatory
regime that allows for the operation of a private sector credit reference bureau has been
adopted.

42.     In addition to the program supported by EMGC I, the Government finalized the
sale of Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZNCB) in early 2007. The privatization of
ZNCB was initiated under the HIPC completion program and substantively completes the
liberalization of the financial sector in Zambia.

43.     EMGC I assisted the authorities with increasing awareness on the need to reform
the civil service pension system. Without having actuarial fair benefit levels, the civil
service pension funds will face serious financial shortcomings in the medium term. In
the mean time, PSPF and LASF have taken measures to reduce their administrative costs
and the authorities have agreed to a phased pay down of their contribution arrears such
that benefits can continue to be paid out. EMGC I also assisted the National Pension
Scheme Authority (NAPSA) to improve its corporate governance and to put in place
additional safeguards with regard to its investment policy.

44.     EMGC II supported measures. In the area of macroeconomic management the
proposed EMGC II operation will support the authorities with the implementation of the
following two benchmarks:

·   (i) The Bank of Zambia has issued a license for the creation of Credit Reference
    Bureau; and

9See Appendix one of the EMGC program document, No. 29294 ZA, for a detailed description. Note that
both funds are closed to new entrants. New civil service hires join the National Pension Scheme Authority
(NAPSA), which was established in 2000 and serves the private sector and the new hires in the civil
service.



                                                    18

·   (ii) The Ministry of Finance and National Planning has implemented a phased
    reduction of arrears of contributions owed by the Government to the Public Service
    Pension Fund with: (i) stocks diminishing from ZK 464 billion at the end of 2005 to
    equal or less than ZK 388 billion at the end of 2006; (ii) ZK 112 billion released to
    further pay down arrears in 2007; and (iii) a commitment expressed in the 2008-2010
    MTEF/Green paper and the 2008 budget to reduce these arrears to negligible levels
    by the end of 2008.


C. Wealth Creation

45.      The theme of the FNDP is broad based wealth and job creation through citizen
participation and technological advancement, while the strategic focus is economic
infrastructure and human resource management. The component of wealth creation
therefore focuses primarily on agriculture, infrastructure, and private sector development,
while the social equity component highlights the need for improvements in health,
education, and HIV/AIDS outcomes.


46.      Agriculture. Agriculture features prominently in Zambia's FNDP is seen to hold
great promise for accelerating poverty reduction (see also Box 1: Zambia's growth and
poverty reduction potential). The FNDP will pay particular attention to the top priority
programs that were identified in the agricultural sector which include: irrigation
development; agricultural infrastructure and land development; livestock development;
agricultural services and technology development; and fisheries development. At the
same time, the FNDP acknowledges that Zambia needs to improve its agricultural
productivity and market competitiveness in order to increase and sustain sector's
contribution to growth and poverty reduction. Notwithstanding, it should also be noted
that the agricultural sector has contributed significantly to Zambia's overall economic
diversification, while the sector itself has also diversified and has increased production in
a variety of crops such as cotton, coffee, tobacco, and horticultural and floricultural
products. The recent impressive performance of agricultural exports has been largely
driven by private outgrower schemes which involve about 1/3 of country's smallholder
households companies and large export oriented commercial farms.


47.      Several actions have been identified in the FNDP to improve the sector's ability
to contribute more effectively to growth and poverty reduction. The main milestones
identified for inclusion in the PAF for 2006 are: (i) the need to increase the allocation
from GRZ's budget to investment programs of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives (MACO) from a meager ZK23.3 billion in 2005 to ZK88 billion in 2006
and indicative figures of ZK226, and ZK193 billion in 2007 and 2008 respectively; (ii) to
improve access to additional land that can be used for agriculture through the provision
of infrastructural services such as connection to the electricity grid, roads and water, and
irrigation services. The basic infrastructure for this exercise has been developed in 2006,
opening up an additional 50 thousand hectares annually for agriculture in 2007 and 2008;
(iii) to define the roles and responsibilities of the public and private sector when it comes
to Zambia's agricultural marketing system. To accomplish this task, a new Agricultural
Marketing Act is being developed. In 2006, the Act has been drafted and all required



                                               19

consultations concluded. The Act has been submitted to all line ministries in 2007, with
adoption by parliament and implementation substantially starting in 2008.


48.      Infrastructure. It is clear that for a country as large as Zambia, which is also
landlocked, a well-designed and maintained road network is of critical importance to link
its communities and to minimize the impact of transport cost on its overall
competitiveness. The FNDP, therefore, has put its strategic focus on improving the road
network. To improve the predictability of financing and strengthen implementation
capacity, three new road agencies, each assigned with a specific task, were created. The
National Road Fund Agency (NRFA) is responsible for the coordination and
management of the road financing functions, including collection, disbursement,
management, and accounting of Zambia's road fund; a Road Development Agency
(RDA), which is tasked with the management responsibility of the public/proclaimed
network, and which includes planning, programming, implementation, monitoring and
overall supervision of all road works in the country; and a Road Transport and Safety
Agency (RTSA), will be responsible for implementing policy on road transport and
traffic management, road safety and enforcement of laws regulating road transport, traffic
safety, and axle load control in the country. In addition, this agency is responsible for
planning, programming, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of road transport
regulations and approved safety programs.

49.      An important step to have the agencies operate effectively is to ensure that
vacancies in the new agencies are filled. Under the PAF for 2006-08, it was agreed this is
a priority and that by the end of 2006, 80 percent of all posts will be filled and that from
2007 onwards all posts will be occupied. The PAF also monitors kilometers of roads
upgraded, rehabilitated, and kilometers of unpaved roads maintained.

50.      The FNDP also puts emphasis on the need to further enhance the performance and
access of other infrastructure service delivery sectors such as water and sanitation,
electricity and telecommunications. Hence, policy improvements and investments are
taking place in these sectors as well. However, the PAF for 2006-08 does not include
indicators to monitor their development partly because of the need to make sure that the
process remains manageable for Government, and partly because Government and PRBS
donors agreed that, the road transport is of a critical importance for Zambia's
development.10

51.      Private Sector Development (PSD). In order to reduce the cost of doing business
in Zambia and to increase participation by Zambians in the economic process, GRZ has
undertaken some legislative and institutional initiatives:

52.      The Zambian Development Agency (ZDA) has taken on the responsibilities of the
Zambia Investment Council (ZIC); Zambian Privatization Agency (ZPA); Zambian
Export and Processing Zone Agency (ZEPZA); Small Enterprise Development Board


10This does not preclude the inclusion of other infrastructure service delivery sectors into the PAF at a later
stage as the process is of revising and extending the PAF with an additional year of coverage takes place on
an annual basis and thus allows for a revision of priorities.



                                                      20

(SEDB); and Export Board of Zambia (EBZ). The Act establishing ZDA was passed in
2006 and a workplan has been developed for removal of barriers to export and setting up
a business. In addition, the Patent and Registration of Companies Office (PACRO) was
reengineered so as to streamline the business registration process. The Lusaka PACRO
office is operating more efficiently and two pilot offices will be completed by end 2008.
The Tourism and Hospitality Act was passed, and the Ministry of Tourism and Natural
Resources is currently working on the accompanying Statutory Instruments (with the
support of IDA and PEP IFC) so as to streamline licensing for tourism related businesses.
These efforts will combine to reduce the length of time it takes to establish a business by
2008 from level of 35 days in 2005 by at least seven days.

53.      The Citizen's Economic Empowerment Act has been passed by parliament, and a
Citizen's Economic Empowerment Authority has been established and a plan for
information and communication will has been put in place. 2007 and 2008 will focus on
establishing its fund and making it operational.


54.      Performance under EMGC I. Even though there were no credit release
milestones under the previous lending operation, several relevant initiatives to EMGC II
were supported. For example, the Government in collaboration with IDA and other
Cooperating Partners organized a private sector development forum to assess progress
made on the PSD reform program and recommend measures to improve its efficacy. As
a result, the PSD Reform Program was revised and the number of working groups
reduced from twelve to three, in an effort to increase focus and expedite results.


55.      EMGC II supported measures. In the area of agriculture, the proposed EMGC
II operation has supported

·   The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives with the drafting and finalization of
    consultations with stakeholders on an agricultural marketing act.


56.      In the area of infrastructure, the proposed EMGC II operation has supported

·   The strengthening of Government's capacity to address identified bottlenecks to
    development in the management of the road infrastructure by filling 80 percent of the
    staffing vacancies of the National Road Fund Agency, the Road Development
    Agency, and the Road Transport and Safety Agency.

57.      Reducing administrative barriers is a priority in the area of private sector
development and therefore the proposed operation has supported

·   (i) the establishment of the Zambia Development Agency and its taking on the
    responsibilities of the former Zambia Investment Center, Zambia Privatization
    Agency, Zambia Export and Processing Zone Agency, Small Enterprise Development
    Board, and Export Board of Zambia; and (ii) the development of an implementation
    plan for the ZDA to accomplish further progress in the areas of removal of barriers to
    export and setting up of businesses).



                                               21

D. Social Equity

58.     Health sector. A healthy, well educated population, which is aware of HIV/AIDs
prevention and treatment, is critical to ensure positive long-term per capita growth and
poverty reduction. To improve the chances of Zambians to live healthy lives several
initiatives have been incorporated in Zambia's FNDP and a number of indicators for
health have been included into the PAF. These indicators focus on assisting the
vulnerable and disenfranchised in Zambia, by improving the percentage of institutional
deliveries; increasing the percentage of fully immunized children under one year of age
in the 20 worst performing districts; improving the utilization of Preferred Health Care
(PHC) facilities; and ensuring that an increasing amount of the health budget is released
to the district level.11

59.     Education. Zambia implemented a policy of free access to primary education in
2003 and this has resulted in increases in net enrollment for the affected grades 1-7.
However, some districts have not done as well as others. The FNDP acknowledges this
issue and is targeting those districts that still have net enrollment rate (NER) of less than
80 percent. In 2005, 10 districts out of 72 still had a NER of less than 80 percent. In
addition, girls leave school earlier than boys and pupil teacher ratios in several districts
are very high, e.g., in 2005 in 12 districts pupil teacher ratios stand at over 100. The PAF
supports actions included in the FNDP to address these shortcomings and to gradually
improve completion rate for girls and reduce the number of districts with pupil teacher
ratios of over 100 for grade 1-4.9

60.     HIV/AIDS. The human toll of AIDS for families and communities in Zambia is
startling. Even though levels of infection have stabilized, the sheer number of people
living with HIV/AIDS is astounding. The FNDP states that estimates put the prevalence
rate at 16 percent among the 15-49 years age group. About 1 million Zambians are
infected with HIV, of which over 200,000 are in need of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
About eight percent of boys and 17 percent of girls aged 15-24 are living with HIV and
40 percent of infants born to HIV infected parents are HIV infected. The PAF supports
the effort by the authorities to increase the number of people tested and number of people
accessing Anti-Retroviral drugs.

61.     Given the presence of several donors, including IDA and the nature of the
interactions in the area of social equity, the proposed operation does not to have any
release milestone in the area of social equity.



         IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

62.     Link to the Country Assistance Strategy. The FY04-07 CAS, discussed with the
board in March 2004, is explicitly rooted in a results framework, which links the
objectives of the predecessor of the FNDP, i.e., the Transitional National Development

11See Annex 2 - PAF for the specific values for each of the indicators for health, education, and
HIV/AIDS.



                                                   22

Plan (TNDP), to specific outcomes to be supported by IDA. The focus of IDA activities
under the FY04-7 CAS were structured around three strategic priorities: (i) Sustained
Economic Growth Anchored in a Diversified and Export-Oriented Economy; (b)
Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable; and (c) Efficiently and Effectively
Managed Public Sector. The FY08-11 CAS, which is proposed to be discussed in
conjunction with the proposed EMGC II, aligns itself with the FNDP and proposes
selective interactions in four priority areas. These four areas are: (i) macro economic
management; (ii) infrastructure development; institutional capacity; human capital
development.

63.     Both CASs state that a DPO depends on upfront actions and results and be the
instrument to initiate and support policy and institutional reforms. Table 4 lists the
proposed credit release milestones. Section III describes in detail how the milestones
relate to the FNDP and the PAF. Annex 3 explicitly identifies how the key areas of
reform are aligned with each priority area of the CASs and FNDP. The full Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) for 2006-08 identifies clearly the link for each indicator
with the FNDP.

64.     Collaboration with other donors. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that
guides the process for providing Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) to GRZ was
signed in mid 2005 between GRZ and CPs. In addition to IDA, the following CPs-
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and European Commission-signed the
MoU. Since then, Finland, Germany and the African Development Bank have formally
joined The proposed operation is part of this joint effort and all proposed release
milestones are part of the PAF, which has been prepared jointly with GRZ and
cooperating partners (see also Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality).




                                              23

                      Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
·   The proposed operation draws directly from the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), which
    was jointly prepared by representatives of the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP)
    and Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) donors. The PAF itself is linked to priorities and
    actions spelled out in Zambia's new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)/Fifth National
    Development Plan (FNDP), which covers 2006-10. As was done for the PRSP/FNDP, all indicators
    selected for the PAF were discussed in the relevant Sectoral Advisory Groups (SAG), which consist of
    Government officials, representatives of Non-Government Organizations (NGO), civil society,
    business organizations, and donors. The SAGs are also the main forum used by GRZ to discuss the
    PRSP/FNDP and progress with its implementation.

·   The PAF builds on the interim PAF12 (iPAF), which was developed in 2005, and which included
    several actions of the previous EMGC operation. Its implementation was generally satisfactory. In
    addition, the previous EMGC operation disbursed both tranches although the second tranche disbursed
    with some delay. The implementation of the iPAF and the previous EMGC operation together with the
    broadly satisfactory implementation of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility of the IMF provides
    an adequate track record.

·   The PRSP/FNDP, the PAF, and other ongoing reform efforts, in particular in the area of public sector
    management, have benefited extensively from IDA and other joint analytical work. For example the
    Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Poverty and Vulnerability Analysis (PVA), and the Public
    Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Report (PEMFAR) have all influenced the
    supported reforms including the PAF and ongoing TA projects.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
·   IDA's support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix and draws all its proposed measures
    from the PAF used by all PRBS donors providing budget support. Note that the PAF is for three years
    and as such provides an accountability framework for the years 2006-08 and will be of a rolling nature.
    In addition, the cooperating partners which are part of the Wider Harmonization in Practice (WHiP)
    group, which includes IDA, are preparing a Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia (JASZ) as a response
    to the new PRSP/FNDP in order to further increase aid coordination and reduce transaction cost to
    GRZ.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
·   Building on what has been articulated under principle one and two; IDA's budget support operation is
    part of the support provided by all PRBS donors. As such, the bi-annual reviews agreed upon by GRZ
    and the PRBS donors are used to agree on the content of the forward-looking PAF, the performance
    under the PAF, and the aid modalities that GRZ can expect for its upcoming fiscal year. The first two
    issues mentioned are part of the discussions that take place in June of each year, while the
    announcement of the expected aid modalities in the form of budget support are communicated during
    the October review.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
·   All proposed IDA release milestones are chosen from the PAF. The total indicators monitored through
    the PAF are 34 of which eight are proposed to guide IDA's disbursement under this operation. The




12Note that IDA did not use the iPAF for disbursing its funds as the previous EMGC operation which
provided IDA's budget support for 2004 and 2005 through two tranches was already in place. EMGC I was
prepared before other cooperating partners, except the EU, were ready to provide direct budget support.
IDA was however a full partner in the preparation of the iPAF.



                                                    24

    milestones chosen are those that overlap with the objectives of the CAS and the PRSP/FNDP and are
    thus critical to support the results agenda under the CAS.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
·   Building on what is stated under principle 3, IDA announces in conjunction with all other PRBS
    donors its expected amount for budget support for GRZ's next fiscal year at the October PRBS review
    meeting. These dates are chosen indeed to allow GRZ to prepare its budget knowing the amounts it
    can expect as budget support.

·   The PAF is a mix of process and outcome indicators (see Annex 2 (with process indicators mostly
    identified for the first year, i.e. 2006, as a means to pave the path to reaching the results, which are
    identified in accompanying outcome indicators in the outer years.



65.      The MoU identifies two categories of performance that are important for
disbursement. First, performance is measured against so-called underlying principles.
These comprise of: (i) GRZ's commitment to fight poverty, including through a pattern
of public expenditure consistent with poverty reduction priorities as identified in
Zambia's National Development Plan; (ii) GRZ's commitment to peace, democratic
principles, the rule of law, good governance and integrity in public life, including the
fight against corruption; (iii) GRZ's commitment to public financial management reforms
as witnessed by satisfactory progress with the PEMFA program; (iv) GRZ's commitment
to pursuing sound macro-economic policies, as is shown by a positive IMF assessment of
overall macro-economic performance. Second, performance against specific process and
outcome indicators as specified in the PAF. The PAF itself does not include indicators
related to the underlying principles.13

66.      The MoU allows each donor to decide how much it will disburse against the
underlying principles and/or against all or a subset of indicators spelled out in the PAF.
At present there are 34 indicators and milestones included in the PAF. For each of the
indicators and milestones a baseline figure for the year 2005 has been included as well as
outcomes for the years 2006, 2007, and 2008. The targets for the outer two years may be
revised based upon performance for the year 2006. The proposed IDA operation is
linked explicitly to eight release milestones out of 34 indicators identified in the PAF for
2006 (see table 4: EMGC II - credit milestones).

67.      Preparation and review process of PAF. The PAF for 2006-08 was jointly
prepared with GRZ, in particular with staff of MoFNP, and PRBS donors, including IDA.
Extensive consultations took place with the Sectoral Advisory Groups (SAGs), which
consist of Government officials, representatives of Non-Government Organizations
(NGO), civil society, business organizations, and donors. The SAGs are also the main
forum used by GRZ to discuss the PRSP/FNDP and progress with its implementation.
All PRBS donors at the October 2006 review meeting endorsed the final version of the
PAF.


13The PAF does include indicators that measure macro economic performance and public expenditure
management but the underlying principles include a wider set of indicators and actions on which the donors
evaluate the performance of the Government.



                                                       25

68.      The Government and the PRBS donors meet twice a year to review performance
in relation to the agreed PAF for the previous year, and to agree the contents of the PAF
for the next year. The joint review meetings take place each year in June and October:

         a. The June review meeting focuses on the PRBS donors and Government
              coming to a joint view on performance, which serves as the basis for
              commitments for the next budget year. The review is based on the National
              Development Plan's Annual Review, the annual Public Expenditure
              Management and Financial Accountability (PEMFA) progress reports,
              Quarterly Budget Execution Reports and related information, plus the national
              audits;

         b. The October review meeting focuses on dialogue on forward planning and
              budgeting and agreement on the PAF for the next budget year. This dialogue
              is based on the annual Financial Reports of the previous budget year, the
              Annual PEMFA Evaluation and the ceilings in the annual budget for the next
              budget year, as specified in Zambia's MTEF Green Paper. During this
              Review meeting, each member of the PRBS Group confirms the volume of its
              commitment. During this review meeting, Government and PRBS donors
              agree on the PAF for the next budget year, and any PRBS donor i.e. IDA,
              intending to provide a floating element will confirm against the new PAF the
              specific milestones, indicators and/or targets that will trigger, when met, an
              immediate disbursement at the relevant review meeting in the following year.


The first review of the full PAF took place in June 2007 and its evaluation is attached to
the program document as Annex 2..

69.      Collaboration with the IMF. The achievements of the proposed EMGC II goals
are strengthened by IDA's close collaboration with the IMF. Benchmarks designed to
improve the management of public expenditure through greater financial discipline and
accountability complement the IMF's support for revenue mobilization and expenditure
control. The IMF's structural policy benchmarks are again developed in close
consultations with IDA and also stress the complementarities between the two programs.
The IMF PRGF program was approved in June 2004 and expired in September 2007. An
understanding has been reached between the IMF and the authorities on a new three-year
arrangement, which is expected to be presented to the IMF's executive board in the
second quarter of 2008.

70.      Relationship to other IDA operations. IDA has several operations and ongoing
knowledge based activities that overlap with the areas covered by the proposed operation.
In the area of Public Sector Reform IDA has in place a TA operation, Public Service
Management Program14 assisting GRZ in the area of civil service and pay reform as well
as with reforms in the area of public expenditure management and financial


14The PSM project in the amount of USD30 million was approved by the board on January 5, 2006 and
was declared effective on May 10 2006. The operation contributes to a pooled funding arrangement and is
for a part a follow up on the Public Sector Capacity Building project (PSCAP) which closed in 2005.



                                                     26

accountability, including the installation of an Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS). The reforms in the area of wealth creation are
complementary to ongoing investment operation in infrastructure,15 agriculture,16 and
private sector development with a focus on economic diversification.17 One of the main
challenges for infrastructure development to contribute to economic growth and increase
access is resources for maintenance and investment, which is hampered by tariff levels
that do not guarantee revenue adequacy. In the area of social equity, IDA is currently
implementing a HIV/AIDS project,18 and after the closure of its Basic Education project
in June 2006, IDA has taken on the roll of providing knowledge transfers to GRZ and
cooperating partners for the remainder of the CAS. As such, IDA has prepared a Public
Expenditure Review for the education sector. In the health sector, IDA currently also
provides knowledge based services and is in the process of finalizing a PER for the health
sector.

71.     Lessons learned. It will be necessary to take on board lessons learned from the
recently completed EMGC, which have been articulated in its Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) and IEG's evaluation of the EMGC operation,19 and from the
Country Assistance Evaluation by the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Department
(IED)20 as it will improve effectiveness of this and future IDA programs. In developing
the program supported by the proposed operation, lessons learned from the two reports,
have led to recognizing that (a) institutional reforms require a longer time horizon than
one year quick disbursing credit by anchoring the reforms in a three your rolling
Performance Assessment Framework; (b) the need for experienced staff in the continuity
of policy dialogue by teaming up with other cooperating partners who bring specialized
skills to the team; (c) the need for continuity in the policy dialogue by signing up jointly
with other cooperating partners and GRZ to an institutionalized implementation
arrangement, which stipulates regular meetings between GRZ and PRBS donors to
review progress and identify potential bottleneck with regard to GRZ's ability to reach
the identified targets in the PAF. The latter has resulted in an agreement to have a high-
level discussion on important policy issues at least once a year.

72.     Analytical underpinnings. The proposed operation draws from a variety of
economic sector work that includes the Public Expenditure Management and
Accountability Report (PEMFAR), Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA), Foreign Investment Advisory Services' (FIAS)


15The Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project of USD50 million was approved by the board on
March 9, 2004 and declared effective on June 15, 2004. Additional financing in the amount of USD25
million was approved in 2007. A Water Sector Performance Improvement Project was approved by the
board on October 5, 2006 in the amount of USD23 million.
16The Agriculture Development Support Program in the amount of USD37.2 million was approved by the
board on May 16, 2006 and declared effective on September 12 2006.
17The SEED project in the amount of USD28.2 million was approved by the board on July 29 2004 and
declared effective on November, 10 2004.
18The HIV/AIDS project, Zanara, in the amount of US42 million, was approved by the board on December
30, 2002 and declared effective on July 8 2003.
19See ICR of the EMGC operation, report No. 36495 ZA and IEG's evaluation dated March 26, 2007
20See the program document of the EMGC, report no. 29294 ZA, page 3, for an overview of its main
recommendations for adjustment lending to GRZ.

Administrative Barriers to Investment report, Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment
(PVA) as well as the diagnostic work on pro-poor growth undertaken by the Poverty
group in PREM. In addition, the credit draws from reports and evaluations carried out by
GRZ such as "Zambia: Public Financial Management Performance Report and
Performance Indicators (PEFA)." In the social sectors the PAF has drawn on the recently
completed PER on the education sector and on the preliminary findings of the Health
PER.

73.     The CEM combined with the Pro-Poor Growth publication by the Bank's PREM
poverty group analyzes the potential of enhancing pro-poor growth in Zambia. One of its
main conclusions is that the impact of growth on the poor can be enhanced by ensuring
that rural dwellers can better participate in the economic process. The challenge
identified is to improve the functioning of the agricultural sector while improving access
to markets through a better road network and access to (micro) finance. This has
influenced the FNDP and its focus on agriculture and physical infrastructure i.e. roads.
The PVA confirms that to have a significant impact on poverty, particular attention needs
to be paid to integrate more of the rural population into the economy.

74.     The investment climate assessment ranks cost of finance and macroeconomic
stability as the two main constraints to business. Obviously, the cost of finance is related
to macro economic performance and to the functioning of the financial sector. In
addition, the FSAP points directly to the need to improve the credit culture in Zambia as
a means of reducing the cost of doing business in the financial sector. Both these reports
have influenced the focus of the FSDP, which has guided the FNDP and the PAF for the
financial sector. The Doing Business indicators, the Administrative barriers study as well
as the DTIS have helped identify the need to reduce administrative barriers in particular
in the areas of trade and licenses. These are the two main categories in which Zambia
scores poorly. The milestones and indicators in the area of PSD are based on these
findings.

75.     The PEMFA report has guided the comprehensive reforms the Government is
implementing in the area of public sector management. These reforms are supported
under the PEMFA project, which receives funding from a large group of CPs including
IDA. In addition, GRZ's PEFA reports have all identified the main areas of public sector
management in which Zambia should make improvements. This to ensure the
sustainability of the macro economic framework, the ability to direct resources to those
expenditure programs that are a priority of Zambia's PRSP, and to improve the credibility
and accountability of the Government with the business sector as well as civil society.

      V.       THE PROPOSED SECOND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND
                                       GROWTH CREDIT

76.     Operation description and Policy areas. Partly at the request of Government and
partly because of the need to increase the impact of growth on the poor, this operation
focuses on those components of the FNDP, i.e., wealth creation, macroeconomic
management and public sector reform that enhance the positive impact of growth on the
poor, add to the sustainability of the current growth momentum, and contribute indirectly



                                               28

to the sustainability of (social) service delivery and contribute to the results specified in
the CASs (see Annex 3: results framework and alignment with the strategic priorities of
the CAS and FNDP). Accordingly, the proposed operation has selected eight credit
release milestones in the areas mentioned. See Table 4: EMGC II ­ Credit Milestones.

                                           A. Public Sector Reform

A.1. Public Service Management
PSMD in cabinet office has implemented a payroll management and establishment control system in six
additional central spending agencies enabling the human resource officers to directly access the system.
A.2. Public Finance Management
The Ministry of Finance and National Planning has ensured more predictability of budget execution by
providing to 34 out of 49 budget heads with annual calculated expenditures of between 95% and 105% of the

77.     Poverty and social impacts. The proposed EMGC II will have an important,
though indirect, effect on poverty reduction, since it will support the Government's effort
with regard to FNDP implementation. It will facilitate poverty reduction mainly through
three channels. The first channel is by assisting the Government to maintain a growth
conducive macroeconomic environment, which will aid the robustness of the current
growth momentum. The second channel is through the continued support to improve
public sector management processes that will enhance the Government's ability to direct
its scarce resources to those expenditure programs that will reduce poverty more
efficiently and more effectively. The third channel is by contributing to a reduction in the
cost of doing business in Zambia, by putting in place or making operational institutional
arrangements that can directly or indirectly contribute to increased productivity of the
private sector.

78.     Environmental impacts. An effort was made to assess and address the likelihood
of significant effects of policies supported by the DPO on the environment, natural
resources, or forests including assessment of the government's systems for reducing
adverse effects and enhancing positive effects. There are two areas of the proposed
EMGC II that require further attention with respect to environmental issues. These are: (i)
the development of an Agricultural Marketing Act, and (ii) increased staffing of three
new road agencies.

79.     Development of Agricultural Marketing Act. EMGC II supports the effort to
develop a competitive, efficient, and transparent public and private sector driven
marketing system for agricultural commodities. As the draft Agricultural Marketing Act
(AGM) act is still under preparation, any environmental impacts are difficult to predict.
In the past, discretionary policies by the government negatively affected the ability of the
private sector to invest in the market. If the new AGM Act will include clear rules for the
private and public sector, the predictability of market outcomes for all participants will
increase. As a result, the private sector will face reduced costs related to risk and
uncertainty, such that the profitability of commercial agriculture is likely to increase,
leading to production enhancing investments. In principle, increased agricultural activity
may lead to encroachment of previously forested lands for agriculture production and
increased intensification. Environmental impacts associated with the development of a
more transparent marketing system are therefore likely.

80.     In the short to medium term, the majority of agricultural investments induced by
an improved Agricultural Marketing Act will be carried out by large scale commercial
farms and corporations (ca 700 in total) and by emergent, commercial farmers (totaling
50,000). For two reasons, significant negative effects of these investments are less likely.
First, the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act (EPPCA) from 1990
requires that an EIA be prepared for all investments that have a major impact on the
environment. EIA procedures are defined by the Environmental Impact Assessment
Regulations (1997) and include the identification and implementation of adequate
environmental mitigation measures. As EIAs are the main source of income for the
Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ), it has a strong incentive to follow up on these
regulations. Second, due to the strong presence of the Bank as a lead donor in




                                              30

agriculture, actively supporting the development of commercial agriculture, an additional
mechanism to monitor these investments is in place.

81.    The FNDP identifies the agricultural sector as one of the main sources of growth
and broad-based poverty reduction in Zambia. In the medium to long term, the pressure
on natural resources, arable and rangelands is therefore likely to increase. The FNDP
recognizes that sustainable management of the natural resource base will be key to
maintaining current and sustaining future growth and poverty reduction in Zambia.
While as yet unapproved, the National Policy on Environment (NPE) is designed for a 15
year period from effectiveness, to create "a comprehensive framework for effective
natural resource utilization and environmental conservation", while being "sensitive to
the demands of sustainable development". The main impact of agricultural growth on the
environment will therefore depend on the implementation of the NPE. Currently, the
implementation of environmental policies is limited by a lack of information
management systems to establish trends in the status of Zambia's natural resources. It is
therefore recommended that the Bank support the development of appropriate
Information and Monitoring Systems for natural resource management.

82.    Increased staffing of three new road agencies. The EMGC II supports the
appropriate staffing levels of the newly created road agencies, National Road Fund
Agency (NRFA), Road Development Agency (RDA), and Road Transport and Safety
Agency (RTSA). The main objective of the creation of these new road agencies is to
increase the predictability of financing and to strengthen implementation capacity. Part
of the new structure is an Environmental Management Unit within the Planning
Department of the Road Development Agency. As a result, environmental concerns are
an integral part of the planning and design process. This is an improvement to the past,
where environmental aspects were only considered at a very late stage of the planning
process. The EMGC II support to the new road agencies is therefore expected to have a
positive impact on the environment

83.    Implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The agreement reached
between cooperating partners and GRZ and made explicit in the MoU for budget support,
defines reporting requirements, bi-annual meetings to discuss progress and possible
revision of the PAF, as well as institutional arrangements and platforms for evaluation.
In addition the cooperating partners under the MoU have agreed to provide budget
support in a way that: (i) is aligned with GRZ cycles for planning, implementation,
monitoring, reporting and funding; (ii) improves harmonization by eliminating bilateral
administrative and reporting requirements as well as bilateral reviews; (iii) ensures
transparency in Zambia of conditions and funding; and (iv) enhances the capacity of GRZ
to meet its commitments by providing appropriate technical assistance and capacity
building.

84.    Disbursement. After Credit effectiveness and upon receipt of a withdrawal
application signed by an authorized signatory, the single tranche withdrawal from the
Credit Account will be deposited by IDA into an account designated by the Borrower at
the Central Bank of Zambia which forms part of the country's foreign exchange reserves.
The Borrower will ensure that upon deposit of the Credit proceeds into said account, an
equivalent amount is credited in the borrower's accounting system to an account,


                                             31

acceptable to the Bank, which finances budget obligations. The Government will
confirm these transactions in writing within 30 days after receipt of the deposit from
IDA. The proceeds of the Credit may not be used to finance expenditures excluded under
the Credit Agreement. If the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes (for
example, to finance goods or services on IDA's standard negative list), IDA will require
the borrower to refund the amount directly to IDA.

85.      Auditing, and Closing Date. The use of the equivalent amount of the Credit
proceeds as described above for budgetary expenditure is subject to audit by the Auditor-
general. IDA reserves the right to require an audit of the foreign exchange account at the
Central Bank of Zambia (deposit account). MoFNP will arrange for the audit of the
deposit account upon request by IDA in accordance with auditing standards and terms of
reference acceptable to IDA and by auditors acceptable to IDA. The MoFNP will make
the report on the audit of such account available to IDA not later than four months after the
date of the Association's request. However, IDA will coordinate with other PRBS donors in
the case it request an Audit as the memorandum of Understanding for PRBS donors
includes the provision of an annual audit. The closing date of the Credit will be
December 31, 2008.

86.      Risks and risk mitigation. It is useful to make a distinction between the risks
related to the proposed DPO and the implementation of the overall medium term program
as articulated in the PAF of which the first year is supported by the proposed DPO. The
risk related to this DPO is one of sustainability and maintenance of the implemented
reforms. This is actually mitigated through the fact that the operation is embedded in a
medium term performance assessment framework (PAF) that is aligned with the
country's own development strategy, i.e., FNDP, and is undertaken in conjunction with
all donors, which are providing budget support. Nevertheless, successful implementation
of the PAF could face risks of the following nature: (i) political; (ii) macro economic;
(iii) external developments; (iv) failure to contain the further spread of the HIV/AIDS
pandemic; and (v) implementation capacity.

87.      Political Risk. The outcome of the elections has shown that the current regime is
susceptible and vulnerable to populous ideas. This can affect the attention needed to stay
the course with the ongoing economic reform efforts to further strengthen the
effectiveness of the public sector and the commitment to work towards a more private
sector friendly economic environment. To mitigate these challenges IDA, through the
activities identified under the FY08-11 CAS, will assist the authorities to strengthen the
institutional capacity of key oversight agencies and support bottom-up initiatives that
emphasize good governance.

88.      Macroeconomic stability. Even though fiscal discipline has taken root in Zambia,
relatively ineffective public expenditure management processes and populist tendencies
can generate risks for macroeconomic performance in particular given the expected
additional tax revenues coming from the mining sector under the revised fiscal regime for
mining. The recent progress in regaining control over the fiscal situation and the decline
in inflation together with the fact that Zambia has reached HIPC Completion and
subsequently benefits from MDRI, could reduce the Government's willingness to



                                              32

maintain a growth conducive macro economic framework. In addition, pressure by civil
service unions for increases in wages and allowances and other non-priority sectors such
as defense could potentially risk the successful execution of the fiscal program. A new
three PRGF arrangement, membership of EITI++, and monitoring of budget execution
through the PRBS related biannual reviews assist addressing these potential risks.

89.     External Developments. The country is vulnerable to terms of trade shocks and
droughts. The upsurge in copper prices and expended production of copper might re-
ignite the hope that Zambia once more can count on the copper sector for economic
success. This could potentially reduce the efforts to diversify the economy and as such
reduce the pro-poor nature of Zambia's growth. IDA in collaboration with other
cooperating partners supports GRZ's efforts to manage its mineral wealth such that it
contributes to increased diversification. This includes assistance to increase institutional
capacity to harness the mining boom and improvements in the business environment that
improve productivity and thus Zambia's competitiveness. A reoccurrence of a drought
would harm the recent gains in food security and could see a surge in the need for food
imports. Several activities are supported to reduce the dependency on rain-fed
agriculture. IDA is proposing under the FY08-11 CAS to support GRZ with an irrigation
project as well as a water resource assistance strategy that can help the authorities to
improve the management of its water resources partly with an aim to reduce the impact of
droughts.

90.     HIV/AIDS pandemic. HIV/AIDS remains the most significant health threat to
Zambia's population and hence to its prosperity. The impact of the disease is
increasingly visible in all spheres of Zambia's society and economy. With prevalence
rates remaining in double-digit figures, the potential damage is enormous. Besides that
the PAF, and thus EMGC II, monitors GRZ's efforts to fight the pandemic, the Bank's
FY08-11 CAS requires that issues of HIV/AIDS are part of each IDA operations.

91.     Implementation capacity. In addition to the risks identified in the CAS in this
area, GRZ's weak policy implementation record, limited Government administrative
capacity, and coordination among relevant agencies could lead to delays in the
implementation of key measures. Several programs in particular through PEMFA are in
place to assist the authorities to improve its capacity to manage the economy.
