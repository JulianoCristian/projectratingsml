The key lessons are as\n            follows. Project effectiveness, and sustainability is\n            strongly ensured by the beneficiaries ownership, confirmed\n            as of the early stages of the project, through involvement\n            in preparation work, and continued throughout the project\n            cycle. In a civil works project, it is important to delay\n            appraisal until at least, a quarter of the final design is\n            ready for bidding, and, when land appropriation is involved,\n            particularly if timing is a factor, issues regarding\n            resettlement, and land acquisition should be completed\n            before awarding associated contracts, to avoid conflict of interests."}, "docdt": "2000-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
