         of rural and urban flooding; (b) improve health and living\n            conditions in the area; (c) support agricultural and\n            livestock development; and (d) protect and conserve the\n            natural environment. The project provides flood control and\n            drainage for a priority area of about 170,000 ha.  Principal\n            investments consist of dikes, bypass channels, and secondary\n            drainage systems, rural roads, bridges and various control\n            and conveyance structures.  It includes an Agricultural\n            Development Plan (PDA) aimed at supporting and improving\n            smallholder production systems and provides for\n            environmental protection and conservation within the project\n            area and in its close vicinity.  It includes an\n            institutional strengthening component for the Commission for\n            the Development of the Guayas River Basin (CEDEGE) and for\n            agencies participating in agricultural development and\n            environmental intitiatives.  It also provides for a\n            monitoring and evaluation process, a mid-term review and\n            recommendations, additional studies, and possible follow-up\n            projects, as well as financing for a master plan for the\n            entire Lower Guayas Basin that delineates a sound\n            development strategy for the area's natural and human resources."}, "docdt": "1990-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
