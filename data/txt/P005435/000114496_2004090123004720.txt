Re:

(Fifth Water Supply Project)
Amendment to the Project Agreement
Sir:
We refer to the Project Agreement between the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the Régie Autonome de Distribution d’Eau 
et d’Electricité de Kénitra (RAK) for the above-captioned Project, dated December 3, 
1993 (the Project Agreement), and the request of the Kingdom of Morocco dated March 
24, 1999 to amend the loan documentation following the privatization of the operations 
of one of the Participating Utilities: the Régie Autonome Intercommunale de 
Distribution d’Eau de Rabat Salé (RED).
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank has acceded to the above request and, 
therefore, proposes the following amendments:
In the Preamble to the Project Agreement, paragraph (A) will read as follows: 
“by the Loan Agreement of even date herewith between the Kingdom of 
Morocco (the 
Borrower) and the Bank, (the Bank) has agreed to make available to 
the Borrower an amount in  various currencies equivalent to thirty million seven 
hundred thousand seven hundred and 
eight Dollars and forty six cents 
(US$30,700,708.46); and one hundred fifty one million 
seven hundred 
seventy three thousand and two hundred seventy French Francs and ninety one 
centimes (FFR151,773,270.91), on the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan 
Agreement, 
but only on condition that the Participating Utility agrees to undertake 
such obligation 
toward the Bank as are set forth in this Agreement”.
Section 2.01 (a) of the Project Agreement will read as follows:
“The Participating Utility declares its commitment to the objectives of 
the Project 
as set forth in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement, and, to this end, shall 
carry out its Part 
of the Project (Parts B.1 (d) and B.2 (d)) with due diligence and 
efficiency and in 
conformity with appropriate administrative, financial, 
engineering and public utility 
practices, and shall provide, or cause to be 
provided, promptly as needed, the funds, 
facilities, services and other 
resources required for its Part of the Project”.
Section 4.03 (a) of the Project Agreement, will read as follows:
“Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Participating Utility 
shall reach on 
its water activities a ratio of total operating expenses 
(excluding depreciation) to total 
operating revenues not higher than 80% for 
Fiscal Year 2000 and thereafter every following 
Fiscal Year during Project 
implementation”.
Section 4.05 (a) of the Project Agreement will read as follows: 
“The Participating Utility shall for each Fiscal Year, commencing with 
Fiscal Year 
1999, maintain its water supply receivables at a level which shall not 
exceed its average 
eight months' billings”.
All the terms and conditions of the Project Agreement, as amended hereby, shall 
remain in full force and effect.
