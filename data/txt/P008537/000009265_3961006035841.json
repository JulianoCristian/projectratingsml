technical\n            assistance for the restructuring of Lithuania State Power\n            System (LSPS), institutional strengthening, and project\n            implementation. These components were chosen because they\n            are of high priority, can be implemented rapidly, would\n            maximize the impact of Bank funds, and bring about a\n            beneficial impact on the electricity subsector and prepare\n            the electricity system for interconnection with Western\n            European networks. The electricity components are\n            complementary to a European Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development administered project (under the grant from the\n            Nuclear Safety Account)."}, "docdt": "1994-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
