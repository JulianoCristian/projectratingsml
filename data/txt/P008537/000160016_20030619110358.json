The\n            performances of the World Bank and the Borrower are rated as\n            satisfactory. The Bank's experience in Lithuania since\n            1994 suggests a number of lessons which may be relevant to\n            the energy sector reform process in other states. Given\n            strong Government support, enabling good regulation and\n            governance, and payment discipline on the part of budget\n            entities, it is possible for a publicly-owned utility to be\n            successful, well-run and financially robust, and to be a\n            positive player in market reform, while remaining under\n            state control. Structural adjustment operations and project\n            operations, if co-coordinated, are mutually supportive.\n            Reform policies should initially emphasize restructuring\n            rather than privatization. Excessive concentration on\n            privatization as an objective can have negative effects on\n            the reform process, particularly in the early stages: in the\n            case of Lithuania, given the variety of governments which\n            held power, too much emphasis on privatization could have\n            been counter-productive, whereas the benefits of\n            institutional reform, restructuring, unbundling and\n            corporatization could be readily demonstrated and were\n            acceptable to the key players. Achieving improved governance\n            of utilities smoothes the institutional reform process. Good\n            utility governance rests on the clear definition and\n            separation of four pillars: policy, ownership, management\n            and regulation. The Board forms the bridge between the\n            second and third of these, and a Board of individuals chosen\n            for their individual merits, clearly briefed on the\n            shareholders' objectives and working free of\n            ministerial interference can help management to optimize\n            operational performance. Most important of all, an\n            independent, well-resourced regulator put in place at an\n            early stage of the reform process can be a firm bulwark\n            against back-sliding."}, "docdt": "2003-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
