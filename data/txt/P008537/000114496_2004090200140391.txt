                              Representations
Dear Sirs and Mesdames:
        In connection with the Project Agreement to be entered
into today between the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (the Bank) and the Lithuania State Power System
(LSPS), LSPS hereby undertakes and warrants to the Bank that:
        1.      The financial statements dated December 31, 1993,
copies of which have been furnished to the Bank, correctly set
forth the financial and operating condition of LSPS as of such
date and that since such date there have been no material
adverse changes in the financial and operating conditions of
LSPS.
        2.      LSPS is not engaged in litigation as plaintiff or
defendant, the outcome of which might materially and adversely
affect its financial condition.
        3.      LSPS has no outstanding agreements or liabilities,
contingent or otherwise (including taxes) which might
materially and adversely affect its financial condition.
        4.      No debt of LSPS is secured by any mortgage, pledge,
charge, priority or other lien, and no contract or arrangement
exists for the creation of any such mortgage, pledge, charge,
priority or other lien.
        5.      There are no existing defaults in the payment of
principal of, or interest or other charges on, any of LSPS'
debts.
        6.      LSPS is not in violation of, and execution and
delivery of the Project Agreement and the compliance with all
its terms do not and will not result in any violation of, any
provisions of any existing agreement, franchise, concession,
license or permit, or of any statute, law, decree, regulation
or any other legal rule of a similar nature presently in effect
and applicable to LSPS.
        7.      LSPS is a duly existing special state-owned
enterprise under the laws of Lithuania with full authority to
carry out its present business, to carry out the Project and to
execute and deliver the Project Agreement and has furnished to
the Bank true copies of all other legislation presently in
force and effect and governing or applicable to the operations
of LSPS, as well as of its statutes as presently in effect and
governing LSPS.
        It is our mutual understanding that, in making the Loan
and entering into the Project Agreement with LSPS, the Bank may
rely on the representations contained herein.
