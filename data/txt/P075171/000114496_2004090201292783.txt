Framework Agreement between GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA ("GOA"), and
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION ("IDA")
(collectively, the "Bank"), dated May 29, 1996, (the "Agreement"), I am pleased to
inform you of the intention of GOA to make available a grant (the "Grant") of six
hundred thirty five thousand Australian dollars (AUD635,000), to be administered by the
Bank for the Cyclone Emergency Recovery and Management Project (Trust Fund No.

the Grant in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, except as otherwise

The Grant is for a Joint Cofinancing Project and will be used exclusively for the
following purpose, namely, the construction of about 40 units of low-cost cyclone-
resistant houses, including the provision of advisory services for design and supervision
therefore, as set forth under Part A.1 of the Project described in Schedule 2 to the
Development Credit Agreement to be entered into between the Kingdom of Tonga and
the International Development Association for purposes of the Cyclone Emergency
Recovery and Management Project.
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated June 27, 2002, between GOA and the Kingdom of

amount of the Grant initially deposited with the Bank of Tonga, upon request from the
Bank, in accordance with Section 7.02 of the Agreement, into IBRD's Cash Account "T"

confirmation by the Bank of this Administration Agreement.
It is expected that the funds will be fully utilized in accordance with the provisions of this
Administration Agreement by December 31, 2003. The Bank will only disburse the
(        Bank funds for the purposes of this Administration Agreement after such date upon the
approval of GOA.
If, at any time, either party determines that the purposes of this Administration
Agreement can no longer be effectively or appropriately carried out or if the Agreement
is terminated, this Administration Agreement may be terminated at the initiative of either
party by giving the other party a three (3) months' written notice to this effect. Upon the
termination of this Administration Agreement, and unless the parties agree on another
arrangement, any Australian Grant Agreement entered into by the Bank, as administrator

GOA held hereunder by the Bank will be returned to GOA, and the Bank's administration
