Lessons\n            learned from the project: When supported by adequate\n            training and supervision village revolving grant program can\n            be one of the surest ways of fighting poverty directly.\n            Establishment of successful community-managed revolving\n            funds has other important and valuable benefits in terms of\n            capacity building, group empowerment and increased cohesion\n            of the community. Taking the village as the entry point for\n            project activities improves participation, ownership,\n            capacity to absorb project supported changes, capture\n            benefits and the sustainability of project interventions.\n            Inclusion of adequate provision for M&E, preferably by a\n            third party, should be essential for any project design, but\n            it is crucially important for innovative projects. Where\n            inclusion of areas, villages, groups or individuals are\n            phased into the project over the implementation period, the\n            arrangements for those taken in at the end of the project\n            and their further support after credit/loan closure (exit\n            strategy) needs to be already agreed at project mid-term review."}, "docdt": "2006-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
