This project consists of three components.  First,\n            the village infrastructure component will support a short\n            program of village infrastructure development in each\n            village, which includes village roads, bridges, jetties,\n            improvement of small-scale irrigation facilities, water\n            supply facilities, and sanitation facilities.  Second, the\n            village-based technology adoption component will support\n            agricultural development of the project villages by\n            identifying specific technology packages suitable for\n            Bengkulu, and preparing implementation guidelines for each\n            identified technology package.  Third, the capacity\n            building/implementation support component will assist the\n            government agencies concerned in implementing the project,\n            build their institutional capacity, and disseminate the\n            project-related information."}, "docdt": "1998-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
