This Simplified\n            Implementation Completion Report provides the findings and\n            implications for subsequent operations, indicating this\n            Programmatic Education Sector Adjustment Credit, as the\n            first in a series of proposed policy reform credits in the\n            education sector, has strong links to the overall\n            Development Support Credits of the Bank, and to the Poverty\n            Reduction Growth Facility supported by the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF). Notwithstanding, it is however\n            realistic to assume that future reform initiatives might\n            face resistance: the primary focus of this project was to\n            establish institutional arrangements, and policy measures to\n            ease governance problems - the focus of future proposed\n            operations will be to deepen those reforms. Key among\n            reforms will be the establishment of the autonomous NTRCA,\n            and increased emphasis on teacher training, continuation of\n            the process of privatization of textbook production at the\n            secondary level, and potential extension of this process to\n            the primary level, continued emphasis on linking financing\n            of institutions to performance, and ensuring a significant\n            role of communities in school management. For these reforms\n            to succeed, it is critical that there is continued political\n            commitment of the Government to reforms, of its ownership of\n            the results, and of public receptivity of the reform\n            initiatives. It is important to note that the first\n            programmatic credit was discussed, negotiated and\n            implemented at a time when the Government, overcoming its\n            initial reservations, increasingly fortified its position to\n            carry forward the reform actions. The timing was also\n            appropriate, reasonably soon after the elections."}, "docdt": "2005-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
