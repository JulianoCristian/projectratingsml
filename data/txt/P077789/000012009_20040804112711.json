Programmatic Education Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project, will assist the Ministry of\n            Education (MOE) in undertaking the first phase of a\n            medium-term reform agenda, aimed at addressing systemic\n            governance issues in order to raise the quality, and\n            cost-effectiveness of service delivery, and improve equity\n            of access in secondary education. The focus will be on\n            reforms, to include a rigorous, and enforced criteria, that\n            governs the establishment of institutions, and of\n            institutional mechanisms that link school subsidies, to\n            objective measures of school performance. Also strengthened,\n            will be the school management committees, to allow them a\n            greater role in school management. To enhance access to\n            secondary schooling, MOE has been proves subsidies to girls\n            at the secondary level, and, over the next few years,\n            means-testing mechanisms will be piloted to better target\n            these subsidies to the poor. Incentives will be provided to\n            the private sector to set up institutions in underserved\n            areas. Moreover, significant emphasis will be placed on\n            program evaluation and monitoring to guide policymaking,\n            namely information on standardized examination outcomes,\n            school performance, and on program effectiveness. An\n            autonomous Teacher registration and certification agency\n            will be established, responsible for developing a roster of\n            pre-qualified, and certified teachers. An apex institution\n            will also be established to manage teacher training, and\n            regulate training institutions, and, set standards for new,\n            and in-service teachers. Finally, an enhanced transparency\n            in textbook production and relevant, demand-driven\n            curriculum will focus on privatizing textbook production,\n            through the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB)."}, "docdt": "2004-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
