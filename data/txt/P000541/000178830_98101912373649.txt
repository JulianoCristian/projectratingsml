PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT (CREDIT 297-COB)
Preface
This is a Project Performance Audit Report on the First Rail-
way Project in the People's Republic of the Congo, for which Credit 297-
COB for US$6.9 million was closed on March 31, 1976. The report consists
of a Project Performance Audit Memorandum prepared by the Operations Eval-
uation Department (OED) and a Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared by
the Western Africa Regional Office. The memorandum is based on the PCR
and discussions with Bank staff members. The transcript of the Executive
Directors' meeting of March 21, 1972 has been read and the project files
have been reviewed. No mission to the Congo has been made by OED staff.
The audit agrees on most of the ideas expressed in the very
comprehensive PCR, but questions some of the reasons which have led to
part of the investment. It also deals with a few problems which appear
to be of a recurrent nature in railway projects.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO FIRST RAILWAY PROJECT (CREDIT 297-COB)
Highlights
Under this project, the Bank assisted in financing consultants'
services for final engineering for the realignment of part of the railway
and a traffic costing study, as well as replacement and expansion of the
freight wagon fleet. The project further consisted of track works, work-
shop improvements and procurement of additional locomotives and timber
cars, all of which were financed from other sources. The project aimed
at maintaining and increasing the railway's capacity, and the final en-
gineering for realignment served as the basis for the next project which
was financed in 1976. The project was successfully implemented, but due
to price increases and currency realignments, the original credit amount
proved insufficient, which led to a decrease in the number of new wagons
and some supplementary financing. Traffic, however, has not grown as ex-
pected. The ex post economic return has been estimated at 12% on the rol-
ling stock and 10% on the realignment.
Points of particular interest are:
Project's success in preparing for the next lending
operation (para. 2; PCR, paras 1.02, 7.01);
availability of IDA funds may have caused some over-
investment iti new railway wagons (paras. 5-7, 9, 15);
supplementary financing could have been avoided
(para. 8);
need for flexibility to meet unanticipated tech-
nical assistance requirements during project im-
plementation (paras 14, 17; PCR, para. 4.01);
financial targets were not fully achieved in spite
of substantial rate increases (para. 13; PCR,
para. 6.03).

Second Railway Project, which, amongst others, included the construction
of the new railway section through the mountains.
II. POINTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
Overinvestment in Railway Wagons
5.        The 260 new freight wagons were to be for replacement (120)
and expansion (140) of the fleet. The credit was originally planned to
cover only about US$1.5 million for consultants' services to carry out
the final engineering for the new railwvay line through the mountains,
but the acquisition of wagons was later added.
6.        When the project was appraised, t:he majority of the Railway';
freight wagons were less than 30 years old and a replacement program for
the oldest units, over 35 years old, wlhich were badly damaged or corrodled,
was already being st:arted. At the time, according to the appraisal re-
port, availability of the cars was reasonable. The replacement consisl:ed
of at least 20% of the wagon capacity for general cargo, which is a ral:her
substantial part in view of the fact that, as discussed below, there are
no indications of a great urgency.
7.        The Bank's economic report olf November 1971 pointed out pro-
blems which were likely to constrain development in several economic sec-
tors. The two sugar companies had just been nationalized, while indus-
trial investment stagnated and existing enterprises had operational dif.-
ficulties, specially due to a shortage of managerial talent. Still, the
appraisal expected a continued high growth rate for cement, cotton and
sugar traffic, while other general cargo was to grow at 7.5% p.a. in ccn--
trast to a decline between 1965-70.  The overall traffic growth rate pro-
jected in the appraisal, for the above mentioned traffic, based on whic.i
the wagon requiremenit was estimated, was to be 8.5% p.a. for 1970-75,
which conipares with 2% p.a. for 1965-70. Judging by the pictutre provid,lC
by the economic report, the appraisal traffic forecast appears overopti-
mistic. In fact, as the PCR points out, traffic stagnated during the
project period and investment in the additional wagons proved premature.
8.        On February 12, 1973, the US dollar devalued by 10%.  On Feb-
ruary 19, 1973, IDA received a request from the Congo for supplementary
financing, while the Government approved the contract for the railway
wagons the next day. A supplementary credit for US$600,000 was approve(d
two months later. There was already evidence that general cargo traffic
was not growing, and it is therefore not clear why no attempt was made
to reduce the number of wagons, rather than seek supplementary financing.
Under the proposed contract, a further reduction of 13 wagons, at an esti--
mated cost of US$220,000, would have been possible without affecting the
unit prices, and the Railway should have taken advantage of this option.
If the above action had been taken and no extra IDA financing had been
made available, the Railway would have had to find some US$190,000 to
finance the actual overrun (US$190,000 of the credit was cancelled). It



-- 3J -
arDears a reasonab le assumption that this rel atvely small amount could
hae. 9een financed from local resources  specially in view of the fact
t'hat ..he 'Governmerlt committed itself to US$17.8 million in local cost
financing undar the Second Railway  Project which was signed in 1976.
9a        At the time of appraisal, it was expected that the railway
waagons were to be iniported fully assembled.  The employment effect on
the Congo of the IDA investment for wagon replacement would, therefore,
have been virtually nil, and may eveen have been negative, since it has
reduced repair activities on old wagons.  (Since no local inputs were
required according to the ori4ginal concept and therefore the project
does not compete for local economic resources with other development
projects, postponing the investment by a few years would haave posed
little, if any, planning problems.)  Actually, the wagons were assembled
locally and the procurement may, therefore, have had some employment
impact.
The Economic Jus-tifi-cati-on of the Proec~t
10.       The PCR estimates the ex post financial return on the wagons,
bought for replacement, at 15%, based on data lused in the appraisal re-
port, but taking into account the increased cost. A proper ex post eval-
uation is not possible, because no data on actual repair costs are avail-
able as all the old wagons have been scrapped. In view, however, of the
points made in paragraph six it appears somewhat uncertain that the return
on the wagon replacement program would be as high as 15%.
11.       The appraisal report calculated one economic return for the
capacity expansion consisting of general freight wagons, timber wagons
and locomotives (the latter two categories were financed from other sour-
ces). Due to the lack of traffic growth, the additions to the fleet proved
to be premature. The new wagons provided an increase in the carrying ca-
pacity for general cargo of 30-35%, which coincides with the traffic fore-
cast for the period 1970-74. According to the appraisal for the Second
Railway Project, this volume would be achieved by 1980. The PCR's re-esti-
mate of the economic return at 11% was based on the forecasts for the
Second Project, but there are indications that traffic growth is still
very slow and that it may be well beyond 1980 before that forecast volume
for 1974 is reached. Based on the above and on the very limited data
available on the benefits, the audit economic return on the additions
to the fleet is estimated at about 10%. The weighted average economic
return for both replacement and expansion of the fleet is 12%.
12.       The PCR estimates the economic return for the proposed realign-
ment of the railway line at 18%; the appraisal estimate was 40%, and the
lower figure is due to higher costs and lower traffic forecasts (PCR,
para. 5e04).  The PCR estimate is based on the original civil works con-
tract under the Second Railway Project and refers to the benefits for the
region as a whole; the return for the Congo was only 9%. In early 1977,
hostilities broke out near the construction site, leading to the destruc-
tion of about US$1 million in equipment and disruption of the work.  Nego-
tiations are now in progress to resume construction, but the cost will be



- 4 -
substantially higher than under the original contract.  On the basis
of the latest cost estimates, the economic return would be about 10%
for the region and 7% for the Congo, but further analyses are still in
progress. While in ithe appraisal for the project under review, the
proposed realignment may have been seen with somewhat too much opti-
mism, the most recent setback could obviously not have been anticipated.
Shortfall. on Financial Achievements
13.       Some financial targets, such as the return on net fixed as-
sets, were not met, because the forecast traffic growth did not mate-
rialize.  This was specially due to the worldwide recession, which has
adversely affected ti.mber production, but aLso because of overoptimism
in forecasting growth rates for different types of traffic, which were
2-4 times the growth experienced for 1965-70. All this was in spite of
the fact that, in addition to increasing its freight rates, in 1972, by
10% as agreed under the project, the Railway increased the rates by a
further 50% during 1973 and 1974.
The Need for Firmer Agreements on Technical Assistance
14.       As pointed out in the PCR (para. 4.01), the efficiency of the
Railway was affected by the Government's decision to suddenly reduce
technical assistance financed by the French Government. A firm commitmtnt
by the Government in the Credit Agreement to maintain the level of techriial
assistance, rather than verbal assurances during negotiations, would at
least have increased the chances that adequate technical assistance would
have been available. The problem of sud[den termination of bilateral
technical assistance is not unique, but has also plagued a variety of
other projects in different countries.  It also happens that during pro-
ject implementation, technical assistance turns out to be inadequate foi
the needs.  As was the case in the Congo, reduction in technical assistance
contributed to a serious decrease in railway efficiency. Because of the rery
important nature of this problem, the Bank may want to consider a
procedure under which loan or credit funds could be reallocated to
technical assistance, if such proves to be essential for the implementation
of a project, and where this was not envisaged when the loan or credit >a;
extended. In the case of the project under review, there might have beEn, an
opportunity to include a provision for technical assistance under the
supplemental credit, but unfortunately this did not receive serious con-
sideration. A few months before making the supplemental credit, the
Association became aware of the fact that technical assistance had been
reduced. The effect on railway operations became evident only later, but
from the sudden nature of the reductions, it should have been clear alreacy
at that time that there was a need for agreement on and possible financigq,
of further technical assistance. It appears that the PCR (para. 4.01) i,
probably too pessimistic on what could have been achieved at the time.
There certainly was a desire to reduce technical assistance, but it shouLk
be noted that during the same period the Association negotiated a credit for
highway maintenance which included a considerable amount of technical
assistance. Furthermore, under the Second Railway Project IDA did conviice
the Railway of the need to include technical assistance.

III. CONCLUSIONS
15.       The decision to finance railway wagons included in the Railway
investment program, and the timing of this investment may have been
influenced by the availability of IDA funds at the time and the apparent
lack of more suitable projects competing for these resources in the Congo.
Since the original plan called for import of fully assembled units, the
effect on employment would have been negligible. The wagon replacement
was useful, but was not urgent. The forecast for the growth of general
cargo traffic was high, and on the basis of a more realistic forecast,
about half of the investment in additional wagons could have been post-
poned for some five years. As it was, general cargo traffic did not grow
at all, and the entire investment for additional freight wagons was pre-
mature. It appears, therefore, that all or part of the wagons could have
been purchased a few years later. Since there was evidence of the lack
of traffic growth when the request for a supplementary credit was sub-
mitted, it is not clear why no efforts were made to further reduce the
number of new wagons.
16.       Financing of the detailed engineering was essential for the
construction of a new line, which was financed under the Second Railway
Project. At the time, the project looked very promising and without it,
the economic development of the entire region was thought to have been
constrained to an upper ceiling determined by the Railway's capacity.
In retrospect, the slow growth of traffic and the increasing cost made
the economic justification of new line construction less strong than
originally considered.
17.       The First Railway Project was implemented without major dif-
ficulties. However, due to the premature expansion of the fleet and ad-
verse circumstances affecting construction of the new line, the overall
economic return has dropped to about 11%. Firmer agreement between the
Government and IDA on the continuity of bilateral technical assistance
would have been desirable, while the possibility of introducing technical
assistance during the implementation of the project might have been con-
sidered. This approach, whenever urgently needed, should be considered
in future Bank/IDA projects.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
AGENCE TRANSCONGOLAISE DES COMMUNICATIONS
RAILWAY PROJECT (CREDIT 29 7-COB)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUMMARY
(i).      The Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC) owns and operates
the Atlantic Ocean port of Pointe Noire, the CFCO railway between Pointe Noire
and Brazzaville, and the river ports and services on the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha
ravers.  The ATC system became insufficient to meet traffic demand, with the
CFCO railway representing the principal bottleneck. As the main problem of
the CFCO stemmed from operating and physical limitations to traffic capacity
over the Mayomb6 mountain range, a feasibility study was financed by UNDP
(with the Bank as Executing Agency) and carried out by TECSULT, Canada, in
1971/72.  Following its review of the study, the Bank concluded that detailed
engineering of the Holle-Loubomo realignment should be undertaken in order to
bring the project to the stage of evaluation for a final investment decision.
At the same time the Government and ATC asked the Association to assist in
financing the 1972-73 portion of the CFCO's five-year development program
(1971-75).  This portion included the provision of rolling stock, track works.
maintenance equipment, and consulting services for detailed engineering cf the
Holle-Loubomo realignment and a traffic costing study for the whole of ATC.
The esti'mated cost of the project was CFAF 6.4 billion to be financed by ATC,
ADB, CCCE, Congo banks, FAC and the Association.  The project was appraised Ina
May 1971 and the Credit Agreement for US$6.3 million signed on April 7, 1972-
The Credit was to provide the financing for about 260 freight cars and the
abovementioned consulting services. Due to a devaluation of the US dollar i1i
early 1973, a supplementary credit agreement for US$600,000 was signed on
July 3, 1973.
(ii).     As the accepted bid for the freight cars from ARBEL, France, exceeded
the amount allocated under the Credit, their number was reduced to 247.  Del-
very of the fre±g>c cars ,c P.-Aunte Noire started in February 1974 and u-
completed in July 1974 which represented an average delay of about one mcmt-lB
over the contractual program.  Foloowlng local assembly under ARBEL supervision,,
all the freight cars were in service by February 1975.  As the freight cars were
delivered under the terms of a fixed price contract, there was no cost overrun.
The performance of AR3EL was satisfactory and the ATC is well satisfied with
the performance of the freight cars.
(iii).    The main consultants contract for the detailed engineering of the
realignment project was carried out by TECSULT assisted by other firms for
supplementary studies. The final report was submitted about five months behinld
schedule in December 1973 due to required additional studies and to revisions
ln the project resulting from comments of ATC and the Association.  Although
ATC felt that TECSULT should have kept it better informed of work carried out
in Canada, the consultants engineering work was satisfactory. The cost estimates
for the realignment civil works, however, were found to be low when the conaracict--rs
bids were received in mid-1974.  The difference between the estimates and bids



- A..2 -
can be mainly attributed to high world inflation starting after the est:Lfmates
were made and the contractors' high assessment of risks for working in the Congc.
BCEOM/SOFRERAIL performed well and submitted the traffic costing study, includirg
the economic justification for the CFCO realignment, on time in November 1973.
On the basis of the consultants' reports the ATC 1974-78 Investment Plarl was
prepared and the Congo Second Railway Project appraised.
(iv).     Other items in the project financed from sources other than th.e Credit
were carried out satisfactorily although subject to some delays and cost overruns.
The final costs of the whole project amounted to CFAF 7.62 bil:Lion.  This overrun
of about 19% was mainly on items finarnced by other donors.
(v).      The original Closing Date of the Credit was extended to March 3;,
1976 to cover the final payment to ARBEL due twelve months after the freight
cars were put into service. An amount of US$190,000 remaining under the Credit
was cancelled.
(vi)      The operations of ATC, and particularly of CFCO, deteriorated seriously
during the project period. This was due to (a) a too sudden and drastic ieduction
in the number of technical assistants as a function of an Africanization Rove; ({)
confining the main ro'Le of the remaining technical assistants to training and admii-
nistration; (c) a 39% increase in the number of Congolese staff between .:970 and
1975; and (d) poor track and equipment maintenance.  In addition, none of the
traffic forecasts were realized except those for manganese and potash.  I'he CFCO
only carried 1.12 million tons of timber, bulk oil and general cargo in :1.975 as
against a forecast of 2.67 million tons.  The largest drop was of 77% fo:: timber
which was mainly due to the world timber slump.
(vii)     Although a 40% economic rate of return on the realignment project had
[been expected, it was found to be only 18% during the appraisal of the Sc.cond
Railway Project due to an 80% increase in the costs of the civil works aind a
decrease in benefits resulting from reduced traffic forecasts.
(viii).   The financial performance of the CFCO was disappointing during t::Ie pro-
ject period. Instead of being able to generate enough funds to pay for i.ts share
of planned investments, service its de'bts and increase its working capitu:l,
the CFCO was obliged to borrow more tnan forecast and decrease its working
capital. As the CFCO earns about 70% of ATC's total gross operating revenue,
its poor performance adversely affected ATC's financial positioin. Despite a
10% tariff increase in mid-1972 and further increases of 50% during 1973-74,
ATC was unable to achieve the agreed rates of return on average net fixed. assets
in use and to comply with the debt limitation covenant.
(ix).     Despite ATC's poor financial performance, the project was instiuniental
in the preparation of the Second Railway Project which includes actions to remedy
the situation. Although there is a risk that the financial and economic goals
of the Second Railway Project will not be completely attained, there is a greater
risk that without this project ATC will not be able to handle the traffic offered
resulting in the Congo's and the region?'s economic development being slowLc. and
the country foregoing substantial foreign exchange earnings.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Agence Transcongolaise des Communications (ATC) formed in 1969
owns and operates: (a) the Atlantic Ocean port of Pointe Noire; (b) a railway,
Chemin de Fer Congo-Ocean (CFCO), between Pointe Noire and Brazzaville; and
(c) the river ports and services on the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha rivers. The
CFCO railway (515 km) provides the basic link between the Atlantic Ocean and
the river transport routes that serve the northern part of the Congo, southern
Cameroon, the Central African Empire and Chad. A 285 km railway owmed and
operated by COMILOG (Gabon) joins the CFCO railway at Mont Bello for transporting
manganese over 200 km of the CFCO to the port at Pointe Noire.
1.02      The capacity of the ATC system became insufficient during the late
1960's to meet traffic requirements with the CFCO railway representing the
principal bottleneck. While ATC took steps to improve the capacity of the
system, a major problem remained on the CFCO because of the operating and
physical limitations to traffic capacity on the railway through the Mayomb6
mountain range near the coast. A feasibility study for the improvement of
the railway in this 110 km long section between Holle and Loubomo (ex-Dolisie)
was financed by the UNDP, with the Bank as Executing Agency, and carried out in
1971/72 by the Canadian consultants, TECSULT, assisted by Canadian National
Railways. Following its review of the feasibility study, the Bank concluded
that detailed engineering of the realignment of thie Holle-Loubomo section should
proceed upon completion of the preliminary engineering.
1.03      ATC had prepared a five-year development program (1971-75) for the
CFCO in which the railway realignment comprised about 50% of the total program
of US$8l.3 million equivalent. The Government and ATC asked the Association
to assist in financing the 1972-73 portion of the CFCO development program
which included mainly the provision of rolling stock, track works, maintenance
equipment and consulting services for final engineering of the Holle-Loubomo
realignment and a traffic costing study for the whole of ATC. The consulting
services were to provide the basis of a subsequent project the main item of
which would be the CFCO realignment. The project was appraised in May 1971 and
the Credit Agreement signed on April 7, 1972. This was the Bank Group's first
lending operation for the ATC.
1.04      Based on the preparatory studies included in this project, the Congo
Second Railway Project (Loan 1228-COB) was appraised in November 1974 and the
Loan Agreement signed on April 12, 1976. The Second Railway Project comprises
ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan and is expected to cost (net of taxes) about
US$233.8 million. This plan was prepared by the ATC in consultation with the
Association using the recommendations of the BCEOM study. It includes the
following main items:
(a)  ATC Headquarters:  improvement of training facilities and programs;
(b)  Pointe Noire Port:  provision of an additional stacking area for timber
handling; construction of new manganese and general cargo berths, and
dredging;



- A.4 -
(c) River Services: procurement of mechanical handling equipment ar.d floatiag
craft, expansion of Brazzaville workshops, and deepening of rivcr channels;
a-d
(d)  CFCO Railway:  procurement and renewal of locomotives and rollinig stock,
track renewal, installation of signalling systems, and expansior! of
workshops, and realignment of 88 km and improvement of 18 km of the
Holle-Loubomo section.
The appraisal report for the Second Railway Project (Report No. 745a-.CiB of
March 3, 1976) contains full details of the past and forecast operatial; and
financial performance of the whole of ATC as well as the CFCO.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Description
2.01      The project consisted of:
(a) Track works, includinig the provision of material and eqjuipment,
and the extending of crossing loops;
(b) workshop improvements and improvements to freight cars;
(c)  procurement of freight cars and locomotives; and
(d)  consulting services for detailed engineering of the Hol1E-
Loubomo realignment and for the traffic costing study.
2.02      The track works included CFCO's annual requirements for rail, tie
and stone ballast replacements. Renovation and repairs of the weakened! parts
of the concrete viaducts were also continued.  To enable longer, heaviLr trains
to cross along the line and improve operations, the sidings at the stali ins
between Brazzaville and Pointe Noire were lengthened as part of a long-tterm
program.  Additional equipment for improving track maintenance in the fo:m of
gang cars, earth-moving equipment units and tools was procuredl.  Items for the
track works were financed by ADB, CCCE, FAC and ATC.
2.03      As the main workshops at Pointe Noire and the depots at Loubcnci and
Brazzaville lacked adequate maintenance facilities, provision was made ~cr
expanding the diesel locomotive maintenance facilities at Poirte Noire. In
addition, vacuum-breaking and drawgear equipment were included in the p:7cject
to improve old freight cars so that they could be utilized in longer an:' heavie-
trains. The above items were financed by FAC, CCCE and ATC with loans From the
Congolese banks.
2.04      To meet future traffic demand, new equipment was included in :ha
project and comprised eight main-line locomotives, 65 timber log cars aid
about 260 general freight cars, of which 120 were to replace a greater tunber
of smaller capacity freight cars. The locomotives and timber log cars %:ece
financed by CCCE and the general freight cars from the IDA credit.



- A.5 -
2005      The best technical and economic solution according to the UNDP-financed
feasibility study was a complete realignment on a southern route of the CFCO
railway between Bilinga (ex-Fourasti&) and Loubomo (88 km) and improvements of
the 18 km section between Holle and Bilinga. The project therefore included
consulting services to carry out detailed engineering of the required works
in order to finalize the cost estimates and to bring the realignment project
to the stage of evaluation by ATC and the Bank Group for a final investment
decision. Further consulting services were included for a traffic costing
study for the whole of ATC. The studies were financed from the IDA credit
with ATC contributing towards their local costs.
B. Cost Estimates
2.06      At the time of appraisal, the total cost of the project was estimated
to be as follows:
(US$ million)
Total            IDA
Costi/      Contribution

- A.6 -
The above estimates were based on 1971 prices and 10% was added to the items
for inflation and contingencies.  Following the devaluation of the US c:ollar
in February 1973, a supplementary credit of US$0.6 million was approvec. by the
Board on July 3, 1973. The original and revised allocation of funds tcgsther
with the actual allocation is given in Table 1.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Track
3.01      Using equipment and material financed by FAC and CCCE, the ATC
continued its annual programs of improving and maintaining the track arid
structures of the CFCO railway. The works for extending the crossing loops
was initially financed by ADB and the program carried on with financing provided
by CCCE and local banks. The extensions have been completed at those stations
which constituted the major bottlenecks and the full program is due to De
completed by 1978.
B. Existing Equipment
3.02      Construction of the new workshops and improvements to existin, work-
shops at Pointe Noire (financed by FAC and local banks) were started in late
1972 and completed in 1975. Under CCCE financing, six experts from SOF:ERAIL
(France) were engaged in late 1974 to improve locomotive maintenance procedures
and train local personnel.  CCCE also financed the improvements to the btaking
systems and drawgear of rolling stock to allow the operation cf longer md
heavier trains.
C. New Equipment
3.03      About 260 new freight cars with spare parts were to be procur(d under
the Credit.  Following international competitive bidding procedures, bi(ls
submitted by three French firms and one Belgian firm were opened on Sep:enber
1, 1972. The Association agreed with the ATC recommendation to award tl.e
contract to ARBEL (France). As the bid exceeded by 11.5% the amount of U3$
4.0 million allocated for this category, the Association also agreed wilh ATC's
proposal to reduce the total number of f-reight cars by 7%. Although thc Asso-
ciation cabled its agreement on the above to ATC on October 2, 1972, a supervision
mission in early November was informed that ATC was still awaiting commen:s oan
its recommendations.  Our cable was t]hen repeated on November 10.  As a result
of this delay and of exchanges of correspondence with ATC on thze numbers and
types of wagons to be procured, the contract for the provision of 247 wagons
was not signed by ARBEL until January 18, 1973 and was approved by the Colrernmeni:
on February 20, 1973. Although this constituted a delay of about 5½ morths
between submission of tenders and contract approval and although the biels were
only valid for three months, ARBEL maintained its unit prices ior the fiaal
contract. On March 20, 1973, ATC signed a contract appointing OFEROM, France,
as its agent for supervising the manufacture and acceptance of the wagons in
France. Due to a devaluation of the IJS dollar in early 1973 and to avoid
reducing further the number of wagons, a supplementary credit agreement for



- A.7 -
US$600,000 was signed on July 3, 1973 and the funds of the Credit reallocated
as shown in Table 1. The first wagons were delivered to Pointe Noire in February
1974 and the last wagons in July 1974.  This represented an average delay of
about one month over the program foreseen in the contract. Assembly of the
wagons in Pointe Noire by CFCO workers under ARBEL's supervision varied between
one and seven months according to the wagon type. Although no contractual time
was specified for assembling the wagons, it was longer than expected, mainly due
to ARBEL's having to find a second local supplier of timber for the wagon floors
as the first supplier provided unseasoned wood and could not fulfill its sub-
contract.  All the wagons were in service by February 1975.  Although not mIentioned
in the contract, ATC asked the Association at the instigation of ARBEL whether
the retention money due the supplier twelve months after the final wagons were
put into service could be paid to ARBEL against a bank guarantee. Although the
Association did not agree with the proposal on this occasion, it could be consi-
dered for future cases as the provision of bank guarantees for retention money
is often a feature of European-type contracts. As this was a fixed-price contract
with no escalation clauses, there was no cost overrun. The items procured tnder
this category with costs and delivery dates are listed in Table 2. The services
of both ARBEL and OFERMAT were satisfactory in the procurement of the wagons.
ATC is well satisfied with these wagons and Table 3 gives details of their use
during 1975.
3.04      With financing from CCCE and local banks, ATC ordered 115 long timber
cars (21 m) in 1971. These were delivered and put into service in mid-1973.
Although the timber cars were of a relatively new type, ATC has been well
satisfied with their performance. They permit the carrying of more concentrated
loads of logs than the shorter timber cars (14 m) and their eight-axle bogies
are very suitable for the track conditions in Congo resulting in less derailments.
.3.05      Again using financing from CCCE and local banks, one 4B 3600 and six
2B 1800 locomotives were ordered in late 1972 and delivered in mid-1974. The
orders included a reasonable provision of locomotive spare parts. The loco-
motives were of the same type that had given satisfactory service in the Congo
in the past.
D. Consultants
3.06      All consulting servicesincluded in the project were financed under
the Credit. An additional amount of US$100,000 was allocated to these services
from the Supplementary Credit of June 20, 1973 to cover the effects of the
devaluation of the US dollar, and the costs of supplementary studies.
3.07      The detailed engineering of the CFCO realignment between Holle and
Loubomo was carried out by the same consultants  TECSULT (Canada), engaged
for the UNDP-financed feasibility study. The terms of reference for the
services included all engineering studies necessary and the preparation of
tender documents as well as a revision of the economic evaluation of the rea-
lignment based on final cost estimates. As TECSULT, however, had difficulty
in finding suitably qualified economists, the economic evaluation was entrusted
to BCEOM (France) in June 1973 (see para. 3.08). Although the Govern-ment did not
sign the consultants' contract until August 14, 1972, TECSULT started field work



Ae8 -
in late June 1972. This field work was completed in early 1973, but TECSULT
did not submit its final report until December 1973, about five month-, behind
schedule. Much of this delay can be attributed to additional soils s:udies
required to complete the engineering and revisions in the project restulting
from the comments of ATC and the Association. Although TECSULT carrii::d out
the engineering aspects of its services Well, its cost estimates for T:he civi.L
works of the realignment were found to be very low when compared with the bids
which were received in mid-1974. However, not all the cost discrepanc::es were
due to poor estimating as the estimates were prepared just before world inflat:ion
became very high.  Further, the bidding contractors' assessment of th. risks of
working in the Congo could not be assessed. Besides the main contrac;: with
TECSULT, additional studies were carried out under the Credit for invc.stigatiurns
into soils conditions, quarries for ballast, timber tie supplies, hyd&oLogical
conditions and the construction of :unnels.  Table 4 shows details of aLl the
studies comprising the consulting services for the detailed engineeri-ng.
After completion of the services, ATC mentioned that it had been perturbed by
the fact that TECSU:LT had done so mu-ch of its work in Montreal. ATC is used
to engaging French consultants whom they can visit during frequent trips to
Europe; its representatives, however, rarely travel to North America. ilthough
TECSULT might have k-ept ATC better informed of the work being performed in its
head office, there is no reason to believe that another firm located elsewhere
would have done the engineering better or less expensively despite a 10.5% cost:
overrun on the TECSUJLT contract,
3.08      The purpose of the traffic costing study were to (a) provide Y.TC
with costing information by type of service and commodity for each of :Lts
sections (Pointe Noire port, CFCO raillway and river transport:); (b) evaluate
the benefits of proposed investments and improvements to the ATC trans:'crt
system; (c) recommend an appropriate pricing policy; and (d) assess th: long-
term market prospects for timber production within ATC's area of influ.nce.
Only three firms of the five invited on April 4, 1972, submitted propo.:als for
this study.  ATC advised the Association of its recommendations on the choice
of consultants on August 12, 1972. However, as ATC then ascertained that the
recommended firm was experiencing serious organizational and financial difficul.-
ties which could affect its capability to carry out the study, ATC and thle
Association agreed in late September 1972 to award the contract to BCECM/
SOFRERAIL (France) whose proposal was judged to be of the same quality as that
of the original reccmmended firm.  Contract negotiations started in thC :-ollowing
month, and the contract was signed on January 27, 1973.  BCEOI4/SOFRERAIL submitL,:e!d
their draft final report in November 1973 in accordance with Their contract.  As;
mentioned previously, the economic evaluation of the CFCO realignment wac trans-
ferred to BCEOM/SOFRERAIL from TECSULT and the report submitted in Novenber 197-3.
As a result of the energy crisis in 1L974, t'ie consultants updated the f'Inrancial
aspects of the study.  ATC and the Association agreed, however, that the draft
final report not be finalized to take account of the world rec:ession as this
would have required considerable reworking of the report particularly w:'th
respect to timber traffic forecasts. The work of BCEOM/SOFREFAIL was jtudged
to be good and its reports very useful for the preparation of the ATC l1'74-78
Investment Plan and the Second Railweay Project. Details of the costs ol" the
studies are given in Table 4.

The total actual costs of the project exceeded the appraisal estimates by
CFAF 1.22 billion or 19%   Nearly half of this overrun (CFAF 0.58 billior '
to be found in the FA-fiinanced workshop improvements wnich took lot ger c-autn
expected, not being completed until 1975. A further CFAF 0.37 billion is
accounted for by the new freight cars where, apart from the small overrun on
the Credit-financed freight cars, the number of CCCE-financed timber cars to
be procured was increased from 65 foreseen at appraisal to 115. Freight car
improvements cost more than double the amount estimated and account for an
excess of CFAF 0.20 billion.  This can be attributed to increases in world
Drices for although the CCCE loan was first requested in 1972, the funds we-ra
not available until early 1974.

Total                           6.4                    7.62
At the time of appraisal, it was not known whether FAC or CCCE would fi:ance
some of the items, so the full amounts were entered against possible CCNE
financing.
3.11      The original Closing Date for the Credit of December 31, 1974 was
extended until March 31, 1976 to cover the final payment to ARPEL for tl1E
247 freight cars which was due twelve months after they were put into seirvice.
The Government requested that the amount of about US$190,000 remaining lnder
the Credit be used for the procurement of new bogies for CFCO railcars and
for radio equipment in the marshalling yards. However, as the Associat:cn
decided that only items originally included in the project could be finamced
from the Credit, the Government agreed with the proposal that these iterls be
financed retroactively under the Second Railway Project.  The funds remilining
under the Credit were therefore cancelled. ATC acknowledged the closing of the
Credit in its letter of January 6, 1977.
G. Supervision
3.12      The project: was carried out competently by ATC and was relatively
problem-free from the procurement standpoint. ATC only submitted one official
semi-annual progress report which was received in May 1973. The reason.. given
by ATC for not submitting regular progress reports were that the propos(.d formal:
of the reports was too complicated and that it did not have the adminisl:rative
services available to prepare them.  ATC did, however, produce a comple:.ion
report on the Credit-financed components of the project.    (For the Se.ord
Railway Project, a format for quarterly progress reports has been agreec with
ATC and the first two reports have already been received). The lack of taese
reports did not adversely affect the execution of the project as the As.ociation
had no problem in obtaining operational and financial information from )KTC upon



- A.ll -
request.  After the first two supervision missions in Novermber 1972 and May
1973, the next railway mission to the Congo was in May 1974.  This latter
mission was mainly to prepare the Second Railway Project whic. -^Jas appraised
in November 1974 and covered the whole of ATCts operations while the first
project was mainly concerned with the CFCO only.  Three meetings were hel(i in
Washington, Pointe Noire and Brussels with representatives of ATC in 1975 during
which ATC's overall activities and performance were discussed Fur:ther, in 1974,
separate missions with ATC's agreement discussed progress on the consulting ser-
vices directly with TECSULT in Montreal and BCEOM in Paris.
IV. ATC OPERATIONS
A. Management, Staffing and Training
4.01      Although there were no structural changes in ATC's management during
the project, there were important staffing changes.  At the time of appraisal,
the general manager, the managers of sections and the majority of the staff
were Congolese, while there were 135 experts at senior and supervisory levels
mainly provided by French technical assistance of which more than fifty were
in the CFCO. The importance of this technical assistance for maintaining
operational efficiency was realized by the appraisal mission. During negotia-
tions, ATC stated that it intended to maintain the level of technical assistance
although this was not made a condition of the Credit. In mid-1972, however,
the number of technical assistants to the CFCO was suddenly and drastically
reduced to 34 and many were replaced by Congolese as a function of an Africani-
zation move, the role of the technical assistants then being mainly confined to
training and administration.  At the same time, the number of Congolese permailent
.staff increased steadily in the CFCO and at the end of 1975 exceeded 5,000,
representing a 39% increase over the number for 1970.  The sudden change In the
numbers of technical assistants and the increase in Congolese staff had a marked
deleterious effect on the efficiency of CFCO's operations (see para. 4,02),
The development of the numbers and duties of Congolese staff and technical
assistants in the CFCO are shown in Table 5. Although the Association often
brought this development to the attention of the Government and ATC, they could
not reverse the situation. There have been recent increases, however, in the
numbers of technical assistants.  Accordingly, the Second Railway Project makes
a provision of US$3.8 million for improved training a:d increased technical
assistance. In addition, the Bank is permitted to cormment on ATC's draft
annual operational and investment budgets prior to approval and has specified
operational targets. It is doubtful if the inclusion of appropriate covernants
in the Credit Agreement would have affected the above CFCO staffing changes as
the reduction in the number of technical assistants was dictated by the Govern-
ment and the increase in Congolese staff by the powerful trade unions.
B. Operational Efficiency
4.02      Table 6 shows details of the CFCO's operations from 1960 to 1975.
Nearly all the operating statistics show deteriorating trends during the
project. Much of this can be attributed to the staffing changes mentioned
previously which affected traffic and maintenance operations.  The numbe, of



p12 -
operational interruptions due to broken rails and derailments increased, and
the maintenance crews lacked skill and supervision to carry out the necessary
substantial maintenance programs.  A :Large part of these interruptions were o0a
the critical mountiLnous section which is being realigned under the Sc!cond
Railway Project.  None of the traffic forecasts for various commoditi,s were
achieved with the exception of potash which is only carried over 40 k:i of the
CECO to the port of Pointe Noire and passenger traffic (see para. 5.0>).  The
decreasing traffic combined with the increasing number of Congolese s'.aff
resulted in output per employee dropping by 18% over the period 1970-1.975.
In retrospect, it would have been useful to include operating targets il a
plan of action for this project as has been done for the Second Railwi.y Project.
4.03      Although locomotive availability was about 66% in 1971, it steadily
declined to 49% in 1975 (due to poor maintenance and lack of spare pa't3)
despite the delivery of new locomotives.  It has increased tD about 5'i% in
1976 and should improve further due to:
(a)  new and improved workshop facilities carried out under
the project;
(b) the Drovision in 1975 of six SOFRERAIL experts for
training in locomotive maintenancee; and
(c)  the recent establishment of revolving stocks of French
locomotive spare parts in France for African railways.
An average locomotive availability of 76% in 1978 was agreed as a targilt
for the Second Railway Project.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
5.01      The appraisal foresaw that freight railway traffic ':ould increase
from 3.11 million tons in 1970 to 5.26 million tons in 1975 and that it would
reach 6.32 million tons in 1985.  Actual traffic, however, was only 3.i5 million
tons in 1975. Table 7 gives a comparison of forecast and actual traffic carried
by the CFCO during 1970-75.
5.02      The main item responsible for the difference between forecast End
actual traffic is timber.  Although it was expected to grow from 646,00i) tons
in 1970 to 1.56 million tons in 1975 , only 360,000 tons were transported in
that year. Timber traffic carried on the CFCO can be grouped as originating
in (a) South Congo and Gabon, (b) North Congo, (c) Southeast Cameroon,  mad
(d) Southwest Central African Empire (CAE); the following figures show actual
and expected timber traffic from these regions.

Timber productiona and traffic were affected by a slump in the world timber
market in 1974 and 19755 which partially explains the difference between
forecast and actual figures.  in addition to this, the appraisal overes.imaa-e
the potential traffic (a) from South Congo and Gabon traffic, which was eseoo:ecd
to reach a ceiling oi 723,000 Lons/year in 1975 (the forecast included  oa t1he
Second Railway Project assumes that the maximum combined production South
Congo/Gabon would be 350,000 tons in 1980), and (b) from Cameroon, where
724,000 tons were foreseen for 1980, while the latest forecast assumed-
duction increasing gradually to reach only 250,000 tons in that year.
5 03       In addition to timber, the appraisal overestimated general caro
traffic (826,000 tons forecast versus 546,000 tons actual in 1975)              -",,
oil (277,000 tons versus 2-0,000 tons).  The forecast for manganese traffi

tons actual); it assumed that tlhis traffic would remain constant there'-
as the capacity of the ropeway between the mine and the railhead would ica,i2
been reached.  The ropeway capacity has recently been expanded, however, to
a maximum of 2.6 million tonrs, which is the figure adopted in the Second
Railway Project.  Potas'h traffic which is carried by the CFCO for the 40 kr
hbetween the mine aone the port of Pointe Noire was forecast to be 400,00C t

main component of the Second Railway Project; the rate of return foL c"Os_,s
investment found in the appraisal of this project, carried out in 1973 '
The difference in the economlc return of the realignment between the firso
the second appraisal stems from diffetences in estimated constructior cos .
traffic forecasts.  The appraisal of the first project estimated net investment
costs of the realignment to be CFAF 10.46 billion in 1971 prices or CA.F 1'
billion in 1975 prices.l/  In contrast, the actual realignment costs

Statistics.



_ A.14 -
prices, based on the signed contract for the main civil works, are estimated
at CFAF 26.13 billion or 80% higher than the original estimate. Further, the
reduction in the traffic forecasts mentioned previously decreased the amount of
traffic that would be foregone if the realignment were not to be built and conse-
quently the project's benefits.
C. Rates of Return on Locomotives and Freight Cars
5.05       The project included the addit-ion to CFCO's fleet of 8 main-linLe loco-
motives, 65 timber log cars and 260 general freight cars, of which 120 wsre to
replace older, worn-out equipment.  This i-nvestment was analyzed on financial
terms only, i.e. the benefits for the renewal cars were assessed from rec.uced
maintenance costs and savings in train operating costs, and the benefits fDr the
locomotives and additional cars determined on the basis of the additiona:l revenue
generated by this equipment. A financial rate of return of 17% was calct.lated fo-r
the replacement cars, and of 18% for the package of locomotives and the rest of
the freight cars. The appraisal stated that the economic rate of return would bE.
higher, since the CFCO railway was the only existing mode of transport bEtween
Pointe Noire and Brazzaville.
5.06       The ex post financial rate of return of the 120 freight wagons, bought
to replace old equipment is 15% based on the unit benefits calculated at appraisal.
The drop in the return compared to the appraisal estimate is due to the small
overrun in the investment cost of these wagons and the fact thai  there was a delay
in their delivery and entering service.  The purchase of equipment to increase ATC's
transport capacity, consisting of 7 locomotives and 242 cars proved to be premature
as traffic stagnated during the period 1972-75 instead of increasing as foreseen
at appraisal (Table 7).  Based on the traffic forecast of the Second RailQ'.y Projact,
the full benefits of this new equipment should be realized after 1978.  Taking th2
above and the actual investment costs into consideration, the financial rate of
return of this investment is 11%. As mentioned in para. 5.05, the economLc rate
of return would be higher.  The overall financial rate of return on the wiicle
locomotive and rolling stock investment is about 12%.
VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Covenants
6.01      The Government and ATC agreed oni the following financial covenai.ts
which were included in the Credit Agreement:
Section 3.01(a): The Government will provide ATC with funds,
facilities, services and other resources required for imple-
mentation of the project.
Section 3.01(b): The Government will relend the proceeds of
the Credit to ATC under conditions including an interest rate
of 7.25% per annum and repayment over 30 years with 5 years
of grace.



- A.15 -
Section 4.03: The Governmnet will settle its future debts
with ATC by the end of each fiscal year and its outstanding
debt as of the time of the Agreement as soon as possible.
The Govermment was not required to provide funds to ATC for implementation of
the project (despite the latter's disappointing financial performance described
below), and complied with the onlending covenant. However, although the Govern-
ment reduced somewhat the amount of its outstanding debt to ATC, it was slow in
settling its current bills with ATC.
6.02      ATC agreed on the following financial covenants and targets which
were included in the Project Agreement:
Section 4.02: ATC will have its accounts and financial
statements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Association. It will provide the Association with
certified copies of financial statements and the report of
the auditors no later than five months after the end of
each fiscal year.
Section 4.03(a): ATC will earn an annual rate of return on
its net fixed railway assets in use of at least 6% in fiscal
year 1973 and of 5% over subsequent fiscal years.
Section 4.03(c): ATC will increase its tariffs by an average
of 10% before July 1, 1972.
Section 4.04: ATC will not incur any long-term debts unless
its cash generated from operations for each fiscal year is
at least 1.25 times the amount of debt service for the
succeeding year.
ATC complied with the auditing covenant by appointing auditors acceptable to
the Association in late 1972. The audit report on the 1972 accounts which
was made available to the Association in August 1973 complied with the Associa-
tion's requirements. Although ATC provided the Association with acceptable
audit reports for each of the following fiscal years, none could be submitted
within the agreed five months. A more realistic six-month delay after the end
of each fiscal year has been stipulated under the Second Railway Project. ATC
implemented on schedule the required 10% tariff increase with the agreement
of Gabon and CAE. Despite an additional average 50% tariff increase implemented
in three stages between February 1973 and November 1974 under strong Bank
pressure, however, ATC was unable to achieve the agreed rates of return on
average net fixed assets in use of 6% in 1973 and 5% thereafter.
B. CFCO Financial Performance
6.03      The summary below of CFCO's income accounts for the period 1971-75

The above table shows that during the period under review aclual opere.t.ng
expenses were slightly below appraisal estimates except for 1975 even tllough
the latter did not take account of the unexpected high level of inflation
encountered.  However, operating revenues were substantially below appraisal
forecasts in spite of the abovementioned tariff increases. The followir.g tablE=
shows the percentagei of forecast revenue and operating expenses actually achieved
during 1.972-75.

The table demonstrates clearly that the railwayTs disappointing financial
performance was caused by a shortage in revenue resulting from a shortfal:L
in traffic, mainly timber, as a result of deteriorating operations and thea
1973-76 slump in the world timber market. The tariff increases mentionEd in
para. 6.02 accounts for the fact that revenues from manganese traffic progress-
ively exceeded forecasts even though traffic was slightly belowq expectations.

on revenues. Between 1972 and 1976 the CFCO only achieved a cumulated net ope-
rating revenue of CFAF 33.2 million,  or 1.4% of total gross revenue.   The average
annual rate of return on net fixed assets in use was negative in 1972 and 1973,
increased to 4% in 1974, mainly as a result of tariff increases, but dropped to
0.9% in  1975.   During the same period,  the railway suffered a cumulative net
loss of CFAF 1,388 million, or 5.9% of its total gross operating revenue.
6.04        These losses adversely affected the CFCO's overall financial situation
which deteriorated steadily as shown in Table 10 (balance sheet) and Table 11
(cash flow). These tables are summarized below:

The tables show that, LlisEead of generating enough funds to pay for its shain
of planned investmlents, service its debts and increase its working capital by
CFAF 1.2 billion in 1975, CFCO was obliged to borrow more than forecast (CFAP-
2.4 billion) and decrease its working capital by CFAF 1.6 billion tD achieve
these objectives. As the CFCO earns about 70% of ATC's total gross operating
revenue, its poor financial performance adversely affected ATC's consolidated
income and financial position. This is reflected in ATC's consolidated income
account (Table 12) and cash flow (Table 13). which are summarized below:

It can be seen from these tables that the trend of ATC's financial situation
followed that of the CFCO, namely that:  (a) ATC's working and operating expense8
were slightly below appraisal estimates during each year between 1971 through
1975 as gross operating revenues were substantially lower than assumed; (b) ATC
achieved only a marginal net operating revenue (CFAF 305 million) between 1972
and 1975; and (c) ATC's working capital deteriorated steadily during the period
under consideration. Accordingly, ATC was umable to comply with the debt limita-
tion covenant provided for under Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement.
C. Remedial Action
6.05       In order to prevent the continuing revenue shortages of the ATC and
CFCO, traffic needs to be increased substantially and cost-based rates charged
for services rendered. Furthermore, ATC's working capital had to be restored
and thereafter maintained at an adequate level. A set of measures for these
objectives has been agreed upon for the Congo Second Railway Project. These
measures include (a) the implementation of a plan of action including specific
operating targets to improve ATC's operational performance and productivity;
(b) an increase in timber traffic by appropriate governmental action to speed
up the exploitation of Congo's timber resources; (c) a waiver by the Government
of the collection of taxes collected by ATC for repayment to the Treasury in
order to restore ATC's present finances to an ccceptable level; (d) the imple-
mentation of a cost-based tariff system; and (e) the inclusion in the project
of a comprehensive plan for technical assistance and training.

VII. CONCLUSION
7.01      The main objective of the project in preparing the large and complex
Second Railway Project was achieved in that the consulting services provided
the basic information for ATC's 1974-78 Investment Plan (which constitutes the
Second Railway Project) as well as the detailed engineering and tender documents
for the realignment of the CFCO railway between Holle and Loubomo, and its econo-
mic and financial evaluation.  Although ATC was unable to meet the financial
targets included in the Project Agreement, some of the reasons for this were
outside its control, e.g. Government decision to reduce number of technical
assistants and change their responsibilities, trade union pressure to increase
CFCO staffing, higher than foreseen inflation and the 1974 recession. However,
the reduction in the efficiency of ATC's operations would have been less had ATC
exerted a better managerial control and supervision. It would have been useful
in this context if the project had included a plan of action with specific annual
operational targets. As no major road construction between Brazzaville and Pointe
Noire was undertaken, no feasibility study of the road was made (see Section 4.02
of the Credit Agreement), and the CFCO railway is still the only link between the
two cities for freight traffic.
7.02      Although there is an element of risk that the financial and economic
goals of the Second Railway Project will not be completely achieved, a far
greater risk exists that without it ATC will not be able to handle the traffic
offered, with the result that the Congo's and the region's economic development
will be slowed and the country will forego substantial'foreign exchange earnings.
