                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR summarizes the developments in project implementation following the February 2011 mission. To date, most activities are completed, one major activity remains: the
                         construction of the Balbala College. As of March 2011, the disbursement rate is of 77% with almost all project funds contractually committed. The Credit closing date was extended
                         for an additional year (until December 31, 2011) in order to complete the construction of the Balbala College. This activity is progressing steadily, with a physical progress rate of
                         50%, and the completion date expected by August 15, 2011.
