                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Most activities of the project have been completed. The main activity remaining to be completed is the construction of the Collège Balbala. Construction began in the summer of 2010
                         and will not be completed by the project's closing date of 12/31/2010. On November 7th, the government of Djibouti requested an extension of the project closing date, but were
                         informed that project extensions cannot be approved by the Bank if outstanding financial audits exist. The 2009 financial audits for the IDA project and the EFA-FTI-financed project
                         have not yet begun. An auditor was selected on 12/1/10, but a contract has not yet been signed (pending information from the project implementation unit prior to Bank no-objection
                         to the contract award).
