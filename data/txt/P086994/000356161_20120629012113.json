and\n            Improvement Project for Djibouti were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory\n            and borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: where the project scope is\n            limited, project development objectives and indicators\n            should be specific and measurable. The establishment of a\n            monitoring and evaluation system depends on having\n            sufficient capacity within the borrower's institutions\n            as well as borrower ownership. Strong coordination with\n            donors during preparation and implementation is essential to\n            identify financing gaps and optimize interventions in the\n            sector, as well as increasing efficiency. Where the borrower\n            has limited capacity in bank procedures, extensive support\n            is required. The large investments in school infrastructure\n            underline the need for a strong maintenance unit to\n            implement the maintenance strategy. It is important to link\n            training with career development. The growing demand from\n            parents to enroll children with special needs requires a\n            longer-term strategy to be put in place to consolidate the\n            efforts achieved so far in this area."}, "docdt": "2012-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
