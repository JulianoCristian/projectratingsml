Restructuring Paper  
 
1. 
The closing date for the 
Djibouti Second School Access and Improvement Project
 
(P086994, Credit 4122-DJ) will be extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 
2011. 
2. 
The Credit was approved by the Board on November 8, 2005 and became effective on 
March 26, 2006.  Most project activities have been completed.  
The project development 
objectives continue to be achievable during the extension period; the performance of the 
borrower and BEPE (project implementing agency) continues to be satisfactory; and the 
Borrower has submitted an action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project 
within the extension period.   
 
3. 
Regarding the audit requirement, we have received clearance from Soukeyna Kane 
(Acting Manager, MNAFM) to allow us to proceed with the extension of the closing date in the 
absence of an audit.  A time-bound action plan has been prepared and agreed to by the borrower.    
 
4. 
The proposed extension is necessary to complete the 
construction of a middle school:  
Collège Balbala.  School construction began in August 2010 and will not be completed by the 
current closing date. The estimated cost of school construction is approximately US$2.44 million.
 
5. 
This will be the second extension of the project.
