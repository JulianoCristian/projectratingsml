"The objective of the Second School\n            Access and Improvement Project for Djibouti will increase\n            access to basic education equitably, improve the quality of\n            education and increase the efficiency of the education\n            system. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011. The project\n            development objectives continue to be achievable during the\n            extension period; the performance of the borrower and BEPE\n            (project implementing agency) continues to be satisfactory;\n            and the Borrower has submitted an action plan acceptable to\n            the Bank to complete the project within the extension\n            period. The extension is necessary to complete the\n            construction of a middle school:  College Balbala.  School\n            construction began in August 2010 and will not be completed\n            by the current closing date. The estimated cost of school\n            construction is approximately US$2.44 million. This will be\n            the second extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
