                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR summarizes the developments in project implementation following the mission that took place in Djibouti from September 26 to October 6, 2011. To date, most activities
                         have been completed and disbursements have reached 76.41%. The construction of the Colle de Balbala "Hodan 3" is completed and the school is currently accommodating 2,700
                         students. The provision of furniture and equipment for the college has been, however, significantly delayed due to the fact that the National Tender Board postponed the opening bid
                         session many times, thus affecting Bank's procurement procedures. The no objection to the evaluation report for this package has just been approved by the Regional Procurement
