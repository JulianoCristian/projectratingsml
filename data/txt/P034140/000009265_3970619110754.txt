IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
EMERGENCY DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJECT (LOAN 3690-AL)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Emergency Desert
Locust Control Project in the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, for which loan
3690-AL in the amount of US$30 million equivalent was approved on January 27, 1994, and
became effective on July 6, 1994.
The loan was closed on August 1, 1996, effective June 11, 1996, at which time a
balance of US$27.84 million was canceled. Final disbursement took place on January 18, 1996.
No cofinancier was involved.
The ICR was prepared by the FAO Investment Center: Mr Jacques Chabloz, team
leader, Ms. Annie Monard, Locust Specialist, and Mr. Benoist Veillerette, Agro-economist. It
was reviewed by Messrs. Laurent Msellati, Task Manager, and Charles Ameur, at the World
Bank (WB).
For security reasons, neither supervision nor completion missions took place in
country. The ICR is, therefore, based on material in the project file. Various communications
by fax with concerned Government officials involved in project implementation (presented in
Appendix 1) were unsuccessful and resulted in unresolved questions, although borrower's
comments on the draft ICR were received on December 19, 1996.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
EMERGENCY DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJECT
(Ln. 3690-AL)
Evaluation Summary
A. Introduction
1.        The serious locust plague which struck Algeria in 1987-88 led to the treatment of
about 2.2 million ha and to a first WB-financed project (Loan 3017-AL) to address the enormous
threat to the country's agriculture. In 1993, another potentially worse plague was forecast. The
Government therefore asked the WB for emergency assistance to support its national locust
control program and to strengthen its surveillance and warning system.
B. Project Objectives
2.        The main project objectives were: (i) to provide urgent assistance in support of
Algeria's national locust control program with provision for three locust control campaigns
between early 1994 and early 1995 covering 1.5 million ha; (ii) to further reinforce the existing
surveillance and warning systems to enable the country to better predict locust activity and
movements. The activities financed under the project were also expected to benefit neighboring
countries in the region. Project objectives were simple and clear, and were drawn up to properly
address the country's specific needs in the event of an imminent plague threat.
C. Implementation Experience and Results
3.        However, the major plague that was expected in 1994 did not materialize for two
reasons: (i) late rainfall in southern and western Mauritania prolonged the growth of green
patches of vegetation which, by creating good breeding conditions, drew significant number of
the gregarious populations to remain there; and (ii) the success of large-scale control operations
in Mauritania from October 1993 to February 1994 meant that approximately 700,000 ha could
be treated. The number of desert locusts decreased as a result, arild the size of populations that
migrated to the western Maghreb (Morocco and Algeria) to breed in spring were considerably
below expectations. This trend extended into the following two seasons (1994-1995 and 1995-
1996) and as swarms progressively decreased, the risk of plague gradually disappeared.
ii



4.         Therefore, a total area of only 83,000 ha was treated in Algeria" out of the 1.5 million ha
foreseen in the project document. Pesticide stocks left over from the previous project were used,
mainly with trucks for ground spraying, leaving the US$25.3 million (84% of the loan) earmarked for
import of pesticide and aircraft services untouched. Only US$2.16 million (7% of the loan) was
disbursed for purchases to strengthen locust control capacity (import of sprayers for existing trucks)
and the surveillance and warning systems (import of 50 Four-WD vehicles). These activities were
implemented over a proper timing sequence. The nature of the use of the counterpart funds is unclear.
The only audit report, received on November 26, 1996, shows a US$24.84 million balance to which an
amount of US$3 million, corresponding to the undisbursed special account, needs to be added.
5.         A verdict on the project's accomplishments must take into account the fact that the
dreaded plague did not in fact take place. The urgent assistance required under the first objective was
thus indeed provided but the preventive treatment was carried out much slower than had been
anticipated. The second objective was partly achieved. During project implementation, the control and
surveillance systems were strengthened and teams actively deployed. These systems are likely to be
sustainable" as the Government has continued to supply, after project implementation, the necessary
operating expenses. The project's outcome can therefore be considered satisfactory.
6.         Due to security reasons", it was only possible to field a preparation mission in September
1993 and the project could neither be appraised nor supervised in the field. In 1996, because the
plague did not take place, and on the advice of the WB, the Government decided to cancel a large part
of the loan. Three progress reports were prepared by the Borrower which focused on the locust
situation and on the treatments undertaken by the control network. However, these reports did not
provide accurate financial information on the use of counterpart funds.
D. Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
7.         A major finding of the project is that the problem of locust infestation is heavily influenced
by climatic conditions and needs to be treated on a regional scale by the international community.
Current desert locust numbers are low and no major plague development is foreseen in the coming
months. Nevertheless, as populations are still gregarious, a vigilant attitude is necessary and
surveillance and control operations will be needed in summer breeding areas of West Afiica and
thereafter in winter breeding areas of Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria.   No particular future
operations are required of the WB.
The key lessons learned are:
Treatment was conducted in three stages covering 14,000 ha, 60,000 ha and 9,000 ha respectively
during three seasons.
21         This is despite the fact that, on two recent occasions, they failed to identify localized swarms.
3/         Algeria has been rated 4 on the 5-level security scale of the United Nations which prevents UN
personnel and affiliates to travel to the country.
iii



The key lessons learned are:
(i)    This project is the second WB loan to assist Algeria in curbing locust
infestation.   During both the projects' implementation, substantial
proportions of the WB loan were canceled, respectively by 62 % and 93 %.
At the time of the emergency preparation of this project, the situation had
been regarded with alarm due to the pessimistic forecasts of the PRIFAS
and GOA in view of limited means and organization and doubts over
Mauritania's capacity to restrain the threat of an advancing plague. In the
future, with the improvement of the surveillance and control system (which
have been strengthened by the project), mass treatments are unlikely to be
required. Strategy should focus more on prevention and early warning than
on treatment itself.
(ii)   In order to ensure an improved prevention systems on an international level,
priority should be directed at improving, better utilizing and combining
recently developed complementary tools such as: (a) the permanent remote
sensing and field information centralized by FAO (which is scheduled to
be compiled through a historiographic-based Geographic Information
System developed by FAO); and (b) the existing bio-model developed by
the PRIFAS on the basis of locust biology.
(iii)   The need for improved international coordination in locust control programs
is essential. As this project in Algeria showed, the success of desert locust
management depended on what had occurred in the Sahelian part of West
Africa. Given that locust infestation is global in nature, FAO is the agency
that could be made responsible for the required international coordination.
(iv)   Another question that must be addressed is how to finance a multi-country
program that will equitably benefit all countries in the region. This
program requires further negotiation and cooperation among the financial
institutions and countries concerned.
(v)    Besides the improvement of early prevention systems, locust control
activities would benefit from the use of improved and alternative products
that have recently been developed and which promise to be less costly and
less damaging to the environment.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
EMERGENCY DESERT LOCUST CONTROL PROJECT
(Ln. 3690-AL)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.         During 1987 and 1988, Algeria was struck by a major locust plague which led to
the treatment of about 2.2 million ha and later to a first WB-financed project (Loan 3017-AL;
1988-1990) to address the threat looming over the country's agriculture. The combined effects
of freak weather conditions and the efficient action undertaken by neighboring countries"
brought down locust activity to minimal levels in the course of this first project and 62 % of the
loan was consequently canceled. In late 1993, another onslaught of this plague, potentially
worse than the previous one, was forecast and this emergency project was prepared with similar
main objectives: (i) to provide urgent assistance in support of Algeria's national locust control
program; this entailed provision for three locust control campaigns which were to be carried out
from early 1994 to early 1995 over an area of 1.5 million ha; and (ii) to further reinforce
existing surveillance and warning systems (i.e. complement the support provided by the previous
project), enabling the country to better predict locust activity and migration. The early warning
activities to be financed under the project were also to benefit other countries in the region.
2.         The objectives were simple and clear, and were worked out to properly address
specific needs in the event of an imminent plague threat. Staggered by the catastrophic impact
of the 1987/1988 plague, and considering the conditions of locust development in the Red Sea
Region as well as the doubts about neighboring countries' ability to stop the plague, Algeria
actively sought to protect itself and requested financial means for preventive treatment on a
large-scale within its territory. The urgency of the first objective required a timely and massive
use of insecticide covering large areas. The second objective was to strengthen Algeria's
protection system in the long run.
" Mainly Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Morocco, and Senegal.



2                PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
B. Achievement of Objectives
3.         Fortunately, due to efficient treatment in Mauritania (penetrating upstream into
Algeria) and providential climatic changes, the massive plague was averted and only localized
locust attacks in limited areas of Algeria's Sahara took place. Consequently, instead of the
planned treatment of 1.5 million ha in three campaigns, only two campaigns took place on a
much reduced scale: some 14,000 ha were treated from October 1993 to July 1994 (against
700,000 ha in Mauritania during the same period); and during the winter/spring period of the
following year (October 1994 to July 1995), 60,350 ha were treated, requiring 65,000 liters of
insecticide.
4.         The frt objective was therefore achieved with the mobilization of required
resources falling much below expectation. This meant that the WB contribution for the import
of pesticide and for use of commercial aircraft services (US$25.3 million" , or 84 % of the loan)
was not used since left-over pesticide stocks, meeting the standards of FAO/WHO, were
available from the previous project. Counterpart funds were apparently2' used to purchase
additional quantities of pesticide locally (approximately 200,000 liters) and to secure five aircraft
from Air Alg6rie in the event of emergency aerial spraying. As it turned out, however, only
ground treatment was resorted to in the Atlas region and because swarms did not, as might have
been expected, reach the coastal areas and aircraft action for direct treatment on swarns was
never needed.
5.         The second objective was achieved in part. As planned during appraisal, 50 Four-
WD light vehicles (US$1.32 million) were imported to strengthen the surveillance and warning
system, as well as 100 sprayers for trucks (US$0.85 million) to strengthen locust control
capacity. These were the only disbursements of the WB loan, for a total of US$ 2.16 million,
or 7.2% of the total. The remainder was canceled on June 11, 1996 at the request of the
Government which had been advised to do so by the World Bank after it had reviewed its
country portfolio. Other items such as spare parts for trucks and a pesticide analysis laboratory
were not purchased. Details of counterpart funds used to purchase equipment locally have not
been made available. The surveillance and control network would seem to have been operational
during project implementation: during the 1994-95 winter/spring breeding period reports mention
19 teams spread over 7 "Wilayate" (districts) of Central and Western Algeria. Staff included of
19 technical agents and 95 workers. A total of 57 vehicles were used (19 sprayer-trucks & 38
Four-WD cars).
6.         The first main benefit of the project was the forestallment of a serious plague risk
(considered high at that time) that could have had a calamitous impact on: (i) the vulnerable
agricultural sector; (ii) the standard of living of millions of people, and (iii) the control programs
of neighboring countries. This benefit was indeed achieved although credit is owed more to
"  Of which US$ 13.1 million had been earmarked for the procurement of pesticide and US$ 12.3 million for
aircraft services.
21 Due to lack of supervision for security reasons and difficulties in communication (see below), the list of missing
information is presented in Appendix 1.



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                      3
providential climatic conditions and preventive action carried out in Mauritania in addition to
the adequate treatment realized in Algeria by INPV. The second benefit is Algeria's increased
ability to better monitor the deep south and southeast of the country thanks to the purchase of
the Four-WD vehicles. At the time of appraisal, neither Economic Rate of Return nor Net
Present Value was calculated as they were not applicable.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
7.         This section deals with the history and evolution of the locust situation in the region
and particularly in Algeria from early 1993 to early 1996, and shows how the threat of another
plague in 1993 constituted a major justification for this project. The analysis provides details
to better understand the specific conditions of the sector and to draw lessons from this
expenence.
January to September 1993
8.        In January 1993, indicators showed that the upsurge of locusts in the Red Sea
coastal plains (their traditional area of origin) had many of the characteristics of previous
upsurges that had led to plagues. Due to heavy rainfall in that area during spring and the
resulting breeding activities, many swarms migrated eastward to the Indo-Pakistan summer
breeding areas and later (but to a lesser extent) to the Sahel where, in July 1993, swarm
populations were reported in all traditional summer breeding grounds. In August, laying swarms
were reported in Mauritania, and in September 1993, the status of the desert locust upsurge
continued to give cause for alarm. In September and October, massive breeding was reported
in the three main regions of desert locust distribution area: Western Region (Mauritania, Mali
and Niger), Central Region (Sudan) and Eastern Region (Pakistan and India).
Situation Forecast in September 1993 as a Basis for Emergency Intervention
9.        Whereas forecasts of the FAO locust center were relatively serene, the scenario
envisaged at that time (notably by the PRIFAS and GOA) was rather alarmist:
(i)    Swarms would migrate from Sahelian countries to Mauritania and southern
Morocco where rainfall during early November would be likely to provide
favorable breeding and/or survival conditions. The first wave of locust
swarms was expected to arrive in southern Algeria during December 1993.
(ii)    After a temporary stop in the area due to seasonal cool temperatures and
the relatively high altitude, the swarms would migrate north during the
spring of 1994. This would intensify spring breeding in Algeria.



4               PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
(iii)   The spring generation would then migrate toward the Sahelian summer
breeding areas and their exponential multiplication would lead to the risk
of a massive invasion in Algeria during 1995.
Actual Situation from October 1993 and June 1996
10.       Actual 1994 spring breeding activities in northwest Africa, however, confuted the
above forecast and the scale of breeding turned out to be much lower. The reasons were the
following:
(i)    A freak weather occurrence - late rainfall in southern and western
Mauritania - prolonged the growth of green patches of vegetation which
consequently created good breeding conditions in that country. Therefore,
a significant number of the gregarious populations remained in southern
Mauritania and, to a lesser extent in northern Senegal, and laid their eggs
there instead of migrating toward Algeria.  Another section of the
population did, however, eventually migrate toward the south of the Atlas
Mountains in Morocco and to adjacent areas of Algeria making the
situation in December 1993 still one of great concern. The FAO forecast
warned of large-scale control operations being required in Morocco and
perhaps Algeria during the following spring. But because of the delay in
migration, the locust populations were weakened by the unsuitable
breeding conditions due to the altitude of the Atlas Mountains.
(ii)    Large-scale ground and aerial control operations were conducted in
Mauritania from October 1993 to February 1994 in which some
700,000 ha were treated. Consequently, the number of desert locusts
decreased and the populations that did arrive in northwest Africa (Morocco
and Algeria) for spring breeding were far below expectation. As a result
of these events, control operations were relatively limited in northwest
Africa; covering 40,000 ha in Morocco from February to June 1994 and
only 14,000 ha in Algeria from March to July 1994.
11.       The following 1994-1995 season also proved to be much less severe than forecast
as a consequence of these providential events: the level of populations available for the next
summer breeding in Sahelian countries was relatively low, and Mauritania had only to treat some
200,000 ha, or less than one-third than the previous year. These treatments proved their
effectiveness once more, despite the lack of adequate means in that country at that time.
Nevertheless, though still relatively downsized, populations entering Algeria in January 1995 for
winter/spring breeding were still more numerous than the previous year due to their summer
breeding in Sahelian cour.tries, including Mali and Niger which had gone undetected. Their
invasion into Algeria resulted in the treatment of more than 60,000 ha (from December 1994 to
June 1995) compared with the 14,000 ha during the same period of the previous year.



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                       5
12.        The following 1995-1996 season showed a new decrease in numbers. In summer,
less than 50,000 ha were treated in Mauritania (August to October 1995). From November 1995
to March 1996, some 20,000 ha were treated in Mauritania and 6,000 ha in Morocco. In May,
groups and small swarms of adults were reported in Algeria where 9,000 ha were treated. These
populations probably stem from the breeding that took place undetected in western and southern
Algeria.
Low Level of Disbursements and Delay in Implementation
13.        Only US$2.16 million (or 7% of the loan) was disbursed to import 100 sprayers
for trucks and 50 surveillance Four-WD vehicles: the remaining US$27.83 million was canceled
on June 11, 1996. For unexplained reasons, other items, such as spare parts for existing trucks
and laboratory equipment for pesticide analysis, were not purchased as planned, though some
contracts had been prepared. According to the last activity report prepared by the INPV in
March 1996, DA 957 million of counterpart funds were spent during project implementation.
This is more than 50% above the DA 625 million budgeted in the project document. Moreover,
the exact nature of these expenses was not made clear" . It can only be presumed that part of
the funds were used for items on INPV's regular budget not directly linked to the project. Such
lack of clarity is due to the insufficient accounting system during project implementation as well
as the absence of auditing. The expenses could have included locally purchased pesticide,
securing aircraft from Air Alg6rie for aerial treatment which was never carried out, purchase
of vehicles and spare parts, some equipment and operating costs.
14.       In view of the state of emergency that existed at the time, the project had to be
prepared quickly: only four months passed between the project's identification/preparation
(September 1993) and the signature of the loan (27 January, 1994). However, the project only
became effective five months later (7 July, 1994) partly due administrative reasons in the country
and partly because the envisaged first treatment during the first semester of 1994 became
unnecessary and thus attenuated the urgency of project implementation.
D. Project Sustainability
15.        During the period under consideration (from October 1993 to May 1996), while the
desert locust populations remained gregarious in western and northwestern Africa, their numbers
decreased regularly as illustrated by the areas treated year after year in the region2". This trend
was a consequence of suitable conditions for winter breeding in Mauritania which made it
possible to successfully conduct large-scale control operations in that country as well as active
surveillance and control in Algeria. However, the efficient control of locust population in the
region (and in particular in Algeria) will only be sustainable if two conditions are met:
"  Clarification was requested from INPV (Appendix 1).
2/ See Table and graph in Appendix B.



6                 PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
(i)     establishment of an efficient surveillance network. The current strategy of
several countries (including Algeria) is to focus on surveillance rather than
on heavy treatment" in order to identify and check the threat of
populations before they affect large areas. By providing 50 vehicles and
100 sprayers, the project has strengthened the Algerian surveillance
network which can now operate efficiently by itself and is likely to be
sustainable as the Algerian authorities have shown their commitment to
provide the necessary operating expenses and spare parts for the
equipment and vehicles. The system's failure to identify two recent
(small-scale) locust invasions2" must be regarded within the context of the
country's large size and the consequent difficulty of identifying small-sized
quantities of locusts in remoter areas.
(ii)    promotion of an international collaboration. If prevention is to be
effective, the problem has to be treated on a regional scale and cover the
entire area where the cycle of locust reproduction operates. For instance,
populations invading Algeria and Morocco originate from sahelian
countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Mali and Niger) in which it is imperative
that swarms be treated efficiently.
E. Bank Performance
16.         The project was identified by the Government which made an official request for
a WB loan on 30 July, 1993. This was rapidly followed (one month later) by a WB-supported
mission to help the Government in the preparation of the project. The mission drew on the
experience of the PRIFAS (Departement acridologique du CIRAD). The mission produced a
relatively detailed report that coincided with the Government's view on the seriousness of the
situation and the need for emergency intervention. The Government emphasized the need for
a tight deadline; it proposed simplified procedures, to which the WB responded satisfactorily,
to cope with the emergency. The project was then rapidly appraised and presented to the Board
as an emergency project (Memorandum of President and a Technical Annex) on 6 December,
1993.  Despite experience gained from the previous project, in which only 6,000 ha were
treated instead of the estimated three million, the decision to accept the project in order to fend
off the risk of another large-scale attack was justified. The only matter which is questionable
a posteriori is that of such large quantities of pesticide being contemplated for one single country.
" Reasons include the high cost of treatment (import of chemicals and plane rental), the potential risk for human
health and environment, and the perishable nature of the chemicals. Algeria has indicated that it would not
borrow the sums again in the future for heavy treatment.
2/ The first in southern Algeria, in November 1994, was the result of an undetected breeding in northern Mali
and Niger during 1994 summer, and the second (again in Algeria), was a consequence of undetected arrivals
of adults in the west and of undetected laying activity in the south. Similarly, the infestations in southern
Algeria in June 1996 consisted of hopper bands that were the result of a spring breeding in the same area; but
a previous survey carried out in April had not reported any desert locust activity.



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                       7
17.        The project became effective only in July, 1994 and due to the security situation
prevailing in Algeria, the project could not be supervised" in the field. Supervision was
conducted from Headquarters, but significant difficulties in communication between the WB and
the Govermment agencies as well as unrewarded efforts by the WB to meet with the counterpart
outside the country, hampered the monitoring of the project. Three implementation summaries
(Form 590) were prepared in August 1994, May 1995 and March 1996 based on incomplete
information provided by the borrower. These reports only stated the low disbursement level due
to the averted locust invasion.
F. Borrower Performance
18.        The project was prepared with the active participation of the Government which
showed an eager commitment to its implementation. The project design was in line with the
sector's policy as it aimed at complementing the national locust control system. Project
implementation was the responsibility of the National Institute for Plant Protection (INPV). The
Institute undertook the planned tasks of surveillance and treatment in a timely and efficient
manner. In this regard, Borrower performance was satisfactory. However, performance was
poor in terms of auditing and reporting of financial aspects of the project
19.        During project implementation, four biannual reports were prepared by the
Government (in October 1994, January 1995, July 1995 and March 1996). As field supervision
was impossible, they are the main source of information regarding the implementation of the
project. They are good technical reports and, in particular, the second and third reports detail
very clearly the history, recent evolution and prospects of the locust situation both in Algeria
and in neighboring countries on the basis of Algeria's own observations and FAO forecasts.
This illustrates the fact that the surveillance and warning network were functioning efficiently,
partly thanks to the project strengthening.  The second report explains very clearly the
mechanisms by which the dramatic threat in 1993 resulted in relatively limited invasion and
treatment during 1994 for to the reasons pointed out above. Accurate details related to the scope
and efficiency of the treatments are provided.
20.        A modification of the structure of the loan was proposed in the first report, and the
second report (January 1995) mentioned the possibility of canceling about two-thirds of the loan
(or US$20.65 million) corresponding to the import of pesticide and commercial aircraft services
(the third report actually proposed that this be done). Such action would have followed advice
from the WB with full agreement of the implementing agency (INPV) but, as no official request
was presented by the Government, the loan was not canceled until June 11, 1996.
21.       Information on financial and disbursement matters is much more scanty. The
second report briefly explained the bidding procedure results for three lots. The actual purchase
of two of them (50 vehicles and 100 sprayers) is stated together with their quotations. However,
"  Algeria has been rated 4 on the 5-level security scale of the United Nations, which prevents UN personnel and
affiliates from traveling to the country.



8               PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
accounting records were never provided and financial matters were never audited. In early
1996, it was agreed with the Government that an audit report which would cover all project
expenditures in 1994 and 1995 should be prepared by IGF and sent to the WB by no later than
September 30, 1996. An audit report for FY 1995 was finally received by the Bank on
November 27, 1996. In addition, it was not possible to identify the nature of the use of
counterpart funds which, according to the INPV reports, were disbursed in their entirety, unlike
the WB loan.
G. Assessment of Outcome
22.        The project can be rated as satisfactory since it has achieved its main objectives,
i.e. the avoidance of a major locust invasion and the strengthening of the national system of
surveillance and control to an efficient and sustainable level. However, good weather conditions
played an essential role. The US$30 million loan had been conceived as a readily accessible tool
strong enough to counter any major threat. Due to the unexpected turn of events, the loan was
never used but nevertheless played its role of "insurance".
23.        Environmental aspects. Major environmental issues identified at appraisal were:
(i) use of pesticides over an area of up to 1.5 million ha; (ii) handling and storage of pesticide;
(iii) disposal of left-over chemicals and containers; and (iv) repercussions on the health of
insecticide teams and of the population living in the areas marked out for treatment. In 1993,
the WB EMTEN (Environment Division of the MNA Technical Department) gave the project
a "B" rating as Environment Category, and decided that a limited environmental analysis would
be appropriate, given that the project might have specific environmental effects.
24.        The following were the standards set down in the environmental analysis:
-   only pesticides approved by FAO and the World Bank were to be used; the
insecticides used against locusts in Algeria were acceptable from a human
toxicology standpoint;
-   a committee of toxicologists would screen any new pesticide prior to its
introduction;
-   pesticide would be delivered in batches to avoid storage problems, and any
pesticide left over would be returned to the manufacturer; to avoid
complications caused by heavy insecticide drums, any new order of pesticides
would limit the size of the containers to 25 liters;
-   maps of ecologically sensitive zones were to be prepared and sent to all the
"wilayate";
-   treatment of national parks was to be avoided as much as possible;



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                       9
technical assistance was recommended to train local engineers in appropriate
techniques, notably safe and effective storage, handling, and application of
pesticide; specialists would advise on disposal of unused pesticide and of
containers; health of insecticide teams was to be regularly monitored by
paramedics;
insecticide teams were to be equipped with suitable protective clothing,
equipment and health kits;
the acquisition of GIS systems was recommended to help pinpoint targets and
control the problem at an early stage.
advance warning was to be given to populations prior to treatments.
25.        Since project activities were limited to the provision of vehicles and sprayers, some
of the proposed actions for environmental protection were not undertaken. However, given the
commitment and the professionalism of INPV, we assume that handling, application and storage
of pesticides, as well as advance warning of populations, were done properly.
H. Future Operation
26.        The surveillance and control teams will be deployed as and when required in given
areas of the country and, if necessary, in neighboring countries (Mauritania, Mali). The chances
of a major locust invasion have significantly diminished for the near future. As explained,
current desert locust numbers are low even if the populations are still gregarious. Appropriate
conditions for summer breeding would increase these numbers but even so are unlikely to lead
to a major plague development this year. According to recent reports regarding areas treated
during the past three years, the current situation is considered an "upsurge decline" (see graph
in Appendix B). Nevertheless, because populations are still gregarious, vigilance is necessary.
Survey and control operations will therefore be required first of all in summer breeding areas
of West Africa and thereafter in winter breeding areas of Mauritania and southwestern Morocco.
The recent level of population breeding was apparently lower in 1995 in Mauritania and
Morocco and higher in Algeria. Other areas requiring survey operations are the summer
breeding areas of northern Mali and Niger. Once again, the amount of rainfall during the wet
season in the summer breeding areas of West Africa is bound to constitute the major factor
affecting desert locust numbers over the next few months.
27.        As demonstrated by the project, prediction of locust activity is uncertain because
it is influenced by a number of factors that escape control. In order to reduce this uncertainty,
the efficiency of the weather forecasts in Algeria should be improved. The country is equipped
with several automatic weather forecast stations set up to identify risky meteorological
conditions, especially in the desert, but not all of them are operational.



10              PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
28.       Delays in pesticide delivery no longer constitute a major problem.  In an
emergency, a range of suppliers (manufacturers, formulators or dealers) are able to deliver up
to 30,000 It or more of pesticide at the final destination within two weeks of the order. Such
speediness is the welcome outcome of a generalized use of communication through fax and e-
mail that have greatly reduced financial discussions after tenders. In an emergency, pesticides
can be sent by air. Pesticides are otherwise shipped by sea and arrive at destination within two
months of the order. Experience has shown that the creation of a pesticide bank is no longer
expedient, if a locust campaign is well planned by all the countries concerned, suppliers can
provide pesticides at short notice. The only problem is the availability of funds which affects
the capacity of countries to correctly plan a campaign and forecast the evolution of the locust
situation.
29.        No particular follow-up action is required of the Bank.
I. Key Lessons Learnt
The following are the main lessons learnt:
(i)    This project is the second WB loan to assist Algeria in its fight against
locusts. During implementation of both projects, substantial proportions
of the loan were canceled, respectively 62 % and 93 %. At the time of the
emergency preparation of this project, the situation was perceived with
great alarm due to: the pessimistic forecasts of PRIFAS; the limited
stocks of pesticide; and, finally, Mauritania's capacity to check the threat
of an advancing plague, in view of that country's limited means and
organization. Consequently, the US$30 million credit was mobilized for
large scale treatments in Algeria. In the future, with the improvement of
the surveillance and control system (which has been strengthened by the
project), such heavy treatments are unlikely to be needed. Future
participating organizations and projects should focus more on prevention
and early warning than on treatment.
(ii)   In order to ensure an improved prevention system at the international
level, priority should be given to the improvement, efficient use and
combination of recently developed complementary tools such as: (a) the
permanent remote sensing and field information system headquartered at
centralized FAO (which is scheduled to be compiled through a
historiographic-based Geographic Information System developed by FAO);
and (b) the existing bio-model developed by PRIFAS on the basis of the
biology of locusts.
(iii)   The need for improved international coordination in locust control
programs is essenti-il. For instance, in Algeria this project showed that
desert locust management depended on what had occurred in the Sahel of



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                     11
West Africa. Contrary to what was foreseen by Algeria and the WB, the
treatments in Mauritania during the winter 1993-1994 were efficient and
contributed extensively in limiting the invasion of Algeria. FAO should
be considered as the agency mandated to ensure such international
coordination as the locust problem is global in nature.
(iv)    Desert locust management will also require financing of multi-country
program that will equitably benefit all countries of the region. The details
of such a program must be worked out. Thus will require further
negotiation and cooperation between the financial institutions and countries
concerned to find adequate financial instruments.
(v)    Besides the improvement of early prevention systems, locust control
activities would benefit from the use of improved and alternative products
that have recently been developed and which promise to be less costly and
less damaging to the environment. The chemical industry has become
more responsive to this issue and is showing an increasing involvement
and commitment to the improvement of storage capacity in order to curtail
insecticide waste and thus reduce the threat to the environment.

APPENDIX A: MISSING INFORMATION                          23
Appendix A: Missing Information
As security conditions in Algeria prevented any field visit and related discussions
with Algerian officials and on the other hand the Algerian authorities never answered the two
FAO/CP faxes dated June, 28th and July, 11th, 1996, soliciting additional information notably
on project expenses and financial arrangements, the mission was dissuaded to request any other
data. A follow-up fax was sent by the Bank on August 3, 1996, to INPV with copies of
FAO's previous requests as well as the outline of the expected contribution of MOA to the ICR.
No answer has been received to date.
As a consequence, the following questions and issues remained unsolved at the
issuing date of the present report:
(1)    Most important was the filling of a Table prepared by the FAO/CP (see
attached Table) detailing the actual expenses of both the loan and
counterpart funds against the cost breakdown as presented in the project
document.
(2)    More specifically, the activity report produced by the Algerian authorities
on March 1996 mentioned counterpart fund allocations to broad items such
as aircraft renting (DA 115 million); purchase of equipment (DA 228
million), and; operating expenses (DA 478 million) for which precision was
requested regarding the exact nature of these disbursements.
(3)    Why no chemicals had been imported at the beginning as 3 contracts for a
total of 500,000 liters had been prepared?
(4)    Why were the importation contracts of spare parts (for Itoshu and
Mercedes) canceled after the bidding procedures had been undertaken?
(5)    What improvements of the surveillance and warning system both in the
country and in the region would you prioritize in the future?
In addition, the authorities were invited to provide their own comments on the
project as well as their own lessons which they have drawn from this experience.

APPENDIX B: SUMMARY OF DESERT LOCUST SITUATION                     25
FROM OCTOBER 1993 TO MAY 1996 IN WESTERN AFRICA
Appendix B: Summary of Desert Locust situation from October 1993 to May 1996 in
western Africa
YE4R 1993
October 1993. The Desert Locust upsurge in West Africa extended into north-western Senegal
and north-western Mauritania where numerous small swarms laid immediately upon arrival.
Three swarms were also reported in south-west Morocco.
November 1993. New generation swarms formed in Mauritania and Senegal despite substantial
control operations. Additional swarms entered south-western Morocco and moved further north
to Algeria border. By late November, immature swarms formed in the Senegal River Valley and
started to move south towards Gambia.
December 1993. As a result of favorable breeding conditions, the Desert Locust situation
continued to be serious in Mauritania (new hatching and band formation), in adjacent areas of
south-western Morocco (arrival of numerous small maturing swarms) and Senegal. The FAO
forecast pointed out the future need of large scale control operations in Morocco and perhaps
Algeria during spring, due to the remoteness of the concerned areas and difficulties of logistics.
Additionai donor assistance was urgently required for Mauritania and Senegal.
YEAR 1994
January 1994. A serious situation was still reported in Mauritania and the winter breeding began
in the North. Small swarms continued to arrive in southern Morocco. Aerial and ground control
operations continued against maturing swarms and hopper bands in western and north-western
Mauritania. No locusts were reported in Algeria during December and early January.
February 1994. The current Desert Locust upsurge declined in Mauritania (and Senegal) due
to control operations and migrations to neighboring countries. As a result of increasing
temperatures, low number of small swarms started moving North, from southern Morocco and
north-western Mauritania.
March 1994. Current infestations are restricted to an area south of the Atlas Mountains in
Morocco and in Algeria.
April 1994. Several significant infestations continued to persist south of Atlas Mountains along
the border of Algeria and Morocco and in northern Mauritania; breeding occurred in both these
areas and also in southern Algeria. Control operations carried out in all areas against hoppers
and laying adults.



26         APPENDIX B: SUMMARY OF DESERT LOCUST SITUATION
FROM OCTOBER 1993 TO MAY 1996 IN WESTERN AFRICA
May 1994. Spring breeding continued in Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria resulting in the
formation of small swarms. The swarm movements started towards the summer breeding areas
of the Sahel of West Africa.
June 1994. Numerous small swarms formed in areas of previous spring breeding and continued
to move towards the traditional summer breeding areas of Mauritania, Mali and Niger.
July 1994. In Mauritania, the swarms that arrived from the North during June, dispersed on a
widespread area upon arrival; consequently, only low densities and scattered adults were
present.
August 1994. No significant Desert Locust populations were reported and the situation appeared
calm.
September 1994. No major developments although ecological conditions remained favorable.
October 1994. Reports indicated that undetected summer breeding has occurred in Niger, Chad
and Sudan. Breeding was in progress in central Mauritania where hopper groups and a few
swarms were reported.
November 1994. Resurgence of Desert Locust activity in western Africa and movements of
swarms from northern Mali and northern Niger to southern Algeria and from southern towards
northern Mauritania. Some adults moved further north into south-western Morocco.
December 1994. Persistence of a potential dangerous Desert Locust resurgence in western
Africa where adults and swarms continued to move from the northern Sahel towards the winter
breeding areas (south-western Morocco and southern Algeria).
YEAR 1995
January 1995. The Desert Locust situation remained serious in north-western Africa where
survey and control operations were in progress. Adult infestations were still present in southern
Algeria.
February 1995. Significant Desert Locust developments occurred in the winter spring areas of
north-west Africa: presence of numerous hopper bands in northern Mauritania where small
swarms continued to lay, arrival of several small swarms south of the Atlas Mountains in
Morocco and in the adjacent areas in Algeria. Breeding was reported in central and western
Algeria.
March 1995. Presence of numerous mature adults in central Algeria, additional laying and
presence of hopper bands. FAO said that, as a result of exceptionally good rainfalls during



APPENDIX B: SUMMARY OF DESERT LOCUST SITUATION                     27
FROM OCTOBER 1993 TO MAY 1996 IN WESTERN AFRICA
March in traditional spring breeding areas and the current presence of hopper bands and swarns
in the adjacent areas, a potentially dangerous situation could develop in the next few months.
April 1995. Apparition of additional hopper infestations in southern and central Algeria and
presence of immature and mature adults in southern and western Algeria.
May 1995. Persistence of locust infestations (hopper bands mixed with immature adults and a
few mature adults) in central and western Algeria and, at a less extent in the south and near the
Libyan border.
June 1995. The Desert Locust spring generation began to move towards the summer breeding
areas in the Sahel of West Africa; in consequence infestations progressively declined in Algeria
although hoppers and adults continued to be reported.
July 1995. Only a few infestations reported in southern Algeria. First reports of copulating
swarms in southern Mauritania.
August 1995. Significant infestations were confined in south-western Mauritania where breeding
was in progress. Scattered mature adults were reported in the extreme south of Algeria.
September 1995. Infestations of hopper bands in south-western Mauritania. Adults began to
move further west and north towards winter breeding areas.
October 1995. Swarns which moved to northern Mauritania late September laid. Additional
swarms started to form in western Mauritania. A few swarms reached south-western Morocco.
A few isolated adults were present in southern Algeria.
November 1995. Swarms formed in western Mauritania and gradually moved towards the North
where already present hopper bands matured.
December 1995. Small hopper and adult infestations were present in northern Mauritania where
widespread rains occurred during the month. Small patches of hopper bands were also present
in adjacent areas of south-western Morocco.
YEAR 1996
January 1996. Due to persistence of favorable ecological conditions in south-western Morocco,
hopper bands and young adults were present on a relatively restrictive area. No locusts were
reported from Algeria. Only a few little swarms were reported in Mauritania.
February 1996. A few small mature swarms were present in south-western Morocco and in
adjacent areas of north-western Mauritania. Only scattered immature adults were seen in south-
western Algeria.



28         APPENDIX B: SUMMARY OF DESERT LOCUST SITUATION
FROM OCTOBER 1993 TO MAY 1996 IN WESTERN AFRICA
March 1996. Significant infestations in north-western Africa were localized in two areas of
hopper bands in the extreme south-west of Morocco and in northern Mauritania. Scattered adults
and hopper bands were also reported in western Algeria.
April 1996. Substantial increase of locust infestations in north-western Africa. Hopper bands
were present in extreme south of Morocco and in western Algeria. Immature swarms and
immature adult groups were respectively reported in northern and western Mauritania and in
Morocco. No locusts were reported after a survey in southern Algeria.
May 1996. Formation of groups of adults and small swarms in western Algeria and further
movements towards the south-east. As a result of previously undetected laying, small early
hopper bands were present in southern Algeria. Swarms were reported from northern
Mauritania.
June 1996. Important Desert Locust infestations were concentrated in southern Algeria where
small swarms started to form however must infestations consisted of second to fifth instar hopper
bands.
