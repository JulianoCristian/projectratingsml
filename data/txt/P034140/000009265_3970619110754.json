Due to a significantly lower than normal\n            rainfall coincided with the project, far less vegetation was\n            available to catalyze locust breeding. Therefore, the\n            project shifted its focus to preventative measures instead.\n            The changes deal mostly with cancellation of funds since\n            much of it was not disbursed. Key lessons learned from this\n            project are as follows: (i) In the future, with the\n            improvement of the surveillance and control system (which\n            has been strengthened by the project), such heavy treatments\n            are unlikely to be needed. Future participating\n            organizations and projects should focus more on prevention\n            and early warning than on treatment. (ii) In order to ensure\n            an improved prevention system at the international level,\n            priority should be given to the improvement, efficient use\n            and combination of recently developed complementary tools\n            such as: the permanent remote sensing and field information\n            system and the existing bio-model developed by PRIFAS on the\n            basis of the biology of locusts. (iii) The need for improved\n            international coordination in locust control programs is\n            essential. (iv) Desert locust management will also require\n            financing of multi-country program that will equitably\n            benefit all countries of the region and (v) locust control\n            activities would benefit from the use of improved and\n            alternative products that have recently been developed and\n            which promise to be less costly and less damaging to the environment."}, "docdt": "1997-01-15T00:00:00Z"}
