The first is to provide\n            urgent assistance in support of Algeria's national\n            locust control program.  The second is to further reinforce\n            the existing surveillance and warning systems, enabling the\n            country to better predict locust activity and movements,\n            thus facilitating planning and implementation of future\n            control programs in situations of both plague and recession.\n            The early warning activities financed under the project will\n            also benefit other countries in the region. The project will\n            essentially consist of disaster prevention rather than\n            disaster relief and the dealing with an existing emergency.\n            The project consists of the following components:  (a) three\n            locust control campaigns over the period February/March 1994\n            to January 1995; (b) further strengthening national desert\n            locust control capabilities by increasing the existing stock\n            of vehicles, spare parts for vehicles, laboratory equipment\n            for pesticide analysis, and health kits for the operators;\n            (c) for prospection purposes, provision of small\n            meteorological and mobile telecommunication equipment,\n            including air to ground receivers and 10 hand-held global\n            positioning systems; (d) provision of short-term consultancy\n            and technical documentation to strengthen the capabilities\n            of National Institute for Plant Protection in the safe\n            handling, application and storage of pesticides, and\n            disposal of pesticides and pesticide containers; and (e)\n            training in locust prospection methods, pesticide handling,\n            phytopharmacy and in pesticide-related environmental protection."}, "docdt": "1993-12-06T00:00:00Z"}
