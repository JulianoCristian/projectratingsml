These are the lessons learned: 1)\n            The logistics of working on small islands is very heavy.\n            This was clearly underestimated for Round Island, but also\n            applies to Rodrigues and to a lesser extent to Ile aux\n            Aigrettes. Partnerships are essential to overcome such\n            difficulties. 2) Collaboration with partners, and in\n            particular collaboration between a nongovernmental\n            organizations and poublic entities such as Government\n            Departments, benefit from being clearly spelled out and is\n            best organized through the use of formal memoranda of\n            understanding (MOU). Such an MOU would have been most\n            helpful for example in the case of Rodrigues. 3) There is as\n            much to learn from failure as from success, as illustrated\n            by the learning process as Round Island, where trials and\n            errors have eventually led to a full understanding of how\n            the island can be restored. This has led to the development\n            of a follow-up project, now on-going."}, "docdt": "2003-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
