is intended to strengthen\n            the institutional framework responsible for promoting and\n            financing development of cooperatives, particularly village\n            level multipurpose cooperative societies. The project helps\n            NCDC and State Cooperative Banks to introduce a more\n            disciplined, project-oriented approach to financing basic\n            facilities for village cooperative societies, regional\n            marketing cooperatives and state-level cooperative\n            federations. Investments comprise construction of godowns\n            for these cooperative institutions. Technical assistance,\n            vehicles and engineering instruments are also financed. The\n            project godowns would result in increased availability of\n            inputs, particularly fertilizer, at the village level with\n            consequent agricultural production increases."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
