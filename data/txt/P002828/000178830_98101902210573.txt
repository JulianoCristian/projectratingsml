TO THE EXECUTIVE DITcECTOKS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A SECOND HIGHR'AY PTROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of U3S807 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for road reconstruction and
maintenance.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report N∞ 34a-TO entitled
"Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 20,
1972. An economic mission is presently in the field.
3         A sliver-shaped, coastal country located on the Gulf of Guinea
between Dahomey and Ghana, Togo's total land area of 56,000 km2 makes it the
smallest francophone nation in West Africa and about the same size as the
Benelux countries.   Its population - estimated at 2,000,000 -   is increasing
by 2.7 percent yearly.  Average population density in the country is 35 inhabi-
tants per square kilometer but settlement patterns fluctuate widely.   In large
parts of the country's northernmost Savanna region, for example, there are fewer
than 20 inhabitants per square kilometer. At the other extreme of the spectrum;,
population density peaks at over 200 per sq. km. in stretches of the hilly lanra Sèara
Kegion and of the coastal Maritime region where approximately a third of Pogo's
population is crowded into one-ninth of the nation's area.   Only about 15 percent
of Togc's people are urban dwellers and Lorrm, the capital, is the country's only
sizeable city.  Despite the fact that Togo is still overwhelmingly rural, -ts urban
population is growing at nearly twice the national clip and rural exodus leading to
urban urnemployment and overcrowding is becoming an increasingly important factor
in the country's economy.
Almost without let up, Togo's economy has maintained a moderate growth rate
since independence.  From 1966 to 1970, for example, GDP growth in real terms
averaged 5 percent yearly and the country's per capita income climbed to (YSE 40,
still a low figure but nearly 60 percent higher than in neighboring Dahomey.
There are indications, however, that the country's economic expansion. slowed
doon somewhat in 1971 and 1972 -   mainly because of a deterioration in Togo's
terms of trade.
5.        The sustained upswing in logo's economy has been due, in great part,
to a vigorous expansion in the country's commerce which, in turn, has been spurred
on by favorable world market conditions for two of Togo's principal exporis, coco,
and coffee. Given its low tariff structure, a legacy of trusteeship days, the
country has become an important regional commercial entrepot for both official
and unrecorded trade. Thus, between 1965 and 1970, Togolese exports increased by
22 percent yearly.  During this same period, imports - particularly of consumer
goods a high percentage of -which were subsequently re-exported - also rose
sharply.  International cocoa prices dropped temporarily after 1969 and Togolese
exports also leveled off. Economic growth in 1972 was, however, fueled by increased
construction activity in the public sector and by completion of a few industrial
projects.



-2-
6.        Not all sectors of the economr have benefited from the nation's years
of relative prosperity. VThjnile living concLitions for urban dwellers engaged in
comnerce, industry, construction arl the civil admini.tration improved signifi-
canKty, particularly in Lome, most of the country's rural population remained
largely unaffected by the modern society's economic expansion and continues to
live in poverty.   Growth in agriculture, which accounts for 42 percent of GDP and
is the source of livelihood for three quarters of Togo's population, has been
sluggish.  At present, most cultiva-tionl is by traditional methods and vields are
low.  Despite the important cornmercial si_nificance of cash crops such as cocoa
and coffee, only a relatively small number of farmers raise these crops and 75 percent
of production in the sector consists of food. crops much of which are consumed in the
countryside.
7.        The backwardness of Togo', rural econoasy and the gap in rural/urban
living standards is the most pressing problem facing the Togolese economy. Per
capita incomes in the nation's towms   average an estimated US9350 and are growing.
Meanwhile, farm incomes hover around IJS$7r overall ancd are considerably lower in
the conltry's poor northern region.   Unless the present trend towards growing
disparity between Togo's modern and rural societies is reversed, rural poverty
and exodus coupled with urban overcrowding and unemployment will be accentuated.
The Government is aware of the seriousness of the situation and has recently taken
steps towards mounting a rura:L development program aimed at improving living
conditions in the countryside and at increasing prod-ction of food crops as well
as important cash crops, e.g., cotton, cocoa and coffee.
8.        The scarcity of carefully prepared, suitable development projects has
been one of the principal obstacles to econornic progress in Togo.   For years, the
Government pursued a policy of technical self reliance and was reluctant to recruit
experienced expatriate personnel to provide technicaL assistance for project
preperation and other needs. More recently, however, Togolese officials have
reversed their stance vis-a-vis foreign technical assistance and have requested
TIfDP, the Bank Group and other aid donors to provide funds for much-needed pre-
investment studies and technical assistance.   The fruits of an expansion in this
forrm of aid should be forthcoming during the second half of the seventies as more
projects are identified and prepared     with the help of foreign technical
assistance - for eventual external financing.
9.        Togo's economic development has been sloweci down by the country's
education system which is based, as in other West African states, on a European
model poorly related to Togo's economic and social conditions0 Conscious of the
present system's shortcomings and anxious to improve and expand education oppor-
tunities in the cointry, Togolese au4thorities have attached a high priority to the
sect-or and are presently earmarking one sixth of budgetary outlays for education.
Fhurthermore, the Government has set up a National -teform Commission to introduce
a revised course OI studies in primary schools,   This Comaission only recently
began to taclcle the question of curriculum reform and extensive further work
will be needed toprepare    a comprehensive program of studie., which would be better
tailored to the country's need.s.



- 3   -
10.       Traditionally, the Togolese Government has followed prudent financial
policies leading to substantial budgetary savings and to a high level of external
reserves. Since 1968, however, there has been a relaxation of Government auste-
rity and current expenditures nave increased considerably, i.e., they rose by
20 percent a year during 1968-1971, mainly because of stepped up outlays for
personnel. This rise in current expenditures coupled with a leveling off of
current revenues due to a slowdown in exports have led to a tightening financial
situation although public savings were still substantial in 1972 and the level of
foreign reserves - about US038 million - is still enough to cover nearly five
months of Togo's imports. Unless the recent trend is reversed and the level of
public savings is raised, however, Togo's ability to contribute financially to
its own development in the future will be hampered. The Bank has, therefore,
urged Togolese officials to hold down new hirings pointing out that during the
next few years it should be possible for the Government to meet most new demands
for services by redeploying and more effectively using existing personnel.
11.       During the next few years, Togo's GDP is likely to grow at a real ra-te
of between h.5 and 5 percent yearly. Trade should continue to be among the most
dynamic sectors in the economy. The industrial sector should also experience
a healthy rate of expansion, particularly if the large CIMAO cement clinker plant
project discussed in Part II of this report is launched.- On the minus side of
the ledger, agricultural production will probably continue to lag well into the
second half of the seventies since the identification and preparation of develop-
ment projects in this sector has just begun and it will be some time before these
projects and programs become operational.
12.       In the longer run, Togo's development prospects are modest.   The
country's natural resources are limited and its small domestic market will tend
to restrict, as in the past, industrial growth. In order to realize Togo's full
potential, the Government will have to foster development of the country's di-
rectly productive sectors, particularly agriculture, while increasing efforts
aimed at regional economic cooperation and pushing through a program of much-
needed educational reform. The Government should also be encouraged to pursue
a policy of budgetary austerity so as to permit it to continue funding a signi-
ficant part of the countryts overall development effort. Finally, the Govern-
ment should expand and improve, as necessary, the existing transport infrastruc-
ture to facilitate both domestic and international traffic.
13.       From 1965 through 1970, 70 percent of Togolese public investment was
financed by foreign aid and total disbursements averaged USM11 million yearly.
France (FAC) was the single largest donor providing roughly a third of this aidi with
the European Economic Cammunity (FED) and Germany funding another 25 percent
each. The Bank Group and other U.N. agencies contributed about 15 percent of
the total aid package and the remainder was provided by other sources, e.g.,
the U.S. and Canada. Most of the foreign aid given Togo through 1970 was
earmarked for infrastructure development.



-'4 -
1i.       Foreign aid inflows are expected to average at least US$20 million per
annum through the next few years. Thereafter, fore:ign aid should grow steadily
as more projects are identified and prepared for external financing. As in the
past, foreign funding will continue to account for 60-70 percent of Togolese
public investment butincreasing amnounts of aid sholELd be earmarked for projects
in the agricultural sector and to finance technical assistance. While traditional
aid donors should continue to be active in Togo, the People's Republic of China
recently pledged to provide T'ogo with approximately US$I8 million in assistance.
It is still unclear when or how this aid will be made available but it appears
likely that the Chinese will focus on financing rural development projects and
that their aid will be in the form of 30-year.interest free credits with 15-year
grace periods.
15.       Aid to Togo has traditionally been provided on generous terms with
grants accounting for about 80 percent of the foreign assistance provided to
date. As of January 1, 1971, the country's external public debt amounted to
U4JJtOL) million and most of this was inc,urred at modest interest rates and with
repayment periods of more than ten years. By 1973, service on this debt will
reach an estimated U5$5 million or 6 percent of projected exports for thne year.
Given the nation's favorable reserve position, Togo should be able to service
this debt without difficulty.  In view of the country's poverty, difficulty in
mobilizing public savings and only fair prospects for GDP growth in the longer
-run, however, foreign aid donors should continue to provide financing on conces-
sionary teims.
PART TI - 3ANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
16.       The Bank Group's only lending operation in Togo to date was a Credit
for a Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 131, September 10, 1968, US$3.7 mil-
lion). As in many other African countries, road maintenance in Togo fell off
in the years following indeperndence due to the poor state of the country's
maintenance fleet and to the lack of adequate personnel and funds.  As a result,
tne condition of the national highway network suffered and long stretches of
road became virtually impassable, particularly during the rainy season. Credit
131 aimed at reversing this Situation. More specifically, project funds were
earmarked to finance a four year maintenance program which included the purchase
ot maintenance and shop equipment, the training of Department of Public Work
(DPW) staff and necessary technical assistance. Financing was also provided
under this Credit for preinvestment studies aimed at identifying road con-
struction, rehabilitation and improvement projects which might warrant Baik
Group financing in the future. A note on the execution of the Highway Maintenance
Project as well as a surTLmary statement of this Credit as of October 31, 1973, is
contained in Arnex II.
17.       aive years have elapsed since Credit 131 was made. During this period,
the 3ank CGroup was unable to :!end to Togo because of a scarcity of well prepared,
suitable projects and because of the country's ability to obtain grant financing
for most of these.  More recently, hrowever, the Government has stepped up its project
identification and preparation efforts - with the help of foreign technical assist-
ance as mentioned 4n paragraph eight - arid a number of potentially promising opera-
tions should be available for hank Group financing in the next few years.
1'.      Since agriculture accounts for )42 percent of Togo's GDP and is the source
of livelihood for three quarters o£ the country's population, Togo's rural develop-
ment is of the highest priorilj.  'ie expect, therefore, to seek the Executive



Directors' approval for the financing of a cocoa/coffee project in the Plateau
Region later this fiscal year as well as for an integrated rural development scheme for
the country's densely populated coastal region in FY76. Other aid donors such as
FAC (France) and FED have also been active in financing Togo's agricultural development.
19.       In an erfort to diversif; the nation's economy and to expand its
industrial base, the Togolese Government has requested Bank financing for the
US$80 million CIMAO cement clinker plant Project. This operation -    a regional
undertaking which would involve production of clinker for the cement market of
West Africa - is jointly sponsored by the Togolese and Ivorian Governments.
The Bank analyzed the project in 1970/71 but had reservations about C"IIAC's
high technical risk and marginal economic return. Since then, a number of
positive factors including, most noTably, the discovery of a large, high quality
limestone deposit have eliminated most of this undertaking's technical risk and
have improved CITAO's economic viability.   Consequently, the Bank has agreed to
reconsider the project and may be able to make a loan for CIviAO by FY75.
20.       Togo's economic development also calls for substantiel inves.ments in
transoortation, a sector which is essential to the country's agricultux'al develop-
ment and in ohich FAC, FED, KfW (Germany) and U3AID as well as the Association
have been active. In addition to the present project, we are considerin,g financincg
a Third Highway Project in FY76.
PART III - TRANSP3RT IN TOGO
21.       Togo's transport system is relatively simple.   It is basically geared
to meet the country's domestic transport needs altnough a small, but growing,
volume of international transit traffic also passes over it. Lome, the nationis
capital and economic center, has both a modern deep water port and an international
air terminal. It is linked to the rest of the country by a road network and a
railway serving tne soutnern coastal area and running far inland.
22.       Road transport is far and away the predominant mode in Togo, e.g., it
accounts for an estimated 90 percent of freight traffic. The nation's highway
system consists of approximately 7,000 km. of roads and tracks and is denses-t
in the South. Two thousand kilometers - a tnird of which are paved'- are clas-
sified as national (primary) roads and are administered, constructed and main-
tained by the Department of Public Works (DPW) in the Ministry of Transport,
Public Works, Mines and Telecommunications (MTPW). Regional districts denominated
"Circumscriptions" are responsible for the country's 5,000 km. of secondary roads,
most of which are poor quality earth roads and tracks. Togo's agricultural feeder
roads are under the auspices of the Ministry of Rural Economy's Regional Develop-
ment Agencies (SOR4Ds).
23.       The 680 km. road running the length of the country from Lom6 to the
border witn Upper Volta forms the backbone of Togots national hignway network
and is complemented by east-west ancillary roads.
24.       Togots transport infrastructure has grown rapidly as the result of
heavy investment in the sector. From 1966 to 1970, 40 percent of public invest-
ment was earmarked for transportation. During tne 1971-1975 period, the level
of spending on the sector is projected to remain high accounting for an estimated
32 percent of government investment outlays.



-6-
25.       Despite improvements in Togo's overall transport picture since 1965,
several problems still face the sector. The most important of these is the
deteriorating financial position of the Togolese Railroad (CFT) which is
increasingly in direct competition with highways.   The CFT's deficit totalled
about US$820,000 in 1972 and had to be covered by the Goverrnment. In an effort
to identify solutions for the railway problern, the Government has commisioned
a study to analyze road/rail transport in Togo. This study is now underway
witn German financing and snould be finalized soon. DuriIng the course of
negotiations, the Association received assurances that it would be given an
opportunity to review and coirrLnt on the study before the Government takes
any major decisions regarding the CFT.
26.       Highway planning in Togo is carried out by the Ministry of Planning
assisted by the MTPN. The country's highrwpy strategy is directed towards
completing the paving of the main north-south axis, reconstructing deteriorated
east-west roads, extending access to rural areas, and improving maintenance.
This is sound given the rising volume of road transport in Togo and the present
project is tailored to fit into this policy framework.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
2(.       The proposed project has evolved from studies financed under our 1968
Road Maintenance Credit and was appraised by a Bank mission in November/December,
1972. The mission's report (199 a-TO, dated November 12, 1973) entitled "Appraisal
of a Second iHighway Project" is beirng distributed separately; Annex III contains a
Credit and Project summary. Negotiation of the project took place from the 15th
through the 19th of October, 1973, and the Togolese delegation was headed by Mr. Alex
Mivedor, Minister of Transport, Public Works, Mines and Telecommunications.    It also
included Messrs. Bessi (National Investrnent Company, Dagadzi (Director of Public
Torks, MTPi), Eklu-Natey (Director of Planning), Etsi (Director of the Budget),
Kponton (Head of the Aoads Division, DPW) and Quashi (Attorney General).
28.       Description:  The project consists of the following elements with an
estimated cost, including taxes and duties, of US$12.5' million:
a)  rehabilitation of the Blitta-Sokode road (81 km.);
b) improvement of the Sokod6-Tchamba-Kambolh road (75 km.);
c)  construction of the Agou-Nuatja road (51 km.);
d) supervision of the civil works referred to in items (a),
(b) and (c);
e) extension of the ongoing maintenance program;
f) a survey of about 2,000 km. of unpaved roads and feasibility
and detailed engineering studies for the reconstruction of
the Tabligbo-Anecho road (4l km.); and
g) technical assistance to the Road Transport Service (STR).



- 7 -
Execution of the project will be the responsibility of the MTPW supported by
consultants for the technical assistance, supervision and preinvestment studies
mentioned above. The civil works associated with the project are scheduled to
get underway in early 1974 and will be completed two years later. They are
expected to generate between 800 and 1,000 jobs during this period.
29.       Reconstruction of the Blitta-Sokod6 road is this undertaking's single
largest component accounting for over 60 percent of its civil works costs and
for about half of the project's total costs. The road itself - an importan-t
part of Togo's main north-south axis - was constructed in 1958 to a paved, one
lane standard. Due to its generally low original design standards and to a
substantial growth of heavy traffic, however, the road has badly deteriorated.
Under this project, the Blitta-Sokod6 road would be widened to two lanes, its
pavement would be strengthened and about 35 percent of the stretch would be
realigned. BCEDM, a French consulting firm, prepared the feasibility and
detailed engineering studies for this road's rehabilitation.
30.       The Sokod6-Tchamba-Kambol6 road - the only transport link between
Togo's north-south axis and the agricultural region around Kambol6, near the
Dahomey border - would also be improved under this project. The existing
route consists of an earth road from Sokode to Tchamba and of a track from
Tchamba to Kambol6.  Both sections of the route frequently become impassable
during the rainy season thereby hindering the agricultural development of the
region served by the road. Under the proposed project, the Sokod6-Tchamba
section of the route (35 km.) would be upgraded to a two-lane gravel standard.
In addition, seven small bridges on the Tchamba-Kambol6 stretch would be re-
constructed and this 40 km. section of road would be widened to two lanes by
the DPW's betterment unit with the assistance of two pieces of earth moving
equipment and other road construction materials to be provided under this Credit.
The feasibility and detailed engineering studies for the Sokod6-Tchamba road
and for tne seven bridges referred to above were done by KEZ, a Canadian firm.
KEZ also prepared preliminary engineering for the Tchamba-Kambole section.
31.       Construction of a 51 km. two-lane, laterite road between Agou, in
the country's Plateau Region, and Nuatja, an agricultural marketing center in
south-central Togo, is also proposed under this project. The road would replace
16 km. of earth tracks and a 35 km. footpath which presently connect the towns.
Construction of this road would not only establish a transport link between Agou
and Nuatja but would also open up for agricultural development the sparsely
populated but agriculturally promising region between the towns. Diwi-Walter
a German consulting firm, prepared the studies for this part of the project.
32.       Under the proposed Credit, the Association would finance arn extension,
through 1976, of the ongoing maintenance program which is now slated to draw to
a close in late 1973. This extension would permit Togo to consolidate the
improvements in road maintenance realized under Credit 131. More specifically,
the project provides for technical assistance to the DPW and for the training
abroad - for 3-6 month periods - of four Togolese DPW staff members. The
Government intends to retain Louis Berger, an American consulting firm, for
the technical assistance referred to above. This same firm provided the DPW
with technical assistance under the Road Maintenance Credit and its selection
for this follow-up is acceptable to the Association.



33.       Funding is also provided under this project for a survey of about
2,000 km. of unpaved roads throughout Togo and for feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for the reccnstruction of the heavily-trafficked but
badly deteriorated 41 km. road from Tabligbo - the proposed site of the
CIMAO clinker plant - to Anecho, an important coastal town. The survey would
gauge the secondary road system's basic maintenance requirements and assess
the scope for road betterment works in coming years.
34.       Technical assistarnce to the STR is this project's final component.
The STR was established, within the M-inistry of Transport and Public Works,
in 1969 for the purpose of organizing, regulating and controlling road trans-
port in Togo. Its developmelt has been hampered, however, by its poor orga-
nizational structure and lack of qualified staff. The technical assistance
(24 man months) proposed under this Credit would aim at tackling these problems
and at strengthening the STR so as to enable it to introduce a data collecting
system for road transport and to more effectively promote road/rail coordination
and road transport in Togo.
35.       Costs and financing:  The following table gives a breakdown of the costs
-  in thousands of US dollars and including taxes and duties -   associated with
the project:
Local       Foreig        Total
Rehabilitation of the Blitta-Sokode Road
(81 km.)                                       1,738        3,238        4,976
Improvement of Sokode-Tchamba-Kambole
road (75 km.) including the cost of
road construction equipment and
materials to be provided to the DPW's
betterment unit for this purpose                 643:       1,152        1,795
Construction of Agou-Nuatja Road (51 km.)          491          914        i,4o5
Supervision of Civil Works                          8oL         705          786
Technical Assistance                                62          691          753
Preinvestment Studies                               38          357          395
Contingencies                                      747        1,643        2,390
Total        3,j800       8,700        12,500
The proposed Credit would cover this project's foreigi exchange component, equi-
valent to 70 perceent of total costs, and about 85 percent of its net of taxes and
duties cost.  The Government would finance all this operation's local costs of
US$3.8 million, US$2 million of which would be taxes and duties.
36.       Procurement and DisIursements:   The civil works proposed on the Blitta-
Sokod&, Agou-Nuatja and Sokod6-Tchamba roads as well as the reconstruction of the
seven bridges on the Tchamba-Kambol6 route will be carried out as separate items
under unit price contracts after international competitive bidding and in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines.  Improvement of the Tchamba-Kambole road



-9-
will be carried out through force account by the DPW's betterment unit because
the size of this part of the project is small, the works envisaged are simple
and they will be engineered in detail only during the process of improvement.
Furthermore, improvement of this 40 km. section will provide the road better-
ment unit with an opportunity to build up its capacity and train its personnel
- a useful development in light of the future road betterment program expected
to result from the survey of unpaved roads also included in the proposed project.
The earth moving equipment to be provided the DPW under this Credit is expected
to cost about US$120,000 and will be procured after competitive bidding advertised
locally and with due regard to the need for standardization. Because of the
small amounts involved - US$190,000 in foreign costs - the fuel, spare
parts, culverts and other construction materials required for improvement of
the Tchamba-Kambol6 road will be procured by the DPW in accordance with its
normal procedures which involve calling for price quotations.
37.       Disbursements under the proposed Credit would cover:  i) 65 percent
of payments made to contractors for civil works on the Blitta-Soko', Agou-
Nuatja and Sokod6-Tchamba roads and for reconstruction of the seven bridges on
the Tchanba-Kambole road; ii) 100 percent of the foreign exchange component of
the cost of earth moving equipment; iii) the equivalent of US$4,750 per km. or
the Tchamba-Kambo16 road representing the foreign exchange component and abou`
55 percent of the total direct cost of this improvement, net of equipment
depreciation. Disbursements for this part of the project would be made on the
basis of certificates of completion to be issued as individual sections of the
road are improved; iv) 90 percent of payments made to consultants for technical
assistance to the DFW and STR, for supervision of civil works and for the pre--
investment studies and unpaved roads survey called for under this project; and
v) the total cost of overseas training for Togolese DPW personnel.
36.       Rate of Return: Based on an analysis of benefits to domestic road
users only, rehabilitation of the Blitta-Sokod6 road is expected to yield an
economic rate of return of 16 percent. Improvement of the Sokod6-Tchamba and
Tchamba-Kambole roads snould result in economic returns of over 13 and about
16 percent, respectively. Because of the uncertainties involved in gauging
the impact of a road which is expected to open up a new area, the forecasted
economic return of the Agou-Nuatja road ranges from 6 to 19 percent but our
best estimate is that the return will exceed 10 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Dphomey and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the 4sso-
ciation and the draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit,
are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.



- 1.0 -
40.       The Credit Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of recent
agreements used for highway projects and contains a covenant committing the
Government to consult with the Association on the economic justification of
any major investment on the CFT before the carrying out of any such investment.
41.       I am satisfied tnat the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
oI Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that tne Executive Directors approve tne proposed Credit.

Financing Plan:
The proposed Credit would cover this project's foreign exchange
component, 70 percent, and about 85 percen-t of its total - net of
taxes and duties - cost. The Government would finance all this
operation's local costs of US'3.8 million, US$2 million of which
would be taxes and duties.
Estimated Disbursements:
Cumul-ative
Year                 Disbursements
June 30, 1974                   30o
June 30, 1975                 4,ooo
June 30, 1976                 7,000
June 30, 1977                 8,700
Procurement Arrangements:
The civil works proposed on the Blitta-Sokod6, Agou-Nuatja
and Sokode-Tchamba roads as well as the reconstruction of the seven
bridges on the Tchanba-Kambole route will be carried out as separate
items under unit price contracts after international competitive
bidding and in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Improvement
of the Tchamba-Kambole road will be carried out through force account
by the DPW's bettenrent unit.
Consultants:
Contract negotiations are now underway with consultants selected
by the Government in agreement with the Association.   For those items
which are an extension of work under the First ;Highway Project, due
regard has been given to the need for continuity in consulting services.
Thus, Louis Berger (U.S.) will continue execution of the maintenance
program and BCEOM (France) and Diwi-Walter (Germany) will supervise this
project's road. construction works. In addition, the Government is
negotiating with BCEOM to undertake the survey of 2,000 km of unpaved
roads and with Gendron & Lefebvre (Canada) to carry out the engineering
studies l.or the Tabligbo-Anecho road.
G:ate of iteturn:
Based on an enalysis of benefits to domestic road users only,
rehabilitation of the Blitta-Sokod6 road is expected to yield an
economic rate of return of 16 percent. Improvement of the Sokode-
Tchamba and TchaTnbe-KarbolT roads should result in economic returns
of over 13 and about 16 percent, respectively. Because of the uncer-
ta nte_s involved in gauging the impact of a road which is expected to
open up a new area, the forecasted economic return of the Agou-Nuatja
road ranges fCrom 6 1;e 19 oercena; but our best estimate is that the
retulrn wrill exceed 10 percent.
