The project\n            components are five. The land allocation and development or\n            rehabilitation component comprises a series of activities\n            designed to establish very poor landless families within the\n            target communities in sustainable new farming operations.\n            Its subcomponents are (a) assigning secure title for lands\n            to be developed or rehabilitated to largely dispossessed\n            families; (b) developing and rehabilitating irrigated land,\n            and setting up or reinforcing water monitoring; and (c)\n            farmer services, including training and extension (using\n            contract professionals), help to access credit for equipment\n            and inputs, and material support to farm establishment. The\n            off-farm income development component comprises three sets\n            of activities to assist poor people in setting up or\n            developing very small or small businesses, or in acquiring\n            technical skills training needed to find remunerative\n            employment:  a) training and equipping villagers,\n            particularly women, to become animal health providers; b)\n            training and equipping new entrants to the fisheries\n            business on the south coast; and c) promoting other\n            revenue-earning services and micro-enterprises. The economic\n            and social development component, which targets communities,\n            comprises two sets of activities: a) development of\n            community management skills and institutions by providing\n            training and logistical support to community organizations;\n            and b) setting up a community development fund that finances\n            small grants for community projects on a cost-sharing basis.\n            The fourth component provides technical assistance and\n            training to help prepare future projects in the sector. The\n            fifth component consists of operating the Project Management\n            Unit, which finances technical assistance, project staff,\n            vehicles, office equipment, office rental, and operating costs."}, "docdt": "1997-09-18T00:00:00Z"}
