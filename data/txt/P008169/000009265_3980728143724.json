(PERL) Project for Uruguay were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: a) in countries like Uruguay, a broad\n            political consensus is also needed in addition to the\n            political commitment of the Borrower. Government commitment\n            clearly was present in the case of PERL, but it was not\n            enough. This illustrates one of the reasons that structural\n            reform in the past in Uruguay has been slower than in many\n            other Latin American countries involving contentious\n            changes. In addition, the commitment to public enterprises\n            (PE) reform has particularly to be present in the management\n            of PEs being targeted for restructuring or privatization; b)\n            Borrowers and the Bank tend to over estimate the capacity to\n            absorb technical assistance and this appears to have been\n            the case with PERL. Even in the context of a project with a\n            sound administrative structure, there is frequently limited\n            capacity, for example, to hire all the service providers\n            required for a large list of project components, especially\n            with a rigorous implementation program plan; and c) this\n            project's experience jibes with the indications from\n            other Bank activities in Uruguay that the process of making\n            sensitive policy changes in countries which depends on the\n            attainment of broad consensus can be exceedingly slow paced,\n            and may not be greatly influenced by the choice of lending instruments."}, "docdt": "1998-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
