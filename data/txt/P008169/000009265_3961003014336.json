a\n            transparent and competitive process, focusing on\n            telecommunications, transport, and power. In the\n            telecommunications sector the project will prepare and\n            diagnose a strategic plan for the restructuring of the\n            sector and design a regulatory framework for\n            telecommunications and set-up a regulatory entity as well as\n            privatize the telecommunications enterprise. In the\n            transport sector the project will review and revise the\n            Aviation Code to facilitate private sector participation and\n            it will audit and privatize the State Aviation Company. The\n            project will also implement a new regulatory framework for\n            ports, including implementation of the new organization of\n            the National Port Entity, develop operational methods and\n            procedures for the port, including coordination with private\n            operators. In the power sector the project will develop a\n            regulatory framework to allow private operators within the\n            national power system and establish a regulatory commission\n            for power, also the project will study privatization options\n            and subsequent implementation strategy for the State Power\n            Entity's selected generation plants. The project will\n            also provide assistance for reforming the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, preparing a diagnosis of the State Petroleum,\n            Alcohol and Cement Entity's cement and alcohol plants,\n            and peripheral privatizations of public entities such as\n            local airports and ambulance services."}, "docdt": "1992-08-11T00:00:00Z"}
