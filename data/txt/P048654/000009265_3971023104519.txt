Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project seeks to assist Guatemala in raising its revenue perfonnance above historically low rates (averaging only between 6 and
9 percent of GDP over the last decade):
(i) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tax and customs administration through strengthening collection, audit, and
enforcement procedures; (ii) increase tax revenues; and (iii) achieving stronger revenue performance is critical in order for
Guatemala to increase social sector spending, meet basic infrastructure needs, and implement the December 1996 Peace Accords
between the Government and the Union Revolucionaria Nacional de Guatemala (URNG), which ended thirty years of civil war.
Key to the strategy will be the creation of a new institution for internal revenue and customs with operational, financial, and human
rcsources management; the strengthening of tax collection and auditing processes; the establishment of taxpayer assistance services;
the elimination of loopholes in the law and simplification of norms and procedures; and the introduction of more rigorous
cnforcement mechanisms.

(US$M)
1. Creation of a Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT): The component  Institution         6.5           17
would support the design and development of an operational and financial       building
independent institution responsible for national internal and customs revenue
collection. The assistance would help develop the new organizational structure and
management systems, and to address training and professional development needs.
2. Facilitating Taxpayers' Compliance; This component would help identify and
operationalize measures to improve voluntary taxpayer compliance through review  Institution     11.7          31
and simplification of procedures and modernization of information technology   building
including tax collection through the banking system; creation of a Special Taxpayers
Unit to give priority attention and service to the needs of taxpayers providing the
bulk of tax revenues; and by establishing a network of taxpayer services (assistance
and grievances) offices to give taxpayers access to recourse and help them
understand, and comply with, the tax code.
3. Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: This component would finance the
carrying out of the review of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to tax  Institution   10.4         27
administration and the institutional structures to improve tax collection enforcement.  building
A new Audit Department would consolidate all audit and investigation expertise
within the SAT, with updated information technology and analytical tools to
facilitate data cross-checking, logistical support, and strengthened legal power to
investigate tax evasion. Particular attention would be given to training.
4. Social Communications: This component would help secure citizen
understanding for the tax administration reforms by financing a social       Institution         4.8           13
communication campaign to inform and educate the public about the benefits of an  building
independent and professionalized tax collection authority, on changes in the tax law,
compliance and enforcement mechanisms, and taxpayer services and rights. The
component would also provide feedback to the Government on tax administration
issues, as well as promote internal change management within the SAT and the
goals of increased transparency and accountability.
5. Project Coordination: Project coordination would be the responsibility of a unit
within the Superintendent of Tax Administration. The unit would support and    Project           4.6          12
monitor progress of the project, oversee contract issuance and completion, track  management
disbursements, prepare semi-annual reports, contract project audits, and liaise with
the Bank's supervision missions.

3. Benefits and target population:
If the outputs of the project are correctly utilized and implemented, then the major benefits from the project would be: (i) qualitative
improvements in tax administration in terms of effectiveness, transparency, and assistance to taxpayers; (ii) measurable
improvement in monitoring and control (financial and physical) of imports; and (iii) increased tax revenues. The target population
would be tax administration agencies and taxpayers.
4.Institutional and impl entation arr angements:- --------------..........
Implementation period: 1997-2001
Executing agencies: The project will be executed by the new Superintendency of Tax Administration, under a Subsidiary Agreement
to be entered into between the Borrower and the SAT. Such Agreement is a condition of effectiveness.
Project coordination: A project coordination unit (PCU) will be created within the SAT with primary responsibility for project
implementation. The creation and staffing of such PCU is a condition of effectiveness.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements: Project records and accounts would be maintained by the PCU to
reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources, and expenditures for each project activity. The
accounts will be consolidated annually into financial statements for the project as a whole. Supporting documentation will be made
available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs), all records providing evidence of such expenditures will be retained by the PCU until at least one year after the
Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account or payment out of the
Special Account is made, whichever is later. Project records amd accounts, including the Special Account and SOEs, will be audited
annually in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of
reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank. The Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing Handbook
(FARAH) published in January 1995 would be used by the auditors in accordance with the Bank's auditing guidelines. Audit reports
will be furnished to the Bank within four months after the close of the Government's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring of project execution will be undertaken by the PCU. The Bank will
participate in monitoring project implementation through periodic supervision missions. The PCU will provide to the Bank an
annual working plan not later than December 31 of each year, starting 1998. The PCU will provide to the Bank the 1998 plan as a
condition of effectiveness. Annual reviews of the project will be carry out not later than March 31 of each year, starting in 1999. A
mid-term review conducted by March 2000 to assess progress in meeting agreed targets and to identify additional technical support
as needed. Semi-annual progress reports will be presented to the Bank no later than 30 days after the conclusion of each calendar
semester, starting 1998.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project                             Document number and date of latest CAS
The CAS emphasizes the need to increase public savings and improve the public  discussion: Report No. 1445 1-GU, May 30,
sector's extremely limited service delivery capability, which is linked to a historically 1995
weak institutional capacity. Two recent ESW reports (a CEM and a PIR) underscore
that a considerably greater domestic revenue effort is required to maintain
macroeconomic stability and promote faster growth. Furthermore, enhancing
Guatemala revenue performance is critical for sucessful implementation of the
approved Peace Accord; these accords include specific targets for revenues, and the
Bank's CAS and assistance strategies of most major donors in Guatemala give high
priority to support for the peace process. By strengthening tax administration, the
project would improve revenue performance and public savings, and contribute to
more sustainable public investment and social sector expenditures.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Issues
Despite the approval of several comprehensive tax reforms and externally supported attempts at tax administration and customs
modernization in the last decade, Guatemala's tax revenue ratio is among the lowest in Latin America. Revenues have averaged
between 6 and 9 percent of GDP over the last decade and registered 8.5 percent in 1996 reflecting in part the impact of a temporary
one year tax on gross earnings. These low levels severely constrain public investment and social sector spending with a significant
impact on poverty alleviation. They would also preclude successful implementation of the December 1996 Peace Accord. The wide
annual variation in tax collection has threatened macroeconomic performance and subjected public investment (and external
financing) to disruptive cycles of stop-go spending.
Revenue collection reflects both the structure of the tax system and deficiencies in tax administration. VAT rates are the lowest in
Latin America (10 percent), with numerous exemptions and loopholes. Personal income is taxed at rates of 15, 20, and 25 percent.
In addition there are high thresholds for tax liability, deductions for VAT payments, exclusion of annual bonuses and pensions,
limited withholding for wage earners and no withholding or periodic payments during the tax year by professionals or the self-
employed. In fact corporate and personal income taxes represented less than 20 percent of total collections in 1996, with the VAT
accounting for 36 percent and import duties 24 percent of revenues, respectively. Small duties on tobacco, alcohol, stamps, and
inheritance collect little.
Tax evasion is endemic in Guatemala. Previous reform efforts have made some progress, mainly in decentralization and generation
of up-to-date tax information systems and databases, but many of the long-standing deficiencies in tax administration have not been
rectified. These shortcomings include: (i) poor identification of non-filers and stop-filers; (ii) poor audit program design,
implementation, and sequential follow-up; (iii) poor use of databases for cross checking; (iv) low quality and quantity of tax auditors;
(v) lack of a career-path for employees, including appropriate compensation and personnel policies; (vi) lax transit and
audit/inspection controls in customs; and (vii) a tax code with poorly defined and weak penalties and lengthy business liquidation
procedures for tax defaulting businesses.
The Customs Service in particular has suffered from profound institutional weaknesses related to poor management, weak human
resources, low pay, lack of adequate systems of financial and physical control, unduly bureaucratic processes with excessive scope for
discretionality by individual staff, deteriorating physical infrastructure, lack of transparency in the collection of import duties, and
resistance to change. Last year the Government uncovered a major corruption ring within Customs accused of diverting massive
amounts of revenues. The Governmuent has intervened in Customs, but has determined that only a substantial program of
institutional reform can lead to long-term improvements.
Government Strategy
The authorities have initiated an ambitious program of public sector reform to address the national goals of poverty alleviation and
the consolidation of peace after years of guerrilla warfare. Programs to reform the civil service, restructure ministries, reform the
administration ofjustice, modernize government financial management, and increase the role of the private sector in the provision of
infrastructure services are in preparation or execution. Under the terms of the recently signed Peace Accords the Government has
undertaken to raise tax revenue to 10 percent of GDP in 1998 and 11.4 percent in 1999, seeing increased revenue as necessary to
provide a solid basis for priority spending. Reform of tax administration is a key element in the Government's strategy for
increasing tax revenue as well as reducing economic distortions and promoting the transparency of tax and customs collections.
Following years of marginally successful efforts to strengthen the existing tax administration regime, the Government has decided to
create an autonomous Superintendency of Tax Administration with a new organizational structure and functional relationships.
Successful creation and functioning of the SAT under modern operating procedures and performance-based personnel management
policies, coupled with priority measures to improve voluntary compliance, reduce evasion, and strengthen taxpayer services are
expected to permit an increase in the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of tax administration. In adopting this institutional
strategy, the Government has paid closed attention to cross country experience in Latin America, and has consulted a wide range of
national and international specialists.
Given the urgent need to increase tax collections (and to meet agreements under the Peace Accords) the Government intends to
launch the SAT in early 1998. In the meantime it would utilize project funds (including some on a retroactive basis) to finalize the
design of the organization as well as initiate the project's tax administration strengthening initiatives. The Government has
submitted a draft legislation to the Congress to create the SAT and expect to present the Bank loan for congressional approval
within next 4 months. The authorizing draft legislation, which would create an autonomous institution, requires a two-thirds
majority votes in Congress. To secure the needed congressional action the Government is conducting a public education effort

including national workshops involving all political parties lnd representatives of civil society, high profile visits by supportive
international experts and officials including the IMF Managing Director and European Union Commissioner, and lobbying of key
business groups. The Government fully anticipates passage of this legislation, which is a condition of loan effectiveness. To
complement the SAT, the Government in late 1996 secured passage of Tax Code reform legislation, which it believes will provide an
improved scope to improve tax collection under a strengthened tax administration regime.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project would support the strategy of the Government for a comprehensive reform of the tax administration system.
The creation of the SAT plus substantive tax administration initiatives would seek to address the major shortcomings in tax
administration by expanding the tax base, modernizing collection and audit procedures, fostering voluntary compliance, and
strengthening the institutional and legal framework for tax enforcement. Priorities in the first year of the project would include
strengthening of the SAT capacity and its operating systems, selection and training of highly qualified staff, and substantive focus on
the needs of special taxpa.yers, improving the taxpayer registry, and strengthening tax collection, Customs, and audit processes.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection;
The main strategic choice made by the Government was to eschew incremental measures to strengthen tax administration in favor of
a more fundamental and faster-paced change strategy. This reflected widespread demand for basic reform, the critical need to
increase revenues on a sustained basis (in part to meet the terms of the recently signed Peace Accords), serious doubts that current
personnel and compensation policies and practices would permit meaningful improvements in tax collection, and the less-than-
satisfactory results of previous remedial efforts A second strategic choice involved combining responsibility for tax and customs
administration under a single entity, rather than in separate institutions, which would allow the reduction of administrative
overheads, decreasing at the same time the potential for level of corruption,and increasing public sector control over evadors through
the use of a common information system and internal cross-<,hecks.

The Government anticipates receiving additional support for its tax administration effort. In June 1997 it signed a letter of intent
with the European Union which tentatively identified tax administration reform as a priority area for future European Union support,
within a proposed package of total assistance aggregating ECU 200 million over 4 years. The Government also anticipates that the
USAID will increase its current program of support for tax and customs administration.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Lessons learned from previous tax administration projects an,d reflected in the project concern the need to: (i) ensure commitment
and ownership of the overall reform through extensive and deep dialogue with the authorities in all aspects of project design and
implementation, plus the presentation of the project to a wide audience of senior Executive Branch and Congressional leaders, civil
society, and key staff to encourage "buy-ine and commitment; (ii) creation of an experienced and highly-skilled project coordination
unit; (iii) ensure appropriate emphasis on organization, business processes, human resource selection, pay, and training issues and
avoidance of an overemphasis on information technology. The project would finance major substantive efforts to promote tax
compliance both through the provision of improved services, as well as the implementation of a strengthened audit effort to raise the
perceived risk of detection of non-compliance.

Country: Guatemala                                                               Project Title: Tax Administration Technical Assistance Loan
The project has identified several additional best practices from the Bank's global experience including: (i) organization of tax
administration based on function rather than by tax; (ii) downward delegation of authority complemented by training and improved
management information systems; (iii) priority attention to the review and strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework; (iv)
programming of a social communications campaign to educate taxpayers on their rights and obligations; and (v) reliance on a
Unified Taxpayer Registry to monitor tax compliance and establish a single taxpayer account.
In addition, the project will benefit from lessons learned in previous Technical Assistance operations including: (i) specific yet
flexible action plans would be developed for each component that focus on outputs, and define evaluation criteria and performance
indicators; and (ii) criteria would be established to ensure careful project supervision, especially with respect to procurement and
supervision of consultants, so as to prevent inadequate budget control and weak management.
Lessons learned from other operations in Guatemala include: (i) the need for close project supervision which will be facilitated in
this case by close overlap with the integrated financial management project, the recent opening of a Resident Mission, and frequent
project reviews linked to preparation of related public sector management operations; (ii) the need to assure adequate counterpart
funding, which should be facilitated in time by successful implementation of the tax administration reforms supported by the project;
and (iii) the need for greater permanency in counterpart staff, which will be encouraged by the Bank as a critical issue in its project
supervision.
The satisfactory experience heretofore with the Integrated Financial Management project (GU-3 895), declared effective in March
1996, and being implemented by the Ministry of Finance, gives.a level of assurance regarding the commitment and ability of that
Ministry to help implement the proposed project in a timely and successful manner.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The strength of the Govermment's commitment to improved tax and customs administration is shown by: (i) submission to Congress
of the far reaching SAT draft legislation; (ii) its initiation of an education campaign to increase public understanding of the need for
tax administration reform; (iii) passage in late 1996 of reforms to the Tax Code, including strengthened enforcement measures
against tax evasion; (iv) its takeover of the Customs Service and aggressive prosecution of corruption within Customs; and (v) recent
passage of reforms to the VAT and income tax laws aimed at expanding the tax base. The Government has also moved in other
areas of public sector modernization, including forceful implementation of the integrated financial management project; advances in
incorporating the private sector in the provision of infrastructure (supported by a recently approved Bank loan); presentation to
Congress of several key modernization bills relating to the Comptroller General, Budget, Probity, Civil Service, Financial
Management, Executive Branch Organization, and Procurement; and significant and highly visible measures to attack corruption
among the police and army.

12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank support would provide critically needed and timely financing; supply high-quality technical advice based on worldwide and
regional experience in tax administration; convey credibility and transparency to the reform effort; and promote efficient and
effective use of the resources supporting the Government's program.

Impact]
Fiscal impact:
The project is expected to have a positive fiscal impact resulting from administrative reforms aimed at improving effectiveness in tax
collection and auditing, and by increasing the tax base through improved mechanisms in registry and taxpayer services. While some
improvements in revenue performance may be expected from the start up of the project in 1998, it is conservatively estimated that
the reforms will result in a permanent increase in annual tax revenues of about 0.9 percent of GDP from the year 2000 onwards.

15. Technical Assessment: Although the tasks to be undertaken under this program are demanding, they are feasible for a country
such as Guatemala, assuming appropriate leadership and commitment. Substantial input from international consultants with
experience in tax administration reformn will be required. At the same time, the appointment of coordinators for each area being
reforned from the local counterpart team, plus selected use of national consultants, should ensure that there is suficient local
participation and transfer of knowledge.

16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: The SAT. The Ministry of Finance is one of the institutionally stronger ministries within the
Government. Top management and most top career staff are professional and motivated. The SAT is expected to draw upon some
human resources from the Ministry as well as to attract highly q[ualified and motivated new staff, including most of the SAT
management team.
b. Project management: The Project Coordination Unit is now being constituted and would be directed by a permanent project
director. Several key administrative staff have been appointed. A condition of effectiveness is that the PCU be appropriately staffed
with qualified personnel in key positions.

20. Sustainability:
The project is expected to have a lasting impact on the financial base of Guatemala's public sector. By supporting a comprehensive
reform in the modality of tax and customs administration in conjunction with improved enforcement, the project should help the
Government establish a sustainably higher, and more predictable, level of revenues. The project's emphasis on creating appropriate
incentives for tax payment should lead to increased resources to finance public investment and social sector spending, creating
constituencies for more vigorous enforcement of tax collection, help increase the credibility of the public sector in general, and
establish benchmarks for tax collection.

Guatemala Tax Administration TAL
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Creation of the Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT)
US $4.9 million
This component would support: the creation and implementation of the regulatory framework for the SAT; the detailed organization
design of the new institution, including the establishment of the SAT's financial and management information systems; the
development of a human resources policy, including the selection and priority training of new personnel, and creation of a new
institutional culture. The development of this component is based on various diagnoses of the Guatemalan tax and customs
administration system completed between 1994 and 1996. These assessments have identified profound weaknesses in several areas:
i) The organization of the separate internal and external revenue services is unduly complex, reflecting a confusing structure based
on functions (collection and audit) and on taxes (separate units for income and VAT taxes). There is no separation between
planning and operations. In Customs, management is especially weak and there are no procedural manuals nor officially-sanctioned
work processes. There is little coordination within or between the two services, contributing, along with poor coordination with the
Attorney General's Office, to a poor record of successful tax fraud investigation and prosecution. There is inadequate attention
provided to large taxpayers, and the effectiveness of the tax collection program using the banking system is limited by its high cost,
the rudimentary processing of tax forms, and slowness of payrments forwarded to the Government.
ii) Human resources policies, training, and compensation levels seriously hinder productivity. Only 11 percent and 57 percent of
staff have university and secondary level degrees, respectively, in the Department of Internal Revenue, while less than 20 percent of
Customs officers have completed high school. Pay is not competitive, there is no process of selective recruitment or promotion based
on merit, and there is no routinely functioning training program. The Government and public perceive widespread corruption in tax
administration.
iiij Administrative budgets are inadequate, with many Customs posts lacking electricity or telecommunications capabilities,
subsistence payments for auditors traveling outside the capital amount are grossly inadequate even if functioning vehicles can be
secured, and the ability of the Government to successful investigate sophisticated taxpayers is limited.
Previous attempts at strengthening tax administration have had limited success due to the fundamental problems remaining in
organization and human resource management Therefore, after reviewing cross-country experience, the Government has decided to
create a new structure that can function under modem operating procedures and performance-based personnel management policies.
The SAT would have autonomy in pay and personnel practices designed to attract and retain competent and honest staff. It would be
governed by a Board of Directors. This oversight body is intended to help bring credibility to the Superintendency, supporting the
Government's intent to establish a politically neutral and professional tax administration regime.
This component will provide technical assistance, goods (including information technology), and training to complete the design and
successfully launch the new Superintendency. Sub-components would include three areas:
i) Legal Framework- Technical assistance to prepare the intemal regulations and necessary ancillary legal provisions regarding: (i)
SAT management; (ii) regulations of the Board of Directors; (iii) pay and human resources policies; (iv) procurement and contracts;
and (v) financial administration of the SAT.
ii) Institutional Development- Technical assistance and information technology for the detailed design and establishment of the
organization, including: (i) its institutional structure and funclion aimed at the establishment of clear lines of authority and reporting
for functional and regional units, separation of units for planning and operations, and appropriate coordination amongst all units; (ii)
analysis and description of all job positions and development of a detailed position manual; (iii) establishment of a procurement and
contracting system assuring the proper procurement, maintenumce, and inventory management of goods; and (iv) establishment of a
modem budget and accounting system (including information technology) linked to the Integrated Financial Management System
being developed within the government, to include appropriately designed and monitored performance indicators as well as internal
audit and control systems.

iii) Human Resources Development- Technical assistance and training for the creation of a modem human resources system through:
(i) the design and implementation of a new personnel regime and procedures (including sub-contracting capacity); (ii) development
of a personnel data base; (iii) survey of compensation levels in the market and creation of a new competitive salary structure and
capacity to adjust salaries and benefits as appropriate; and (iv) development of a personnel evaluation system to serve as the basis for
recruitment, promotion, training, and redundancy. This sub-component also includes support for contracting of a private firm to
assist in the design and execution of a personnel selection process through performance testing and personnel screening, with the
view of launching the SAT with highly qualified and professionally motivated staff. This selection process will be open to all
existing staff of the Internal Revenue and Customs Services. This sub-component also includes resources for priority training needs
of new staff in order to minimize the disruption in tax collection as well as lend support for change management and efforts to create
a new service oriented culture within the organization.
Project Component 2 - Facilitating Taxpayer Compliance
US $6.9 million
This component would support a major effort to improve voluntary taxpayer compliance with tax obligations through: (i)
simplification of processes and modernization of information technology systems with the goal of increasing the speed and accuracy
of tax collection as well as expansion of tax filing; (ii) creation of a Special Taxpayers Unit to provide increased attention and service
to large taxpayers; and (iii) establishing Customer Service Units to assist taxpayers in fulfilling their tax obligations. Sub-
components would include three areas:
(i) Process Reengineering- Technical assistance, information technology, and training to design and support implementation of
assessments and reengineering of at least five key processes affecting both internal and external revenues with the aim of improving
results (speed, efficiency, and effectiveness), transparency (through appropriate controls and supervision), and service to the taxpayer
(simplification of processes and equity). This sub-component would involve the analysis of business processes currently in use, the
development of improved processes and procedures, the planning and implementation of changes required linked to information
technology investments, and monitoring performance under the reformulated processes and procedures to support their continued
improvement. In Customs: (i) the Government has initiated a process of "self-declaration" designed to substantially reduce
discretionality by Customs officers, remove duty collection as a responsibility of those officials, and delegate to import agents and
importers the responsibility to value imports, subject to random checks generated by pre-selected criteria identified in individual
cases by a centrally programmed information technology system. This process will be reviewed and strengthened under the project,
as well as processes relating to (ii) the transit and warehousing of imports; and (iii) the monitoring of exports (especially from
exporters benefiting from special import concessions). The Government has identified two priority processes in Internal Revenue to
be supported by this sub-component, including: (iv) the design and implementation of a revised (and renegotiated) system of tax
collection through the banking system requiring preliminary processing of tax forms, identification of payments linked to individual
taxpayers, and timely forwarding of payments to the Government; and (v) the tax appeals process. Other initiatives to promote
collection to be supported by this sub-component include: the review, strengthening, and extension of the Unified Taxpayer Registry
program, which today is considered to comprise grossly outdated information covering only a small percentage of the tax base.
(ii) Unit for Attention to Special Taxpayers- Technical assistance to design and support establishment of a unit to give priority
attention and support to around 500 taxpayers who account for about 65 percent of tax revenue. The unit would provide validation
of the information received at the time of declaring and paying taxes, assist in the detection and follow-up of taxpayers' omissions
immediately after tax due dates, and provide timely taxpayer services and advice to these clients.
(iii) Taxpayer Services- Technical assistance, information technology, and training to develop a national program to disseminate
information on various basic aspects of tax responsibilities that all taxpayers need to know. It would aim to minimize the time each
taxpayer spends filling out tax forms, to answer questions relative to any new procedures under the SAT, and reduce the costs of
voluntary compliance. Additionally, taxpayers would have access to expert advice in an environment of confidentiality. An
information system would also be set up to resolve questions by telephone or through other modes of communication to reduce the
work load on local taxpayer walk-in service centers. An associated activity would be conducting customer surveys as a mechanism
to improve taxpayer services.
Project Component 3 - Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms

US $7.2 million
This component would support a critically important effort, complementary to the program to improve voluntary tax compliance, by
creating a new Audit Department designed to significantly increase the Government's tax audit capacity and to link information
obtained from both Internal Revenue and Customs. Over the life of the project it would involve: (i) review of the legal framework in
order to strengthen its application in the areas of investigation and audit, identification and collection of tax arrears, and application
of sanctions; (ii) strengthening of the tax auditing program; (iii) modernization of audit information systems; and (iv) improvement
of human and physical resources. Sub-components include four areas:
(i) Review of the Legal Framework- Technical assistance for the review of existing laws and regulations and their applications and
possible revision, as appropriate, in the areas of: (i) access 1to third party information; (ii) restrictions on Government access to
information held by other Government agencies; (iii) ability to obtain and utilize information from taxpayers relating to their tax
obligations; (iv) ability to obtain and utilize accounting, inventory, and other taxpayer documents to support audits; (v) to seize
information during investigation of commercial establishments; (vi) power to require taxpayers and third parties to provide
declarations and evidence to courts; (vii) eliminating the ceiling on fines at 20 percent of the tax; (viii) elimination of the
requirement of three violations for the same fraud prior to temporary closure of a commercial establishment; (ix) reduction in the
number of appeals; (x) reduction in processing steps; (xi) elimrnination of the primary role of the Attorney General's Office in the
prosecution of tax fraud cases; (xii) official stamping of invoices before their distribution to commercial establishments; (xiii)
initiation of partial payments in the event of tax fraud appeal; and (xiv) restrictions on access to judicial injunctions after losing tax
case appeals, among others.
(ii) Strengthening Tax Audit- Technical assistance, information technology, and training to develop and implement: (i) procedures
for the selection, programming, and execution of audit cases to be supported by data from within and outside the SAT; (ii)
procedures for the supervision and monitoring of audits; (iii) programs to strengthen control over invoices and receipts of
commercial establishments; and (iv) programs for the use of modern computation equipment, including "laptops", in the different
phases of physical and financial audits.
(iii) Modernization of Audit Information Systems- Technical assistance, information technology, and training to design and
implement a multifunction graphic information technology system supporting a modern tax audit program.
(iv) Strengthening of Human and Physical Resources- Technical assistance, training, and some infrastructure support to strengthen
the audit function: (i) supporting a measurable increase in the quality and number of specialized auditors; (ii) creation of a
specialized training program to significantly improve the capacity of auditors; and (iii) purchase of 100 vehicles to facilitate physical
audits.
Project Component 4 - Social Communications
US $3.3 million
This component would support activities necessary to assure public understanding and support for the objectives of strengthened tax
administration, to inform and educate the general public about the benefits to be derived from the creation and functioning of a
professional and autonomous tax administration entity, the changes being introduced in tax laws and regulations, the new
mechanisms for tax compliance and audit, as well as the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. Reliance would be placed on a
professional firm expert in social communications, focus groups and surveys of public opinion about the SAT, creation of public
relations materials and strategy, and conducting of public forums, workshops, and meetings. Publication of bulletins and brochures,
holding information fairs, and open discussions using communications media would be used to explain the various changes
associated with implementation of the SAT. Surveys would also be conducted to evaluate the public's understanding and awareness
of the new laws and procedures to create feedback mechanisms with the aim of developing better tax policy and a more efficient,
effective, and respected tax administration. Additionally, an educational program explaining taxpayer rights and responsibilities
would be made available to primary through tertiary level students, in coordination with education sector authorities. The
component would also finance a communications effort within the SAT to support the change management effort and strengthen
knowledge of and commitment to the goals of the organization.

This component would provide project implementation support by fic   intenaional experts and local stafl support personnel,
operating costs, and equipment for the Project Coordination Unit The PCU would be responsible for the supervision of the project,
contracting of and monitoring of consultant firms and individual consultants, oversight of project finances, preparation of reports,
and auditing under the project. International experts in audit, internal revenue and customs processes, and information technology,
as well as a senior international project advisor would provide direct support to the project director in key substantive areas, as well
as interface with the consulting firms that are expected to help implement the project. National counterparts in the four project
components will help to coordinate these areas within the project and with SAT management and oversee the institutionalization of
their respective project elements.

The fiscal impact of this project is estimated by projecting increases in the effective tax ratios arising from proposed tax
administration measures. These reflect both the expected increased efficiency of the fiscal authority to collect and audit,
and the estimated impact of the increase in the tax base. A projected scenario (available on file) results from the following
tax administration measures:
*   Creation and organizational development of the new Superintendency of Tax Administration, which comprises the
functions of Internal Revenue and Customs.
X Approval of key amendments to the Tax Code and judicial norms to support punishment of tax evasion.
*   Establishment of a control system aimed at large contributors by 1998.
*   Establishment of cross-checking mechanisms.
*   Improved registering of medium-size contributors during 1997.
*   Revision of the tax payment system with commercial banks during 1998.
* Improved control of smuggling resulting in moderately higher tariff collection.
The scenario is specified for the period covering 1998-2000 and is based on assumed increases in the effective tax-to-GDP
ratios for:
* value-added tax (VAT)
* income tax (ISR)
* external tariffs
Forecasts are based on the following assumptions:
* A baseline GDP growth rate of 4 percent;
* Constant VAT and ISR consumption and income elasticities;
*   World Bank forecast data for exports and 1MF data for GDP and imports;
*   Continuity of the present exchange rate policy throughout the period;
*   No changes in tax and tariff rates and policies (so as to isolate the effects of the above tax administration measurcs).
The forecasts already incorporate the 1996 fiscal policy and tax administration changes, including:

*   The increase in the VAT rate from 7 to 10 percent in 1996
*   The introduction of the temporary tax on gross earnings (ISET) which yielded Q496 million in 1996 and assumed to
yield Q900 million in 1997
*   The approval of a new Tax Code
*   The dismantling of a major tax-evading smuggling ring
*   The approval of several legal amendments to improve tax law enforcement
RESULTS In the scenario, the reforms are expected to start yielding positive results in terms of increased tax revenue by
1999. From the year 2000 onwards, it is estimated that the reforms will result in a permanent increase in annual tax
revenues of about 0.9 percent of GDP. In present value terms discounted back to 1996, the infinite stream of these
additional revenues from 2000 onwards would represent about $1.5 billion in fresh fiscal revenues (using a 10 percent
discount rate).4

arement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of consultants would be done according to the provisions of the "Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) and of goods according to the provisions of the " Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996). For complex time-based assignments and for contracts
based on a lump sum price, such contracts will be based upon the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued
by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall haive been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract
documents have been issued by the Bank other standard forms acceptable to the Bank shall be used.
Table A of this section shows the project costs by procurement arrangements. International competitive bidding procedures
(ICB) shall be used for the purchase of goods including information technology equipment under the project, with contracts
for goods where practicable being grouped into bid packages of US$ 150,000 or more equivalent. Goods estimated to cost
US $25,000 equivalent or more but less than US $150,000 equivalent per contract may be procured using National
Competitive Bidding (NCB), up to an aggregate amount of US $1 million. Goods estimated to cost less than US $25,000
equivalent per contract may be procured through national or international shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$
600,000. Table A. 1 shows the selection arrangements for consultants. Requirements of prior review of other contracts for
consulting services and goods are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
Expenditures for individual contracts of goods and services, for which prior review by Bank is not required, will be
disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs) all records evidencing such information must be retained by the PCU until at least one year after the Bank has
received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account is made. Full
documentation for all contracts requiring Bank's prior ireview will be submitted. Disbursements, representing mainly
expenditures under short term technical assistance, will. be made over a period of four years, the average for technical
assistance projects in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Since the Government wishes to advance rapidly in the
creation of the SAT, retroactive financing not to exceed US $2.82 million (10% of the loan amount) would be applied to
finance eligible expenditures made after July 1, 1997 but no more than a year before loan signing.
A special account in US Dollars might be established alt the Central Bank with an authorized allocation of $2.0 million.
The amount of the initial deposit, however, would be lirnited to $1 million untill the aggregate amount of withdrawals from
the Loan plus outstanding special commitments were equal to or exceed the equivalent of $5.0 million, to correspond to
anticipated expenditures in the first months of project execution. The special account would be replenished monthly to
assure liquidity of funds, and all replenishment applications would be accompanied by reconciled bank statements from the
depository bank showing all transaction is the special account.
The allocation of loan proceeds is provided in Table C of this section (see Table C).
