1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

With one of the lowest tax revenue ratios in Latin America (i.e., 8.8 percent of GDP in 1996)
Guatemala's historically weak revenue performance had been a crucial factor undermining the
country's macroeconomic performance, as well as its overall development prospects. Specifically,
wide annual variations in tax collection threatened public account balances and subjected public
investment to disruptive cycles of "stop-go" spending. In addition, low tax revenues severely
constrained public investment and social sector spending, thus limiting poverty alleviation efforts.
They also hindered the implementation of the December 1996 Peace Accords, which put an end
to 36 years of armed internal conflict and set the foundations for an ambitious agenda for
reconciliation and reincorporation of excluded groups, human development, sustainable economic
development, and modernization of the state and improved governance. Notably, reaching a tax
revenue target ratio of 12 percent of GDP was one of the specific targets agreed under the Peace
Accords--a necessary step for raising the resources allocated to poverty alleviation and
development policies.

Guatemala's low tax revenues reflected the structure of the tax system, deficiencies in tax
administration, as well as pockets of corruption within the tax agencies. Specifically, Guatemala's
tax code exhibited one of the lowest VAT rates in Latin America (i.e., 10 percent). In addition,
there were high thresholds for tax liability, deductions for VAT payments, exclusion of annual
bonuses and pensions, limited withholding for wage earners, and no withholding or periodic
payments during the tax year by professionals and the self-employed. Likewise, the tax code
provided weak penalties for non-compliance, which, together with lengthy business liquidation
procedures for tax evasion, resulted in endemic tax evasion. Long-standing deficiencies in tax
administration, including poor identification of non-filers, weak auditing and inspection
procedures, and the lack of modern management tools were compounded by the lack of
coordination between the Departments of Internal Revenues (Dirección General de Impuestos
Internos) and Customs (Dirección General de Aduanas). Morale in these two agencies was low
as a result of the lack of a career-path for employees, low pay, and lax personnel policies. The
Customs Service, in particular, suffered from profound institutional weaknesses related to poor
management, weak human resources, lack of adequate systems of financial and physical control,
unduly bureaucratic processes with excessive scope for discretional decisions by individual staff,
deteriorating physical infrastructure, lack of transparency in the collection of import duties, and
resistance to change. A major corruption scandal led the Government to intervene in the
Department of Customs in 1996.

The strengthening of the country's tax performance was undertaken as part of an ambitious
program of public-sector reform that included the reform of the civil service, the restructuring of
key ministries, the reform of the administration of justice, the modernization of public financial
management, and an increase in the role of the private sector in the provision of infrastructure
services. Reform of tax administration was a key element in the Government's strategy for
increasing tax revenue, as well as reducing economic distortions and promoting the transparency
of tax and customs collections. As mentioned above, under the terms of the Peace Accords signed
in 1996, the Government agreed to raise tax revenues to 10 percent of GDP in 1998 and to 11.4
percent in 1999. Following years of marginally successful efforts to strengthen the existing tax
administration regime, the Government decided to create an autonomous Superintendency of Tax
Administration (Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria - SAT) with a new
organizational structure and functional relationships. The Government requested Bank support for
the creation of the new tax agency, including its organizational design, the implementation of


                                               1

initiatives to strengthen tax administration, and a wide-scale education effort aimed at raising
public awareness as to the importance of a sound tax administration and securing the
Congressional votes necessary for the creation of the SAT.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Tax Administration Technical Assistance Loan Project (SAT TAL) sought to assist
Guatemala in raising its revenue performance above its historically low rates by: i) improving the
effectiveness and efficiency of tax and customs administration through strengthened collection,
audit, and enforcement procedures; and ii) increasing tax revenues. This, in turn, would help
achieve stronger revenue performance to support increased social spending, the provision of basic
infrastructure and the implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords.

The three key indicators corresponding to the project's two Project Development Objectives
(PDOs) were:
     PDO 1: Increase tax returns
     1.1 Increase tax revenues by 2000 by 1 percent of GDP above the 8.5 percent of GDP reached
         in 1996.
     PDO 2: Improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tax and customs administration
     2.1 Percentage of late filers reduced from 20 to 10 percent for the value-added tax (VAT) and
         from 45 to 20 percent for the income tax by 2000.
     2.2 Tax arrears due in June 1997 reduced by 50 percent by December 1999.

1.3      Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
         and reasons/justification

The PDOs remained unchanged during the life of the loan.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

The project's target beneficiaries were the tax administration agency and taxpayers in general.
Specifically, the operation was expected to bring about: i) qualitative improvements in tax
administration in terms of effectiveness, transparency, and assistance to taxpayers; ii) measurable
improvement in monitoring and control (financial and physical) of imports; and iii) increased tax
revenues.

1.5      Original Components (as approved)

The project was comprised of the following components:

Component 1 - Creation of a Superintendency of Tax Administration (Superintendencia de
Administración Tributaria - SAT) (17 percent of project costs - US$6.5 million total, of which
U$4.9 million corresponded to Bank financing). This component supported the design and
development of a new operationally and financially independent institution responsible for the
collection of internal and customs revenues, including the new organizational structure and
management systems, training, and professional development needs.

Component 2 - Facilitating Taxpayers' Compliance (31 percent of project costs - US$11.7
million total, of which US$6.9 million corresponded to Bank financing). This component was
aimed at identifying and implementing measures to improve voluntary taxpayer compliance
through the review and simplification of procedures, the modernization of information



                                                2

technology, including channeling tax collection through the banking system, the creation of a
Special Taxpayers Unit, and the establishment of a network of taxpayer services offices.

Component 3 - Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms (27 percent of project costs -
US$10.4 million total, of which US$7.2 million corresponded to Bank financing). This
component supported the review of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to tax
administration and the institutional structures to improve tax collection enforcement, including
the establishment of a new Audit Department.

Component 4 - Social Communications (13 percent of project costs ­ US$4.8 million total, of
which US$3.3 million corresponded to Bank financing). This component aimed to promote wide-
scale public understanding of the tax administration by financing a social communication
campaign to inform and educate the public about the benefits of; an independent and
professionalized tax collection authority; changes in the tax law; compliance and enforcement
mechanisms; and taxpayer services and rights. This component was also intended to provide the
Government feedback on tax administration issues, as well as to promote internal change within
the SAT, and to meet the goals of increased transparency and accountability.

Component 5 - Project Coordination (12 percent of project costs - US$4.6 million total, of
which US$3.7million corresponded to Bank financing). This component financed the overall
management and coordination of the project through the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which
was to be established within the SAT.

1.6     Revised Components

No additional components were added during the life of the loan.

1.7     Other significant changes

The loan agreement was amended in early 2002 to include the category of civil works to finance
the construction, the rehabilitation and/or remodeling of SAT's offices. A total of US$6.7 million
were allocated to the civil works category, and an additional US$2 million were assigned to the
category of goods. These increases were offset by an equivalent reduction in the amounts
originally allocated to consultants and other costs that were previously unallocated.

The project's original closing date (March 31, 2002) was extended three times (to March 31,
2003; March 31, 2005; and March 31, 2007), resulting in an overall project life span of almost
ten years between appraisal and closing. Although the Government explored the possibility of a
fourth extension to continue project support throughout the tenure of the present administration,
this request was denied by the Bank given the age of the project.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR finds the quality at entry to be Satisfactory, as it did a panel of reviewers as part of a
Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA) conducted in August 2006. The loan objectives were
consistent with those of the Bank as articulated in the 1995 CAS (Report No. 1445 1-GU; May 30,
1995), which emphasized the need to increase public savings, improve the public sector's
extremely limited service delivery capability, and strengthen its historically weak institutional
capacity. The project also reflected the Government's own priorities, which called for a far-



                                               3

reaching modernization of the public sector.       Moreover, by supporting the creation of an
independent tax agency and the overall overhaul of the tax administration, the operation
contributed to the strengthening of Guatemala's revenue performance, which was critical not only
to meet the revenue targets set under the umbrella of the Peace Accords but, more generally, to
support sustainable public investment and social sector expenditures. The Bank's team correctly
identified a rare window of opportunity to address a major weakness in Guatemala's public sector,
capitalizing on the presence of a reform-minded administration. Project preparation benefited
from strong ownership on the part of the Borrower and the Bank's ample expertise in public-
sector modernization in general and tax administration in particular.

The appraisal team correctly identified a set of core actions that needed to be taken as part of the
creation of the SAT and included them in this operation. Accordingly, the project's four
substantive components focused on well-defined areas of intervention, addressing the immediate
issues of designing and implementing the organizational and operational structure of the newly
created tax agency, improving tax and customs collection procedures, strengthening enforcement
mechanisms, and communicating/educating the public and Congress as to the importance of a
sound tax administration. These components were straightforward and provided a comprehensible
navigation chart that included clearly defined outcomes and a corresponding timetable.

Drawing from an in-depth analysis of the lessons learned from previous tax administration
operations and best practices from the Bank's global experience, the appraisal team clearly
identified the key determinants of the project's success and incorporated them into the reform
strategy, including: promoting dialogue among a broad base of constituencies--including
Congressional leaders, the civil society and key staff, to build consensus on the tax administration
reform; emphasizing the review and strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework; and
avoiding overemphasizing aspects related to information technology at the expense of other key
institutional aspects such as organization, business processes, and human resources. Likewise, the
team carefully gauged the various risks threatening project implementation, including the
challenge of obtaining the required 2/3 majority in Congress to approve the creation of an
autonomous SAT, and took appropriate measures to mitigate these risks through adequate project
design, such as implementing an intensive communication campaign and developing a highly
detailed project implementation plan.

The project was part of a larger public-sector modernization program supported by the Bank in
Guatemala that included a series of three Integrated Financial Management Projects (IFM-I, II
and III). In all, these loans supported a well-defined program aimed at improving efficiency and
increasing transparency within the public sector, focusing on both the revenue and expenditure
sides. This, in turn, has had the secondary impact of improving the management and efficiency of
the entire lending portfolio.

2.2      Implementation

Despite its overall accomplishments, the project encountered significant obstacles during its
implementation. The project was off to a slow start, as heated debates surrounded the passage of
legislation calling for the creation of the SAT, making it difficult to obtain the needed 2/3
majority in Congress. While the legislation enabling the creation of the SAT was finally approved
in early 1998, there were additional delays in obtaining Congress's approval of the project. As a
result, the operation was not declared effective until December 11, 1998, a year later than
anticipated at appraisal. Implementation continued to be slow, in part reflecting delays in
contracting an international consultant firm to help define the longer term reform strategy. The
firm was hired and ultimately began work in mid-2000. The project came to almost a complete



                                               4

halt in 2002 due to a highly hostile political climate. From 2004 onward, the pace of
implementation regained renewed momentum, as the newly appointed SAT management strongly
supported its modernization process. The operation finally closed on March 31, 2007--five years
after its original closing date. Of the original US$28.2 million loan amount, roughlyUS$9 million
was cancelled, as project disbursements were severely affected by the delays experienced during
implementation.

Several factors, both within and outside the Government's control, affected project
implementation, including frequent changes in SAT management, delays and obstacles in
execution, and, most notably, lack of commitment toward the modernization process.

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control:

Uneven political support: The project had the full support of the Arzú administration (1996-2000),
which sponsored the creation of the SAT within the framework of an ambitious set of public
sector reforms undertaken to support the 1996 Peace Accords. Conversely, there was an apparent
lack of support on the part of the Portillo administration (2000-2004), which as the opposition
party, not only did not support the SAT TAL project, but also attempted to undermine SAT's
autonomy. Thereafter, the SAT and the corresponding TAL project has received the full support
of the Berger administration (2004-2008).

Lack of continuity in SAT's top management: Project implementation was clearly damaged by
the frequent changes in management. There have being six different SAT superintendents during
the life of the project, with three different superintendents serving during the Portillo
administration. The frequent changes in SAT's top management had a detrimental effect on
project implementation, as each administration revised the activities being financed under the
project according to its own priorities. In some cases, adjustments were only minor, with SAT's
overall modernization agenda remaining on course. In other cases, such as under the leadership of
the third superintendent who was assigned to the post after the unjustified removal of his
predecessor, modernization efforts were abandoned and a large proportion of key managerial staff
was removed. Fortunately, the current superintendent has remained in her post from 2005
onward, bringing much needed stability to the agency.

Lack of adequate budgetary allocations: As evidenced in the SAT TAL project, Guatemala's tight
fiscal controls over external borrowing can slow down project implementation. Specifically, the
amount of a project to be implemented in any given year, as well as the corresponding
counterpart funds are determined as part of the annual budget approved by Congress. Thus,
despite the SAT's financial autonomy (i.e., it is endowed with 2 percent of tax revenues), the pace
of implementation of the SAT-TAL project was subject to Congressional approval, not only at the
time of the project's approval but every year during its life. This severely affected the pace of
implementation as only minimum levels of funding were approved in 2002 and 2003. For
example, in 2002 no resources were allocated to the project until November. Not surprisingly, the
lack of resources severely hindered implementation, putting the project at risk. The lack of
funding was largely the result of political infighting and not valid fiscal constraints.

Reduction in tax revenues as a result of changes in the tax code and free-trade agreements: As
further discussed below, it is impossible to distinguish between the impact of improvements in
tax policy per se--which were the focus of the operation--and changes in tax policy on tax
collections. In this context, it is important to note that some of the improvements in tax policy
may have been overshadowed by negative changes in tax policy. Specifically, powerful vested
interests have consistently opposed tax initiatives in Congress or, in some instances, launched
successful court challenges to achieve the strike down of taxes approved by the legislature. For


                                                 5

example, the 2003 Supreme Court ruling that a presumptive income tax (Impuesto a Empresas
Mercantiles y Agrícolas - IEMA) was un-constitutional caused a decline in revenues of 2 percent
of GDP in 2004. Other factors, such as the opening of the economy and the signing of free trade
agreements, have also contributed to lower tax revenues (e.g., the share of customs taxes
(impuestos arancelarios) decreased from 1.88 percent to 0.98 percent of GDP between 1995 and
2006 and are expected to continue to decrease as the various trade agreements signed by
Guatemala enter into effect).

Additional project activities: Additional activities were included during project implementation,
including: i) activities in the area of customs reforms that were initially financed under an IDB
project; and ii) civil works to finance the upgrading of SAT's infrastructure.
a. IDB-financed activities in the area of customs: In November 2001, the SAT requested that the
    Bank finance and expand efforts initiated by an IDB operation in the area of customs
    following its closure in 2003.1 The Bank supported the integration of activities focusing on
    customs reform into the SAT TAL operation, since they were complementary in nature and
    the two institutions had collaborated closely in the area of customs from the onset of the
    project. Overall, these activities contributed to the substantive and organizational reforms that
    were being pursued under the IBRD­sponsored operation and constituted a positive addition
    to the project.
b. Civil works: In 2002, the project was amended to include the financing of civil works to
    finance the upgrading of the SAT's infrastructure. The amendment was the result of strong
    pressure from Congress, due to the lack of understanding of the nature of technical assistance
    projects on the part of its leadership and a strong bias against projects that financed mainly
    "consultant" activities rather that tangible physical infrastructure, and, more importantly, the
    existence of the SAT itself as an autonomous entity. After several attempts to curtail project
    implementation, the leadership in Congress agreed to continue with loan implementation
    under the condition that civil works were added to the project. While the need to improve the
    SAT's physical infrastructure was real--particularly within customs--this addition was not a
    natural fit for the project as it did not match the project's objective and the PCU--as well as
    the SAT in general--lacked the expertise to implement civil works. Consequently,
    performance in this area fell well below expectations, with no construction being carried
    out--only designs were financed under the project as the bidding process for the actual
    construction was unsuccessful. This activity is now being pursued with SAT's financing
    under a project with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Overall, the
    inclusion of civil works had a negative impact on the operation, as it distracted attention and
    efforts from the project's core activities without yielding any positive outcomes.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control:

Uneven level of governance: The agency's governance was seriously weakened during the period
between 2000 and 2003, due to the lack of political commitment under the Portillo administration
and growing corruption at the higher levels of SAT management toward the end of its
administration in 2003. The project could do little to offset the hostile political climate, and was
at serious risk during this period. The aggressive anti-corruption stand adopted by the Berger
administration, which lead to a number of high-profile arrests and indictments of senior
officials--including the former SAT superintendent--and the appointment of a well-regarded ex-

president of the Bank of Guatemala as the head of the SAT were important initial steps toward
restoring the SAT's credibility and rebuilding its governance mechanisms. The process toward
enhancing SAT's transparency and governance has continued under SAT's current management
team, which has demonstrated great conviction and courage in the face of the threats and acts of
violence--including the assassination of a customs staff in 2006--that resulted from its
aggressive anti-corruption campaign within customs.

Staff continuity within the PCU: Despite the frequent changes in SAT superintendents, the
permanence of the key management and technical team within the PCU helped to provide
continuity to the operation. Moreover, the PCU acted as a retaining wall during the 2002-2003
period, ensuring proper use of project funds during a period of very weak governance within SAT.

Uneven support for the reform process: As clearly shown by the implementation of the operation
as well as reform programs worldwide, strong support from powerful and capable "champions" is
crucial to achieve in-depth institutional transformation. While the level of support for the reform
process had been uneven until early 2004, the SAT has undoubtedly benefited from having strong
champions from 2004 onward. Under the leadership of the two last superintendents, the SAT's
modernization program has regained a renewed momentum, setting in motion a sustained wave of
cultural and institutional transformation for over three years.

Ownership of the modernization process: In 2004 there was a significant shift in the SAT
modernization process. The agency's new management not only focused on overcoming the
legacy of mismanagement of the previous administration, but also forged a strategic vision of the
modernization process to be undertaken. The development of the 2004-2007 institutional strategic
plan (Plan Estratégico Institucional - PEI) was a crucial factor in the development of a unifying
vision of the modernization process that had a strong ownership from all levels of the
organization. A management committee was established to oversee the implementation of the
plan and to ensure appropriate internal coordination. SAT's new strategic plan helped put the
project back on track, as it was fully consistent with the objectives of the project. It also affected
the role of the project itself, which until that point, had served as a navigation route for the reform
process. From 2004 onward, the project became a strategic tool for the implementation of SAT's
own strategic plan.

Technical and financial support from the international community: Under the leadership of the
current Superintendent, SAT has succeeded in assembling a broad base of technical support
through cooperation agreements with many international and foreign agencies, including, most
prominently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but also the World Customs Organization
(WCO), the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Technical Assistance (OTA), the U.S.
Department of Internal Revenues (IRS), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),
the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), Canada's Border Services Agency (CBSA),
the Inter-American Center        of Tax Agencies (Centro Interamericano de Administraciones
Tributarias - CIAT), and the Spanish International Cooperation Agency (Agencia Internacional
de Cooperación Española ­ AECI).

Dismal disbursement performance: Despite the project's substantial achievement, disbursements
were historically low with total disbursements amounting to only 68 percent of the loan amount.
The slow pace of disbursements was largely the result of delays in project implementation, which
in turn, was caused largely by a hiatus in project implementation during the Portillo
administration. Poor disbursement performance was further worsened by delays in the launching
of the loan's civil works component and mistakes in procurement processes that forced SAT to
finance over US$1 million in consultancies and civil works out of its own budget. It is important
to underscore that in this case, project disbursements do not constitute a good indicator of the



                                                  7

project's performance. Moreover, as shown in Annex 1, the SAT offset lower disbursements
under the project by committing over US$16 million of its own financial resources to ensure
continued financing of the ongoing reforms under two UN projects.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project's M&E design was rated Moderately Satisfactory as part of the QSA07. In terms of
the Key Project Indicators, the project's Result Framework distinguished between changes in tax
revenues and improvements in tax administration performance, which was critical in separating
the effect of external factors, such as macroeconomic performance and changes in tax policy from
improvements in tax administration per se. Specifically, one project indicator (i.e., tax revenues
as a percentage of GDP) with its corresponding end-of-project target was defined to measure
progress toward the first PDO, focusing on increased tax revenues. While this indicator had high
visibility beyond the project, as it coincided with one of the key measures identified under the
umbrella of the Peace Accords, it was not helpful in measuring gains in tax collections arising
from improvements in tax administration per se. Two additional indicators were identified for the
second PDO (i.e., to improve tax administration). Unfortunately, one of them (i.e., tax arrears)
had to be dropped, as all tax arrears were transferred to the Ministry of Finance by law, and the
concept of tax arrears was eliminated, with tax payers being defined as either filers or non-filers.
The second tax administration indicator (i.e., percentage of late filers) was first monitored at the
end of 2001, focusing primarily on large taxpayers (the chaos in the former tax and customs
agencies' files and the generalized lack of information made it very difficult to estimate this
indicator accurately, particularly at early stages of implementation). From 2004 onward, this
indicator has been systematically tracked for medium taxpayers as well.2

An extended set of output indicators were identified for each of the four core project components.
Although some of these indicators were not very valuable in terms of measuring the impact of the
activities being carried out under each component, they provided a detailed roadmap for the
initial stages of the creation of the SAT, including critical activities to be completed and their
expected timetables.

Considering that the PDO1 was not well suited for a tax-administration project and that one of the
two indicators selected for PDO2 could not be used, the original M&E was not strong enough to
adequately assess the impact of the project. Fortunately, the project's M&E improved
substantially over the life of the project, as the SAT developed its own performance indicators.
The strategic planning unit has played a key role in enhancing the internal consistency and
reliability of SAT statistics. Although it was established as part of the SAT's original structure in
1998, since 2004 this unit has assumed responsibility for establishing the M&E methodology for
all SAT performance indicators and their computation. While individual divisions were initially
resistant to share information with the strategic planning unit, the establishment of a performance-
based salary bonus in 2005 that required the definition of specific performance indicators for each
division and its sub-areas and a detailed tracking system contributed to the sharing of information.




2    To track progress for this indicator, the supervision team used data provided by SAT's operational
areas (i.e., tax collections and management). The data being used in this ICR has been elaborated by the
strategic planning unit, which is now responsible for all SAT statistics.




                                                   8

This ICR has taken advantage of the SAT's stronger M&E system for its Results Framework
Analysis. While some of the indicators--particularly those relating to tax collections--can be
traced back to the project's origin in 1997, reliable data on the SAT's internal performance exists
only from 2004-2005 onward. However, the substantial gains they offer in terms of reliability and
internal consistency offsets the disadvantage of the shorter time span.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The PCU had adequate financial management systems, software, and trained staff. No systemic
problems were identified during implementation. Likewise, except for some occasional delays in
the implementation of agreed procurement schedules and procedural mistakes in two procurement
processes, there were no systemic problems with regard to the quality and reliability of the
project's procurement administration.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The PCU has now been absorbed into SAT's permanent structure, to constitute a newly
established Project Coordination Unit. This unit will be responsible for coordinating all projects
with external financing, including the two ongoing projects with United Nations (UN) agencies.

The two UN projects will continue to provide financing (i.e., US$16.6 million) to the actions
supported under the SAT TAL operation. In particular, an ongoing operation with the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) will continue to support SAT's modernization efforts,
with a special emphasis on customs. Under a different operation, UNOPS will support the SAT in
its efforts to improve its physical infrastructure, which as discussed earlier, was not successful
under the SAT TAL operation. It is important to note that these two projects are financed by
SAT's own financial resources, which denotes its commitment to the reform effort.

At the SAT's request, the Bank team will continue to provide technical assistance during FY08
(the project was assigned full supervision resources for FY08, although the only activity pending
is the ICR preparation). As in the case of its predecessors, the Third Development Policy Loan
(DPL-III), which was recently approved by the Board (Loan No. 74820-GU, August 2, 2007),
includes targets in the areas of tax revenues, tax administration, and customs, ensuring that the
SAT continues to have visibility within the Bank's portfolio.

As mentioned earlier, the SAT has actively sought the support of an array of international
agencies and institutions, which are providing valuable know-how and expertise in core areas.
The continuous support of these agencies will help sustain the reform efforts and continue to
improve SAT's institutional capacity.

3.       Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Bank successfully capitalized on a unique window of opportunity to support the peace
process in Guatemala by financing an operation aimed to strengthen Guatemala's weak tax
administration and, hence, to increase revenues. A decade after its preparation, the objectives of
the SAT TAL continue to be highly relevant and consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy
and the national priorities. Between 1995 and 2004, the Bank produced two country assistance
strategies whose overarching objectives were to help: i) reduce poverty; ii) promote growth and



                                                9

economic stability, and iii) improve the management and productivity of the public sector.3 The
SAT TAL directly supported the third objective (i.e., by strengthening tax administration) and
indirectly supported the other two (i.e., by increasing tax revenues to, in turn, help fund social
infrastructure investments and support macroeconomic stability).

The 2005 CAS directly supported the program of the current administration. Specifically, the
main foundations of the Berger administration's Vamos Guatemala program include: i)
maintenance of macro stability--including fiscal reforms to create further space for social
investment; ii) security--both personal and legal; and iii) improved governance and public sector
management, including at sub-national level. As denoted by the strong political support it
received from 2004 onward, the operation's objectives were highly consistent with the agenda of
the Berger administration and the 2005 CAS, providing direct support to the objective of
improving public sector management and indirectly supporting the objective of maintaining
macroeconomic stability to, in turn, finance social investments.

2.       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Despite the obstacles and challenges faced during its implementation, the operation made a
substantial contribution toward improving Guatemala's revenue performance by supporting the
creation of a new tax agency for internal revenue and customs with operational, financial, and
human resources management autonomy. The operation also actively supported the strengthening
of tax collection and auditing processes, the establishment of taxpayer assistance services, the
elimination of loopholes in the law and simplification of norms and procedures, and the
introduction of more rigorous enforcement mechanisms. The lack of progress in the area of
physical infrastructure has not affected overall performance with respect to the PDOs, since it
was a later project add-on that responded to political pressures rather than substantive arguments.
The two PDOs have been met, as: i) tax revenues have increased in line with the end-of-project
target; and ii) tax administration has been substantially enhanced. However, given the project's
extended life, more substantial gains in tax revenues should have been achieved. The
achievement of objectives can be summarized as follows:

PDO 1 ­ Increasing tax revenues: The operation has marginally satisfactorily met the objective
of increasing tax revenues. Net tax revenues represented 10.3 percent of GDP in 2006, thus
largely achieving (and exceeding from 2001 onward) the end-of-project target of a 1 percent
increase with respect to 1996 levels from 2000 onward.4 The historical evolution of Guatemala's
tax burden over the past 40 years shows two clearly distinguishable periods. The first one, which
spans between 1965 and 1995, is characterized by a stable tax burden, at levels below 8 percent
of GDP. The second period, which begins with the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996, is
characterized by increasing efforts to raise tax revenues. During this second period, tax burden as
a percentage of GDP has increased from 8.8 percent in 1996 to 10.3 percent in 2006.5 However,




3   Each CAS also had a separate objective: human resource development (the 1995 CAS), and building
social cohesion and strengthening participatory decision processes (the 1998 CAS).
4   Note that the actual tax revenues in 1996 were higher as a proportion of GDP than the preliminary
estimates utilized at appraisal--8.8 and 8.5 percent of GDP, respectively.
5   Guatemala's Central Bank has recently recalculated GDP using 2001 as the base year. However, to
ensure consistency with the original project documents and performance targets, this report refers to the
GDP with 1958 as the base. Most reports from the Government and the IMF make reference to both GDPs
to avoid confusion.


                                                  10

progress has not been steady, due to, among other factors, political opposition, unfavorable
constitutional court rulings on taxes, and tariff reductions resulting from trade agreements.6

As shown in Figure 1, the tax burden increased from 1998 onward, after SAT's creation, reaching
10.7 percent of GDP in 2002. It then began a declining trend until 2005, when it reached 9.8
percent of GDP. This trend was reversed in 2006, when the tax burden bounced back above the
10 percent mark as a result of significant efforts to reinstate (in revised form) taxes that were
struck down by the courts and substantially strengthening tax administration through the passage
of an Anti-Evasion law and the vigorous implementation of a strategic plan, developed with
assistance from the Bank and IMF.

In summary, the operation largely met the target defined for PDO1 of increasing tax revenues by
1 percent of GDP from 2000 onward. However, the 1 percent target was defined in relation to the
project's original closing date on March 31, 2002. More robust gains in tax revenues should have
achieved given the project's additional five years of implementation.

PDO 2 ­ Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of tax and customs administration: The
operation has satisfactorily met the objective of enhanced SAT performance as shown by a wide
array of indicators. The successful creation and functioning of the SAT under modern operating
procedures and performance-based personnel management policies, coupled with priority
measures to improve voluntary compliance, reduce evasion, and strengthen taxpayer services
increased the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of tax and customs administration.




6    Factors beyond the control of the SAT that have negatively affected tax revenues include: i) increase in
benefits to Central America exports ; ii) numerous unfavorable constitutional court rulings on taxes; iii)
undue delays in the processing of VAT fiscal credit to exporters during the 2003-2004 period, which
resulted in lower net VAT revenues in 2005, when the accumulated stock was eliminated; iv) a reduction in
tariffs due to free trade agreements; v) the decentralization of some taxes to municipalities (i.e., property
taxes ­ IUSI); and vi) a reduction in the tax to support the implementation of the Peace Accords (IETAPP)
in 2006.

The indicator corresponding to this PDO called for a reduction in the percentage of late filers,
from 20 percent to less than 10 percent for VAT, and from 45 percent to less than 15 percent for
income tax (ISR). This indicator has been fully met for large and medium taxpayers, which
account for approximately 75 percent of all tax revenues. Specifically, as a result of the close
follow-up on the part of SAT's Special Taxpayers Unit, the percentage of late VAT filers (so-
called "Omisos") was reduced from 5.5 to 0.9 percent for large taxpayers and from 9.5 to 0.2
percent for medium taxpayers between December 2004 and 30 June 2007. Likewise, the
percentage of late ISR filers was reduced to from 2.2 to 0.7 percent for large taxpayers and from
9.6 to 1.8 percent for medium taxpayers during the same period. Table 1 shows the substantial
reductions achieved between December 2004 and June 2007. No reliable data are available for
regular taxpayers, as the SAT has so far concentrated its efforts on those types of taxpayers (i.e.,
large taxpayers at first and medium taxpayers from 2004 onward) that yield the highest tax
revenues.

3.4     The specific achievements in the areas of SAT's overall performance, voluntary tax
compliance, enforcement and social communications, which also point to the achievement of
PDO2, can be summarized as follows:

Component 1 - Creation of the SAT: Satisfactory. This component effectively supported the
design and development of a new tax agency responsible for the collection of internal and
customs revenues. Activities under this component focused on the design of the SAT's
organizational structure, its management and operational systems, training, and professional
development needs. The Bank's technical assistance and the operation's retroactive financing
were critical in allowing the Government to carry out a sound preparation process. Special
emphasis was placed on ensuring the functional independence of the new agency. Despite the
challenge of obtaining the 2/3 majority needed in Congress, the Bank strongly encouraged the
Government to seek legislation establishing an autonomous tax agency to ensure SAT's financial
and functional autonomy, including self-determination for personnel management and pay. On
January 12, 1998, Congress approved the creation of SAT (Decree 1-98), establishing it as an
autonomous agency with operational and financial autonomy and endowing it with 2 percent of
its revenues. The SAT initiated its first activities in August 1998, taking over the functions of the
old Internal Revenue and Customs Services. The transition took place with minimum disruption,
although the widespread personnel changes required intensive training in the substance of internal
revenues and customs (only 25 percent of the personnel of the SAT's personnel in 2000 came
from the former tax agencies).

Despite the trials experienced during periods of hostile political climate and corrupt leadership,
the SAT has become a solid, respected, and professional organization over the past nine years.
Currently, it has modern operating procedures, sound institutional planning processes, and merit-
based human resource management. As characterized by the IMF (2007), SAT has a qualified
management team, well-structured operations plans, and is increasing its effectiveness.7 Under
the leadership of the current Superintendent, the SAT is engaged in an ambitious modernization
process that encompasses all units within the organization. Progress in the area of customs,
internal controls, and the development of key management tools are particularly noteworthy (See
Annex 2 for a detailed description of the outcomes under this component.)

The SAT's effectiveness and efficiency have increased substantially since the project began,
pointing to steady gains in efficiency and effectiveness in tax administration. Tax revenues have
increased by 1.5 percent of GDP between 1998 and 2006 and have remained relatively stable
despite changes in tax policy that reduced the taxable base. As shown in Table 2, tax evasion has
decreased substantially--in the case of VAT, evasion went down from almost 40 percent in 1999
to 31.6 percent in 2006. It is expected that VAT evasion will be further reduced to 28 percent in
2007 due to the impact of the Anti-Evasion Law. This rate of evasion is comparable to that of
Colombia (28 percent) and compares favorably to that of Mexico (45.7 percent), Argentina (40.4
percent), and Bolivia (39.4 percent). However, it is still far from that of Chile (19.7 percent). At
the same time, collections costs have decreased, with current operating expenditures accounting
for 1.9 percent of tax revenues 2006. Lower operating costs have opened the financial space
needed for capital investments (equivalent to 0.5 percent of overall SAT's tax revenues in 2006)
associated with the implementation of SAT's modernization program, including ICT updates and
improvements. Tax revenues per employee increased from Q$8.4 million in 2003 to Q$9.6
million in 2006.

Component 2 - Facilitating Taxpayers' Compliance: Satisfactory. This component supported
activities aimed at improving voluntary taxpayer compliance. These activities included the
redesign of tax forms to make them more user-friendly, the implementation of an electronic tax
filing and collection system through commercial banks (BANCASAT), the creation of a Special
Taxpayers Unit, the implementation of a program to induce taxpayer compliance (OrientaSAT),
and the establishment of a network of taxpayer services offices. The SAT also designed a set of
electronic tools to support taxpayer compliance and communications (e.g., AsisteLibros,
RetenISR, RetenIVA, ExenIVA, PlanIVA@SAIT, and BuzonSAT). All of these tools can be

outcomes under this component).

SAT's extensive array of services aimed at facilitating voluntary compliance by minimizing the
cost for taxpayers. From January 1999 onward, all tax forms and payments were submitted
through local banks, with SAT no longer receiving payments and returns. In 2001 the new
BANCASAT system was implemented to promote electronic filing and payment. Currently, 92
percent of all tax revenues corresponding to 30 percent of all transactions are being paid
electronically. It is expected that these percentages can increase to over 96 percent and 46 percent,
respectively, as a result of the new requirements that all payments greater than Q$5,000 be paid
electronically. In 2006, the OrientaSAT program conducted over 23,000 `friendly' visits to
taxpayers to help them understand the tax responsibilities. As a result of this and many other SAT
initiatives, the number of individual taxpayers that obtain a tax identification number (Número de
Identificación Tributaria - NIT) has increased to over 51,000 per month in 2006, representing a
207 percent increase over the previous year. The number of active taxpayers has also increased
steadily since 2003, topping over 1 million in 2006.

Component 3 - Strengthening Enforcement Mechanisms: Satisfactory. Activities under this
component supported the review of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to tax
administration and the development of institutional structures to improve tax collection
enforcement. The specific outcomes include the establishment of a new Audit Department for
Internal Revenues; the development of an auditing management tool (FISAT) that includes a risk
analysis module to enhance the selection of taxpayers for auditing; the reengineering of processes
to determine VAT returns to exporters; the development of auditing manuals focusing on 28
economic sectors; and the training of SAT auditors on the auditing standards of 14 of these
sectors. In the case of customs, specific outcomes in the area of enforcement included full
replacement of field personnel in the main ports together with the implementation of a risk
analysis module to select import shipments for inspection. The Anti-Evasion law approved in
2006 has stiffened the penalties associated with tax evasion to now include incarceration (See
Annex 2 for a detailed description of the outcomes under this component).

With the support of the project, the SAT has substantially strengthened its enforcement
capabilities, resulting not only in a direct fiscal impact due to unreported tax revenues detected
during audits and inspections, but also an indirect one due to the heightened perception of risk
among taxpayers. As shown in Table 4, there has been a substantial increase in SAT's fiscal
presence, by increasing the number of field visits to businesses from 15,313 in 2003 to almost
250,000 in 2006--equivalent to 65 percent of all registered VAT taxpayers. Field visits have also
expanded territorial coverage and times (i.e., weekends and evening hours are now included).
Revenues from a monitoring program focusing on non-complying taxpayers (Omisos) has


                                               14

increased Q$77 million in 2002 to Q$311 million in 2006, which represents an increase in
revenues equivalent to 1 percent of SAT's tax revenues. Internal-revenue audits have increased
their efficacy--while reducing the number of audits from almost 6,800 in 2004 to 4,700 in 2006,
the number of audits with a fiscal impact ("smart" audits) has remained largely unchanged (i.e.,
over 2,000) as a result of improved selection mechanisms. A similar effect can be observed in the
case of customs, where the percentage of import shipments inspections has decreased from 80
percent in 2004 to 45 percent in 2006, while the percentage of hits (`smart' inspections) has
almost doubled from 4.8 to 9 percent during the same period due to the adoption of a new risk
analysis module. This, in turn, has substantially reduced the processing times, with the
consequent positive impact on service delivery to customs users. It is expected that, as recently
appointed customs personnel gain on-the-job experience, the percentage of "smart" inspections
will also increase. Finally, the number of business closures also increased from only 35 in 2001 to
almost 600 in 2006. However, the challenge to effectively transform fiscal gains from auditing
into actual revenues collections is still pending due to internal factors--slow improvements in the
area of judicial affairs within the SAT--and external ones--such as structural inefficiencies in
the judicial system.

Component 4 - Social Communications: Highly Satisfactory. Although initially off to a slow
start, this component has promoted widespread public understanding of tax administration
reforms by financing a wide variety of social communication activities. These activities focused
on educating taxpayers on changes in the tax law to ensure their smooth implementation. The
SAT website provides a valuable resource for taxpayers seeking information and support on tax
compliance and enforcement mechanisms, taxpayer services, and their rights. It is widely used by
taxpayers, as denoted by the over 4.5 millions print-outs that are downloaded from the site every
year. More recently, the focus of social communication activities has expanded, targeting broader
sectors of the population, including youth and the Mayan population, as part of activities aimed at
promoting a tax culture throughout the population. Some of these activities are highly innovative,
such as a theatrical production for children illustrating justifications for taxes and a tax lotto that
uses VAT receipts as an entry. Equally important, the SAT has sought to build strategic alliances
with the private sector and civil society in an effort to increase transparency and external


                                               15

oversight. For example, the SAT has subscribed to an agreement with the Transparency Coalition,
which includes, among others, the Guatemalan Chamber of Commerce, to oversee reports of
corruption and irregularities in customs operations.

Public education campaigns on specific changes to the tax law: The SAT has been very
successful in achieving the smooth implementation of substantial changes to the law by devising
carefully planned implementation strategies that included well-thought communication
campaigns. For example, during 2005 in order to support the replacement of over 850,000 license
plates throughout the entire country, the SAT made applications available on its website allowing
individuals easy access to information regarding the amount that was due, the location to pick up
license plates, and the status of their respective applications. In addition to an aggressive media
campaign through radio, newspapers and TV, the SAT enlisted the collaboration of the gasoline-
distributors union to distribute over 150,000 fliers in service stations throughout the country. As
described above, the smooth implementation of the Anti-Evasion Law was also the result of a
comprehensive communications campaign. This campaign was organized in three distinct stages:
first, it aimed to build support among key stakeholders for the legislation; second, once the
legislation was approved, to inform taxpayers of the implications in terms of compliance; and,
third, to assist taxpayers in complying with the new regulations by providing assistance via e-mail,
call centers and the SAT website. The SAT also provided intensive training to VAT taxpayers on
the requirement of the new law (i.e., 34.5 percent of VAT taxpayers received training in 2006).

Developing a tax culture: In early 2005 the SAT created the "Permanent Tax Culture Program,"
in an effort to create awareness among community leaders, teachers, heads of households, and
children of the benefits derived from a sound tax administration. Some of the activities that are
being carried out as part of this program include a series of workshops aimed at community
leaders throughout the country, the distribution of children's workbooks in collaboration with the
Ministry of Education, community training activities in both Spanish and Mayan (over 40
percent of Guatemala's population speaks one of 21 Mayan languages), a children's theater play
that emphasizes civil values, a comic strip starring `Simón Tax' that appears weekly in two major
newspapers; street banners in high-traffic locations, which read "Ask for your tax receipt", and
interactive electronic "tax games" accessible through the SAT website. A tax lotto that uses VAT
receipts as the entry has proved very successful. It not only rewards winning taxpayers with cash
and other prizes such as bicycles, but also the business that issues the winning receipt as well as
the municipalities that receive the largest number of entries. SAT has collected over 1.3 million
VAT receipts during 2006, amounting to over Q$144 million.

Center for Tax Studies (CenSAT): The mission of the CenSAT is to deliver training on tax issues
to taxpayers in general and to students at all educational levels. In 2005 the CenSAT carried out
845 events that reached over 56,000 taxpayers and students, as well as over 5,200 individuals
holding important public and private posts. Likewise, the SAT regularly sponsors booths at
events related to tax administration, such as professional congresses and annual conferences.

Partnerships with the civil society: The SAT has been very proactive in seeking opportunities for
civil oversight, including:
    In 2005 the SAT subscribed to an agreement with the Coalition for Transparency that
     includes the Guatemalan Chamber of Commerce, a reputable non-government organization
     affiliated with Transparency International (Acción Ciudadana), and a national think-tank
     (Centro de Investigaciones Económicas Nacionales ­ CIEN). By virtue of this agreement, the
     Coalition is now the recipient of reports of potential corruption and/or irregularities in
     customs; it then channels them to the SAT for follow-up; and the SAT is expected to report



                                               16

    the findings back to the Coalition. This creates a mechanism of civil oversight that enhances
    transparency and accountability in SAT operations.
    In December 2006 SAT subscribed to the Pact for Customs Integrity (Pacto de Integridad en
    el Sistema Aduanero Nacional) with 17 private and public organizations to enhance
    transparency and accountability in customs operations. The subscribers include customs users
    such as the Guatemalan Export Association (AGEXPORT) and the national coffee
    association (ANACAFE), private service providers such as maritime and land transport
    companies, other public organisms that participate in customs operations such as the Ministry
    of Agriculture and the Port Police, and the Coalition for Transparency. These subscribers
    have pledged to join forces by enforcing transparency within their own organizations, sharing
    information, and collaborating in the diagnosis of existing weaknesses and addressing them.
    The SAT will present them with the 2008-2011 strategic institutional plan (PEI) for their
    input and endorsement shortly.
    Customs user groups now meet regularly in the three main ports to discuss and provide
    feedback on the day-to-day functions of customs operations in these locations.

3.3     Efficiency

The project was expected to have a positive fiscal impact resulting from administrative reforms
aimed at improving effectiveness in tax collection and auditing, and by increasing the tax base
through improved mechanisms in registry and taxpayer services. Specifically, the reforms were
expected to result in a permanent increased in annual tax revenues of about 1 percent of GDP
from the year 2000 onwards with respect to the 8.5 percent of GDP recorded in 1996. Although it
is not possible to distinguish between the impact of the project itself and that of external factors,
actual increases in tax revenues as a proportion of GDP were higher than anticipated, being
consistently at or above the 9.8 percent of GDP target from 2001 onward. Specifically, the
aggregate value of the difference between actual net tax revenues and those anticipated at
appraisal between 2000 and 2006 amounts to US$576 million (see Annex 3).8

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project represented a balanced approach to the complicated task of creating a new,
performance-based institution, and implementing important substantive tax administration
reforms. The successful creation of the SAT, coupled with actions aimed at improving voluntary
compliance, reducing evasion, and strengthening taxpayer services have increased the
effectiveness and efficiency of tax administration. This, in turn, has resulted in an increase in the
tax burden by roughly 1.5 percent of GDP since 1998, despite unfavorable changes in tax policy
that reduced the taxable base during 2003 and 2004. Both PDOs, which remained unchanged
throughout the life of the project, were achieved. The lack of progress in the area of physical
infrastructure has not affected project performance, although it negatively impacted overall
project disbursements. A decade after its approval, the objectives of the operation continue to be
highly relevant with respect to national priorities and the Bank's assistance strategy. However,
the operation's over-extended life and its low disbursements detract from its overall performance.
Likewise, although tax policy was not the focus of the operation, the continuing limited fiscal
space resulting from the lack of more robust gains in tax revenues after almost a decade since the
SAT's creation warrant the operation an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

estimates utilized at appraisal (8.5 percent).

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Peace Accords signed on December 29, 1996, not only marked the end of a long internal
armed conflict but also established a broad development agenda aimed at building a more
inclusive society. The Accords identified the reduction of poverty, particularly among rural and
indigenous people, as essential for lasting peace. The Peace program constituted a broad and
challenging development agenda which included a number of policy actions and outcome targets
covering areas such as economic, social, and human development, public sector reforms, justice
and human rights, security and reconciliation. In the area of taxes, the Peace Accords called for a
tax burden of 12 percent of GDP.

The implementation of the Peace Accords has been uneven. For example, significant progress has
been made in the implementation of structural reforms, particularly by promoting private
participation in infrastructure, eliminating restrictions to trade, and improving public financial
management. Despite these successes, compliance in other areas has required more time than
anticipated and some of the Peace Accord targets have been rescheduled. Despite the
strengthening of the tax administration, increasing the tax burden is one of the areas where
performance has been below the expectations of the Accords. Although the project's tax-revenue
target was successfully met, at 10.3 percent of GDP in 2006 the current tax burden is still below
the 12 percent target agreed under the Peace Accords.

As mentioned earlier, the tax reform agenda has been especially controversial, being strongly
opposed by powerful interests on both the right and left and subject to the decisions of the
Constitutional Court. While the improvements in tax administration have largely offset the impact
of unfavorable constitutional court rulings on taxes, they have not succeeded in substantially
increasing tax revenues at the levels agreed under the Peace Accord. However, the Government
has managed to make the fiscal room necessary to increase social spending to about 6 percent of
GDP in 2006. The increased spending has resulted in better and more social services, such as the
establishment of new community-based maternal, child health and nutritional programs. Likewise,
public investments in basic infrastructure can also be expected to have a positive effect on
poverty alleviation.

Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement in Guatemala that the Accords remain the basis of the
country's medium term development. In the area of tax policy, the Government is attempting to
shift the focus of the public dialogue to social needs, its costs and the revenue requirements of
meeting them. Tax reform is an important part of the national dialogue on Guatemala's future
development pattern that aims to reach a broader consensus among different, civil society groups,
the private sector and the political parties. On the positive side, with the support of the SAT TAL
operation, Guatemala has undertaken substantial steps to modernize and increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of its tax administration. Although not a sufficient condition to resolve
Guatemala's revenue challenge, having a sound tax administration is indeed a necessary one.
Once societal agreement is reached on the policy side, the country will have the institutional
readiness to fully capitalize on it. In the meantime, SAT's increased effectiveness has helped
ameliorate the negative impacts of the adverse changes in tax policy.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The SAT TAL project's institutional development impact has been high, contributing toward the
creation and consolidation of an autonomous tax agency, a core institution within Guatemala's



                                               18

public sector. Under the project, SAT has taken an important step towards enhancing its
institutional effectiveness through the development of an integrated vision and the establishment
of basic processes and systems supporting vertical and horizontal integration. The improvements
in tax administration have been substantial, deserving the endorsement of the IMF and others.
By developing modern management tools, the SAT has made substantial progress toward
diminishing the room for discretional decision making and enhancing transparency. These
management tools include an integrated management information system (PROSIS), the Single
Taxpayer Account (Cuenta Corriente Integrada), and the SAQB'E (i.e., "transparent path" in
Mayan), which is to replace the current customs management system (SIAG). The development
of critical databases such as the Tax Registry (Registro Tributario) will contribute to more
efficient and transparent tax administration by providing critical information in an accurate and
timely manner. As the SAT continues to move toward the automatization of processes through
the incorporation of information systems and management tools, it is crucial to ensure their
integrity in terms of internal and external safety, access to private information, and overall
transparency of the systems. The SAT has already taken important steps in this direction,
including strengthening technical expertise in the area of ICT within its internal auditing arm,
obtaining certification for readiness against external hacker attacks, contracting an external firm
to audit its systems, and ensuring that all new information systems and management tools are
fully transparent and can be easily audited.

The SAT has taken substantial steps toward enhancing the integrity of its personnel. It has
replaced roughly 300 out of a total of 800 customs employees, including the `take-over' of the
main ports by replacing existing field personnel with new hires. The personnel turnover program
is still ongoing, with existing personnel being required to undergo training as well as integrity
testing to remain in the SAT. Tests aimed at probing employees' integrity (polygraphs and more
recently voice-stress analysis) are being routinely utilized as part of the hiring and promotion
practices. The SAT's Internal Audit unit has been strengthened significantly to include also an
anti-corruption area. As a result of internal investigations, a total of 195 SAT employees (incl. 22
managers) were dismissed during 2005 and 2006. Alliances with civil society groups such as the
Transparency Coalition are also important steps toward enhancing SAT's institutional integrity.

With the support from the operation, the SAT has taken an active role in promoting changes to
the tax law to enhance tax administration. The most notable achievement in this area was the
passage of the Anti-Evasion law (Decree 20-2006). The objective of this important piece of
legislation included provisions for, inter alia, VAT tax withholding, requiring the registration of
printing companies to eliminate false tax receipts, increasing access to ports, and hardening the
penalties for tax evasion. The impact of this legislation has been remarkable, including an
increase in VAT revenues equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP, and an 18 percent reduction in VAT
credits during the first three months of implementation. A follow-up legislation (Anti-Evasion II)
is currently being prepared with close technical support from the IMF. It has been presented to
key stakeholders within civil society (e.g., the Grupo de Diálogo del Pacto Fiscal) and is
expected to be presented to Congress before the end of the year.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

This operation, as well as the overall Bank assistance strategy carried out in Guatemala during the
1990s, responded to the priorities set for Bank interventions in post-conflict reconstruction
(World Bank, Post-Conflict Reconstruction: The Role of the World Bank [1998], pp. 25-26).
Specifically, the assistance aimed at: i) jump-starting the economy by supporting the conditions
for macroeconomic stabilization and rehabilitation of financial institutions; ii) reconstructing the
framework of governance; iii) repairing the physical infrastructure; iv) rebuilding and


                                                19

maintaining key social infrastructure; and v) targeting assistance to individuals harmed by the war
and revitalizing local communities hurt by conflict. This operation responded directly to priorities
i) and ii) and indirectly to priorities iii) through v).

3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N.A.

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The sustainability of the achievements of the SAT TAL operation is deemed Moderate, given
that there is the risk of slippage as a result of changes in leadership. Although the presidential
frontrunners have expressed their intention to continue on the path of reform, the upcoming
elections clearly bring uncertainty to the continuation of the ongoing tax administration reforms.
While to continue to move forward with SAT's modernization would clearly require the presence
of a reform-minded management team and strong political support progress made to date is likely
to endure changes in leadership. Unlike in 2000-2003, when the SAT was just in its beginnings, it
now has achieved a degree of institutional maturity and has broader support among key political,
economic and civil actors. The SAT's survival under a purposely destructive leadership, as was
the case in 2003, attests to its institutional resilience.

The next six months (i.e., the time remaining for the present administration) will be crucial to the
sustainability of the project and, more importantly, the SAT itself. There are key actions that the
current SAT management hopes to achieve, including passage of a follow-up anti-evasion
legislation that would address persisting weaknesses in the current tax administration framework;
the formal adoption of an administrative career that would consolidate the stability of SAT
personnel; and the deployment of an integrated management system in customs (SAQB'E) that
would continue to reduce discretional decisions on the part of the SAT staff and strengthen the
integrity and transparency of ITC tools.

There are several factors that mitigate the risk associated with potential changes in leadership. In
addition to the strong ownership of SAT's mission and vision within the institution, several
factors help reduce this risk including: i) the agency's autonomy granted by law; ii) the demand-
induced pressures for reform resulting from improved performance; iii) the heightened role of
public consultation organisms; iv) the continuous support of international and bilateral agencies;
and v) the strong ownership within SAT of its newly developed strategic plan for the 2008-2001

At the same time, it is important to note that stronger political will be needed to achieve a
substantial increase in tax revenues in line with the expectations defined under the Peace Accords.
Political support will be required not just on the part of the executive branch but also from the
legislative and judicial branches of government. Widening the tax base is the obvious next
challenge as there are limits to the potential gains that can be obtained from further improvements
in tax administration (as an illustration, should all the tax administration measures being
suggested as part of the Anti-Evasion Law II, the anticipated fiscal impact is roughly 1 percent of
GDP).

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

During preparation, the Bank team contributed its cross-country experience in Latin America,
providing access to a wide range of national and international specialists with ample experience
in both tax administration and Guatemala's tax administration.           9 In this manner, SAT's
institutional imprint capitalized on the lessons learned and successes obtained elsewhere in the
region (particularly in Peru). During the two years of project preparation, the Bank's technical
assistance went beyond project preparation activities to focus on the design of SAT's institutional
imprint--including defining an organizational chart, human development needs, an ITC
strategy--and implementation strategy. The Bank team helped the Government shape the original
SAT legislation, as well as design and evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of
alternative implementation scenarios. The Bank's retroactive financing was crucial in providing
the Government with the financial resources necessary for the SAT's design. The new tax agency
was designed by Guatemalan officials and external consultants, drawing on diagnostic studies of
the IMF, USAID and others. Close collaboration with the IMF from the onset of the project
proved to be extremely valuable, with the IMF contributing expertise not only on tax policy but
also on tax administration. The Bank team succeeded in adequately gauging the progress that
could be made in terms of tax administration even in the absence of an aggressive reform on tax
policy, as shown by the end-of-project target on tax revenues as a percentage of GDP. Partly as
the result of the lack of reliable tax administration data during preparation, the Bank team did not
succeed in developing a robust Results Framework to adequately measure the operation's impact.

The operation also benefited from previous sector work, including the 1996 Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM), which provided valuable input for the negotiations on the Peace Accord
and contributed to the design of Bank operations in public sector modernization, including the
SAT TAL project. Moreover, the operation benefited from the successful experience of the First
Financial Management Project (Loan No.P007213; May 1995) and the fact that the same task
manager was responsible for both operations, which allowed building upon existing working
relationships between the Bank and the Ministry of Finance. Although not intentionally planned
as such, tackling the spending side of the public-finances equation through the FMP-I before
addressing the revenue-side through the SAT TAL proved to be a sound logical sequencing of the
operations, as it made it easier to respond to familiar arguments against increased taxation that
pointed to corruption and mismanagement of public resources.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

A QSA07 panel rated the overall quality of project supervision as Marginally Satisfactory,
Specifically, the Focus on Development Effectiveness and Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguard
Aspects was rated as Satisfactory, while the Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Process and the
Candor and Quality of ISR were rated as Moderately Satisfactory. While the supervision Team

was praised for doing an excellent job at maintaining client engagement, providing tax
administration technical assistance on sophisticated issues such as evasion studies and legal
framework, thus promoting the achievement of the project's development objectives, the QSA
points to its lack of success in enforcing the many implementation plans created during the life of
the project, or the yearly procurement plans. In addition, the QSA panel found the assessments
reported in Aide-memoires and ISRs regarding the SAT capacity to implement the project was
deemed as overly positive. Accordingly, the Panel considered that the IP ratings should have been
downgraded in FY05 and FY06 to signal to the agency the need to follow the agreed plans very
closely.

The ICR agrees with the QSA overall assessment, also noting that the supervision reports during
2002 and 2003 were overly optimistic and did not fully reflect the challenges and risks facing the
operation during that period. At the same time, it is important to note the contribution of the
supervision team to the accomplishment of the project's development objectives. In particularly,
the Bank mobilized a strong project team to support the design and implementation of this project.
Throughout the life of the project, the Bank provided considerable technical assistance through
the project team and consultants in core substantive areas. This technical assistance was highly
valued by the Borrower--even more, perhaps, than the financial support provided under the loan
in question. Despite the at times frustrating implementation process, the Bank team continued its
full engagement with the project, working with the PCU and the SAT's middle management
when political support was lacking. The Bank team built strategic alliances with other donors,
including the IMF and the IDB, not only to maximize the impact of the technical and financial
assistance aimed at SAT, but also to protect the SAT and its accomplishments amidst hostile
political conditions. Moreover, the Bank team successfully introduced effective risk control
measures when negotiating agreements with the Government at critical junctures of project
implementation. For example, in 2003, when dealing with the SAT Board's refusal to extend the
contract to the international consultant firm that had been responsible for supporting the SAT in
its reform program, as well as with Congressional pressure to reallocate loan proceeds to finance
physical infrastructure, the Bank team successfully negotiated an agreement that minimized risks
to the project, ensuring that i) consulting services would continue to be provided by an
international firm selected under Bank guidelines; ii) the terms of reference for the new firms
would be those already approved by the Bank for the original contract extensions; and iii) the
civil-works and consultancy sub-components of the customs reform would be carried out jointly
as a single process. These terms minimized the potential negative effects of the 2002 amendment
by preventing SAT management from carrying out the less controversial and politically attractive
construction of customs posts and infrastructure in the short term, while postponing the more
difficult and substantial institutional reforms. This is just one illustration of the many challenges
that arose during project implementation and how the Bank supervision team was able to address
them satisfactorily.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank succeeded in capitalizing on the window of opportunity that opened in Guatemala in
the mid-1990s, with the stabilization of the economy and the end of over thirty years of civil war.
Having played a key role as an honest broker during the peace negotiations, the Bank continued
to support the peace process after the signing of the 1996 Peace Accords through a robust
portfolio that responded to the country's post-conflict needs. The SAT TAL project was a key
component in the Bank's strategy, as it helped support economic stability and increase spending
in social services and basic infrastructure, as well as attain specific targets agreed under the
umbrella of the Peace Accords. The Bank's contribution was substantial as it provided critically


                                               22

needed and timely financing. It also contributed high-quality technical advice based on
worldwide and regional experience in tax administration, and conveyed credibility and
transparency to the reform effort.

The Bank, together with the IMF and others, played an active advocacy role, communicating to
key actors within the executive branch, the legislature, the private sector and civil society the
importance of first creating an independent and professionalized tax administration and later
preserving SAT's autonomy. For example, during preparation, the Bank helped coordinate high
profile visits by supportive international experts and officials, including the IMF Managing
Director and European Union Commissioner, to support the creation of the SAT. Later on, in
2001 the Bank team organized a meeting with public officials, key donor agencies (MINUGUA,
IMF, USAID, IDB) and several foreign ambassadors to show the progress achieved by the SAT
and the project, in an effort to offset attempts in Congress to strip the SAT of its autonomy.
The CMU's decision to maintain the operation during the difficult 2000-2003 period clearly paid
off. While the project's poor disbursement performance and the adverse implementation
environment provided ample justification for the project's cancellation, the Bank's management
also took into consideration overall country conditions and the strategic importance of the SAT
and decided to continue with the project while purposely slowing down the rhythm of
implementation. In view of the operation's eventual turn-around and its overall impact, the Bank
management team--including the CMU, the country Resident mission and the sector leaders--
should be given credit for their decision, which resulted in a solid project that helped the country
move closer to its fiscal goals, as well as provided a model for organizational reform more
generally.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government played a key role during project preparation, exhibiting high ownership and
commitment, despite the potential political costs of tax reform. It effectively sought assistance
from international financial institutions and bi-lateral cooperation agencies not only to obtain
financial support for its efforts to improve tax administration, but more importantly, technical
expertise. Although the Government did not have an automatic majority in Congress, it obtained
the 2/3 majority needed to approve the creation of the SAT by conducting an aggressive
communications campaign aimed not only at legislators but also the private sector and the society
at large. In a rarely used procedure, the Minister of Finance personally presented the bill to
Congress to underscore the strong political support on the part of the administration and the
strategic importance of the legislation.

Political support for the project--and the SAT itself--waned during the 2000-2003 period. The
project was actively sabotaged in various ways, including by not assigning implementation
resources within the framework of the national budget law. In 2003 SAT management made an
active attempt to dismantle the institution by removing key managers, appointing personnel in a
discretionary manner, thereby seriously hindering SAT's governance.

The situation was drastically reversed in 2004, as the new administration took a firm stand against
the abuses of the previous period. Several high-profile government officials, including SAT's
former Superintendent, were incarcerated on corruption charges. A former director of
Guatemala's Central Bank and one of the five members of SAT's first Board of Directors was
appointed as Superintendent. Highly familiar with the agency and its founding principles, he took


                                                23

swift measures to rebuild the agency's governance and gave new momentum to its modernization
agenda. Appointed in 2005, the current Superintendent was also highly familiar with the SAT's
challenges and aspirations as she had been in charge of project preparation back in 1997-1998.
She has provided strong leadership and a clear vision, making it possible to accelerate and
consolidate SAT's modernization process and transforming the SAT in to one of Guatemala's
most reputable public agencies. Not surprisingly, over 37 percent of the project's disbursements
took place during her tenure.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PCU reported directly to the SAT Superintendent and the Board, providing a crucial link
between SAT officials, managers and the Bank. The PCU comprised a very solid project
management and technical team. The PCU staff was highly stable during project implementation,
which was critical to ensuring continuity and the project's survival during periods of poor
political and institutional climate. Moreover, during the 2002-2003 period, the PCU acted as a
barrier protecting against the misuse of project funds.

Despite the unfavorable implementation environment, particularly during the period between
2002 and 2003, the project succeeded in making considerable technical headway, largely as a
result of the commitment toward reform of SAT's middle management and the unwavering
commitment of the PCU. From 2004 onward, the PCU effectively capitalized on the political
support that it received from SAT's top management and, in turn, fully supported their
modernization efforts. Throughout the life of the project, the PCU coordinated implementation
efforts in the various areas, exhibiting a flexible and cooperative attitude not only vis-à-vis the
various units within the SAT but also with the Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory for the reasons outlined above.
However, it is important to point out that overall Borrower performance from 2005 onward has
been critical to the operation's success, as the factors threatening the success of the project were
successfully addressed and project implementation took renewed momentum. Moreover, the
SAT has committed substantial financial resources to ensure that the reforms initiated under this
operation have continuity over time.

6.       Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Lessons of general application

    Taxes are, by their very nature, community-based systems since they represent a societal
decision to contribute to common assets--such as infrastructure, education and health care--and
to support the most vulnerable groups. Thus, for tax administration projects to be successful,
society at large needs to be incorporated in the design process. As illustrated by the experience of
the SAT TAL operation, the Bank and other international institutions can play a key advocate role,
helping to create awareness and to build support for needed tax reforms not just among key
agency staff and the executive branch, but also the legislature and the judicial branches of
government, the private sector, and the community at large.




                                               24

    Creating mechanisms to channel input from taxpayers, businesses, and other stakeholders is
another critical step toward building a community-based tax system. The SAT has actively
involved representatives of the larger community through various participatory mechanisms such
as customs user groups and the strategic alliance with public, private and civil actors to enhance
the transparency of customs operations. The inclusion of the larger community has resulted not
only in regular feedback and greater oversight of SAT's performance, but also in expanding
support for the SAT and its modernization efforts among a broader base of constituencies.

    When stakes are high, it can be important for the Bank to "stick around," even in the face of
poor project performance. The experience from the SAT TAL operation illustrates that the
challenges faced in the implementation of tax reforms are not only technical and institutional but
also political in nature. The political opposition that created such difficult implementation
conditions was directly proportional to the magnitude of the change brought about by the actions
being supported under the project. Guatemala's experience shows that, in times of adversity, the
continuation of ongoing Bank projects can help protect the progress made so far.

    Tax law does not operate in a vacuum and often has "unintended consequences," which the
tax agency can help elucidate for lawmakers. The experience in Guatemala indicates that
lawmakers are often unaware of the multiple ramifications of seemingly innocuous changes to the
tax law. The technical assessment of the impact of such changes on the part of the Ministry of
Finance and SAT should be a crucial input in the legislative process.

    Institutional factors that can hinder the sustainability of tax administration reforms include:
resistance to change that is ingrained in most bureaucracies, lack of top management support, and
lack of continuity in top management. Political factors that can hinder the sustainability of tax
administration reforms include: pressure from powerful vested interests, lack of understanding on
the part of lawmakers, and, of course, lack of political will.

Project-specific lessons

    As in the case of the SAT TAL project, it is important to emphasize not only enforcement but
also voluntary compliance and communication campaigns in the design process to foster a
mutually supportive attitude between the tax authority and the community.

    Developing an institutional strategic plan was an important trigger of SAT's modernization
process, as it helped galvanize a home-grown vision of the reform agenda. Centralizing
responsibilities for M&E systems within the planning unit was also an important step.

    Integrity is a fundamental cornerstone in the development of sound tax administration. The
SAT has made substantial efforts to enhance the integrity and of its personnel, including the
requirement for all SAT employees to make an annual declaration of patrimony that is subject to
random checks by the internal auditing department. Likewise, the utilization of voice stress
analysis (VSA) technology as part of the recruiting process has deterred those that are not
qualified from applying (e.g., to be eligible for reassignment, customs personnel that had been
removed during the "takeover" were required to undergo the VSA; the large majority decided not
to re-apply).

    Progress in tax administration depends upon profound cultural change. Often, this change has
to be induced drastically, as the toxicity of the existing environment can suffocate gradual efforts.
In the case of customs, this challenge was overcome by the SAT's "takeover" of the main ports,
when existing personnel were replaced all at once with new recruits who had received intensive
training.



                                                25

    While technology can be both a facilitator and a driver of change, it is not a substitute for the
development of sound institutional, organizational and operational systems. This was adequately
recognized during the design process of the SAT TAL project.

    The experience of the SAT TAL project indicates that it is not appropriate to include major
civil works in technical assistance projects, as it adds undue complexity to the implementation
process.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies (this section presents a summary of the Borrower's
comments; for full text, see Annex 7).

According to the Borrower, the results of the evaluation presented in this document are
reasonably balanced. Specifically, the Borrower highlights that, as indicated by the ICR, the SAT
faced serious difficulties in implementing this loan during the presidential administration
corresponding to the period 2000-2003 as a result of political pressures and an overall
deterioration in governance within the institution. These difficulties, in turn, reflect SAT's
vulnerability in the face of political changes and changes in leadership. The Borrower also
highlights that, as reported in the ICR, substantial progress has been made during the current
administration, which has resulted in SAT's prominent position within Guatemala's public sector.

Other observations made by the Borrower include: i) it is important to note that increases in tax
burden as a percentage of GDP do not fully reflect SAT's performance, as there have been
numerous factors beyond SAT's influence--including unfavorable court rulings, reduction or
elimination of existing taxes by Congress, and reduced tariffs as a result of free-trade
agreements--that have negatively affected tax collections; ii) the delays experienced in the
procurement of civil works also reflect the inflexibility and complexity of the Bank's
procurement methods; iii) SAT's inability to fully capitalize on uncollected tax revenues
identified by SAT's auditing mechanisms are mainly the result of external actors, including the
Public Ministry and the courts; and iv) the SAT's Board has approved new internal regulations
regarding SAT's organizational structure and the specific functions of each unit to reduce the
impact of potential future changes in leadership.

(b) Cofinanciers

Although no co-financing arrangements were in place, the IMF has collaborated closely with the
Bank on Guatemala's tax policy and tax administration from the beginning of the project.
Accomplishments have been closely monitored and assessed in a joint effort. The latest IMF-
IBRD assessment shows significant progress in achieving the SAT's strategic tax administration
reform plan (PEI) from mid-2005 onward. Nearly half of the measures identified in the PEI have
been fully implemented and nearly all of the remaining conditions are currently in process. A key
finding of the assessment is that the general government objectives on tax administration and
customs have been met. The IMF report (2007) states that the SAT has a sound management
team, well-structured operation plans, and increasing effectiveness.' In October 2006 the IMF-
Director for Fiscal Affairs publicly praised the SAT's accomplishments during interviews with
the media (see, among other, Prensa Libre and Siglo XXI, Oct. 10, 2006).10

Financial management system in place by 6/98.                                      Achieved
Other Outputs
The outcomes anticipated at appraisal have been either achieved or exceeded.
     Human resources management: This is one of the areas most severely hit during the low-
governance period in 2003. There was an increment on the arbitrary placement and transfer of
personnel and no formal evaluation processes took place. The situation has been reversed and not
hiring and promotion practices respond to standardized processes. New recruits and personnel up
for promotion have to pass an integrity test (polygraph or, more recently, SVA). SAT's new
integrated management system (PROSIS) is being utilized for human resources management.
Performance-based bonuses that incorporated carefully designed performance measures were
implemented in 2005 and 2006. Although training was ad hoc early on, it is increasingly
becoming an integral part of SAT human resource management (i.e., 88.8% of SAT personnel
received training during 2006). The SAT is currently developing an ambitious organizational
career plan (carrera administrativa) that would decrease discretionality in the areas of human
resources management even further.
     Information and Communication Technologies (ITCs): The SAT datacenter is one of the best
in the country. All SAT agencies and offices are connected online. As the SAT continues to move
toward the automatization of processes through the incorporation of information systems and
management tools, it is crucial to ensure their integrity in terms of internal and external safety,
access to private information, and systems transparency. The SAT has already taken important
steps in this direction, including strengthening technical expertise in the area of ICT within its
internal auditing arm, obtaining certification for readiness against external hacker attacks,
contracting an external firm to audit its systems, and ensuring the all new information systems
and management tools are fully transparent and can be easily audited.
     Internal Auditing: The SAT's Internal Audit unit has been strengthened significantly to also
include an anti-corruption area. As a result of internal investigations, a total of 195 SAT
employees (incl. 22 managers) were dismissed during 2005 and 2006. Alliances with civil society
groups such as the Transparency Coalition, also constitute an important step toward setting in
place external, non-public controls on SAT's institutional integrity.
    Administrative efficiency: SAT has substantially increased its operational efficiency as shown
also by the increase in tax revenues per employee, from Q$8.4 million in 2003 to Q$9.6 million
in 2006.
2. Improved tax and customs collections
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal
Special Taxpayers Unit established by 1/98.                           Achieved 6/99

systems by 12/98.                                          Since Jan. 1999, tax forms and payments
                                                           are processed through local banks. As of
                                                             Dec. 2006, the BANCASAT system
                                                               channels 92% of all tax revenues
                                                            (equivalent to 30% of all transactions)
                                                                        electronically.
New customs collection system in place in four
locations by 12/98 and all locations by 6/99.                             Achieved

Other Outputs
The outcomes anticipated at appraisal have been either achieved or exceeded.
    In addition to the Large Taxpayers Coordination unit, which is responsible for monitoring the
country's 300 largest taxpayers, a Special Taxpayer unit was established to administer the
subsequent 3,500 largest taxpayers (expected to increase to 5,000 by the end of the year).
"Account officers" have been assigned responsibility to manage specific taxpayer files. Electronic
filing using SAT software has been required of nearly 3,500 largest taxpayers.
    Customs reforms: In 2004-2005, the SAT embarked on an ambitious reform effort targeting
the still inefficient customs operations. Reduction in customs processing times and costs were
achieved through the implementation of an electronic customs manifest in all ports and airports,
the establishment of      a 24/7 air express office at Aurora Airport and one-stop offices for
documentation analysis established at border crossings with CA neighbors, the implementation of
a single customs declaration (harmonized with other CA countries) in place of two; and the
reduction in discretionality and number of customs inspections (red light channels) through
implementation of risk assessment and selectivity system based on SAT databases and
information. Field personnel have been replaced by new hires in all major ports. A new customs
audit system (Aduana Móvil) has been implemented. A new integrated management system
(SAQB'E) is being developed which will replace the existing one (SIAG), enhancing the integrity
of customs processes. Guatemala has subscribed with the US an agreement to ensure container
safety (CSI). An ambitious security plan (Puerto Seguro) is being implemented which includes
sealing and identification of all containers upon arrival, the recording and Internet broadcasting of
key customs operations, and the improvement in the physical infrastructure (perimeter walls,
exits, etc.). Customs user groups now meet regularly in the three main ports to discuss and
provide feedback on the day-to-day functions of customs operations in these locations.
     Development of modern management tools: The SAT has made substantial progress toward
diminishing the room for discretional decision making and enhancing transparency by developing
modern management tools, including an integrated management information system (PROSIS),
the SAQB'E (it means `transparent path' in Mayan), which is to replace the current customs
management system (SIAG), and the Single Taxpayer Account (Cuenta Corriente Integrada).
3. Enhanced voluntary compliance
Outputs Anticipated at Appraisal

                                                                           by banks still needs
                                                                         substantial improvement.

                                                                               is still ongoing
Other Outputs

The outcomes anticipated at appraisal have been largely achieved.
     User-support tools: The SAT has also designed a set of electronic tools to support taxpayer
compliance and communications (e.g., AsisteLibros, RetenISR, RetenIVA, ExenIVA and
PlanIVA@SAIT). All these tools can be downloaded through SAT robust website
     Communications with users: A new service has been developed (BuzonSAT) that allows each
taxpayer a free internet account with the SAT.
     Development of critical databases: Although still in need of substantial depuration, the
Single Tax Registry (Registro Tributario) will contribute toward a more efficient and transparent
tax administration by providing critical information in an accurate and timely manner.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The project was expected to have a positive fiscal impact resulting from administrative reforms
aimed at improving effectiveness in tax collection and auditing, and by increasing the tax base
through improved mechanisms in registry and taxpayer services. Specifically, it was estimated
that the reforms would result in a permanent increased in annual tax revenues of about 1 percent
of GDP with respect to the 1996 tax burden from the year 2000 onwards. It is important to note
that actual tax revenues in 1996 were higher as a proportion of GDP (8.8 percent) than the
preliminary estimates utilized at appraisal (8.5 percent), thus resulting in two possible end-of-
project targets.

Although it is not possible to distinguish between the impact of the project itself and that of
external factors, actual increases in tax revenues as a proportion of GDP were higher than
anticipated. Figure 3.1 shows that the actual tax burden was consistently exceeded the 9.5 percent
of GDP mark between 2000 and 2006. If, alternatively, 9.8 percent of GDP is considered as the
end-of-project target, the actual tax burden was slightly below in 2000 (i.e., 9.6 percent) but
achieved or exceeded every year from 2001 onward (see Figure 3.2).

The aggregate value of the difference between actual net tax revenues and those anticipated at
appraisal between 2000 and 2006 amounts to US$576 million (see Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1). The
9.8 percent of GDP mark is utilized to estimate expected tax revenues. The GDP and tax revenues
series are expressed in real terms, using 2000 Quetzals. The exchange rate used to convert
Quetzals to US dollars corresponds to December 2000. The Consumer Price Index is used to
convert 2000 US dollars (4th quarter) to 2007 US dollars (2nd quarter).

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


I.1 En términos generales, los resultados de la evaluación contenida en este documento se
presentan de una manera razonablemente equilibrada, indicando que durante la administración
gubernamental 2000-2003, la Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria-SAT enfrentó
dificultades importantes para la ejecución del préstamo referido debido a presiones políticas y al
deterioro de la transparencia institucional; lo cual refleja la vulnerabilidad de la Institución ante
cambios políticos y de liderazgo; así mismo se enuncia que, durante la actual administración
gubernamental, han habido avances importantes que han llegado a posicionar a la SAT en una
situación preeminente dentro del sector público.

Sin embargo, es importante mencionar que en el tema relativo a la ejecución de inversión en
infraestructura, en el documento se indica que SAT y particularmente a la Unidad Coordinadora
del Proyecto-UCP es responsable en forma parcial de lentitud en los desembolsos para la
ejecución, mismos que provocaron atrasos y "errores"; así mismo se menciona la implementación
de garantías con el propósito de evitar en el futuro, los errores mencionados. Al respecto, se
sugiere considerar también la responsabilidad del BM por la aplicación de procedimientos
complejos e inflexibles.

I.2 Con relación a los resultados de recaudación tributaria, medida como porcentaje del Producto
Interno Bruto, no se incluye una referencia adecuada sobre los obstáculos que ha sorteado la
Administración Tributaria durante el período de ejecución de este préstamo, entre los cuales se
puede mencionar:

        · Incremento de beneficios concedidos a los exportadores según Decreto 29-89, por
            exportaciones realizadas a Centroamérica (Según Decreto 38-04).

        · Innumerables recursos de inconstitucionalidad que dejaron en suspenso o sin efecto
            algunas normas tributarias, con el consecuente menoscabo a la recaudación tributaria.

        · Acumulación de una presa de solicitudes de devolución de crédito fiscal del IVA de
            los exportadores, que al regularizarse en 2005 implicó una reducción de la
            recaudación tributaria neta.

        · Reducción de los Derechos Arancelarios de Importación por acuerdos incluidos en
            los Tratados de Libre Comercio y reducción del Impuesto a Empresas IETAAP
            durante 2006.

I.3 Continuando en el tema de la recaudación, es necesario que para comparar adecuadamente los
resultados de la misma en el año 1995 con la de años posteriores, se tome en consideración que la
recaudación del Impuesto Único sobre bienes Inmuebles- IUSI fue incluida en los datos de 1995,
sin embargo, por traslado de la administración de dicho impuesto a las municipalidades en los
años posteriores ya no se incluye en los datos de recaudación.

I.4 El Informe indica que debido a las pocas mejoras en la gestión del departamento jurídico no
se ha podido potenciar la recaudación por ajustes de Auditoría. Esta afirmación es cuestionable,
porque los principales obstáculos son la debilidad en el accionar del Ministerio Público y del
Organismo Judicial.

I.5 Con respecto al análisis de riesgo de la sustentabilidad de las reformas, se hace notar que, con
el objeto de blindar a la institución ante posibles cambios de liderazgo, se emitió un nuevo
Reglamento Interno (Acuerdo de Directorio 007-2007) que establece normas relativas al
funcionamiento de la estructura organizacional y define mejor las funciones de cada dependencia
de la SAT, para reducir los espacios a decisiones discrecionales.
