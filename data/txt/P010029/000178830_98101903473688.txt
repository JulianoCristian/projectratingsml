training, extension, and various other government services.   In industry
the growring labor force is lacking in skiiis at aii levels, but the most
critica7 shortage is at the intermediate technician level. (paras.h-6)
A Unesco Tlission on technical education (1961) foresaw an annual requirement
by 1970 for 12,000 new technicians as against an annual output in 196C) of
500.  (para.22)
iii)      In 1961 following the recommendation of the Food and Agriculture
Commission (1960) an agricultural imiversity was established in each
province - at Lyallpur, Wlest Pakistan and at Mymensingh, East Pakistan,
with projected enrollment capacitieas of 5,000 and 2,500 students respectively.
(paras. 32-73)   Tn May, 1962 the government adopted a "Ten Year Development
Plan for Polytecthnic/Technical Institutes of Pakistan" calling for the
establishment of thirty-six technician training institutions of all types
with an annual output capacity of approximately 7,000 technicians.(para.25)
The fou.rteen technical institutes covered in this report are a part of
this Plan. (paras.73-89)   To provide staffing for all these technical
institutes an accelerated technica.l teacher training program at the
already established technical institutes in Dacca, Karachi and Rawalpindi
will be necessary. In turn the development of the teacher training
colleges will require the temporary services of foreign teachers and oversea
training for their Pakistani counterparts. (paras. 91-96)
iv)       There will be an adequate supply of candidates for admission
to these institutions and of job op:portunities for their graduates.  The
education and training programs madle possible by the establishment of
these agricultural and technical irnstitutions will not meet all the currently
foreseeable needs of the country fDr professional agriculturalists arid
industrial technicians, but they will substantially alleviate critical
shortages in these two categories of manpower.

development of curricula and administration, training of staff, planning of

teams from IWJashington State University and Texas Agricultural and Mechanical
College. In similar respects the program for technician training is being
assisted by advisers from Oklahoma State Universitv sponsored by the Ford
Foundation. The same university will assist in the training of technical
teachers and is providine an expert to advise on the procurement of equipment
f'or the technical institutes.  (paras. 72-73;  97-100)
vi)       With a few minor exceptions the design and scale of buildings to
be constr-nted are apprnpniate   The9v are chqracteri7ed on the whole by a

of total project costs between major categories, i.e. construction,
equipment, and personnel. As a generai ruie approximately 20l of the cost
of construction in the project and 8CF% of the cost of equipment will require
foreign exchange. Approximately 60t% of the personnel costs will be in
f'oreign exchange. On this basis .810 million of the total cost of 8)26
milliion for the two projects will be in foreign exchange. (see Tables 13 & lh).
ix)       In each province the credit shall be applied to the payment in

universities (project items 1-16) and. of personnel costs of the technical
teacher training programs. The balance of the credits in each province
shall be applied to construction costs at the two agricultural universities.
The estimated date of completion for the last item is 1968. (para. 30)
x)        The projects are suitable bases for development credits equivalent
to $4.5 million for East Pakistan and. 8.5 million for West Pakistan
provided the borrowers meet the requirements set forth in paragraph 12b.
The remaining costs of the project estimated to be about 813 million
equivalent will be financed by the gcvernment.

2.        In 1959 a Nqational Commission on Education reviewed the Pakistan
educational sys+em as a wrhole and provrided a framei.w7ork of goals and policies
for its modernization and development.   The second Five Year Plan (1960-6e5)
emphasizes technical education.   In 1961 a UNESCO Mission further reported on
developmer.t needs in th 1 e fiel  of tehnca  edctin     In ---   ,4,- - T  1904r th  rpo  o
the Food and Agriculture Commission stressed the need for expanded training in
agricul1tu,re.

Pakistan submitted a request for an IDA credit to assist in financing facilities
flor exp-d.ledl technical ar,tdL agriculturalU edUUcationU1i411 in e.LILh insLti.LULti.Llons o. p.r-
fessional le-vel and over thirty institutions at the technician and craft level.
An IDA appraisal Mis;3L0n visited Pakistan in  September-October, 1962 to e.valuate
this request against the educational needs of the country as a whole, but at
that t.mLe noI  e of the projectb items were ready for financing.  rurther vi.sits
were made by two members of the mission in March-April, 1963.    Of forty pro-
ject items presented, nineteen are read;y and suitable for financing at thi-s
time.   Of the other twenty-one, some were substantially completed when first
examinea ana some are noL yet ready.   Tne nineteen project items selected
comprise two agricultural universities, fourteen technical institutes, ancd three
technical teacher training colleges.   Some of these project items involve ex-
pansion of existing facilities or completion of partially built institutions.
Others involve completely new establishments.   The technical teacher training
colleges require primarily technical assistance for expansion of the training
program.   Annex 1 lists the individual project items by type, location, and
the amount of the proposed IDA credits involved.
II.  SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
4.        The human resource development of Pakistan as elsewhere, can be
evaluated only within the context of the nation's emerging life as a whole.
Some of the conditions which bear upon the development of Pakistan are character-
istic of other countries in its present stage of growth.   But there are other
conditions which are peculiar to it and which aggravate its problems of develop-
ment.   Among these are the separation of the East and West provinces, the prob-
lems of water shortage, salinity, and waterlogging in the West and of periodic
floods and poor communications in the East, and the loss of a considerable por-
tion of its high level manpower during the post-partition migrations.    The
effect is to accentuate the need for technical and professional training in a
wide variety of fields.

5.        The population growth rate of Pakistan has been rising during the
past decade and is currently estimated at 2.2% per year.    The 1961 census
places population in East Pakistan at 51 million and in West Pakistan at 43
million.   In East Pakistan 95% of the population is rural, in West Pakistan
77%.   Agriculture accounts for more than half the national product and for
some three-quarters of total employment.   Employment in agriculture will con-
tinue to rise absolutely and should remain predominant for considerable time
to come.   However, output of large-scale industry has been rising at a ral;e
of 10-12% per year, in line with Plan targets, and employment in industry,
including transport, now accounts for over :10% of all employment.   Non-
agricultural employment is increasing as expected at a rate of 5% per year
during the Second Plan period.
6.        The general standard of living is still low, with a G.N.P. per head
in 1960-61 of a little over Rs. 315 in East Pakistan and Rs. 397 in West
Pakistan.   The population density of East Pakistan - 922 per sauare mile
is among the highest in the world; density in West Pakistan is 139 per square
mile.   The government budget in 1962-63 reinresents 17% of G.N.P., but inc:Ludes
a great deal of external aid, since total current revenue amounts to less than
10% of G.N.P.   In summarv Pakistan iS a eountrv of low income and productivitv,
of underdeveloped resources, both physical and human, and of limited dispoSable
revenue for investment.

7-        The nation wrhich was created in 1'37 had tfw)o m.a n r riiictionnl tasks
confronting it.   The first consisted of mocderrizing the educational system
;in  *4ni ri +. nviri  ,  9t - . +1%  +h;  c,Yn A ^n-r.l rA  m1; -ii 1  ,  9  h 1-lgnv, 1 9;i r, ,A,ria
in the National Commission Report of 1959.   The second task was quantitative
eFar,sion at <1l  eve]s -t  -u rear  -o the crato    of        ar b ced educ:ti4on
pyramid.   During the decade of the 1950's this called for particular emphasis
upon highe  ecuain     whic  had -rw -or 4lwl 4ro         to independence.__  4
enrollments and outputs of the two provinces< over the past decade.   They show
that while East Pakistan has enjo;yed a higher enrollment of priLmary student.s,
West Pakistan has carried more students on to secondary and higher levels End
has also had a generally better rate of growth a,t all levels.   The relative
stagnation of growth at the secondary level in East Pakistan, unless corrected,
will set limiLs to expiansion in thie techinicai and professional fields in future
years.
9.        Annex 3 illustrates a very serious problem of primary education in
both provinces - the high drop-out rates.   In East Pakistan only one chiid in
seven of those entering school reaches the fifth grade and in IlWest Pakistan one
in four.   More than half the loss occurs in the first two years with the re-
sult that students revert to functional illiteracy and the expenditure of effort
and resources is wasted.
10.       A major effort of the next decELde must be to broaden the base of the
educational pyramid not only by providing access to school for more children,



especially g-irls, but; paticulaly by f:inding the means to retain a much higher
percentage of students in school until some permanent benefit is gained.

wards future careers, efforts should be made to channel more of those who will
continue into tech'nUIcal, professlonal, or v-ocatlonal trainrLLg and away- from
the classical arts c(Durses.  This problem can be seen in Appendix 3, which
shiows tnat w -hie uihe:re was an absolute increase during the udcaut in the nuiiur-er
of science students in the intermediate colleges (grades 11 and 12), the rate
of increase and the nlumbers involved were considerably less than for the aris.
While the present supply is adequate, should this trend continue, expanding
opportunities for professional training in engineering, agricuiture, medicine,
and science will outrun the supply of qualified candidates.
12.       The second Five Year Plan aims to increase primary enrollment by
1,300,000 (40%) in East Pakistan, and 1,200,000 (60%) in West Pakistan and.
secondary enrollment by 200,000 (30%) and 230,000 (40%") respectively.  But
it is not likely that these targets will be met.   During the first two years
of the Plan, allocations of funds to education were considerably below the
scheduled Plan level.   In 1962 they were increased to the level of Rs. 260
million, which, if maintained to 1965 will bring total expenditure up to -the
Plan level of Rs. 950 million.   However, time has been lost, particularly in
the critical field of teacher training.
13.       To meet the increased enrollments the Plan estimates a need for
70,000 additional primary teachers and 15,000 secondary teachers by 1965.
These figures do not take account of replacement requirements which are con-
servatively estimates at 30,000 prirnary and 10,000 secondary teachers, making
total requirements for the period of 100,000 and 25,000 respectively.   Against
this need the annual output of primalry teachers had risen from 7,400 in 1960
to 8,100 in 1962 and of secondary teachers from 1,800 to 2,130.   The annual
targets for the remaining years have been raised to 12,000 primary and 3,100
secondary teachers, but the resultant F'lan period totals of 55,000 and 12,000
(if achieved) will still fall far short of the requirement.
14.       The project items discussed i.n this report cannot be considered
without some reference to these and other needs of the educational system of
Pakistan.   Educational services and facilities do not meet the country's needs,
and during the coming decade there must. be a maJor effort - greater than any-
thing done thus far, and greater perhaps than is currently foreseen, to develop

the countryvs human resources through education and training of all kinds.
To meet the need, expenditures will have to rise well above the present levels,
which in 1962-63 wnre aboit 2.251 of G.N.P. and 10% of public expenditure.  It
should be recognized also that the largest part of this increase would be for
recurrent costs,

problems together with the problems of general eXpansion anUd iprovemLent dis-
cussed above should be the objects of planning activity leading to a weLl
phased general development plan for education with reference to priorit:ies,
prerequisites, costs, and feasibility.
16.       To prepare such a plan would probably require technical assis-tance
of the sort that h.as been provided for economic planning. Thus far the
government has not been receptive to such assistance, but it is currently
making an effort on its own part to strengthen the planning services at the
central and provincial levels.
17.       Despite the absence of a general educational development plan and
despite the exdstence of many educational projects which need urgently to be
undertaken, the project items considered in this report clearly have a nhigh
priority.   The reports cited above refer to critical shortages of professional
agriculturalists, industrial technicians, and engineers which must be met if
the targets of the second and third Five Year Plans are to be achieved.
Although the educational base is t;oo narrow for the long term requirements of
Pakistani development, it can well support at this time these essential develop-
ments at the technician and professicnal level.
IV. THE NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Agricultural Universities
l8.       At the beginning of the second Five Year Plan, agriculture emoloyed
75% of the total labor force of apprcximately 29 million people.    It is es-
timated that this percentage will decline to 65% by 1970, but notwithstanding
this decrease, the absolute number of people in agricultural employment will
rise over the decade from 22 million (1960) to 24 million (1970).  As in many
other countries the preponderence of such employment is not reflected in the
educational system of Pakistan.   Moreover, the need for education and research
is of particular importance in view cf the waterlogging, salinity, and erosion
problems confronting the countrv. and of the low average vi=eld of the existinga
agricultural lands.

19.       While no svstematic studv has been made of either existing resources
or future requirements for professional. agricultural manpower, such data as
exist suinnort the genernl view that su.pply fallq far short, of demand.  The
Second Plan foresees a requirement cluring the plan period of 2,125 new graduates
for government seQrices alone including the f      illin' nf' o/00 e sting1Are
but not including any allowance for normal wastage, for losses to non-goverrment
employ7mPent, or for teachers of agricult al subjects in secondary schools.

mentione  above  ArMMUa2l outputa of LIlhle siLx insti tutions -wonu~L reaclh _570\ by
1965 and 8340 by 1970.
21.       No definite estimates of requirements for the 1965-70 period have
been r.ade, but the rood and Agricultura.l Commrission Report (1960), -whose
programs for agricultural development go considerably beyond those of the
Second Plari, considers existing facilities as "grossly inadequate" anud vie ws
the future need as "urgent" and in East, Pakistan "desperate".  Even if all
projects achieved their targets on schedule, Pakistan wou Ld by 1970, stilL
have no more than some 6,500 agricultural graduates, which is a very small
number for a country whose employment in agriculture wvould be 24 million persons.
Technical Education
22.       The report of the UNE;SCO Tri1isEion on Technical Education in Pakistan
foresaw an annual requirement by 1970 for 12,000 new technicians, of which
6,000 would be trained in diploma level technical institutes, and the remain-
ing half would be provided by promot;ion. and in-service training from the ranks
of skilled workers.
23.       In 1960 there were in West; Pakistan two technical institutes (Karachi
and Rawalpindi) and two engineering colleges (Karachi and Lahore) which o.ffered
training for technicians.   In East Pakistan there were the polytechnic institute
at Dacca and two specialized I'monotechnic" institutes for leather and textile
technologies.   Some training of technicians was also done at the Ahsunullah
Engineering College in Dacca.   There wAere also in each province a number o.f
technical schools offering vocational and technical training below the level
of the three-year diploma course for technicians.   The annual output of
technicians was 500.
24.       On the recommendation of the National Education Comnmission (1959)
it was decided (a) that the engineering colleges would eliminate technician
training and concentrate on professional level engineering instruction, (ID)
that a number of technical schools would be upgraded to offer three-year diplora
courses for technicians, and (c) that a. number of new polytechnic and technical
institutes would be established.
25.       These decisions were incorporated as a orogrnm in the Second Five
Year Plan, which has undergone substantial modification as a result of the



- 6 .-
UNESCO report and other studies.   The most recent and definitive program is
set forth in the "Ten Year Development Plan for PolvtechniclTechnical Inr-
stitutes of Pakistm'" of May, 1962.   This plan calls for the development by
]970 of thirty-six technician  raninz instit.utions eof all tvnpe  with arx annual
output capacity of approximately 7,000 technicians.   With the exception of
five speci Iizer "r-onotec.h-cs'ni  ~ in+ic i  all of the techn.ical institutes
are to be constructed in their first phase during the Second Plan period,

(1961).  'In view of all these facts the raising of the 1970 target fromi

26.       The demand for admission into the polytech-nic and teciical in-
stitutes is far in excess of the availab:Le places.  In 1962-63 there were
6,056 appLicants in West Pakistan of wshich 1,610 could be accepted.  The
same relative demanzd exists in East Pakistan.  There has been no difficulty
in the placing of graduates of the institutes in industry, although a c:loser
rapport between the institutions and industry might result in a distribution
among specialties aore in accord with industry's current needs.   The example
of an industrial liaison committee which is being used in Multan is being
adopted in other cases.
Technical Teacher Training
27.       The success of the planned expansion of technical institutes calls
for a teacher training program far exceeding the present minimum efforts of
the goverNnent.   Table 1 is based upon the "Ten Year Development Plan -or
Polytechnics" and shows the annual teacher output required to cover the ex-
panding enrollment and a wastage calculated at 10% per annum.   Details are
given in Annex 5.   This latter figure takes into account both normal wastage
due to sickness and retirement, and loss to industry: experience at the Dacca
Polytechnic over the last five years confirms this estimate of 10% wastage
per annum.

28.       Although technical teacher training programs have been in operation
for some years, the emphasis has been placed upon upgrading courses for ex-
isting teachers with the result that very few additions to teaching strength
had been ]made by -the end of 1962-63.  To meet the requirements as shoivn by
the table, an output of about 400 teachers per annum will be necessary over
the remaining six years of the decade.   It is not likely that this target
can be reached before 1966.

35.  Establishmen+ of the University:  The development plan of the
university is based upon the report; of a committee headed by Dr. Raziuddin
Siddiqui, -ice     -e ofI t       S.- and assisted by advisers from
Taxas A and M College then working at Yiymensingh and Tejgaon. It recommended
thn rsoro,n    +f  .sl P1 l-;  hA t;.-.,4is14-.,,.1  + _; -.  ; Vnc+  PoIr, o+ r tF-
Mymensingh in a "rural" university comprising faraulties of agriculture, animal
huLsbID,an dry, ve4teina1,' c    aru±  lturl  enineerlng, econoicLs 0.11±4 ± 
sociology, and home economics, and in addition departments of agricultural
education, exensio:n, and basic WLd sLcial sclences.
36.         In the absence OI proper preparation for a     u       su    i      th
intermediate colleges (grades 11 and 12) the university would enroll its
stu enrLs aflter the matriculation examination (grade 10) anu ofier a five-year
course leading to the B.Sc. in the various faculties except for veterinary
science and agriculturai engineering which would be six years.     Advanced
studies for the M.Sc. and Ph.D. would also be offered.    The program of the
university, basing specialized studies on a sound grounding in science and
humanities and offering specialized wcrk in several related fields, follows
accepted precepts and is both economical and educationally sound.
37.        The report of the committee was accepted in June 1961 and ordinances
establishing the university were enacted in September 1961.     For the iminediate
future, it was decided to concentrate upon development of the existing faculties
of animal husbandry and veterinary science and the establishment of a faculty
of agriculture and departments of sciences, agricultural education, and ex-
tension. On this plan enrollment of students was begun immediately.
38.        The location of the university at Mymensingh using the College of
Animal Husbandry as a nucleus has enabled it to get under way several years
before it otherwise could have.    The site, adjacent to the Brahmaputra River,
is central, lies in a fertile area, and possesses good communications. Drawing
its students from the whole province it will require housing for 100% of them
and given the absence of facilities in the town, for most of its staff as well.
39.        Students:   The Development plan of the University calls for ex-
pansion of enrollment as follows:
B.Sc.                 Advanced Degrees
1960-61  1964;-65  1969-70   1960-61  1964-65  1969-70

be approximatelyr LOO.



-- 1C) -
40.       Thus far the principal limitation on expansion of enrollment has been
physical facilities, especially hoste-L space.  Two existing halls can, accom-
modate 344 students; semi-permanent sheds another 190 and an additional hostel
nearing completion an additional 320, making a total of 854 ':seatsh'. Tne
1962-63 enrollment consisted of 458 camndidates for the B.Sc. in the three es-
tablished faculties and 77 students in the shorter three-year course in Veter-
inary Science.  Of the 458 degree candlidates, 151 were first or second year
students irn the newly established faculty of Agriculture, the remainder being
first to fifth year' students in Veterinary Science or Animal Husbandry. Stu-
dents admit;ted in 1962 were all first or second division (i.e. excellent or
good), and in 1963 the percentage of first division has been increased.
41.       Staff Development:  The current roster of teaching staff of the uni-
versity lists 58 members for the threes established faculties of VeterinELry
Science, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. The staff of Veterinary Science
and Animal Husbandry are to some extent holdovers from the earlier college and
show the least amoumt of foreign training and advanced degrees. In the combined
total of 34 members, there are 3 Ph.D.'s and about 8 others who have M.Sc. de-
grees or other foreign training. The remainder have only local training. Of
24 members of the Faculty of Agriculture, plus Basic Sciences and Languages, 6
have Ph.DI's and al:L the remainder have M.Sc.'s including a number with f'oreign
training.
42.       The staffc development program calls for a total of 136 teaching staff
by 1970.  The Intercollege Exchange Program jsponsored by AID provides f'oreign
training according to the following schedule:
Ph.D. Candidate   M.Sc. Candidate   Other   Total
Departing before 1961                                                    10
Departing 1961                    1                15             -      16
Departing 1962                    6                 5             1      12
Departing 1963                    5                  9            1      15
53
Normally one year is required for the M.Sc. degree and two to three years for the
Ph.D.  In addition AID is providing a team of nine visiting professors .nd con-
sultants from Texas A and M College cn a year to year basis. This will -be in-
creased to thirteen.
43.       It would appear that existing trained staff, trainees under t'ne Inter-
College Exchange, the University's own graduate students, and miscellaneous
foreign study grants can meet the need and that no additional support fcr foreigr
training is called for. Since 1961 teacher salaries have been increased by 50%
and are now within a range which, with housing, should enable the university to
attract and keep able men.
44.       Teaching, Research and Extension:  Thus far major changes in academic
activity have been in the revision ard sTF-engthening of curricula plus very
1 The Inter-College Exchange Programs which are in effect at both Nfymensingh
and Lyallpur provide: (a) technical assistance in the major fields of study and
(b) oversea study grants for the advanced training of Pakistani professors.



important changes in examination procedure.   Extension training will begin
in 1963 wath a small in-service program for the Department of Agriculture
which will be expanded to a full scale program by 1965.    Classes in Ex-
tension Organization .wll begin in 1964 Ior fourth year st-udents in agri-
culture, and in Methods and Procedures the following year for fifth year
students.   An agricultural education teachers' course will begin in 196J
for twenty students.
45.       Thus far research activrity has only begun.  Major activity mnust
wait upon the return of advanced trainees from abroad and the expansion of
graduate studies at the university.   However, a basis is being laid in the
build-up of poultry flocks and dairy herds and in the acquisition of acreage
for production of fruit, jute and rice.
46.       Land:  The former Veterinary College, which forms the nucleus of
the new ux.iversity had about 79 acres of land on the banks of the Brahmaputra
River 3 - 4 miles from the town, to which has been added 121 acres of con-
tiguous land.   Thlis wllU be the principal site of the university.   It is
flat land, above flood level, and reasonably well drained.    In addition the
university is in the process of acquiring 820 acres of adjacent lands wThich
will be used for the Dairy and Agricultural Farms.   At least four agri-
cultural subdistricts near the university will be assigned to it as a student
laboratory and for research in extension.
47.       Architectural Planning and Construction:  Architectural and site
planning were first entrusted to the firm of Berger and Associates, which
produced a master site plan and architectural plans for student hostels and
staff residences, both of which were urgent if the university was to enroll
students according to schedule.   Construction was begun in 1962 on staff
residences for Pakistani staff and for 9 members of the Texas A and M team,
and on permanent hostels for 320 students and a semi-permanent hostel for
190 students.   Temporary classrooms and other essential service units were
added.
48.       In October 1962 responsibi.lity for planning a part of the academic
and other non-residential buildings wias given to the Pakistani firm of Noon
and Qavum, assisted by the architect, Richard Neutra of California.    As of
July, 1963 Noon and Qayum had delivered the preliminary drawings, siting
plan, specifications, cost estimates and tender documents for the six major
structures assigned to them, namely: the faculties of Agriculture and Veter-
inarv Science, the Administration Ruilding, Library. Convocation Hall and a
Student Teacher Center plus Guest House.   These represent the portion of
the program originally scheduled for 1962-63.
49.       The University oriainallv requested IDA to consider the entire pro-
ject as included in the approved scheme for the Second Plan period plus 1966.
However, it hecame apparent, that the cost estimates of the original scheme
would not be reliable and that no architectural planning would have been done
for the later phases of the project at the tim..e it was to be accepted.  The



- 12 -
University wns advised tha+ only those parts of the project wonul be  ODn-
sidered for which cost estimates were based on preliminary drawings and
specifict .ions   Such architectural data has been preare   hr Pbyerper and
Associates for student and staff housing and by Noon and Qayum for the six
buildings listed above.   Designs for farm buildings have also been prepared
by a local architect.
50.       Since that time working drawings for the faculties of agriculture
and veterinary science have been completed and construction has been begun.
Working drawings for the other buildings designed by Noon and Qayum are
nearl,y corm.plIcte.
51.     lConstruction of new university faci';ties will continue through 1966
and will include in addition to the buildings mentioned above:  Faculties of
AimLal H'lusbandry, Agricultural Engineering, Ag,ricultural Economics, Department
of Basic Sciences and Arts, and Extension, additional student and staff' hous-
ing <and general service buildings.  The portion of the total project repre-
sented by the present application is approsdmately one-third of the teaching
space, eigrhty percent of the general buildings, one hundred percent of thre
farm buildings and two-thirds of the student residences.
52.       Temporarily this would appear to be an unbalanced phasing as between
general buiildings, student housing, and teaching space.  However, exi;sting
buildings taken over from the old Agricultural College can continue to be used
for Anima:l Husbanciry and the basic sciences, and there should also be space in
the new faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Science which could be assigned
to other purposes during the next several years. Provided that the University
administration insists upon maximum ati:Lization of space for the benefit of
all teaching departments, the additional facilities to be constructed umder
the present schedule should enable the university to continue with expansion
of enrollnent and development of the academic program substantially as plan-
ned.   But the university should proceed at once to engage architects fo7r the
designing of the remaining facilities.
53.       In general the designs for the proposed construction are appropriate
and are characterized on the wihole by a sense of economy.
54.       Equipment and furnishings to be procured under the IDA credit at
Mymensingh are linited to those required for the buildings to be constructed
under the credit and listed above, namely: three student hostels, the facul-
ties of Agriculture and Veterinary Science, the library, administration
building, convocation hall, student teacher center, and farm buildings. They
will be predominantly for teaching and research purposes in the various
laboratories, classrooms, and farm buildings of the two faculties and in the
central library.
West Pakistan Agricultural University - Lyallpur
55.       Estabilsnment of the University:  The Agricultural University at
Lyallpur has a relatively long tradition, having begun in 1909 as a diploma
level institution, and then, after affiliation with the Punjab University in
1923 offering successively the B.Sc., the M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees. In 1961
following the recommendations of the! Educational Commission (i959) and the
Food and Agriculture Commission (196,0) it was established as a university,



followingr Lines laid down by the report of the West Pakistan Agricultural
University (Siddiqui) Coimnittee.   Since 1954 technical assistance has been
provided to the agricultural college by AID through the Washington State
University.
56.       The newr university was established with faculties of agriculture,
animal husbandry, agricultural engineering and veterinary science; and
divisions of basic sciences and arts, extension and teacher training, most
of which were already in existence.    Within these subject areas it assumed
a three-f'old mission of teaching, extension and research.
57.       Through a new contract with Washington State University, the U.S.
Government agreed to provide 14 visiting professors, training grants for over
50 Pakistani and over $100,000 of ec[uipment.   A provisional Vice Chancellor
was appointed and an expanded first year class was enrolled even before the
university became a legal entity.
58.       The site at Tvallpur is well chosen-    Tn addition to the advantage
of building on the former college, the district is a fertile one located in
the center of the Wfest Pakistan agricultural regi n-s  Some of the hest grow-
ing lands and some of the worst problems of salinity and wraterlogging are
close at hand.   jyallpu   is  a a   ng commercil andrinlustrial center with
good road, rail and air connections.    Climate is representative of West

60.       The physical and administrative separation Of college and institute
has been a painfu:L and vexding task for the university, involving the loss of
valuable eq-uipiment and highly qualified personnel.  However, the process is
now completed and the losses are being made up.   As a compensation the
university snould be freer to concentrate on basic research which is more
appropriate to the purposes of a university, leaving applied research to
the Department of Agriculture.
6i.       Student Body:  The origina:L university development pian aims at
an enrollment by 1965 of 2,135 students, of which 1,825 would be candidates
for the B.Sc. and 310 for higher degrees.    Output in 1965 is expected to be
280 Bachelors of Science in the four faculties, 100 MIasters of Science in
various fields and. about 25 Ph.D.'s.   The subsequent Master Plan, described
below, carries the expansion forward to provide for an enrollment of 5,000
students in 1973.
62.       Enrollment in 1962 wqas 1,114 (compared with 686 in 1960) of which
912 were B.Sc. and 202 advanced degree candidates.    Of 296 students admitted
to the first year class in 1962, 228 were high first or first division on the
matriculate exanination, 54 wrere second division and 14 third division.



63.       Staff Development:  The estimated requirement for teaching staff to
t a-e care of an enr'o-.tEM of 2,13$ students in 1965 is 405, of which 233
wrould be demonstrators and teaching and research assistants.   Teaching
assista..tLs ar.d der,onstrators wu-"vLd usuallIy- notl- ye-t- have advanced degre-es.
In 1962 in a total university staff of 174 there were 7 Ph.D.'s and 81 M.Sc.'s.
Thscormpe -wit I arnd 524 respecti-vely in  91     wentuy-enmn      er
studying overseas under the AID Inter-College Exchange program, 17 for the
rP.D. am 10 for thie M.Sc.     s sirilar number are expec  t   o     a
during the next two or three years.   In addition the university expect,s to
train a substantial number of its future teaching staff in ius o-uv,. graduate
school, whose enrollment currently numbers 202, of which 28 are candidates
for the Ph.D. and 174 for the M.Sc.   In addition the university has a team,
of 14 visiting professors provided by- AID under contract with Iashingtozi
State University, which is expected to continue on a year to year basis for
several years to come.   A small number of experienced and well qualified
Pakistani have been appointed on deputation from other agencies. There is
t;herefore a good prospect that qualified staff will be available in sufficient
quantity to meet the needs of the university's development.
64.       Teaching, Research and Extension:  For the faculties of agriculture,
agricultural engineering, veterinary science, and animal husbandry curricula
and course syllabi have been well developed and equipment requirements deter-
mined with assistance from the Washington State University team.   Despite the
separatiorn of the Agricultural Research Institute, researclh has continued at
the university as part of the graduate study program and within the depart-
ments.
65.       By European or American standards the weekly total of hours of
instruction remains high (up to 38).   However, work in basic sciences has
been strer,gthened and in addition emphasis has been increased with regard to
extension and indigenous problems such as waterlogging and salinity. Short,
practical courses of varying duration, serving altogether 1,000 farmers per
year, training of agricultural teachers for secondary schools, publications,
training and experiimentation in extension and participation in activities of
scientific: and agricultural societies are among the ways in which the univer-
sity seeks to mairntain relations with its constituent community.
66.       Land:  I'he university began in 1961 with an area of 755 acres.
Since then it has acauired 13L5 acres. making a total of 2;100.  Efforts are
being made to secure an additional 5,,000, i.e. a total of 7,100 acres. In
addition riegotiations are lunder way f:or the assignment to the -unliverSitv of
several areas in the Lyallpur district for extension activity.
67.       Architectural Planning and Construction:  Early in 1962, after
appnrovra rof fthe lltilr1rPr-trs  deverlonpn+. czphe=me,T   C 1gen- rl sl, p   wa
worked out in cooperation with the town planning department, and construction
.^.as begun under the auspices of the Public Works Department on two urgently
needed hostels for 300 students each and 124 staff residences. Late in. 1962
the firm of Har1-nd 13 Bartholomew of SOa t Louis, M5issouri, was retained to
prepare a master plan, including rev:Lew of the site plan, preliminary draw-
ings of buildings, specifications, cost estimates, etc.    The raster plan
was delivered to the university in August, 1963.    Architects for detailed
architectural plaxnning have yet to be appointed.



- 5L -
68.       The master plan provides for the development of a university of
5,000 stude --ts over a period of t;en years (1963-1973) at an estimated cos'
for construction of nearly $24 million.   In actual fact, hovwever, the major
part of the construction essential to the realization of the university' s
academic development is scheduled during the first five years (1963-68) and
has been phased in such a way as to permit the continuous expansion of en-
rollment along lines laid down in the original development plan. Ifhila some
minor adjustments may be necessary tetween the schedules of the first and
second five year phases, the first phase is a fairly self-contained program
of development and provides a good basis for lending for the university.
69.       This phase,   which would actually be completed in 1969 or 1970,
will provide almost all of the space required for the various faculties of
the university, plus farm buildings and a number of general buildings such
as Library, Adrministration, and the Dining Hall.  Hostel "seats" will be pro-
vided for 25436 students, which added to the approximately 700 existing seats
will give residential accommodation for some 3,100 students. Since the enroll-
ment target for 1965 is 2,135 ancd since the university is currently well
abreast of schedule, this figure is a reasonable target for 1969-70. reach-
ing space has been designed so as to provide maximum flexibility in its assign-
ment among faculties, so that in any given year a functional balance of
facilities is maintained.
70.       The master plan includes schematic drawings for all buildings, a
site plan, and is based on somewhat more extensive engineering studies than
is usually found in a master plan.   The work is of good professional quality,
and is characterized by a sense of economy.   It is noteworthy that in a
nurnber of cases such as professors' offices the exaggerated space requirements
given in the original developrment; plan have been sharply reduced.
71.       Equipment to be purchased at Lyallpur University under the IDA
credit is predominantly for teaching and research in the faculties of agri-
culture. agricultural engineering, veterinarv science and animal husbandry
and in the division of basic sciences in laboratories, workshops, and farm
and dairy centers.
72.       Adrmnishtrationcf University Proiects:  The implementing agen,y in
the case of university projects is the university itself, which has the
ne-essarya_thoit ln inrltr sz statutes and in addition is linked to   he
provincial govermnent through its Chancellor, who is the Governor of the
province.   Normn'll-y nrorement of equipme+.nt w.ill be          Ivnirrten hy the- supmn1
departments of thes provincial governments, following standard government pro-
cedures ar,d includling inter.antiornal bidding.  Eq ipm-ent remlidrements are
determined initially by the teaching departments, with advice from the
Washri-ngtoin S4-t+at,,e a Teaes A -r.A M -eams -dA  approve  by a ,-.rir+ee of
deans.   These arrangements are satisfactory.    For construction there are
Pakistani firms chich are qualified to car.ry     -- out te*rk. h
of the size of the work involved, tenders would be invited on an international
basis.   JupeIVLs.on of construct;ion wo-uld Lbe provided bJy thU1e architectsL UV. U
This arrangement would be satisfactory subject to approval by IDA of the
architects selected and of the contracts between the architects and thie
universities.



73.       Each university has a project office, headed by a project director,
who is an engineer.    The volume of work to be undertaken, however, requires
strengthening of these offices andi in particular the appointment of at least
one well quaiified architect-engineer who can collaborate with the contracting
architects on behalf of the university.
Technical Institutes
74.       Of twenty-nine technical institutes for which financing was originall,j
requested by the Fakistan government, fourteen are suitable for financing at
this time, eight in East Pakistan ancd six in Ilest Pakistan.   The time schedule
for construction of the various project items is difficult to assess in view
of frequent delays in the commencing or continuation of projects.     All project
items for which financing would be provided have been approved for inclusion
in the Second Plani and it has been stated that all items will be completed by
the end of 1965.    Reports on progress up to December 31, 1962 indicate that
this is feasible.
75        In terms of enrollment and output the program for expansion of
technician trainirng has not developecl as rapidly as was foreseen in the Second
Plan.   This is partly the result of delays in planning and partly of shortage
of financing, especially for equipment.    The original schedule anticipated
that annucal output, of technicians would reach approximately 3,000 by 1965, but
by 1962 output had. risen to only 850., from 500 in 1960, and it was clear from
first year registrations that the 1965 output would not exceed 1,900.
76.       Despite this delay in quantitative expansion, progress in qualitative
aspects of the program has been very good.    A sound foundation was laid for
later expansion of the program by the pilot work done at the polytechnic
institutes of Dacca, Karachi, and Rawvalpindi, beginning in 1955, with assist-
ance from the Ford Foundation ancd the Oklahoma State University.    The poly-
technic at Rawalpindi, in particular:, sets an excellent standard for later
inst,itutions to emulate-   Wjth this hackground a Technical Ediication StAndard-
ization Committee assisted by the OkLahoma State advisers prepared in 1.961 a
lianual of Standards for Polytechnic :Institutes covering curricula, labcratory

will continue its advisory services for several years at least, and there is
reason to expect -that with the addition of more, qualified personnel the
Directorates will continue to cope successfully with the expanding progrram.
78.        Equipment to be purchased for the technical institutes unde:r the
IDA credit is based on lists prepared bv the Technical Education Standardiza-
tion Committee in 1961 and published in the "Manual of Standards for Poly-
technic TnstintuteS"  The lists cover the range of hasic science and
engineering laboratories, visual aids, workshops and library books required for

prepared with the help of advisers from Oklahoma State University under the

is to be done prior to procurem.ent under the mDA credit.

The insti.tutions in tGroups I and iI are Identical in most respects. Ai Uf
December 31, 1962 - the time of the first Mission report - Group I was slightly
more ad-vanced in construction. They are new institutes located so as to provide
technical education opportunities within each of the main regions intc which
East Pakistan is divided. The principal and main industrial town of t.he district
has been selected. in each instance. Admissions and outputs of students have
been determined in accorclance with the overall targets set by the -Ten. iear
Development Plan for Polytechnics".
80.        Each of the institutions will offer three-year full-time courses in
two technologies selected from automobile, civil, electrical and mechanical
engineering together with intensive and part-time courses in a variety of
trade subjects suitable for the craftsman or artisan. Among such subjIects
will be included automobile mechanics, blacksmithing, carpentry, electrical
installation, fitting and turning, foundry work, surveying, and welding.
Table 2, below, shows the enrollment capacity of each institute result-ing from
the proposed expansion during the Second Plan and the technologies it will offer.

The figures given above are as provided in the original project schemes of the
Second Plan.  Additional expenditures contemplated during the Third Plan period
will expand the capacities of these institutions at a relatively lower capital
cost per student by 1970 to approximately 5,000.
81.     Output of these institutions in. 1965 is estimated to be 320 technicians.
However by 1968 when enrollments are stabilized the output potential of these
facilities, allowing a 20% drop-out, will be approximately 30% of total enroll-
ment or 550. Output in 1972 would be 1,500.
82.     While building layout will vary in accordance with the site character-
istics, each project item provides for a main administration and teaching block.
four workshops, a hostel for 80 stucdents, one senior and one junior staff
quarters, and a house for the Princinal.   Designs for the bu ildrin  are sf
acceptable standards, and the cost per student of Sl,,520, not including staff
housing, is reasonahle in the ciTnimstances of Pakistan= Tncl usi on of estimated
staff housing costs raises the per student cost to $1,665. Construction work on
the administration and teaching block and on the workshops has begun on all
sites but is slightly more advanced in the first four institutions.

83.     The West Pakistan technical institutes for which financing is
recorrmMriendedr+. +.his tme are also divided into two groups.

87.       Construction of the Multan institute is to be divided between the
Second and Third ]?ian periods.  The administrative block, ciassrooms, two-
thirds of the worlkshops, and one-sixth of the equipment have been allocated to
the Second Plan period and the remainder of the workshops and equipment and
all of the staff housing to the Third Plan period.  In order to provi(le a
satisfactory project item for finrancing, however, all of the equipment and
workshops should be included at this time together with the administrative
block and classrooms.   This will assure continuity and integrated develop-
ment of the project and therefore a more rapid achievement of planned enroll-
ment targets.
88.       The preliminary drawings submitted cover classrooms, administrative
block, workshops, and student hostels and indicate a well designed complex
of buildings.   The estimated capital cost of $1,770 per student, without
staff housing, is reasonable considering the number of technologies to be
offered and the high equipment costs which result.

90.       Estimated output of the five existing institutes for 1965 is 6:LO.
However, calculating output as 30% of a s-table enrollment, as was done above
for East Pakistan,, would give a potential output for these facilities of 1,125.
Enrollment of all s:ix institutes by 1970 is expected to be 9,896 which would
give a potential output of nearly 3,000.
Technical Teacher Training Colleges
91.       As indicated above, technical teacher trainirg has been carrie(d on
to a limited extent for several years at the polytechnics at Dacca, Rawalpindi,
and Karachi, but the effort has been directed primarily to up-grading existing
teachers and very little to the training of new teachers.   If the staffing re-
quirements of the 10-year development plan are to be met, a major effort of
teacher training must be initiated immediately.
92.       The objective of the project under consideration is to expand the
present efforts at Dacca, Rawalpindi, and Karachi (by about 4 times) to a
total enrollment of 400 trainees bv September, 1965, of which 150 would *be in
Dacca and 250 divided between the two West Pakistan institutes.   A course of
one year will be offered, and since the training is snecialized. it is exnect-
ed that a high percentage of the trainees will enter teaching service the
following vear.  Pending the construction of senarate facilities teacher train-
ing will be carried on within the three polytechnic institutes and teacher
trainees will be given nrioritv over rolvtechnic students as may be renuired.
Separate facilities should be ready by 1965.
93.       For some years to come the major source of recruitment will be from
among polytechnic graduates, many of whom will have had little or no industrial
experience and subsequent training.   For these the course must provide extended



workshop practice and technology as weLl as formal pedagogical training.
Ir1 Idely a_ o-ya 4owrs     is -eial      and  at a4 -ae  dae -t-4  1-4 -A- eacher;
might be brought back for further training.    Until the critical problem
of teacher shortage has been sol.ved, however, a one-year course will    e
necessary.
94.     Ideally -again, technical teacher training should be conducted in
institutions wnicn are separately administered but in close contact wilth
polytechnics, in which teaching practice can be carried out and an inter-
change of certain facilities arranged. The urgent nature oT the need does
not permit of present development along these lines, and use must therce-
fore be made of existing facilities wnithin the three major polytecnnics
at Dacca, Rawalpindi, and Karachi as described above.
95.     It is understood that Dacca, and Rawalpindi will be finally
selected. for the siting of permianent technical teacher training centers
and that appropriate construction will be required.    This will be provided
by the government.
96.     In respect of all three technical teacher training colleges it
will be essential to provide for foreign expert service over at least two
years and for their Pakistani counterparts to have an opportunity to gain
additional training and experience overseas.    Counterparts would receive
one year's training overseas divided between England and the United States.
Table 4 shows the extent of foreign expert service and oversea training
facilities required for each polytechnic.

Administration of the project for technical
institutes and teacher training.
97.       As indicated above implementation of the program for technical
institutes to be financed by IDA will require strengthening of the
directorates of technical education in both provinces. In each directo-
rate there will be appointed a qualified project director with respons:i-
bility for coordination of all aspects of the project. In addition, an
equipment specialist will be needed to advise on selection and installa-
tion of the equipment to be financect, a large part of which will be
imported.  It is understood that the Pakistan government is now receiving
such services from Oklahoma State Uriversity. It is also understood that
the assistance of UNESCO or some other agency experienced in the interna-
tional procurement of equipment will, be sought for review of the
equipment lists. Such review is to assure that specifications are
written so as to permit international bidding.
98.       Construction work will be performed by contractors on the
governmerLt's approved list. Lettingr and administration of contracts is
handled by the public works department.
99.       The normal practice in Pakistan is to budget annually 2% of
building cost for maintenance. The concept of regular maintenance,
however, is not well developed, and assurances should therefore be sought
that buildings financed by IDA will be regularly maintained.
100).     Similarly in the case of tecthical teacher training, it is
understood that tohe Pakistan goveranent will request the Oklahoma State
University to carry out the recruitment of foreign experts and the neces-
sary counterpart training arrangements.  This would be eminently satis-
factorv in view of the major nart nlaved by the Universitv under Ford
Foundation grants in the establishmesnt of the present polytechnic syst;em
in  Pakis-t n.  Services of the extpe:rts would begin in Sentemher 1964_
Staff Houlsing
101.      There sLs a widespread and acute shortage of housing for govern-
ment a-. nd nrnfp,Jnnn1 wornrVkrs nf 211 types in Pakistan ncnd t.here is nlqn

102.      In the variou p-roject  covered by this report thea average
percentage of total project cost represented by staff housing is 16.3%.

103.      while recognizing that in many cases the provision of housi.ng
may be essential for the recruitingr of qualified staff and that progress
is being made Toward common and. economical government nousing standards,
further progress would be necessar;y before the financing of staff housing
could be justified.  It has therefore been excluded in this case frorn the
projects of which IDA will finance a part.
VI.  COSTS AND P'li UICING
104*      Tables 5 - 10 below summarize the costs for all project items
covered by this report.  Expenditures 'or staff housing and expenditures
prior to January 1, 1963 for any purpose are not included in the project
cost. The proposed credits would cover about 50% of the total costs in
East Pakistan and in "Test Pakistan; Tables 11 and 12 below show more specif-
ically 'how the proceeds from the credits would be allocated to items
included in the projects.
105.      The basis of cost estimates for construction f'or all project
items in this report is a square foot-age cost for the particular type of
construction involved. In the case of the technical institutes, these
figures are provided by the Public Works departments and are drawn from
recent experience in similar types of construction. For tihe universities,
square .footage costs have beeh determined by the architects in similar
manner. In all cases, the square footage totals are as indicated in
preliminary drawings. In all cases also the square footage unit costs
are approximately 10% above those used in 1961, when the schemes were
first drawn up. This increase in costs has been recognized and approved
by the Pakistan government. Contingencies have been added to cover Possible
future increases in cost.
106.     Iymensingh:  The Pakistani government has authorized a capital
expenditure during the Second Plan period (1961-65) for Mymensingh Univer-
sity of Rs. 36:million. These expenditures are exclusive of assistance
provided by AID under the Intler-Ccllege Exchange Program which covers
technical assistance and overseas training grants.

107.      The program contained in the present application is estimated
to cost ap-proy;-q ma+tl Rs P 2 9r .llion fo1 r rnn1 irrv  inctlinirl na rrch-i-
tectst fees, site development and 4.3 million for equipment including
tion and instructional equipment see Annex 7.)   The current estimates
appear 4to b e r e' iab-Ll-e a nd thlIIe cos   for -vaiu Lt s of PC-,ucio  falls
within acceptable limits.   No reliable estimate of per student cost can be
given since tWhe current req-ues- itS not U a- LjJ Uo pl   pjectu and since the
student capacity can only be determined approximately. Assuming 1,500
students, a very rough estimLte of cost for construction, equipment and
furnishings of all facilities including staff housing would be 'P5,160 per

Tor thlE ultinate ero±olimento 01     sue[s.     "e ulfmate cost per
student. should therefore fall below 2"5,000, which for an agricultural
university, is moderate.
108.      Table 5 below presents aL summary of the total project costs as
it has been defined in the current request. The total of eligible items
includes all construction designecd by Noon and Qayum and scheduled for
1962-63, three hostels designed by Berger, farm buildings and equipment
or site development related to these constructions.   it excludes all staff
housing and one hostel scheduled for construction in 1961-62, which is
edither completed or substantially so.

109.      Lyallpur:  The earlier estimates for the Agricultural University
at Lyal1pur provided Rs. 42 million for capital expenditures during the
Second Plan period (1961-65).   EstinELtes under the Miaster Plan for the
period 1963-68 given in Table 6 beslow total about Rs. 64, million but
carry the University's development considerably beyond the point en\isaged
ior 196'5, and for the period 1963-65 are consistent wzith those of the
earlier scheme (See Annex 8).

116.    Despite important advances since 1947, the educational and t-rain-
ing system of Pakistan is not now capable of supplying the critical manpower
needed for the economic development of the country either in the immediate
future or during the next 10 - 15 years.  Over the longer period the edu-
cational pyramid needs to be broadened and strengthened at all leve:Ls with
greater emphasis at intermediate and higher levels on scientific, techni-
cal and professional training. (paras. 7-17)
117.    For the shorter term there is need for development in a number of
areas, but the projects for agricultural, technician and technical iteacher
training covered by this report are of the first priority. Although sys-
tematic manpower studies do not exist, available data support the govern-
ment's conclusion that there is an urgent need for more and better trained
professional agriculturalists and industrial technician-,.  Training of
technical teachers is of the greatest urgency to provide staff not only
for those technical institutes for which !DA financing would be supplied,
but also for previously existing institutes and for others to be estlab-
lished in the future. (paras. l8-28)
li8.    The projects considered are well conceived to meet the needs for
which they are intended. The Agricultural University at Lyallpur will build
on a sound tradition under good leadership, and with the assistance of the
Washington State University experts should be able to continue its expan-
sion and qualitative development as successfully as it has begun.
(paras. 55-71) The agricultural university at Mymensingh although a newer
institution, has made a good beginning and should continue in this way with
assistance from the Texas A and V team. (paras. 34-54) The program for
expansion of technical institutes has a maj or advantage in the pilot work
done with assistance from the Ford Foundation and Oklahoma State University.
The continued services of Oklahomra State experts will be of great benefit
both to technician training and to the training of tecenical teachers.
(paras. 74-90)
119.    With a few minor exceptions the design and scale of buildings to be
constructed are appropriate to the purposes they should serve. They are
characterized on the whole by a sense of economy, and the estimated costs
are realistic and within acceptable limits. The question of standards of
staff housing has posed a problem, but it is not of sufficient magnitude
to disqualify these essential projects. The problem is, in fact, country-
wide and not restricted to these projects or to the educational sector.
It can, only be solved with time and on a country-wide level. Meanwhile
the provisional governments have made a beginning toward reduction and
standardization of the scale of accommodation allowable for new government
staff housing (Paras. 101-103)
120.    For all the institutions concerned equipment needs are most urgent
and impossible to satisfy from local resources. For the technical insti-
tutes the revised equipment lists will benefit particularly from eight



vyars eYxpr:ience in the pilthn1.  ti    s .ponnsno-red by t.he Ford Foundnlationr
For the universities the procedure for selection of equipment is the proper
one )origin.ating in the v%arinii dprtndn der+inving from. actual traoh-
ing and research programs, and passing in several stages of review to the!
Council of I)eans for fnal approval. -rough--r+ +h,ig      c       th  advic
members of the Washington State and Texas A and M teams has been available.
121.     Since the successful expansion of technical education depends pri-
marily on the proper training of technical teachers, the provislon of foreign
expert services to the teacher training colleges is essential.     Similarly
those raksUis.a    acUIher-brariners wnO are d o bk  o-ver Un lhe departure of
the foreign experts should each have one yearts oversea study and observa-
tion in a specially designed program.
122.     Since in-service training is as important a source of technicians
as formal training, the government should be urged to every possible effort
to stimulate training within industry and to secure fulier compliance witn
the apprenticeship crdinance of 1961. (paras. 22, 25)
123.     For all project items current expenditures have been included in
the government approved scheme and are therefore assured for the duration of
the Second Plan period. For the period thereafter the government will give
assurances that it will support the operation of these institutions for their
declared purposes and will maintain the buildings in good condition.
124.      In order to assure satisfactory implementation of the project, the
following requirements are to be met:
a) Project administration at each of the universities will.
be strengthened by the addition of at least one quali-
fied architect-engineer tc act for the university in its
relations with consulting architects and contractors.
(para. 73)
b)  At Mymensingh University architects acceptable to IDA will
be appointed immediately to complete the design phase of
the university?s development plan. (para. 52) The Univer-
sity at Lyallpur will appoint architects acceptable to IDA
for the preparation of detailed plans based upon the Master
Plan. (para. 67) All contracts between the universities
and architects will provide for adequate supervision of
construction by the architects and will be approved by IDA.
(para. 72)
c)  Mymensingh University will provide assurance that the 820
acres of land promised it by the government has been trans-
ferred to the university or will be transferred as of an
agreed-upon date.   (para. L6)
d)  A full--time qualified proi4nt director is to be annointed
in the Directorate of Technical Education of each province.
(panra  97)

e)  Lists of equipment to be purchased for the technical
institutes in East and West Pakistan will be revised
with the advice of the equipment specialist. When
completed, the revised lists will be submitted to Unesco,
or some other qualified agency acceptable to IDA for re-
view. (para. 97)
f)  The governments of East and West Pakistan agree to employ
an equipment specialist acceptable to IDA for a period of
two years, who will advise the directorates of Technical
Education in both provinces regarding the selection and in-
stallation of equipment to be purchased under the IDA
credit. (para. 97)
g)  For inplementation of' the technical teacher training pro-
ject the governments will employ consultants acceptable to
IDA along the lines described above. (para. 100)
125.     Under these conditions the project provides a suitable basis for IDA
credits of $4.5 mi:lion to East Pakistan and $8.5 million to West Pakist;an.

Among the fifteen which have been excluded five smaller institutions
in East Pakistan hadi been substantiall;y completed at the time of the mission s
first visit, and three larger polytechnics in Dacca, Khulna, and Chittagong
were being financed by other external agencies.     Consideration of a proposal
for establishment of an Institute of Graphic Arts (printing trades) in Dacca
has been def:erred to pennit further study and refinement of the project.    In
West Pakistan the polytechnic institute at Peshawar was substantially conmpleted.
In addition consideration of six new technical institutes proposed for Abbotabad,
D.I. Khan, Larkana, Leiah, Quetta, and Sargodha has been deferred because of
the uncertainty whether the teacher training program will have achieved Euf-
ficient output by 1965 or 1966 to supp:Ly their needs together with the other
institutes already built or building.
