Dear Mr. Zile:
In reference to the Swedish Grant Agreement for the above Grant, concluded 
between us on  May 14, 1996, as amended pursuant to the Letter dated March 26, 1998, 
signed by Chris Lovelace, Acting Director, on behalf of the Bank, and countersigned by 
you on April 6, 1998, I am pleased to inform you that Sida has agreed under an 
amendment letter (copy attached) to increase the grant amount provided by it for 
purposes of the Project. Therefore, I am proposing to amend the above Swedish Grant 
Agreement as follows:
1.
The amount of the grant of sixteen million two hundred seventy-eight thousand 
four hundred Swedish Kroners (SEK 16,278,400) shown in Section 2.01 of said Agreement 
is changed to read: eighteen million two hundred twenty-eight thousand seventy Swedish 
Kroners (SEK 18,228,070).
2.
The date shown in Section 1.03 is amended to read “December 31, 2001”.
Please indicate your agreement to the above amendment by signing, dating and 
returning to us the attached copy of this letter. Upon receipt by the Bank of the copy 
of this Letter Agreement countersigned by you, this Letter Agreement will become 
effective as of the date of the countersignature.
Very truly yours,
