WELFARE REFORM", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "loan_no": "4154;P308", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The project outcome is rated highly\n            satisfactory, with a likely sustainability, and high\n            institutional development impacts, achieved through\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower. A\n            number of lessons convey the following. In a complex\n            institutional capacity building, and policy strengthening\n            operations, project successes may well be poorly correlated\n            with the allocation of investment resources. This operation\n            achieved its most notable development impacts in the\n            smallest components, largely due to the successful design\n            and implementation, and intervention of an operation that\n            was squarely aimed at improving sector management. The\n            improved business processes, training, and policy\n            development activities paid off, particularly in\n            Latvia's reasonably stable macroeconomic and social\n            environment. Moreover, the reform's intensive public\n            information campaign clearly was a major success factor for\n            the multi-pillar pension, and guaranteed minimum income\n            reforms; reforms which also benefited from extensive\n            technical analyses (e.g., the pension budget model) that\n            were made available to policymakers, and the public.\n            Nonetheless, the operation might have developed, and tracked\n            more quantitative indicators, particularly given its core\n            focus on supporting a fiscal, and structural reform agenda\n            around social benefits. For complex, information technology\n            interventions of this type, it is important to ensure local\n            capacity to monitor project implementation, because while\n            the Project developed an extremely thorough business, and\n            automation plan, this led to a false sense of confidence, in\n            that the client was prepared to implement these highly\n            technical activities, in the absence of additional support\n            (e.g., a project auditor), which highlights the need for\n            more careful feasibility, and risk analyses in the future.\n            Other lessons outline: the importance of matching consultant\n            expertise to needs; the project period was too long; and,\n            the Bank project implementation requirements were too\n            bureaucratic to ensure timely, and effective\n            decision-making, noting some activities were implemented too\n            quickly, and, the weak institutional capacity of the\n            Borrower, at times, led to over-reliance on external\n            experts, and Bank staff."}, "docdt": "2004-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
