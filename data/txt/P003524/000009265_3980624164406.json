Provincial\n            Highway Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was likely, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            restructuring of the project was warranted, as was a\n            mid-term review, and given the delays in project\n            implementation, field supervision should have continued\n            until project closing. For components which could not be\n            launched, even after an elapse of one or two years, a\n            decision should have been taken to restructure or cancel the\n            components. The tools used for project management, including\n            supervision reports, progress and audit reporting, and\n            procurement tracking, should have been more realistic and\n            explicit, reflecting changes and implementation difficulties\n            in the project. Supervision intensity, including the skills\n            and level of staffing needed for effective supervision and\n            the frequency of field supervision, were less than adequate\n            in this project. The technical aspects of expressway design,\n            road management systems, and road safety are all areas which\n            may have benefited from greater assistance by the Bank."}, "docdt": "1998-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
