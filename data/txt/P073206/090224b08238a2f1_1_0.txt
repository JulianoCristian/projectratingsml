                         The two project implementing agencies, the Department of Environment and Natural resources (DENR) and the Department of Finance (DoF) have successfully put in place the
                         requisite legal and technical requirements to proceed with the mainstreaming of critical reforms to land administration, valuation and real property taxation. The project has
                         successfully partnered with 49 LGUs in the Provinces of Leyte, Bohol and Bukidnon (including 11 for LGU-assisted titling) and three cities for valuation and real property taxation

                         (RPT). All project targets for land registration and land valuation/taxation have been met. Significantly, the project prepared the Land Sector Development Framework (LSDF), which
                         sets out the land sector strategy until 2030, and this was endorsed by government. The LSDF also incorporates the Road-ap for Valuation and RPT reform, which was also approved
                         by government. The project's social agenda is also enabling significant success in resolving long-standing family disputes over land inheritance.

                         The Project was restructured, which involved revising the Results Framework and Monitoring, including: (a) several PDO indicators were revised; and (b) some PDO indicators
                         which either could not be measured within the life of the project or were not fully attributable to the impacts of the project were dropped. The project restructuring was approved in
                         October 2010 with a loan fund cancellation of US$3.63 million due to the decrease in titling activities as a result of delays in the passage of the Residential Free Patent Act (Republic
                         Act No. 10023), as well as the decision not to construct one-stop-shops for land administration services delivery in Bohol and Bukidnon Provinces.

                         The project will close on March 31, 2014.

                         Although Additional Financial for the project had been prepared, it will now not proceed as the government was unable to meet its internal authorization requirements in order to be
                         approved by the World Bank. Of particular note the achievements of the project for public land records management and also land valuation and RPT collection by local government
                         is ready for mainstreaming, which was to have occurred under Additional Financing. Further, local government unit led land titling is proceeding on a national basis under the
                         government's own resourcing. DENR has now advised that those activities that were to be funded under Additional Financing, will now be fully covered under their own government
                         funds. In fact, activities at the National Capital Region (Metro Manila) have been started early this year to serve as pilot for the Land Administration Management System roll out
                         nationwide. DENR will request the full local funding in the 2015 Government's Appropriations Act and will aim to complete the whole country for the next 3 years, as had been
                         planned under Additional Financing.

                         It is expected that a further request may be submitted to the Bank later in 2014 to support a new project, the third phase of LAMP. DENR has advised that a third phase would focus
                         on the "land management" part of the Land Sector Development Framework. The aim is to have an integrated land management approach. On the DOF side, it is expected that the
                         valuation reforms in a pilot province and some additional cities will be the focus. DENR and DOF would like to discuss proposals with the Bank team during the April-May LAMP2

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project will close as scheduled on March 31, 2014, having made good progress in achieving its development objectives and targets. It is likely that the Bank will be requested to
                         support a new project which would be expected to cover the key elements of what was to have been included under the now dropped Additional Financing.
