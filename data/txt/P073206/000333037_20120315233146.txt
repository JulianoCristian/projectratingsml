                               Extension of Closing Date


1.      The closing date for Philippines, Second Land Administration and Management
Project (LAMP II), Ln. 7298-PH, P073206 will be extended from March 30, 2012 to
December 31, 2012.

2.      As per the January 2012 Mission, the project implementation progress and
progress towards achievement of the project development objectives were assessed as
satisfactory. All the five project components have now achieved almost all of the targets.

3.      The project’s support for the passage of the Residential Free Patent Law
(Republic Act 10023) in March 2010 has enabled titling of residential properties, in
addition to agricultural lands. More than 103,000 patents (101% of the target) have been
titled under the project wherein 92% have been distributed to land owners. Several other
administrative orders/instruments have been put in place to facilitate the institutional
reform as well as the harmonization of systems, land service delivery and alignment of
the land reform agenda and land fiscal reform agenda. These are being done in parallel to
supporting the passage of the Land Administration Reform Act Bill. On the valuation
side, the Real Estate Services Act was passed with the project’s support and
implementation is underway. The Valuation Reform Act Bill has been re-filed under the
current Congress to institutionalize the valuation and land tax reforms. Academic
programs in land administration and management are continuing in two state universities
and training programs are being provided by the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources’ (DENR) Center for Land Administration and Management – Philippines
(CLAMP). Likewise, educational programs for valuation are now being offered for the
first time in a state university, thus providing formal professional education in these
areas.

4.      The Local Government Units’ (LGU) interest and support for the project is
increasing as the importance of land titling is seen as essential for local government
planning and land taxation. The project has successfully partnered with 79 LGUs in the
Provinces of Leyte, Bohol and Bukidnon, under the LGU-led titling initiatives. In
addition to delivering land titles, the LGU partnerships are enabling a broader range of
improvements to LGU administration, including taxation collection, land use planning
and asset management. There has also been strong collaboration between the project and
the Indigenous Peoples of Bukidnon under a Memorandum of Understanding. The
project's social agenda is also enabling significant success in resolving long-standing
family disputes over land inheritance.

5.      Under the project, the DENR and DOF have successfully put in place the requisite
legal and technical environments to proceed with the mainstreaming of critical reforms to
land administration and land valuation and taxation. This is a manifestation of the
Government's commitment to land sector reform, as defined under the Land Sector
Development Framework, which is firmly based on improving land governance. These
are complemented by the land fiscal reforms as identified in the DOF’s Bureau of Local
Government Finance (BLGF) Roadmap for Property Valuation and Taxation Reforms.
6.       The proposed extension is necessary to complete and/or undertake the remaining
project activities. These include:

        Drafting of the DENR Department Administrative Order on the Management of
         Government Lands.
        Formulation of the Draft Land Administration Code.
        Distribution of the remaining land title certificates.
        Continuing support to the operations of the Development of policy guidelines for
         mass data capture for the Land Administration and Management System (LAMS).
        System maintenance and assistance to Regional Land Management Services
         Offices for the operations of LAMS.
        Conduct of workshop and meetings for the review of existing policies on records
         retention and disposal.
        Development of policy guidelines on cost and fees for computerized verification
         and inter-agency data sharing.
        Continuing support to property valuation activities.
        Continuing support to Professional Regulatory Board of Real Estate Services.
        Continuing support to formation of a Professional Valuers Body
        Continuing support for information and education on the Valuation Reform Act
         Bill in the 15th Congress until enacted.
        Development of the agricultural valuation course.
        Conduct of the Project Development Impact Assessment Study.

7.      A revised Project Implementation Plan that covers up to the revised Loan closing
date of December 31, 2012 has been prepared by the project and found acceptable by the
Task Team.

8.       This will be the second extension of the project.
