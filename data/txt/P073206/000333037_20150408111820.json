(LAM) Project for Philippines\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: for the potential benefits of land title\n            and valuation to accrue, other complementary interventions\n            ranging from agricultural support to tax administration also\n            need to be pursued. The change agents, whether national or\n            international, have played a central role in: (a)\n            introducing the reforms to the executive of the national LAM\n            agencies and in shepherding the policy reform bills through\n            the Congress and the Senate; and (b) developing the\n            Executive and Administrative Orders in support of the\n            reforms and the systems, and technology and training\n            programs for the improvement of LAM service delivery. It is\n            also critical to identify executive champions in the\n            national LAM agencies and in the Congress and the Senate. In\n            parallel with the development of the policy agenda,\n            committed political champions, preferably a Committee\n            Chairperson in the Senate and Congress needs to be\n            identified as well as other key officials and gatekeepers of\n            the legislative process. Equally important is to obtain the\n            support of strong champions at the local level committed to\n            advancing property valuation reforms. Moreover, the\n            systematic adoption of market-based SMV by all local\n            governments, rather than just by those with a vocation\n            toward reform, needs to be a requirement from the central\n            government that is adequately enforced. This is particularly\n            important given the perceived political cost attached to the\n            increase in property assessments."}, "docdt": "2015-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
