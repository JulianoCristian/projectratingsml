an effective\n            mechanism aimed at addressing the basic needs of the\n            population in a decentralized manner, through such groups as\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The project aims to:\n            a) improve health and nutrition over the short-term; and b)\n            assist in the formulation of sustainable policies and\n            programs in the social sectors over the medium term. The\n            project contains four components: 1) institutional\n            development; 2) sub-project implementation; 3) establishment\n            of a living standards measurement survey (LSMS); and 4)\n            development of a policy framework in the health sector. The\n            first component assists in the development of the Social\n            Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) Agency.  The second\n            component addresses basic health, nutrition, water and\n            sanitation needs of the groups affected by the economic\n            decline, especially pregnant and lactating women and\n            children under age five.  Financing is provided for: i)\n            rehabilitation of primary health care facilities; ii)\n            nutrition education and food distribution programs; iii)\n            construction of day care centers; and iv) installation of\n            basic water supply facilities.  The third component involves\n            development of a household survey. The last component\n            includes financing of technical assistance to help the\n            government develop medium term policies for the health sectors."}, "docdt": "1992-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
