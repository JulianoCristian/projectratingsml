rated as satisfactory. Some of the key lessons learned from\n            the project include: 1) The absence of sector policies in\n            nutrition, health, water supply, and basic sanitation\n            adversely affected Social Impact Amelioration Program's\n            (SIMAP's) operations and the sustainability of some\n            subprojects. 2) Pre-selecting the subproject sites during\n            project preparation significantly increased SIMAP's\n            capability to timely implement the subprojects. 3) Greater\n            emphasis should likely have been placed on subproject\n            maintenance issues during project preparation when\n            negotiating project sites with the Regional Administrations\n            and related ministries. 4) Government agencies and\n            communities responsible for the sustainability of\n            subprojects executed through SIMAP should be more actively\n            involved at all stages of the subproject cycle. 5) The short\n            and long-term success of nutrition projects implemented\n            through health centers is dependent upon the level of\n            collaboration and commitment from the Ministry of Health\n            (MOH). 6) Greater impact would have been gleaned from the\n            nutrition interventions had project administrators\n            emphasized greater coordination between the MOH and SIMAP,\n            better coordination between food distribution and the\n            rehabilitation of the health centers, and greater investment\n            in nutrition education programs. 7) Implementation\n            timetables should take into account the institutional\n            capacity of the implementing agency to manage the project."}, "docdt": "1998-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
