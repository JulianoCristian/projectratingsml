The project consist of the following components:\n            1) will first develop a capacity within Ministry of\n            Education (MoE), specifically with respect to the Tonga\n            School Grants Program (TSGP) that will be financed under\n            component two, to: (i) critically analyze policy options;\n            (ii) establish project priorities; and (iii) develop project\n            specific rolling plans based on sector priorities, assessed\n            project performance (results), the efficient allocation of\n            resources and consultative dialogue with stakeholders.\n            Secondly, it will provide a policy and regulatory framework\n            for the TSGP; 2) will establish the Tonga School Grants\n            Program. Through TSGP, the Tonga Education Support Project\n            (TESP) will finance improving the quality of schooling and\n            removing inequities in access to quality schooling by way of\n            a program of grants that allows schools to: (i) gradually\n            meet government imposed school quality standards (MSS); and\n            (ii) finance non-salary inputs that they and their\n            communities determine necessary to improve school and\n            student performance output. All primary and junior secondary\n            schools will, over the course of the Tonga Education Policy\n            (EPF), participate in the results-based TSGP. The amount of\n            each school grant will be governed by a funding formula that\n            reflects: (i) enrollment; (ii) the extent to which the\n            school meets or exceeds the National Minimum Service\n            Standards (MSS); (iii) Government's assessment of the\n            schools service delivery capacity (degree to which the\n            school is disadvantaged and/or its community is\n            under-served; and (iv) needs expressed in the school's\n            three year rolling development plan."}, "docdt": "2005-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
