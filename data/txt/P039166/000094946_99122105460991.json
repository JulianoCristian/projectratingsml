Furthermore, the project was instrumental in\n            improving the protection, and management of the\n            bio-diversity of the Danube Biosphere Reserve. Regardless of\n            success, the lessons suggest, in the first place, that\n            public education, and awareness activities, should\n            adequately be planned well in advance of project\n            implementation, to allow a meaningful public involvement to\n            take place. This could have been initiated through\n            awareness, and education activities, developed through\n            non-governmental organizations, and/or small grants\n            programs. Secondly, the creation of a biosphere reserve\n            should be implemented in phases, in order to provide the\n            administration, and local communities, with the\n            understanding to adequately plan for financial, and\n            managerial responsibilities. Furthermore, if the\n            administration of protected areas is to work effectively\n            with local communities, it is suggested that technical\n            studies be used as a guide in the use of reserve resources,\n            and, should be undertaken at the early stages of the project."}, "docdt": "1999-11-22T00:00:00Z"}
