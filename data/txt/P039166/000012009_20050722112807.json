The\n            experience from this project confirms a number of OED\n            lessons as follows. Biodiversity conservation cannot be\n            carried out in isolation, but integrated within the economic\n            interests of local and regional communities, for resentment\n            occurs when financing of nature conservation appears to have\n            preference over unmet local needs, be it delivery of basic\n            services or employment. Thus, failure to integrate local\n            interests in the conservation and management strategy of a\n            biosphere reserve can endanger its longer-term\n            sustainability. To this end, it is indicated that\n            conservation areas will be sustainable only through good\n            management and sufficient funding to maintain it. Thus it is\n            incumbent upon the Global Environment Facility (GEF) project\n            designers to facilitate sound management, and governance\n            arrangements that include local stakeholders, and promote\n            income-generating activities that will provide sustainable\n            income for management. Moreover, biodiversity conservation\n            may require trade-offs, particularly on the size of the\n            restricted area in which all economic and human activities\n            are banned. Too large an area creates very high overheads on\n            inspections and regulation compliance, and possibly, strong\n            local opposition may undermine longer-term sustainability.\n            The size of the area depends on the conservation objectives:\n            there should be sufficient funding and time to facilitate\n            agreement on the species and/or landscape that are the\n            targets of conservation, and for research to determine\n            required minimum viable habitats/landscapes and their\n            connectivity to larger-scale ecosystems. Finally, upon the\n            establishment of biodiversity reserves it is important to\n            promote networking of the reserve staff with national and\n            international NGOs, and promote recognition by international conventions."}, "docdt": "2005-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
