         substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) In small countries, projects often involve\n            multiple ministries and limited personnel to carry out key\n            tasks. Projects can still be successfully implemented when\n            there is a strong stakeholder commitment to reform and when\n            these is the political and administrative commitment to set\n            high-quality standards, to monitor progress, and to make\n            flexible changes as necessary; 2) It is important to locate\n            the unit that coordinates implementation under the major\n            implementing Ministry, so that the senior official/s with\n            that Ministry are able to provide the necessary authority\n            for the project to progress and to avoid implementation\n            delays; 3) Quality reforms and those involving institutional\n            capacity building tend to need extended periods of time to\n            firmly take root in changed thinking and practice, and\n            therefore to have an attributable effect on staff and\n            student learning; 4) Regular and functional school-level\n            supervision, along with parental/community involvement to\n            provide feedback on aspects of the learning environment\n            (e.g. textbooks), are important to make needed changes to\n            improve student learning; and 5) Recruitment from the outset\n            of qualified staff is essential for ensuring strong and\n            consistent project implementation progress."}, "docdt": "2007-07-30T00:00:00Z"}
