Project\n            will support the development of Ecuador's capital\n            market and provide additional long-term financing for the\n            industrial sector. Greater competition in the mobilization\n            and channeling of long-term resources will also be promoted\n            by opening participation in the proposed project not only to\n            CFN and COFIEC, the country's traditional medium- and\n            long-term financial intermediaries, but also to eligible new\n            development banks. The proposed operation faces no unusual\n            project risks. There is, however, some uncertainty since the\n            industrial policy of the new Government, which is scheduled\n            to be inaugurated in August, is still unclear."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
