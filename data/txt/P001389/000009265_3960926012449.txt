HIGHLANDS WATER ENGINEERING PROJECT
(CREDIT 1747-LSO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Highlands Water Engineering Project,
for which Credit 1747-LSO (SDR 8.0 million, US$9.8 million equivalent) was approved on
December 15, 1986, and declared effective on March 13, 1987, respectively. The project was
cofinanced by the Govemment of Lesotho, European Development Fund (EDF), European
Investment Bank (EIB), Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom,
the Govemment of France, Center for Intemational Migration (CIM) of Germany, United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
and the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The credit was fully disbursed on April 11, 1990, and
the Credit was closed on December 31, 1990.
2.    This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the Southern Africa
Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). Part II has been prepared by the
implementing agency for the project, the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA).
3.    Preparation of this PCR was based inter alia on the Report and Recommendation of the
President, the Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the
Association and the Borrower and intemal Association memoranda.

HIGHLANDS WATER ENGINEERING PROJECT
(CREDIT 1747-LSO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.          The main objectives of the Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project were to
assist the Government of Lesotho in the design and preparation of the initial construction phase
(Phase LA) of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) and to support the required
institutional arrangements.
2.          Major project components included: detailed design, preparation of tender
documents and evaluation of bids for the construction of the Katse Dam, the transfer tunnel and
a hydropower complex; detailed engineering for infrastructure improvements for the LHWP;
studies on the environmental aspects, resettlement and rural development issues related to the
LHWP; strengthening of Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) through technical
assistance, training and the provision of funds for its operating expenses; technical assistance to
the Government of Lesotho to support its representation in the Joint Permanent Technical
Commission (JPTC); a power generation planning study; and an investment planning and tariff
study for the Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC) and a power generation planning study.'
3.          The project was executed by LHDA with the assistance of consultants.
Implementation Experience
4.          Despite a complex and delicate environment involving two governments and the
large number of institutions involved in project financing, implementation of the project was
successful and led to approval of Bank financing of Phase IA of LHWP (Loan 3393-ILSO,
approved on July 23, 1991). At appraisal, the project was scheduled for completion by February
28, 1990, and most of the components were completed on schedule.
5.          The implementation of the project concentrated first on the recruitment of
consultants and LHDA staff. Careful monitoring at the early stage of recruitment and adherence
to the implementation schedule expedited project initiation. Appropriate training, together with
1 The power generation planning study was included as part of the investment planning and
tariff study during implementation.

regular review of work performance, helped to build up the number and competence of Basotho
staff. The various technical assistance assignments provided LHDA with the necessary skills for
managing the project, supervising the engineering consultants, supervising the environmental and
compensation studies and preparing relevant policy proposals and for implementing the financial
management and accounting systems.
6.          All designs were reviewed by an international panel of experts which convened at
critical intervals of the design work. The findings of their reviews were incorporated in design
modifications. Close and early coordination in the design of the hydropower and water transfer
components ensured timely completion of the two major design tasks. Reviews by the panel of
international experts also reduced the risks associated with the development of designs. Similarly,
a panel of international experts reviewed the design of the action program for environmental and
social aspects of LHWP (Phase 1A).
Results
7.          As the project was implemented along the lines envisaged at appraisal with no
changes in focus, its stated objectives, namely, assisting in the design and preparation of the first
phase of the LHWP and supporting the required institutional arrangements, were successfully
achieved. The successful completion of the project not only laid the necessary engineering and
institutional foundation for commencing the LHWP (Phase 1A) but also helped to secure the large
amount of funds required for implementing it.
8.          The project also financed detailed studies on the social and environmental aspects
of the LHWP area which resulted in the adoption by the Government of Lesotho of a
comprehensive environmental action plan. The effective and successful implementation of the
environmental action plan will have positive impacts on the physical and social environment and
the living conditions for residents in the LHWP area. In addition, the project funded the LEC
development planning and tariff study which provided the necessary information for improving
the management, operation and financial performance of LEC.
Susnability
9.          As the project was the engineering phase of the LHWP (Phase 1A) its sustainability
will depend on the successful completion of the LHWP (Phase 1A) and subsequent operation of
the water transfer and hydropower components, which in turn will depend, to a large extent, upon
continued institutional development and strengthening of LHDA.

Findings and Lessons Learned
10.         The main lessons drawn from the implementation of the Lesotho Highlands Water
Engineering Project are:
careful monitoring, close coordination in the implementation of various components
and adherence to the implementation schedule at the early stage are crucial for the
timely completion of the project (see para. 5.1);
building up and strengthening the capacity of the implementing agency is critical
for the success of the project (see para. 6.6); in particular, assignment of national
staff to line positions, as opposed to functioning as counterparts, enhanced the
responsibility of staff and the sustainability of the institutional arrangements.
however, in attracting staff to the project implementing agency care should be
taken not to cause a drain of skilled local staff from other government agencies (see
para. 6.7);
early focus, open information sharing and debate are essential for ensuring the
agreement by all parties on a comprehensive environmental action plan (see para.
6.8);

Country                 Lesotho
Sector            :     Natural Resources
Sub-sector              Water
2.    Backeround
2.1         Lesotho is a small country completely surrounded by the Republic of South Africa.
It is mountainous and possesses few natural resources. Agriculture is still the leading sector of
the domestic economy, providing employment and contributing partially to income for about 70
percent of the population. The development of a modern industrial sector has been limited by the
need to import nearly all raw materials and intermediate goods, the proximity of the highly
industrialized economy of RSA, and the shortage of skilled entrepreneurial, managerial and
technical manpower. As a result, Lesotho depends heavily on RSA for paid employment,
imports, government revenue, monetary arrangements, electricity as well as transport routes.
2.2         Thus, a major objective of Lesotho's development strategy is to broaden its
economic base and thereby reduce its vulnerability to external factors that results from its heavy
dependence on RSA. However, given its slim resource base, Lesotho's ability to build a more
self-reliant economy has been extremely limited. Water is the only natural resource that is in
relative abundance in Lesotho. At present, only a small fraction of Lesotho's surface water
resources (about 175 m3/s), dominated by the Senqu River system, is utilized. The prospect for
a substantial increase in the economic exploitation of this resource has been enhanced by the
growing water deficit in South Africa's industrial hub between Pretoria and Witwatersrand and
its desire to supplement its domestic supplies with imported water from Lesotho. The feasibility
of diverting large quantities of water of the Senqu River, from the natural south-westwardly flow
north to the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging (PWV) area in RSA, was first studied in the
1950s, and again in the 1960s (under a UNDP-financed project executed by the Bank). These
earlier studies did not result in a project because agreement could not be reached between the two
governments on payment for water exports.



2.3         In 1978, the Lesotho and South African governments appointed a joint technical
committee to study further a possible water transfer scheme. The resulting feasibility report
(1979) recommended construction of a water transfer scheme of 35 cubic meters per second
(m3/s), requiring the phased construction of four dams and about 100km of water transfer tunnels.
The scheme also envisaged a hydropower generation component.
2.4         Following the review of the preliminary feasibility study, the two governments
agreed on the preparation of a more detailed project layout and on the scope of another, more
detailed, feasibility study. The cost of this feasibility study was shared by the two governments.
Stage 1 of this study commenced in August 1983 and was completed in December of the same
year. Lesotho's funding was made available through a grant from EDF. Financing from UNDP,
with the Bank as the executing agency, provided a technical team to supervise the execution of
the studies on behalf of the Government of Lesotho. The Stage 1 studies identified an optimal
project layout and concluded that there were no unsolvable environmental, socioeconomic or legal
difficulties. The two governments then agreed in 1984 to go ahead with Stage 2 of the feasibility
studies and to increase the eventual quantity of water to be exported to 70 m3/s. The Stage 2
feasibility studies were completed in April 1986.
2.5         The basic agreement to proceed with the implementation of the project was then
reached through the signing of the "Treaty on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project between the
Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho and the Government of the Republic of South Africa" (the
Treaty) on October 24, 1986. The Treaty covered the rights and obligations of each party and
specified the quantities of water to be delivered, the cost sharing provisions, and the scope and
calculation of benefit (royalty) payments.  It further set out the principles for financing,
construction, operating and maintaining the LHWP. The Treaty provided that RSA would be
responsible for all the costs of that part of LHWP related to the delivery of water to South Africa
and Lesotho would be solely responsible for financing the hydropower component. Thus, Lesotho
would assume virtually no financial obligation for the water transfer component. The Treaty also
provided for the establishment of a number of institutions including the Joint Permanent Technical
Committee and the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority.
2.6         The Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project covered the detailed design stage
of the first construction phase of the LHWP. This multi-purpose scheme would allow the Lesotho
Government to exploit an abundant natural resource as a means of generating revenues which
would help broaden the country's economic base. The scheme would raise revenues for
development from the sale of water to South Africa, generate hydroelectric power for domestic
consumption and promote development of the project area.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1         The objectives of the Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project were to assist
the Government of Lesotho in the design and preparation of the initial phase of the LHWP and

3.3        In addition and parallel to the preparation activities under Part A of the Project,
geotechnical investigations, detailed engineering, preparation of tender documents and evaluation
of bids for the construction of the delivery tunnel from the tail pond of the hydropower complex
to the Ash River outlet in RSA, including the terminal structures and syphon-type crossings under
various rivers, were carried out and financed by agencies of RSA pursuant to the Treaty.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1         The Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project was identified in 1982 when the
feasibility study was commissioned. Subsequently, the Government of Lesotho formally requested
Bank assistance in carrying out the project. From the beginning the design of the project was
carried out within the overall framework of the country's development strategy, namely, to
broaden its economic base and to promote sustainable development. The project's objectives were
clearly understood by all the relevant parties involved, and the design and organization of the
various components of the project were well coordinated. Execution of the Engineering Project
was the responsibility of LHDA, which was provided for by the Treaty and established under
Lesotho law in November 1986. The Project was appraised in October 1985 and the credit
negotiated in May 1986. As is evidenced by the smooth process of implementation the scope and
scale of the project were consistent with its stated objectives and the project was well prepared.
5.    Project Implementation
5.1         Implementation Schedule  At appraisal, the project was scheduled for completion
by February 28, 1990, and most of the components were completed on schedule. The
implementation of the project concentrated first on the recruitment of consultants and LHDA staff.
Careful monitoring at the early stage of recruitment and adherence to the implementation schedule
expedited project initiation. Close and early coordination in the design of the hydropower and
water transfer components ensured timely completion of the two major design tasks. Reviews by
a panel of international experts also reduced the risks associated with the development of designs.
Despite the large number of institutions involved in the project financing, no delays were
experienced during the implementation of the components financed by the Engineering Project.



5.2         Project Costs and Financing    The total cost of the project was estimated at
US$51.3 million at appraisal, comprising US$37.8 million (or 74 percent) in foreign costs and
US$13.5 million (or 26 percent) in local costs. Estimated and actual costs and funding for the
project are detailed in Table 5 in Part III. The Credit was approved by the Board on December
11, 1986, and the Development Credit Agreement was signed on December 15, 1986. Original
financing under the Engineering Credit was for the amount of SDR 7.8 million (US$9.75 million
equivalent), or 19 percent of the estimated total cost. Further funding for the project was
provided by CIM of Germany, EDF, EIB, ODA, the Government of France, the Government of
Lesotho, RSA, USAID and UNDP. As specified in the Development Credit Agreement, the
execution of the EDF Loan Agreement and the EIB Loan Agreement was condition of credit
effectiveness and the credit became effective on March 13, 1987. Final IDA disbursement under
the Engineering Project was US$10.43 million due to the fall in the dollar against SDR during
project implementation.
5.3         Disbursements  In order to expedite disbursements, a Special Account in US
dollars was established in the United Kingdom and operated by the Central Bank of Lesotho on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. AR IDA eligible expenditures were
prefinanced from the Special Account, unless otherwise previously agreed to by the Association.
The annual audit of LHDA's accounts also covered the Special Account and associated statements
of expenditures. The estimated and actual disbursements of the Credit are given in Table 3 in
Part III. As can be seen from the Table, there were no significant variances between estimated
disbursements at appraisal and actual disbursements and the last disbursement was made on April
11, 1990. The credit was closed, as originally planned, on December 31, 1990, and the Special
Account was closed on February 4, 1991.
6.    Project Results
6.1         Piject Objective   As the Engineering Project was implemented along the lines
envisaged at appraisal with no changes in focus, its stated objectives, namely, assisting in the
design and preparation of the first phase of the LHWP and supporting the required institutional
arrangements, were successfully achieved. The successful completion of the Engineering Project
has laid the necessary engineering and institutional foundation for commencing the LHWP (Phase
IA), which is partly financed by the Bank (LN 3393-LSO).
6.2         Engineering Designs  The designs of the Katse dam and the transfer tunnel were
carried out by a joint venture consisting of firms from France, RSA and the United Kingdom.
The delivery tunnel was designed by another joint venture composed of firms from RSA. The
design services for the hydropower component were provided by firms from France and the
United Kingdom. All designs were reviewed by an international panel of experts which convened
at critical intervals of the design work. The findings of their reviews were incorporated in design
modifications. Selection of design consultants financed by the Credit was carried out according
to IDA guidelines.



- 6 -
6.3         Tender Documents and Bid Evaluation   Tender documents for the major civil
works for the water transfer component, i.e., Katse dam and reservoir, transfer tunnel and
delivery tunnel, were issued on October 16, 1989. Tenders were received on April 20, 1990 and
their evaluation was completed in August 1990 and contracts were awarded in December 1990.
As construction activities for the hydropower component have to start later than the water transfer
component, tenders for the hydropower component are phased and later than those for the water
transfer component. Tenders for the civil works were invited in October 1992 and those for
electro-mechanical equipment in November 1992.
6.4         Securing Financing for the LHWP (Phase IA'  The LHWP (Phase 1A) is a huge
undertaking even by international standards, with total cost estimated at US$2,414 million.
Raising such a large sum of funds for a small, resource-poor country like Lesotho presented a
major challenge. In addition, as the costs of the water transfer and hydropower components were
the respective responsibilities of RSA and the Government of Lesotho (para. 2.5) funding
arrangements for the two components had to be different. Under the Credit a financial advisor
was retained to assist LHDA in raising the financing for the water transfer component. To
maximize international financing of the civil works, tenders were invited on a financed basis and
funding raised by contractors and suppliers in the form of export credits and associated
commercial loans was sought. This strategy proved successful and resulted in the receipt of bids
from major exporting countries supported by offers of significant export credits and commercial
loans. To ensure that debt service payments for the offshore lenders would be met in a timely
manner and to provide some comfort for lenders who might otherwise be reluctant to assist in the
financing, the Bank agreed to the establishment of a trust in which it would participate and share
any shortfalls in repayments with other lenders on a pari passu basis. To complement the
offshore lending, LHDA also developed a strategy for obtaining the on-shore financing from
sources within Lesotho and RSA. As a result, financing for most items related to the water
transfer component was secured before the start of construction of the LHWP (Phase IA). A
financial advisor, funded by the European Economic Community, assisted in the coordination of
the financing for the hydropower component.
6.5         Advance Infrastructure and Access Roads  Another important result of the
Engineering Project was the construction of advance infrastructure for the LHWP (Phase IA).
The first contracts for engineering services were awarded in 1987 and contracts for the initial
section of the access roads to project sites were awarded in early 1988 with financing provided
by the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). All advance infrastructure, including the
access roads were completed during 1990.
6.6         Institutional Development   One of the major components of the Engineering
Project was to assist in the establishment and strengthening of LHDA. The LHDA was
established in November 1986 by order of His Majesty King Moshoeshoe II (Order No. 23) and
charged with the execution of the engineering, construction, and operation and maintenance of the
LHWP, including the hydropower component. LHDA's current management structure evolved
during the implementation of the Engineering Project. Initially, the chief executive had direct
supervisory responsibility for all of LHDA's departments (technical, finance and accounting). In
1988, additional departments (environment, legal, public relations, training and infrastructure)



- 7 -
were created and the positions of deputy chief executive and assistant to the chief executive were
established. In 1989, the capital finance division, in charge of coordinating and monitoring the
securing of finance for the LHWP (Phase LA) construction project was created and a second
deputy chief executive was appointed. The various technical assistance assignments financed
under the Engineering Project provided LHDA with the necessary skills for managing the project,
supervising the engineering consultants, supervising the environmental and compensation studies
and preparing relevant policy proposals and for implementing the financial management and
accounting systems.
6.7         Training and Human Resources Development  During the implementation of the
Engineering Project, LHDA gradually built up its staff from 60 at the end of FY87 to 248 regular
employees and about 20 semi-skilled workers in non-permanent positions by FY90. Careful
monitoring of the work performance and appropriate training helped to build up the competence
of Basotho staff. Out of its total work force, 68 higher level positions in the fields of accounting,
administration, engineering, environment, finance and legal services were filled with Basotho
staff. Practically all Basotho staff in higher level positions took over direct line positions and
were not assigned on a counterpart arrangement basis. This approach proved to be extremely
successful as it greatly enhanced the sense of responsibility of the staff and prepared them for
early career advancement. LHDA's salary levels are attractive enough to retain qualified staff
who otherwise might be looking for employment elsewhere, either in the local private sector or
in neighboring countries. However, the build-up of LHDA's staff was achieved, to some extent,
through the hiring of qualified staff from other government agencies. This caused some
difficulties in the affected agencies. These difficulties have been mitigated by restructuring the
Fourth Education Project (Credit 1512-LSO) to expand the overseas training of Basotho
professionals for upgrading their skills through two-year programs so that they could fill positions
vacated by those hired by LHDA. In addition, various donors have provided fellowship
programs, primarily in engineering, for Basotho professionals. Also, in response to the general
decline of the real value of civil service salaries and in order to retain qualified staff the
Government of Lesotho instituted a special allowance scheme for technical staff working in other
government agencies.
6.8         Social and Environmental Aspects  The project produced a three-pronged
environmental action plan (EAP), based on extensive studies made before and during the project,
to be implemented during the LHWP (Phase 1A) project. The EAP comprises (i) a natural
environment and heritage plan protecting flora, fauna and places of historical interest, (ii) a
compensation plan for households losing dwellings, farmland and/or grazing land, and (iii) a rural
development plan to further enhance the standard of living of the affected households by providing
skills training and infrastructure in addition to the compensation measures. Government has
adopted a compensation policy and enacted relevant regulations. The EAP will serve as a pilot
for many of the measures in the National EAP implemented by Ministry of Planning with donor
support. The project further prepared for implementation of the EAP during LHWP (Phase LA)
in two ways: (i) construction of advanced infrastructure took place during the project which gave
opportunity to apply and modify compensation and resettlement policies on a pilot basis, and (ii)
LHDA got the time to build up and give experience to an environmental division now charged
with implementation responsibility for the EAP. LHDA's environmental division was supported



- 8 -
by a full-time environmental advisor and two meetings of an international panel of experts
reviewing the preparation of the EAP. Agreement on the compensation policies and the cost
sharing of the rural development plan between the two participating governments was reached only
after long discussions. IDA facilitated the process by providing technical assistance through
missions and by promoting open and timely sharing of information between the parties. The early
and open discussions also contributed to building consensus within LHDA (the engineering units
and the environmental division) on the scope and content of the EAP. The EAP was created fully
in line with World Bank guidelines and is of high quality. This is due to a combination of (i)
LHDA taking ownership of the development of the EAP and putting priority on it, and providing
resources for the work, and (ii) Bank supervisory staff giving the EAP due attention in all project
components, adequately supported by environmental specialist mission staff.
7.    Project Sustainabilitv
7.1         The project not only contributed to the successful completion of the engineering
works for the LHWP (Phase IA) but also actively supported the institutional development of the
LHDA. The LHWP (Phase 1A) is financed partly by an IBRD loan (Loan 3393-LSO) and the
institutional development and strengthening of LHDA in practically all fields continue to be
supported by the LHWP (Phase IA). Efforts are also continuing to replace expatriates with
Basotho staff as and when the latter acquire the requisite experience. The present organizational
structure of LHDA will require changes as the implementation of the LHWP (Phase 1A) nears
completion, in order for it to become ready for the operating phase of water transfer and
hydropower generation. To ensure that the appropriate institutional structure and capacity are in
place before the start of operations LHDA has agreed under the LHWP (Phase IA) to undertake
an organizational review and training assessment. The agreed recommendations of such studies
will be implemented by LHDA by October 31, 1994. Thus, to a large extent, sustained
institutional development will depend on LHDA's effort and capacity to implement in a timely
fashion the required changes in its own structure as the project moves on to subsequent stages.
8.    Association Performance
8.1         The main rationale for the Association's involvement in the Engineering Project
stemmed from its belief that the LHWP is in the best economic interest of Lesotho as it offers a
unique opportunity to convert water into export revenue. At the request of the Government of
Lesotho the Bank helped to guide the complicated and delicate negotiations between Lesotho and
RSA and acted as the lead agency in the raising of the massive amounts of funds required for
implementing the project. The Association's involvement in the Engineering Project not only
ensured the successful completion of the engineering phase but also sent strong signals to
international contractors and financial institutions confirming the desirability as well as the
feasibility of the project, and was instrumental in securing the necessary financing for the project.
Because of its impartiality the Association was able to act as the "honest broker" in a complex and
delicate environment involving two governments and a large number of consultants, thus ensuring
the economic, financial and environmental viability of the LHWP while at the same time



- 9 -
promoting the widest possible international cooperation in the LHWP. The complexity and
sensitivity of the project required considerable flexibility and freedom for managers to make quick
decisions.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1         The implementing agency for the project, LHDA, performed very well during the
implementation of the project, particularly given its rapid rate of growth during the period in
question. LHDA's accounts have been audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Association since its establishment in 1986, and the audit reports were submitted to the
Association within four months of the end of each fiscal year. LHDA's performance in this
regard has also been satisfactory. The audits did not raise any issues.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1        The Association's relationship with the Government of Lesotho and LHDA, the
implementing agency, on the project has been very satisfactory.
11.   Consultine Services and Studies
11.1        The Engineering Project financed consultants for the technical assistance
components and the design of a component of the water transfer facilities. The consultants were
shortlisted by the Government of Lesotho and selected in accordance with the Association's
guidelines. Consultants financed from other sources were recruited in accordance with the
respective financing agencies' requirements. The RSA-financed consultants for the water transfer
component were familiar with the project because of their participation in the feasibility study and
provided valuable continuity. The Association was very actively involved in reviewing the
progress and recommendations of the consultants in close cooperation with LHDA.  All
consultants have performed to the full satisfaction of LHDA.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1        The Development Credit Agreement in the case of Credit 1747-LSO was
appropriate for achieving project objectives. The inclusion of the execution of the EDF Loan
Agreement and the EIB Loan Agreement as additional conditions of credit effectiveness ensured
that financing from other sources for the project was made available at the early stage of project
implementation. The provisions regarding the execution of the project and the financial covenants
were particularly useful in ensuring the close consultation and cooperation between the Association



- 10 -
and LHDA during every stage of the project implementation. As the project was an engineering
credit, no staff appraisal report was produced. However, the Memorandum and Recommendation
of the President provided a useful framework for both the Association and LHDA for project
supervision and implementation.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Introduction
1.    The implementation of the Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project was a critical
stage in the development of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP). It represented
concrete evidence of the commitment of the parties to the Treaty to proceed with the
implementation of the LHWP. The generous financial support and goodwill received by the
Lesotho Government from bilateral and multilateral development aid agencies was a strong
catalyst in stimulating a receptive environment among the international contracting and
financial communities thereby paving the way for the eventual successful fund-raising program
for the construction phase of this complex scheme.
Project Benefits/Results
2.    The engineering project provided an ideal opportunity for establishing a sound
institutional and financial foundations for the successful implementation of the construction
phase of the LHWP. With the financing provided by the donor community, as well as direct
contributions by both parties to the Treaty, it was possible to procure key services to
supplement LHDA's own expertise.
3.    Apart from the services usually associated with "engineering projects", the Lesotho
Highlands Water Engineering Project included services in two key areas. These were
technical assistance for institutional support to LHDA and financial advisory services. The
technical assistance provided by a reputable engineering consultancy firm greatly enhanced
LHDA's capability in supervising and monitoring the preparation of designs and tender
documents. Similarly, the financial advisory services provided by an international merchant
bank, were critical in facilitating the successful mobilization of the massive financing required
for the major construction works of the Water Transfer component of the LHWP.



- 12 -
4.    The engineering project also provided financing for wide-ranging studies into
environmental and resettlement aspects of the LHWP. These studies have resulted in the
formulation of a comprehensive Environmental Action Plan which is being implemented
parallel to major construction works and is aimed at ameliorating the negative impacts of the
LHWP on the communities in the project area.
Conclusion
5.    The Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project greatly facilitated the preparation of
the LHWP and has ensured the timely and successful implementation of the construction phase
of the project.
