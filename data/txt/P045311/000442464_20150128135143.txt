Rebuilding Lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina                                                                 September 17, 2002
                          During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a grenade hit and devastated Milada Macanovic’s family business. 
                          Today the 30-square-meter grocery store that Milada and her husband rebuilt in the southern Bosnian city of
                          Konjic is stocked with cabbage, green beans, potatoes, peppers, pasta, candy, cookies, juice, soda, water, and
                          ice cream. 

                          Milada is one of many beneficiaries of the World Bank’s Local Initiatives Project, which over the past five years
                          has helped to sustain more than 170,000 jobs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In a country burdened with a 30 to 40
                          percent unemployment rate, the Bank has dispersed more than $130,000 in small-enterprise loans.

Though the store hadn’t grown in size, Milada used the credits to keep it fully stocked for the neighborhood, and the income derived from it
supports her family of five.  She has already paid back most of the DM20,000—about $10,000—she had been lent over the last three
years.

Milada and her husband are among 3.5 million Bosnians across the country who are slowly putting their lives back together and trying to
create a stable future for their families.
