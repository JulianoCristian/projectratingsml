Regardless of success,\n            lessons address the following. Particularly appropriate, was\n            the decision to contract nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) as implementing partners, given the post-conflict\n            context in the country, for although other legal entities\n            were also eligible, NGOs' comparative advantages, met\n            the needs for micro-credit services provision. However,\n            financial/business skills, and management capacity vary\n            across NGOs; most likely, micro-credit organizations\n            combining client-driven approaches, with strong business\n            management will succeed. This was largely due to the\n            investments in technical assistance, and training, which\n            strengthened micro-finance institutions' capacity in\n            micro-credit operations, and, likewise, their\n            performance-based financing provided incentives to\n            strengthen their institutional, and financial performance."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
