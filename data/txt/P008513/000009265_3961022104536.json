"The objectives of the Sheep Development\n            Project are to: 1) increase the profitability and efficiency\n            of sheep and wool farming; 2) privatize the provision of\n            several services to farmers, including wool marketing and\n            veterinary services; and 3) improve the management and\n            conservation of natural grazing resources by farmers. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will focus on: 1)\n            organizing sheep and wool farmers into farmers'\n            associations or groups through which essential services can\n            be channeled; 2) developing a competitive marketing\n            structure with incentives for production of quality lambs\n            and wool for premium prices; 3) increasing sheep and wool\n            productivity through establishing training and advisory\n            services for private farmers and supporting selected\n            breeding activities; and 4) developing and disseminating\n            sustainable pasture management techniques among sheep\n            producers. The project consists of three main components: 1)\n            sheep private enterprise development, including: (a) sheep\n            producers' groups/associations; (b) regional sheep\n            breeders associations; (c) Kyrgyz sheep breeders\n            associations; (d) wool and lamb marketing; and (e) wool\n            testing; 2) development of livestock support services, which\n            comprises: (a) project implementation unit; (b) agricultural\n            training and advisory services; and (c) animal health\n            services; and 3) sheep breeding research support involving\n            sheep breeding research and pastures land resources."}, "docdt": "1996-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
