IntroductoryStatement

1. This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce changes
   in the Mozambique HIV/AIDS Response Project (the Project) (Grant No. H0300-
   Moz) andthe accompanying amendment to the Project's legal documents.

2. The proposed changes are as follows: (i)    modify the project development objective
   (PDO) to indicate that the IDA i s only one player in the fight against HIVIAIDS and
   that its success will be judged through the success of key prevention and care
   activities. Thus the PDO will read as follows: "The Project Development Objective is
   to contribute to slow the spread o f HIV/AIDS inMozambique and mitigate the effects
   o f the epidemic through prevention and care activities''; (ii)change the results
   framework indicators by removing one outcome indicator, which makes a specific
   reference to prevalence rate, and adding one outcome indicator and modifying three
   intermediate outcome indicators that can be attributed to the Project; (iii) the
                                                                              change
   fundingmechanism inorder to allow IDA funds for Parts A, ByC and Eofthe Project
   to be channeled to the Common Fund of the National Commission to Combat AIDS
   (CNCS) together with funds from other bilateral and multilateral organizations; (iv)
   reallocate funds between categories; and (v) extend the closing date of the project by
   one year from December 31, 2008 to December 31,2009 in order to have sufficient
   time to implement the measures outlined above. This package o f measures will help
   improve the implementation of the project and help the government scale up the
   nationalresponse to the epidemic.

BackgroundandReasonsfor Restructuring

3. The Project was approved by the Board on March 28, 2003, and became effective on
   August 15, 2003. The original grant amount was SDR 41.6 million, of which SDR
   20.8 million or 50% has been disbursed. Project funding i s channeled through two
   government institutions: the CNCS and the Ministry o f Health (MOH). The
   implementation o f prevention activities (Parts A, B, C, and E o f the Project) is the
   responsibility o f the CNCS. Treatment o f opportunistic infections and the
   strengtheningo f service delivery (Part D) are implementedbythe MOH.

4. After effectiveness, project implementation was sluggish during the first two years.
   The slow progress was largely due to the fact that CNCS hadbeen directly managing
   the grant-making process itself and actually processing all subprojects from civil
   society and the public sector throughout the country. The large number o f small
   subprojects processed has resulted in high transaction costs and delays. The
   institution's engagement with line ministries was also slow during the initial two
   years. For these reasons the project was ratedunsatisfactory from May 2004 to March
   2007 when, as a result of significant improvement in project management and
   implementation, it was upgradedto satisfactory.

5. After the mid-term review in February 2006, there has been significant improvement
   in project implementation, and the disbursements of IDA funds have increased
   significantly. For example, the number o f subprojects approved and implemented at
   the community level through all 11 provinces of the country increased from 664 in

                                            3

     2004 to around 1,800 in 2006. Also, the government has largely exceeded its targets
     interms of voluntary counseling andtesting centers created; numbero f people tested
     and advised; number o f facilities that offer prevention o f mother-to-childtransmission
     services; and the number o fpersons who receivehome based treatment. Private sector
     companies are increasing their work place preventive programs and more than 50
    percent of the US$2 million allocated to them has been disbursed. The multi-sector
    response is gaining momentum. All ministries have started implementing their
     HIV/AIDSaction plans. CNCS has committed about US$ 10.0 million for the public
     sector (from IDA and other donors) and disbursements have reached about US$ 1.0
    million. See updated Results Framework inAnnex 1.

  ProposedChanges

  6. The proposed changes will modify slightly the PDO to make it more precise but the
     scope o f the Project will remainthe same. The changes include:

             (i)    The modification o f the PDO as follows: "The PDO is to contribute to
                    slow the spread o f HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and mitigate the effects
                    o f the epidemic throughpreventionand care activities".

             (ii)   The removal o f the outcome indicator: "By 2008, reduce by 25% the
                    rate of increase in HIV prevalence among women inthe age group 15-
                    24" as prevalence rate is considered an inappropriate indicator to track
                    the evolutiono fthe HIV/AIDSepidemic.

             (iii)The changes in the following outcomehntermediate indicators are
                    introducedto better align them with United Nations General Assembly
                    Special Session on AIDS (UNGASS).

                          1. "By 2008, the age of sexual debut has increased by one year
                             over 2002 age" to read as follows: "By 2009, the percentage of
                             15-24 olds who had sex before the age 15 has declined to less
.                            than20% from (baseline year) level."

                         2. "By 2008, the share o f number o f the population from the age
                             group 15-49, who have had sexual partners outside the primary
                             union inthe last 12 months has declined by 10% from the 2002
                             level" to read as follows: "By 2009, the percentage o f young
                             men and women aged 15-24 who have had sex with a non-
                             marital, non-cohabiting partner in the last 12 months has
                             declined by 10% from the 2002 level."

                         3. "By 2008 the rate o f condom use in sexual encounters outside
                             of primary relationship inthe last 12 months by persons 15-19,
                             has increased by 20% from 2002 levels." To read as follows:
                             "By 2009 the percentage ofyoung women and menaged 15-24
                             who used a condom at the last time they had sex with a non-
                             regular partner, has increased by 20% from 2006 levels."

                                                4

              (iv) The addition of one intermediate outcome indicator to assess the
                   functioning o f the monitoring and evaluation system as a management
                   tool to assist CNCS in its coordinating and strategic roles concerning
                   the national HIV/AIDS response. The intermediate indicator reads as
                   follows: "By 2008, CNCS can report annually on at least 75% of the
                   indicators in its national HN M&E Framework and that a report is
                   disseminated to national leaders."

7. An important restructuring measure i s the contracting out o f the grant-making
    mechanism to a Grant Management Agency (GMA), a private company. This
    measure should have a strong impact on project implementation as grant making
   represents more than 60 percent o f the total project cost. The contract was signed on
    March 7, 2007, and since then the collaboration between the GMA and CNCS has
    been excellent.

8. CNCS i s inthe process o f strengthening its provincial offices by increasing staffing in
    financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. Inaddition the GMA will post
    technical advisors in each province, who will support the provincial offices in
   processing the subprojects. The role o f provincial offices o f CNCS i s to coordinate,
   promote and oversee the implementation o f HIV/AIDS interventions by different
    actors (public, private and civil society). These offices also have the authority to
    approve and finance local subproject proposals below a given threshold, and execute
    financial management and internal auditing functions.

9. To reduce transaction costs for the government, IDA will channel its funds for the
    CNCS parts of the Project through a Common Fund with other donors. The key
    donors o f the Common Fundare Canada, Denmark, DFID, Ireland, and Sweden. The
    Global Fundi s expected to join soon.

10. To allow time for the implementation o f the changes, the Closing Date will be
    extended by one year to December 31,2009.

11.The principles of IDA participation in the Common Fund are outlined in a
   Memorandum o f Understanding signed by IDA, partners, and CNCS on April 6,
   2006. Each year at the time o f the Annual Review meeting, a common disbursement
   plan will be agreed upon between the CNCS and the Common Fund Partners (IDA
    and other donors participating in the Common Fund) for the following year. The
   contributions o f the Common Fund Partners will be transferred in installments upon
   agreement that certain triggers have been met. The triggers for the first disbursement
   are: (i)agreed and endorsed comprehensive, prioritized and costed Annual
   Operational Plan (AOP), including cash flow requirements; and (ii)Financial
   Monitoring Reports (FMRs) from the first three quarters o f the previous year. The
   triggers for the subsequent disbursements are: (i)draft o f external financial and
   procurement audit report from the previous year; and (ii)   FMRs of the previous year
   plus the first quarter of the current year. For each fiscal year, the percentage of IDA
   financing will be basedon the total AOP, andneeds for financing from IDA and other
   Common Fund Partners. The lessons learned from the 2006 annual review were

                                             5

    submitted by CNCS to Common Fund Partners and the Bank for comments, and
    subsequently used in the formulation and discussion o f the AOP for 2007. In
    December 2006, the 2007 AOP was endorsed by all Common FundPartners.

12. A reallocation o f funds between categories i s proposed as follows. The amounts of
    the grant allocated for Part A (Community and Civil Society Initiatives), Part B
    (Capacity Building for the Civil Society HIV/AIDS Response), Part C (Ministerial
    Multi-Sector Response), and Part E (Program Management) o f the Project for
    disbursement categories 1-6 of Schedule 1 will be reduced to what has already been
    disbursed plus funds expected to be disbursed until the effectiveness of the
    amendment to the Development Grant Agreement (DGA). The amounts allocated to
    categories 1-6 include the outstanding amount from the original Special Account A o f
    US$ 1.15 million that the Recipient will document with eligible expenditures by
    September 30,2007. The difference between the original amounts for these categories
    and the new reduced amounts will be aggregated and reallocated to a new
    disbursement category 9 called "Works, Goods, Consultant Services, Training and
    Operating Costs for Parts A, B, C and E, and Sub-Grants for Subprojects under Parts
    A and C of the Project", for a total of SDR 14.31 million out o f a total grant of SDR
    41.6 million. This will allow IDA to fund a portion o f the AOPs and Budgets of the
    CNCS. N o change will be made regarding the allocations for Part D implemented by
    the MOH. A table providingthe revised allocationof funds is presentedinAnnex 2.

13. This amendment also includes a correction to the wording o f Part C o f the Project
    description that allows funds for the Ministerial Multi-Sector response to be
    channeled for public sector subprojects. Inorder to allow for: (i) capacity buildingof
    Civil Society Organizations (CSOs); and (ii)   the provision o f antiretroviral treatment
   by CSOs, the description of Part A (Community and Civil Society Initiatives) of the
    Project was modified to allow for facilitating agents to simultaneously undertake
    capacity building activities and implementation o f subprojects. Part B (Capacity
   Building for Civil Society HIV/AIDS Response) o f the Project is now limited to
   capacity needs assessment for CSOs and the establishment o f a data base to provide
   information on certain features o f the CSOs, their location and areas o f expertise.

14. The amendment also includes changes inthe procurement schedule to align the DGA
   with the current Bank procurement guidelines. To that effect, the proposed new
   Procurement Schedule includes the following changes: (i) insertion in Section Iof
                                                               the
    Schedule 3, o f the applicable Bank Procurement and Consultants Guidelines dated
   May 2004, revised October 2006; (ii)    the eliminationo fthe ceilings bythe aggregated
   amounts o f contracts for goods and works to facilitate smooth implementation of
   activities without the need o f further amendments to the Grant; and (iii)   the increase
   of the threshold, under National Competitive Bidding, for goods from US$ 150,000 to
   US$200,000 and the introduction of a threshold of US$ 500,000 for works, for
   National Competitive Bidding.

Analysis

15.The proposed changes will not affect the economic, financial, technical and social
    aspects of the Project as appraised. The institutional arrangements will essentially
    remain the same, i.e. CNCS will continue to be the agency responsible for the
    implementation of parts A, B, C, and E and the M O H for part D. With the creation o f
    the Common Fund in November 2006, ajoint Financial Management Committee of
    the Common Fund was created to facilitate decision making. Members o f this
    committee include CNCS officials, and two representatives o f the Common Fund
    Partners. This committee i s not supposed to substitute CNCS in its decision-making
    capacity and authority. Since some discussions in the committee may include
    procurement issues, IDA will not take part in the Financial Management Committee
    deliberations. Donors and IDA have agreed on criteria for the prior review o f
    contracts above the thresholds defined in the DGA. To that effect, the DGA will be
    amended to reflect, inter alia, that subprojects will be appraised, approved,
    coordinated, monitored and evaluated by the GMA instead of CNCS, using
    essentially the same eligibility criteria andunder the same terms andconditions.

16. In addition, to reflect the mechanisms and guiding principles o f the Common Fund
    functioning, changes in the implementation program were made and include: (i)a
    description o f the AOP and budget including the process o f its approval by all parties;
    and (ii)a descriptionof the role and mandate o f the GMA and CNCS inrespect o f the
    grant making function. There are no exceptions to IDA policies as a result o f these
    proposed changes.

17. Of the three effectiveness conditions o f the Amendment Letter, two have been
    already met, namely: (i) adoption o f the revised Operations Manual in form and
                                the
    substance satisfactory the Association; and (ii)    that CNCS can produce Financial
    Monitoring Reports in form and substance satisfactory to the Association. The third
    condition refers to the receipt by the Association o f a refund in the amount o f US$
    1,350,000 o f the advance made to the original Special Account A. The submission by
    September 30, 2007 of documentation evidencing that the remaining outstanding
    advance o f US$1,150,000 has been used for eligible expenditures has been included
    as a covenant inthe Amendment Letter. The 2006 audit is due on June 30,2007.

18. The audit report o f 2005 was unqualified. Some management, accountability and
    internal control issues were raised by the auditor. The Bank sent a letter to CNCS
   urging it to address the issues raised in the audit report. CNCS is currently taking
   measures to: (i)  improve its internal audit functions; (ii)
                                                              strengthen the supervision o f
   provincial delegations o f CNCS; and (iii)recruit 11 financial managers with the
    objective o f having all o f them contracted by June 30,2007.

ExpectedOutcomes

19.As mentioned, the project development objective has been modified, i.e. "to
    contribute to slow the spread o f HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and mitigate the effects
    o f the epidemic through prevention and care activities". Expected outcomes and
    intermediate results are presented inAnnex 1.

Benefitsand Risks

20. The proposed restructuring i s expected to make CNCS more efficient in providing
    financing to preventiveand mitigating actions by the public and private sector as well
    as civil society. It will also allow CNCS to better focus on its leadership and
    coordinating role and become more strategic in guiding the national response.
    Ultimately, as already mentioned in paragraph 2, a better project implementation
    would help reduce over time new HIV/AIDS infections, increase survival rates and
    improve quality o f life o f those infected.

21 The main potential risk i s that the restructuring measures take more time to have an
    effect. For example, the GMA could take longer to put inplace an efficient system o f
    grant making. This risk was mitigated through the selection criteria that required
    bidders to already have a strong experience in the implementation o f similar
    operations. Another risk would be for CNCS to take more time in improving its role
    o f coordination and leadership. Through policy dialogue and evidence from recent
    supervision missions, there are already signs that CNCS i s preparing itself to take that
    role and considering how to focus implementation on the sectors whose activities will
    have the greatestpotential impact.

22. Under the new implementation arrangements, CNCS will use an updated Operational
    Manual and will produce Financial and Monitoring Reports (FMRs) acceptable to the
    Association. A risk associated with the FMR i s the delay in reporting by
    implementing agencies that may impair the ability of CNCS to produce complete
    FMRs needed for disbursements to the Common Fund. To mitigate this risk,
    implementing agencies will be carefully instructed in the reporting requirements of
    the subprojects inaccordance with the guidelines set forth inthe subproject manual.

23. CNCS provincial offices and the GMA, who will process grants for subprojects, will
    follow the requirements o f the CNCS Financial Procedures Manual. This Manual
    describes the accounting system, internal control procedures, basis o f accounting,
    standards to be followed, authorization procedures, financial reporting process,
    budgetingprocedures, financial forecasting procedures, andcontract management.

24. The Internal Audit Unit o f CNCS has been strengthened by hiring additional staff.
    This unit now comprises seven internal auditors, including the Supervisor. CNCS is
    also recruiting an assistant auditor. Among other tasks, the Internal Audit unit is
    supporting the CNCS financial management unit by reviewing financial management
    arrangements o f organizations that are implementingsubprojects.
