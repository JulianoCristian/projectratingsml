"The HIV/AIDS Response Project for\n            Mozambique aims to assist the Government of Mozambique to\n            finance the implementation of its national strategic plan to\n            combat sexually transmitted deceases, and HIV/AIDS. The\n            strategy is designed to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS\n            infection, and mitigate the effects of the epidemic through\n            prevention, and care treatment. The national strategic plan\n            is multi-sectoral in nature, bringing together the efforts\n            of government, civil society, private sector, and\n            communities in a national campaign to slow the rate of\n            infection and provide care for those who suffer from the\n            disease. The project has five components. The community and\n            civil society initiatives would empower communities to\n            respond effectively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; the capacity\n            building for the civil society HIV/AIDS response will\n            support efforts to create AIDS competent communities by\n            improving skills, and increasing implementation capacity for\n            the implementers, supporters, and target groups active under\n            the community and civil society initiatives; the government\n            multi-sector response will support ministries and\n            subordinate institutions in the development and\n            implementation of HIV/AIDS related programs directed toward\n            their own personnel and; strengthening and scaling up health\n            sector services for HIV/AIDS to provide technical leadership\n            on treatment and care for people living with HIV/AIDS."}, "docdt": "2003-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
