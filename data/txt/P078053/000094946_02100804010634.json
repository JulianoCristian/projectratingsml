In this frame, the environmental\n            assessment (EA) focuses heavily on the handling, collection,\n            evacuation, and management of wastes resulting from the\n            incidence of HIV/AIDS. The EA sets the framework to regulate\n            the health care waste (HCW) management in health facilities,\n            and procedures to control, through a technical approach, HCW\n            management, beginning with an emphasis on information\n            campaigns, and training programs, followed by the\n            reinforcement of the management capacity of the private\n            sector involved in solid waste management, which includes a\n            framework for partnerships with civil society. Equipment for\n            adequate HCWs collection, storage containers, and\n            incinerators will be provided for health care facilities,\n            and, appropriate uses of recyclable materials will be promoted."}, "docdt": "2002-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
