Re:

Coastal Pollution Management Project)
Amendments to the Project Agreement
Dear Sirs:
Please refer to the Project Agreement, dated October 28, 1994, between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and Companhia 
Espírito Santense de Saneamento (CESAN) for the above referenced Project, as amended, 
and to the discussions between representatives of the Bank, CESAN and the State of 
Espírito Santo during the mid-term review of the progress of the Project held from May 
26 to June 5, 1998.  We propose to amend the Project Agreement in order to revise some 
of the performance indicators and targets applicable to CESAN and to the Project, as 
follows: In Section 4.02 (a), the figure "60%" is replaced by "72%". 
2. Section 4.03 (a) is amended to read as follows: "Section 4.03. (a) Without 
limitation to the provisions of Section 4.02 of this Agreement, CESAN shall, 
unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, cover, from its funds from internal 
sources, at least 30% of its 
total capital expenditures."
3. The table in the Schedule is amended to read as set forth in the Attachment 
to this letter.
If you agree with the foregoing amendments, please sign the three copies of this 
letter on the spaces provided below, and return one fully signed copy to us.  This 
amendment will become effective as of the date of this letter, upon receipt by the 
Bank of one fully signed copy of this letter.
Sincerely, 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
