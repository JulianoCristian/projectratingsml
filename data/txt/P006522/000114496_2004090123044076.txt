Re : Loan 3767-BR (Espírito Santo Water and 
Coastal Pollution Management Project) 
Amendment to the Loan Agreement
Dear Minister Malan, dear Governor Ferreira : 
Please refer to:  
(a) the Loan Agreement between the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and the State of Espírito Santo (the Borrower), dated 
October 28, 1994, for the above-referenced project, as amended;  
(b)  the discussions between representatives of the Bank and Dr. Jorge Hélio Leal, the 
Borrower’s Secretary for the Development of Infrastructure and Transport, in 
Washington on 19 April, 2002;  
(c)  letters Ofício/G/No 092/2002 (dated 3 June, 2002), and Ofício/216/2002 (dated 22 
October, 2002) from the Borrower’s Governor regarding reinstatement of US$12.5 
million equivalent in previously cancelled Loan proceeds, a 6-month extension for 
the Closing Date of the Loan (through 30 June, 2003) and an increase in the 
disbursement percentage for local expenditures on civil works to be financed by 
Loan proceeds; and  
(d)  Fax No. 068 dated 9 October, 2002 from SEAIN to the Bank’s Country Director for 
Brazil endorsing the reinstatement and Closing Date extension. 
In line with these antecedants, we agree to reinstate the amount of US$12.5 million 
equivalent to the Loan Account and to add a new disbursement category with retroactive Bank

financing of 70% for local expenditures on civil works contracts signed after 1 March, 2001 for 
Eligible Subprojects under Part B.1 (a) through (e) of the Project. We propose to amend the Loan 
Agreement as follows :  
1.  Section 2.03
is modified to read as follows : 
“The Closing Date shall be June 30, 2003 or such later date as the Bank shall establish. 
The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Guarantor of such later date.” 
2.  The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1  is modified as provided in the Annex to this 
letter.  
Please confirm your agreement to the reinstatement of the amount of US$12.5 million 
equivalent to the Loan Account and to this amendment by signing and dating the three originals 
of this letter in the spaces provided below, and returning one to us. Upon receipt by the Bank of 
one original of this letter signed by you, this amendment will become effective as of the date of 
the last countersignature. Once this amendment letter has been countersigned by you, we will 
send you a revised Amortization Schedule for the Loan (Schedule 3 to the Loan Agreement). The 
retroactive commitment charges, i.e., the amount that represents the additional commitment 
charges that would have been paid to the Bank had the amount of US$12.5 million not been 
cancelled on 24 December, 1999 will appear automatically on the Borrower’s regular billing 
statement to be issued by the Bank after the effectiveness of this amendment, and will be due on 
the payment date therefor.
