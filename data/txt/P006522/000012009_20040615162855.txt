1     Additional financing in the amount of US$36.0 million     is sought for the State
Government of Espirito Santa in support of the Espl'rito Santa Wuter and Coastal
Pollution Management Project supported by Loan 3767-BR which closed on June 30,
2003. This additional financing to carry out activities appraised under the parent loan
would be under Fixed SpreadLoan terms with a maturity of 17 years. The proposed loan
would enable 1.6 million people to benefit from follow-on investments in improved water
supply services (improved service continuity, pressure and water quality) and about
350,000 people to benefit from additional sewerage connections. If approved, the
additional financing would have a closing date of September 30, 2008. The Loan
supports Brazil's efforts to achieve enhanced and more equitable access to water and
sanitation services, as indicated in the Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the
Board on December 9,2003.


I.  Project Background

2      A US$154 million      loan for the Espl'rito Sunto Water And Coastal Pollution
Ahiagement Project was approved by the Board on June 28, 1994. The estimated total
project cost at appraisal was US$308 million, including US$92.5 million in counterpart
funds from the State of Espirito Santo and US$61.5 from the State Water Company,
CESAN. The project became effective on December 19, 1994 and was hampered by poor
implementation     performance (both by CESAN        and the State Secretariat for the
Environment and Water Resources (SEAMA)) and a lack of counterpart funds (mainly
those owed by the State Government) during much of its original 5-year implementation
period. Significantly, the State Government failed to secure a parallel loan from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) which, it was thought at appraisal, would cover all or
most of the State Government's counterpart funding obligations. By the original closing
date (December 31, 1999), a large number of sewage collection systems in the Vitoria
Metropolitan Region (which includes the municipalities of Vitoria, Vila Velha, Cariacica,
Viana, Serra, Fundgo and Guarapari) remained unfinished and unconnected to sewage
transmission, treatment and disposal infrastructure. Against this backdrop, the project
was radically restructured in late 1999 and early 2000, US$54 million were cancelled
from the loan to bring the project's overall size in line with the State's ability to
implement it and the original closing date was extended three times for a total of three
and half      years. After   the restructuring,  implementation performance improved
 significantly, to the point where the Bank agreed in late 2002 to reinstate a total of
US$l2.5 million     in previously cancelled loan proceeds to complete on-going works.
These improvements are reflected in the project's development outcome (DO) and
implementation progress (It?) ratings which were consistently "satisfactory" after early
 2000, with the exception of one Project Status Report (PSR) sequence in September,
 2002 when COFIEX held up consideration of a State Government request for a partial
reinstatement of loan proceedsneededto complete the project's major civil works. By the
 time loan 3767-BR closed on 30 June, 2003, the original US$308 million operation had
 become a more limited US$l83 million        operation with commensurate reductions in
 physical outputs and institutional achievements.

3     The project has the following main objectives: (i) to improve the efficiency of
CESAN'S water supply and sewerage systems by supporting the company's efforts to
operate on a commercial basis with financial self-sufficiency; (ii) to increasethe coverage
level of CESAN's water supply and basic sanitation services (i.e., sewage collection,
treatment, and disposal) in the urban areasof the Vitoria Metropolitan Region and other
towns located in the Santa Maria and Jucu river basins; and (iii) to provide appropriate
water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areasof the Vitoria Metropolitan
Region. By     achieving these specific objectives, the project will         permit:  (i) an
improvement in the quality of life of about 1.6 million urban inhabitants of the State of
Espirito Santo; (ii) a reduction in the incidence of oral-fecal diseases; and (iii) an
improvement in the quality of water for human consumption and recreational uses
through the restoration and protection of the environmentally deteriorated rivers that feed
the urban areas of the Vitoria Metropolitan Region and the estuarine and coastal areas
within and adjacent to its municipalities. The project has four main components: (i) water
supply; (ii) sanitation; (iii) operational development and institutional strengthening of
CESAN      and strengthening of the State's sanitation sector; and (iv) institutional
strengthening of SEAMA and IEMA.

Project Achievements to Date

4        Becauseof the funding shortfall (brought about mainly by the State Government's
inability to securea parallel loan from the EIB as envisaged at appraisal), the project has
only partially met the targets originally set at appraisal, as sunnnarized below:

5. Water Supply. The investments undertaken have expandedthe systems of the Vitoria
Metropolitan Region eliminating existing bottlenecks and significantly improving the day
to day operation of CESAN's systems. The project .expanded CESAN's               distribution
network, through the installation of 59,144 new connections (about 83% of appraisal
estimates), helping cover normal population growth even in areasof accelerated urban
development. Water coverage increased from 9 1% at appraisal to 94.4% in 1999 and
held steady at about 94% through 2002. Water rationing was eliminated for 98,000
persons and reduced for many others. This is a substantial achievement given that at
appraisal, almost two thirds of CESAN's customers were subject to rationing. Waiting
times for new connections are currently less than five days.

6      Sewage Collection.     CESAN's investment in sanitation sought to reduce water
pbllution in the Vitciria Metropolitan Region as well as in the water basins of the Santa
Maria, Jucu, Jabuti, Pero@o and Una rivers. Domestic wastewater, which was mostly
discharged without treatment into rivers, estuaries, bays, and coastal waters is now
collected, treated and appropriately disposed of in parts of Vitiiria, Vila Velha, Cariacica,
and Guarapari on the coast and most of Santa Maria de Jetiba and Dorningos Martins in
the interior. When all households connect to the sewerageinfrastructure already in place,
 seweragecoverage for the urban population in CESAN's concession area will increase
from current levels of about 21% to 31%.

                                              7




7.   Sewage Treatment. In addition to expanded sewagecollection systems, the project
has financed substantial sewagetreatment capacity, most of it in the form of sophisticated
secondary treatment facilities operated by a private contractor in urban areas with
virtually   no negative impacts on surrounding communities. Total sewage treatment
capacity built under the project to date (1050 l/s) is only about 60% of appraisal targets,
and the number of connections built (47,380 connections benefiting a total of about
320,000 people) are only 46% of appraisal targets (103,365 connections). Currently, the
project's 4 largest sewage treatment plants are running more than 50% below capacity,
producing adverse environmental and social consequencesfor the state and negative
financial consequencesfor CESAN. As complementary collection systems are added and
sewage treatment plant capacity is fully utilized under the proposed additional loan, a
total of about 600,000 people are expectedto benefit.

8. Operational and Institutional     Strengthening of CESAN and Strengthening of the
State's Sanitation     Sector. This component improved the company's management
capacity, operational efficiency, and, to a limited extent, its financial performance. To
date it has included a managerial development program to improve CESAN's institutional
capabilities to carry out its responsibilities under the project combined with a training
program for CESAN's operational staff in the areasof planning, marketing, financial and
operational techniques, a program to institutionalize operational and financial planning, a
sanitary education program, a total quality program to improve CESAN's productivity
and response to consumer complaints, the acquisition and development of new
management systems, and the renovation of laboratory equipment. Despite these
initiatives, political interference in CESAN's     management between 1994 and 2002
limited the impact of measuresdesigned to improve CESAN from within. For this reason,
the institutional strengthening measures for CESAN considered under the proposed
additional loan, follow a slightly different approach: instead of changing CESAN mostly
from within, they seek to transform it from without, by holding the company accountable
for results to its customers, by improving governance structures and by enhancing the
transparency of the sector overall. On an operational level, loan 3767-BR financed a
significant increase in individual metering in Espirito Santo (85% in 2003 compared with
69% at appraisal) but had only limited success in achieving a sustainable reduction in
non-revenuewater (36% in 2002 against 39% in 1994).

9        Institutional Strengthening of SEAMA.      Under the State Governments in office
between 1994 and 2002, SEAMA was kept in a state of almost continuous flux and no
institutional strengthening was achieved under loan 3767-BR. Given the importance of
strong environmental institutions for the sustainable management of water resources and
sewerage infrastructure, institutional    strengthening of SEAMA       is a major unmet
challenge that the current State Government (in office since January, 2003) intends to
addresswith resourcesfrom the proposed additional loan.

10       ICR for loan 37671BR. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) has been
prepared for loan 3767-BR in which the overall outcome of activities to date has been
rated "satisfactory",    and sustainability   is considered "likely"    while  institutional

                                               8


development impact is rated as "negligible." The State Government of Espirito Santo's
request for an additional Bank loan stems precisely from its desire to meet the project's
original water and sewerage coverage targets as well as its institutional development
objectives. The need for additional financing to complete the project's physical
components (both water supply and sanitation) and institutional development.objectives
(for CESAN and particularly for SEAMA) was first presentedby the Borrower during the
Bank's     supervision mission    of  18-20 March,    2003. The Federal Government's
Commission on External Financing (Comissao de Financiamentos Externos, COFIEX)
gave initial approval to the State Government's request (carta consulta) on 22 October,
2003, leading to preparation of the proposed Additional Loan between December, 2003
and May, 2004.


II.  Justijkution   for Additional IBRD Financing
II1. The main justification for providing additional financing is to ensurethe completion
of Brazil's     Espikito Santo Water and Coastal Pollution      Management Project, as
appraised. The parent loan closed on June 30, 2003. The funding shortfall has arisen
from a lack of counterpart funds, that resulted mostly from the State Government's
inability to secure a parallel loan for project implementation from the EIB. This lack of
counterpart funds forced the project to be re-sized to the State's real implementation
capacity between 1999 and 2003 with commensurate cancellations of loan proceedsfrom
loan 3767-BR. These two factors have had the effect of creating a financing gap that
prevents the original coverage targets and institutional development objectives of the
project from being reached. With an improved state financial situation, the Borrower has
requestedthe Bank's assistanceto complete the project in line with its original objectives.
The following factors have been taken into account in assessingthe need for additional
financing:
          U




       Achievement of original project objectives. The project has only partially met its
       original objectives. For example only 46% of the original expansion target for
       sanitation connections has been met to date, benefiting only about 320,000 people
       compared with 770,000 envisioned at appraisal.

b)     Feasibility  of reducing project scope. In the project's main metropolitan areas
       (Vitoria Metropolitan Region), a significant reduction in project scope is not
       feasible. Unless additional financing is made available, more than 50% of capacity
       in four large, secondary sewage treatment plants built in Vitoria, Vila Velha,
       Cariacica and Guarapari will remain idle, with negative environmental, social and
       financial consequences.On an environmental level, the limited number of sewage
       collection   networks currently connected to the treatment plants reduce the
       efficiency of the biological treatment processes, producing an effluent of sub-
       standard quality. Higher levels of organic loading would result not only in more
       sewage being treated, but all sewage being treated to a higher standard. From a
       social perspective, low capacity utilization deprives more than 250,000 residents of
       the health benefits associatedwith piped sewerage, benefits that could be obtained
       at relatively modest additional cost using existing treatment installations. Finally,

                                              9



      low levels of customer connections to treatment plants deprives CESAN of the
      tariff revenue it needsto meet its debt obligations.

C>    Availability  of other financing. No other financing is presently available to the
      State Government and CESAN to complete the project.

d)    Time    available  for   processing a free standing      loan. The Espirito     Santo
      Government has asked that processing take place as rapidly as possible, as the
      ecological and hygienic conditions in the Vitoria Metropolitan Region continue to
      deteriorate and the number of households without service is increasing rapidly. The
      new State Government has repeatedly declared that its priority for the coming years
      is to improve the quality and coverage of water and sanitation infrastructure and
      improve the quality of services offered by SEAMA and CESAN. The use of a new
      project to meet the objectives envisaged for the original operation would be an
      unnecessarily slow and inefficient      route, involving  substantial documentation
      requirements and additional budgetary resources.Given that the proposed activities
      were already contemplated under the original project, the efforts associated with a
      new operation do not seem to be the best way to use scarce Bank budget and staff
      resources.

e)    Borrower    commitment     and capacity. The present Government of Espirito Santo
      has already provided clear evidence of strong political          and administrative
      commitment to the project. Moreover, the implementation arrangements used for
      the project since the 199912000restructuring have proven to be robust and effective
      at meeting objectives in a timely and efficient manner.


III. Project Objectives


12. The purpose of additional financing will be to meet the original project objectives of
improving the efficiency of CESAN's water supply and seweragesystems; of increasing
the coverage level of CESAN's water supply and basic sanitation services and of
providing appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areas. In
addition, additional financing will allow the project to meet its original objective of
strengthening SEAMA's and IEMA's environmental management capacity.


IV. Project Description
13. The proposedadditional financing would provide resourcesto finance four
components:

Component 1: Institutional     Strengthening of SEAMA and IEMA

A program to strengthen the institutional capacity of SEAMA,          the State Secretariat
charged with setting environmental policy, and IEMA, the State Institute charged with
carrying it out. The program comprises the following activities (a) an institutional and
strategic planning exercise; (b) design and installation of an integrated environmental

                                             10



information system; (c) development of a monitoring network for the environment in
general and water resource management in particular; (d) development of IEMA's
environmental licensing capacity; (e) development of a state-wide water resource
management system; and (f) training and environmental education activities.


Component 2: Strengthening of CESAN and of the State's Sanitation Sector

Strengthening of CESAN's institutional, operational and financial capacity by changing
the environment in which CESAN operates.Activities will include: (a) development of a
performance benchmarking system to track both CESAN's service quality as perceived
by users, and its operational and financial performance; (b) design and implementation of
actions to improve CESAN's corporate governance; (c) training of CESAN's staff; (d)
non-revenue water reduction; (e) environmental management and education; (f) support
for new household sewage connections and operational improvements;                and (g)
strengthening of the Borrower's sector organization and the legal and regulatory
instruments for water and sanitation service provision.

The institutional,  operational and financial strengthening of CESAN          will include
activities aimed at improving institutional accountability and corporate governance, as
well as regulating the company's operational and financial performance. In particular,
CESAN will select, define and develop level of service indicators and operational and
financial performance indicators. A set of semi-annual targets for the next five years
(2004-2008) will be produced as a reference. Twice a year, results will be published
state-wide to enhance accountability vis-&vis the public. With regard to governance,
some of the actions that will be implemented include setting specific management targets
for cost reduction or revenue increases, adopting transparent and performance-based
criteria for the selection of personnel, strengthening the Board of Directors of CESAN
and of the management team (including setting rules for the composition, selection,
nomination and dismissal of members), strengthening the division           responsible for
strategic and financial planning, remuneration of technical excellence and shared best
practices, while limiting   the responsibility of CESAN to operational functions and
shielding it from political influence and regulatory duties. With regards to overall sector
organization and appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks, a detailed study will be
performed, leading to recommendations on sectorial planning (including             required
investments and coverage expansion policies), a well-defined subsidy policy (including
the establishment of social funds), a revision of the organization of the sector within the
State of Espirito Santo, and in particular, the organization of services in rural and semi-
rural areasthat CESAN operatesat a loss. Tools and procedures will also be developed to
control and support CESAN as a concessionaire of public services, and assist in the
renegotiation of concession contracts with municipalities.


Component 3: Water Supply Investments


An investment. program including: (a) expansion and upgrading of the Carapina and
CaGarocawater treatment plants; (b) upgrading of the Ibes-Boa Vista transmission main;

                                             11



(c) expansion and upgrading of the SantaClara, Pedreras/SantoAntonio, Garoto, AraG&,
and Morro    do Pica storage tanks; and (d) upgrading of the Guarapari raw water
transmission and treatment systems.


Component 4: Sewerage

An   investment program including:       (a) a sanitation master plan for the Vitoria
Metropolitan Region (particularly for Vitbria, Vila Velha, Cariacica, Serra, Viana and
Guarapari) as well as development of a water quality model; (b) expansion of sewage
collection systems in the cities of Vitoria, Vila Velha, Guarapari and Cariacica; and (c)
construction of new sewage collection and treatment systems in the districts of Nova
Almeida and Praia Grande (in the city of Serra), in the district of Manguinhos (in the city
of Serra), and in the city of Viana.


A summary of investment and capacity-building activities to be carried out with the
additional loan is presentedin Schedule A.


V.  Project Implementation

14.   Project implementation arrangementswill be similar to those successfully adopted
during the 3 % years after the project was restructured and before Loan 3767-33113closed.
A project Steering Committee (Corn&? Diretivo         do Projeto) chaired by the State
Government's     Secretariat of Planning, Budget and Management (SEPLOG)               and
comprising   the State Secretariat of Finance (SEFAZ),           the State Secretariat of
Infrastructure Development and Transport (SEDIT), and the State Secretariat of the
Environment and Water Resources(SEAMA) in addition to CESAN, will assume overall
project oversight functions. Project management will         be the responsibility   of an
independent Project Management Unit (Unidade de Gerenciamento de Projeto, UGP)
directed by a general coordinator with support from technical, environmental and
administrative-financial   coordinators, all of whom will be selected by the Steering
Committee. The UGP will be staffed by an external engineering consulting/project
management firm that will report to the general coordinator. An Executive Secretary will
provide logistical support to the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will also
create a special bid evaluation commission (Comisslio Especial de Licitagtio, CEL). The
external engineering consulting/project management firm will         (i) provide technical,
administrative and financial management support for project implementation; (ii) review
and update existing engineering designs for project works; (iii) prepare additional
environmental studies as required; (iv) hire specialized individual consultants as required
for project implementation; and (v) supervise contracts for works, goods and other
consultants in cooperation with CESAN and IEMA,          the implementing agency within
Espirito  Santo's environmental management system. Overall            project management
arrangementsare summarized in the diagram below.

15. A full financial management assessmenthas been carried out for the additional loan
and is available in the project files. Overall financial management risk for the additional
loan is rated as moderate. The UGP will use financial management procedures agreed
with the Bank. It will maintain detailed project accounts, utilizing the existing schedule
of accounts that permits the accumulation of costs by project cost category and
component. Financial statements, prepared on a cash basis, will follow national norms
which are acceptable to the Bank. In addition to monthly financial statements, the UGP
will prepare quarterly Financial             Monitoring          Reports (FMR's)        comprising  project
financial statementsas well as sections on physical progress and procurement processes.
CESAN's accounting system will be used for the production of accounts and for the
financial control of all components. Financial Management reports will be produced by
the UGP.

16. A special account in US Dollars will be createdfor Bank funds. In addition, CESAN
will  open a separate "special counterpart financing account" (conta especial de
contrapartida, CEC) in which counterpart payments equivalent to 3 months' cash flow
will be deposited in advance. Given earlier counterpart financing difficulties,                   the State
Government views the CEC as a mechanism both to ensure the timely completion of
project activities and to instill confidence in contractors and consultants that invoices will
be paid without undue delay. This confidence is expected to translate into lower prices
for the project's goods, works and consulting services. Finally, an operational account
will be opened in Reais (R$) fed both by loan proceeds transferred from the special

                                            13


account and by counterpart funds from the CEC. Payments to contractors, suppliers and
consultants will be made from this operational account. The Special Account will have an
authorized allocation of US$3.0 million.     External audits of the project and special
account will follow the Bank's new audit policy and audit guidelines issued by the
Financial Management Sector Board on June 30, 2003. CESAN's financial statements
will also be audited by external auditors.

17. Disbursement Schedule. The proceedsof the proposed additional financing would
be disbursed over a four-year period as shown in Schedule C.

18. Procurement. Goods, works and consulting services will be procured in accordance
with currently applicable Bank guidelines and the provisions of the Loan Agreement for
the additional loan. A detailed procurement plan has been developed for the activities to
be financed from the additional loan and agreedwith the State Government. A summary
of procurement arrangementsis presentedin Schedule D.


VI, Project Sustainability


19      The physical investments and capacity building measures to be carried out under
the proposed additional loan have been designed to consolidate the financial and
environmental benefits of the activities implemented under the project to date. On the
infrastructure side, a number of key high-return water supply investments have been
selected by CESAN that will improve water quality as well as service pressure and
continuity while providing the backbone infrastructure that will allow for continued
service expansion. These have been complemented by investments in sewage collection
and treatment systems that maximize capacity utilization in four large existing sewage
treatment plants and expand coverage to other areasin the Vitoria Metropolitan Region
that have a high direct impact on coastal water quality. On the institutional side, capacity
building measures for IEMA       will  develop the environmental information       systems,
monitoring networks and licensing capacities required to allow it, inter alia, to track the
effluent quality produced by sewage treatment plants constructed under the project to
ensure compliance with appropriate environmental standards. Institutional strengthening
of CESAN, finally, will enhance its accountability vis-a-vis the State Government and
general public and build more robust governance structures less susceptible to political
interference.

20. Financial Sustainability.   CESAN's financial performance deteriorated significantly
under the previous State Government (in office between 1999 and 2002) and the
company showed averagenet losses of about US$5 million/year between 2000 and 2002.
Under new management, the utility took sweeping measures to reduce operating costs
and increase revenues during 2003, achieving a net operating profit of about US$2
million on the strength of improved administrative practices, re-assignments of resources
to productive purposes,a tariff increase, an increase in metering, improved bill collection
performance and significant reductions in both personnel and outsourced service costs. A
full financial assessment (available in the project files) has been carried out for CESAN
for the 2004-2012 period as part of preparations for the additional loan and shows that

                                             14



CESAN can remain profitable even if it finances 100% of the counterpart payments for
the investments under the additional loan. This is true, primarily because the State
Government (which owns almost all of CESAN's shares) has assumed principal and
interest payments for Loan 3767-BR and has agreed to do the same for the proposed
additional loan. Given that most of the proceeds of both Loan 3767-BR and the proposed
additional loan have gone to (or will go to) sewerageinvestments with high externalities
(including environmental and health benefits), the State Government has argued in favor
of public financing as an alternative to even steeper tariff increases than those already
authorized (real increasesof 3% per year between 2000 and 2002 and 6% in 2003).

21       Institutional  Sustainability   of  SEAMA/IEMA.        The   proposed physical
iniestments      in water and sewerage will       generate maximum      benefits   only   if
SEAMADEMA          on one hand and CESAN on the other are strengthened in parallel. As
discussed in section I, no institutional strengthening of SEAMADEMA         was achieved
under Loan 3767-BR due to constant institutional change that left SEAMA,          the State
Secretariat charged with defining environmental policy for Espirito Santo, and IEMA, the
Environmental Institute charged with carrying it out, without clear direction. This has
changed under the present State Government which has made improved environmental
management a cornerstone of its government program. In line with this priority, the
project team has worked with SEAMA/IEMA            over the past 6 months to design an
institutional and strategic planning exercise that will define IEMA's core products and
the means (both financial and human) required to achieve them. Technical assistanceand
equipment will enable IEMA to monitor the performance of a private contractor that is
operating Espirito Santo's four largest sewage treatment plants. In addition, the proposed
additional loan will     allow IEMA     to develop, more generally, the environmental
information systems, monitoring networks and licensing capacities that will enable it to
accompany the rapid industrialization of Espirito Santo in a manner that balances
economic, social and environmental demands on the basis of good information and first-
class decision support tools.

22.      Institutional Sustainability of CESAN. Unless institutional measures are taken
to strengthen CESAN, there is a risk that project investments will be operated at sub-
optimal levels. If CESAN fails to connect new users to additional sewage collection
systems in a reasonable amount of time, or if poor bill collection performance deprives
the utility of the operating revenue to ensure proper maintenance, the project's full social,
environmental, financial and economic benefits may not be reached.While Loan 3767-
BR financed measures that strengthened CESAN from within, the proposed additional
loan will support a package of activities that complement CESAN"s own internal reform
measures (reduction of non-revenue water for example) by changing the environment in
which CESAN operates.This approachhas proven successful in dealing with both public
and private companies in the United Kingdom, Chile, Colombia and, to some extent, in
Uruguay. The additional loan would finance activities that (i) hold CESAN accountable
to its customers for results, (ii) improve governance structures in a way that reduce the
risk of political interference and (iii) enhance the transparency of the water sector in
Espirito Santo overall. At six-month intervals, for example, CESAN would be required to
report via the media on the length of time it takes to connect new users to services, repair

                                             15



leaks that have been reported by the public, etc. Such reporting structures have been
shown to be successful in mobilizing public opinion in favor of sustainable institutional
improvements.




     Figure 2: Poor families discharging untreated sewage to inland waterways


VII, Poverty Impact

23.  About 658,000 (41%) of the 1.6 million people that will benefit from the project's
water supply investments are expected to be poor (family         incomes of less than 3
minimum     salaries) while 109,000 (31%) of the 354,000 direct beneficiaries of new
sewagecollection and treatment systems fall within the same category.


VIII.   Environmental Aspects

24,   The original project was classified as Category B under the Bank's environmental
guidelines, and an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out at the time of
appraisal. For the activities to be financed under the proposed additional loan, an updated
Program Environmental Assessment and an updated Environmental Management Plan
were prepared and discussed in public consultations in Espirito Santo. Water supply and
sanitation investments to be carried out under the additional loan are classified as
category B and are not expected to have either major negative environmental impacts or
to involve resettlement of population in the project area. Specific environmental
assessmentsfor individual investments will be carried out as required by local law. Issues
that arise in conjunction with the implementation of works will be addressedthrough the
incorporation of environmental guidelines for contractors as part of bidding documents.
These guidelines will include rules on the disposal of construction waste in pre-approved
landfills, communication with local communities, pedestrian safety, dust and noise
abatement measures, etc. These guidelines have been reviewed by Bank environmental
specialists. Expansion of wastewater service is expected to lead to a significant increase

                                             16



in sewage collection with health benefits both for local residents along polluted water
ways and for usersof Espirito Santo's beachesmore generally.


IX. Participatory Approach

25     Building   on past experiences in water and sanitation projects, CESAN would
continue to use a highly participatory approach to service extension and new works
construction, with direct involvement of beneficiaries at each stage of the project cycle.
All community interactions would be intermediated by community facilitators, a number
of which have acquired valuable experience in community mobilization for water and
sewerageprojects under a number of previous initiatives. Local municipalities would also
be closely involved, and their participation will be critical in facilitating the planning and
execution of public works.


X.   Project Benefits
26     The project would lead to significant health and welfare benefits. Overall, the
project is expected to produce (i) an improvement in the quality of life of about 1.6
million urban inhabitants of the State of Espirito Santo; (ii) a reduction in the incidence
of oral-fecal diseases; and (iii) an improvement in the quality of water for human
consumption and `recreational uses through the restoration and protection of the
environmentally deteriorated rivers that feed the urban areasof the Vitoria Metropolitan
Region, and the estuarine and coastal areaswithin and adjacent to its municipalities. As
part of preparation for the proposed additional loan, the project's original Cost-Benefit
analysis was reviewed and updated. It is available in the project files. Overall, the
additional activities proposed are expected to have a financial internal rate of return
(FIRR) of 28% (5 1% for water supply investments and 16% for sanitation investments).
When discounted at 10% over 30 years, cash flows from additional investments are
expected to generate a net benefit of about US$93 million.           Given the high positive
externalities for investments of this type, the economic rate of return (ERR) of proposed
water supply and sanitation activities is even higher: 44% overall (72% for water supply
and 24% for sewage collection and treatment). The overall net economic surplus is
almost twice the financial benefit, or about US$169 million over 30 years.


XI. Risks
27.   The activities proposed for financing under the additional loan face two categories
of risk in particular: (i) risks associated with successful implementation; and (ii) risks
associatedwith actually generating financial and economic benefits at the expected levels
(seesection X). Consider each in turn:

(a) Implementation    Risk. Implementation arrangements for project activities under the
additional loan draw on the lessons of the past 9 years of project implementation in
general, and on the successful institutional set-up of the past 3.5 years in particular. First,
to avoid over-taxing CESAN's limited implementation capacity (a key factor affecting
implementation     performance between 1994 and            1999), an independent project
management unit (UGP) supported by a large, independent engineering consulting firm

                                              17



will be used to help implement activities under the additional loan in close cooperation
with IEMA and CESAN. Second,given the difficulties faced by the State Government in
mobilizing sufficient counterpart funding in the past, three measureshave been adopted
to smooth financial flows and ensurecompletion of priority activities:

    *   The proposed additional loan amount (US$36 million disbursed over 4 years) is
        far smaller than the previous loan (US$ll2.5       million disbursed over 9 years).
        Counterpart funding requirements are consistent with what the State Government
        has actually paid to consultants and contractors over the past 3.5 years of project
        implementation;


    l   Priority capacity-building activities, water supply investments and key sewerage
        works that use idle capacity in existing treatment plants would be funded at high
        disbursement percentagesfrom the proposed additional loan. Other, less critical
        investments will be funded entirely by CESAN as counterpart investments under
        the project;

    *   The State Government and CESAN have agreed to set up a special counterpart
        financing   account (described in detail in section V) in which counterpart
        payments equivalent to 3 months' cash flow will be deposited in advance. This
        mechanism is expected to instill confidence in contractors and consultants by
        demonstrating that funds to pay invoices are available for payment without delay.

(b) Risks to benefits. To assessthe risk that financial and economic benefits might not
materialize as expected,the project team has carried out a Monte Carlo Simulation using
Crystal Ball software to model the vulnerability of benefits to changesin the assumptions
used for the financial and economic analyses. Changes in connection rates to new
infrastructure, investment cost overruns, overruns in operation and maintenance costs,
reductions in collection efficiency for tariffs, failure to reach non-revenue water targets
and decreasesto the population's willingness to pay for services were all modeled for a
range of scenarios that differed from the basecase. These simulations show the expected
financial and economic benefits to be extremely robust: overall, the probability         of
achieving a positive net present value (NPV) for project investments in financial terms is
estimated at about 76%. The probability of achieving a positive NPV in economic terms
is close to 100%.
