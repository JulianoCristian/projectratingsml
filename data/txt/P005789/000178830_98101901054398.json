   The key objective of the project is to increase farm income\n            through production and productivity increases. The project\n            would consist of: (i) establishment of an extension service\n            including construction of buildings, recruitment and\n            training of extension staff, and provision of equipment;\n            (ii) construction of 15 rural water supply schemes; (iii)\n            studies of a possible second phase project; (iv) setting up\n            of an organization for the project's implementation;\n            and (v) technical assistance. The project would benefit\n            about 45,000 people. Beyond substantial net farm benefit\n            increases, the project would help to improve the quality of\n            life of the rural population by providing them with potable\n            water. The main risk is the possible slow start-up of the\n            project. Timely recruitment of local and expatriate staff,\n            and early initiation of the recruitment and training of\n            extension staff are expected to minimize the risk."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
