Project
Description:    The project is the first phase of an agricultural develop-
ment program in the Central Highlands region of YAR. The
key objective of the project is to increase farm income
through production and productivity increases. The project
would consist of: establishment of an extension service
including construction of buildings, recruitment and train-
ing of extension staff, and provision of equipment; con-
struction of 15 rural water supply schemes; studies of a
possible second phase project; setting up of an organiza-
tion for the project's implementation; and technical assis-
tance. The project would benefit about 45,000 people.,
Beyond substantial net farm benefit increases, the project
would help to improve the quality of life of the rural
population by providing them with potable water. The main
risk is the possible slow start-up of the project. Timely
recruitment of local and expatriate staff, and early ini-
tiation of the recruitment and training of extension staff
are expected to minimize the risk.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT OF IDA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO ThE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC FOR
A CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) for Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs) 7.8 million (approximately US$8.0 million equivalent), on standard IDA
terms, to help finance a Central Highlands Agricultural Development project.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Overseas
Development Administration of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland (ODA) are expected to participate in financing this project. In
addition, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development has approved a
loan of around $10.5 million equivalent to finance complementary investments
in the project area.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on domestic resource mobilization (No. 3554-YAR) dated
January 6, 1982 has been distributed to the Executive Directors. A report on
medium -erm policy and which reviews the public investment program was
recently discussed with the Government. Country data are attached in Annex I.
Introduction
3.        Over the last decade YAR has experienced far-reaching changes in its
socioeconomic structure and the material welfare of its citizens. The repub-
lican government which came to power following the 1962 Revolution succeeded
in establishing within a surprisingly short period of time the foundations of
a modern state.
4.        Political integration and the build-up of public institutions, while
maintaining a liberal market orientation, have provided the basis for rapid
development of the public and private sectors. Under the Three-Year Develop-
ment Program (1974-76) and the First Five-Year Plan (1977-81), the foundations
of the country's physical and social infrastructure were laid and expanded,
and first attempts were made at lifting agriculture, the mainstay of the
economy, out of its medieval setting; industrialization was also started,
albeit on a small scale.
5.        Rapid domestic economic growth has been accompanied and enhanced by
the large inflow of remittances and transfers by Yemenis abroad, particularly
workers in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. These are estimated to have
increased from around $65 million in 1971/72 to a level that has fluctuated
around $1.2 billion on an annual basis between 1977 and 1982. Largely as a
result of these cash inflows, YAR's real per capita GNP has increased
significantly over the last ten years, reaching an estimated $500 in 1982
(World Bank Atlas methodology).



- 2 -
15.       Although there are no reliable data on income and consumption
distribution, there are reasons to believe that the benefits from recent
growth have been widely distributed. Strong family ties ensure that many
people benefit from the increase in incomes. Public social expenditures,
especially in education and health, increased substantially, and the associated
benefits accrue directly to an increasing segment of the population.
Major Development Issues
7.        Overall economic performance during the First Plan period (1977-81)
has been satisfactory. Real GDP grew at around 6 percent per annum. Invest-
ment effort was impressive averaging around one-third of GNP.  These achieve-
ments, remarkable as they are, should not, however, detract from the fact that
YAR continues to be one of the world's least developed countries. Productivity
levels are still extremely low, especially in agriculture. Over 90 percent of
the population resides in rural areas, a large part in remote villages without
access to modern transportation, schools, electricity or health services.
Agricultural land and water are scarce and few mineral deposits have been dis-
covered so far. YAR's commodity exports are still extremely low, reflecting
the country's limited resources and the underdeveloped state of its economy.
The shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower is an overriding constraint
to development and limits the capacity of the public administration to manage
and implement a growing and increasingly complex development program.
8.        The budget deficit has emerged as a major concern in recent years.
Over the past five years, Government expenditures have increased at a pace
more than double that of revenues. By 1982, revenues represented only about
40 percent of expenditures and the budget deficit increased to 36 percent of
GDP. At the same time, the share of the budget deficit financed by external
loans dropped from an average 44 percent in 1977-81 to 16 percent only in
1982, which compelled the Government to increase its borrowings from the bank-
ing system (mainly the Central Bank). As a result, the money supply grew
-apidly during the recent years, and by more than 25 percent in 1982. Despite
this rapid growth, inflation hardly exceeded 6 percent in recent years since
the growth of money supply was accompanied by a continuous increase in imports
and a decline in foreign reserves, from 16 months of imports of goods and ser-
vices in 1977/78 to 3.5 months by end 1982 (and to less than 3 months in March
1983). The continuation of such a large budget deficit might reduce the
reserves further to a level where an increase in money supply would most
likely result in higher inflation.
9.        Reducing the budget deficit calls for;  (a) in the short-run, cutting
public investment expenditures; and (b) in the medium-run, bringing current
expenditures under control, mobilizing more taxes 1/ and establishing adequate
1/ The Bank report Mobilization of Domestic Financial Resources in the YAR
(January 6, 1982) made a number of recommendations in this regard as well
as on other resource mobilization considerations. A number of these
recommendations have been implemented and others are under consideration.



users' fees. The Government is increasingly aware of the seriousness of the
situation and has taken a number of measures to keep expenditures within the
levels authorized by the 1983 budget. These include a selective freeze on new
hiring, restrictions on purchases of cars and furniture and on the creation of
new public authorities, etc. Budgeted capital expenditures for 1984 are 22
percent lower than their 1983 level. The Bank is assisting the Government in
reducing the public investment program of the Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86)
and the report which reviews this program was recently discussed with the
Government (para. 2). Budgeted current expenditures for 1984 are at their
1983 level. On the revenues side, the Government has recently reimposed
customs tariffs on previously exempted foodstuffs and increased the tax on
qat. The Government is also in the process of converting the taxation of
petroleum products from a specific to an ad-valorem basis, enlarging the scope
of excise taxation and establishing some users' charges in health and educa-
tion and municipal taxation. Most of these measures have been recommended by
the Bank report on domestic resource mobilization (para. 2). The effectiveness
of these measures, however, will depend on the vigor with which they will be
implemented.
Government Objectives
10.        Since the early 1970s, the country has been trying to develop human
resources and build new institutions, to strengthen the physical and social
infrastructure, to raise the productivity of the commodity-producing sectors,
and to improve the standard of living of the people, giving priority to their
basic needs. Most of the First Plan's targets which were in line with these
objectives have been met except in the agriculture sector where output of some
traditional crops has declined and overall growth fell considerably below
targeted levels primarily because of the abandonment of marginal rain-fed
areas where income opportunities could not compete with the opportunities of
migration. The production of qat (a mild stimulant) has been on the increase
and has competed for agricultural land.
11.        The Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86) has a 7 percent GDP growth
target calling for a total investment of around $6.5 billion (1981 prices)
over the plan period. The sectoral distribution of investment underlies a
continued broad-fronted strategy with an emphasis on agriculture and manpower
development. The plan's financing envisioned heavy dependence on external
sources with around 70 percent of investment expected to be covered by grants
and loan disbursements and direct foreign private investment. However, since
this expected level of foreign finance does not appear to be forthcoming and
because of the extremely tight budgetary situation that has developed recently,
the Government is in the process of revising its investment program and the
Bank is assisting in this effort (para. 9).
Capital Flows and External Debt
12.'       Since the 1962 Revolution, YAR has received large amounts of foreign
assistance. Given the country's low per capita income and its UN classifica-
tion as a "least-developed country," most of the aid has been provided in the
form of grants and concessionary loans. Cumulative aid disbursements, in-
cluding grants, came to around t2.7 billion by the end of 1982. The principal



- 4 -
donors have been Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, USA and
the Federal Republic of Germany as well as IDA and the Arab development funds.
13.        About one-half of the total assistance given so far was provided as
grants, mostly for food aid, technical assistance and, more recently, for bud-
get support, primarily from Saudi Arabia. Food aid has been provided through
the World Food Program and by a number of bilateral donors. A significant part
of official grants has been made available in the form of technical assistance.
Given the extreme shortage of skilled manpower in YAR, this type of aid has
high priority and will be needed by the country for many years to come. Be-
sides the grants, YAR received sizeable amounts of official loans. Drawings
on these loans have increased in recent years, reaching $262 million in 1981
and $246 million in 1982.  Most of the official loans and credits have been
cominitted for the financing of specific projects, with the main emphasis on
roads, agriculture, and utilities.
14.        The terms of official loan assistance have been very favorable.
Loans from the USSR and the People's Republic of China are, for the most part,
frese of interest. Western European countries have generally charged between
3/4 percent and 2-1/2 percent. Interest rates charged by Arab countries have
va ried fr"" 0 to 4 percent. Loan maturities range from 5-50 years, with an
average uL 20 years.
15.        YAR's external public debt outstanding on December 31, 1982 was
estimated at $2244 million, of which $1312 million was disbursed. IDA credits
accounted for $136 million or about 10 percent of the total disbursed and out-
standing debt reported. Because of the very favorable terms of borrowing, the
debt service payments amounted to $55 million in 1982, equivalent to around
3.6 percent of gross foreign exchange earnings (including workers' remittances
and private transfers). Service payments could rise significantly to about 10
percent of the gross foreign exchange earnings by the end of the 1980s.
PART II - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS 1/
16.        This credit would be the thirty-seventh to YAR, bringing total IDA
commitments to $364.5 million net of cancellations. The main three elements
of IDA's assistance in YAR have been; to concentrate on developing the basic
institutions, skills and physical infrastructure which are prerequisites for
development; to develop production and income in the dominant productive
seCtor, agriculture; and to support the Government in its programs to meet
basic needs in rural and urban areas. To achieve these objectives, IDA has
extended eleven credits, totaling $120.4 million, for agriculture, fisheries
and rural infrastructure; fifteen credits, totaling $158.6 million, for
infrastructure including highways, ports, water supply and sewerage, power
distribution, and urban development; five credits, totaling $51.0 million, for
eciucation and training; two credits, totaling $14.0 million, for industry; a
1/1 Substantially the same as Part II of the President's Report (P-3709-YAR),
dated January 12, 1984, for the Urban II credit approved by the Executive
Directors on February 21, 1984.



$2.0 million credit to promote the exploration of the petroleum and geothermal
resources to private companies; and a $10.5 million credit to strengthen and
expand the capability of the Ministry of Health to plan, staff and manage the
country's health care system.  In FY78, an investment of $2.4 million by the
International Finance JCorporation (IFC) was approved to help finance a dairy
and juice project. Another IFC investment of $4.0 million was approved in May
1983 to help finance a dry cell battery project. Further opportunities for
IFC involvement are being explored.
17.       A major constraint to YAR's social and economic development has been,
and will remain for some time, the critical shortage of professional, skilled
and semi-skilled manpower, and the insufficient experience and weakness of its
institutions. World Bank strategy has emphasized strengthening institutions
and manpower capabilities through increased training of local staff and con-
tinued technical assistance, as well as through direct financing for education.
Thus all IDA-assisted projects in YAR contain substantial institution-building
components. Two particularly important examples of the World Bank's support
have been in the Central Planning Organization (CPO) and the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Fisheries (MAF). In CPO, the World Bank (through three grants
totaling $520,000) and the Kuwait Fund have financed a team of planning and
economic advisers to assist in the establishment of a planning machinery. The
Bank has also been the executing agency for a UNDP-financed project to assist
the CPO in the preparation of the Second Five-Year Plan (1982-86) (see para.
11). In MAF, the Bank supplied the services of seven advisers initially
financed by UNDP with IDA as executing agency, and now financed jointly by
IDA, the EEC Special Action Fund (under the Second Tihama project) and UNDP.
The Agricultural Research Station at Taiz is also financed as part of this
institutional support.
18.       YAR's disbursement performance (disbursements as a percentage of
total commitments) has been affected by a number of implementation problems,
although it still compares favorably to the EMENA region's average. Among the
recurrent problems that are common to most countries at YAR's stage of develop-
ment are: delays in recruitment of consultants, delays in award of contracts
and resolution of conflicts with contractors, and finalizing cofinancing
arrangements. In addition to these common problems, there has been one in-
stance (the Fisheries Development project) where fundamental project objec-
tives were threatened by actions of the implementing agency. In this parti-
cular case, the Government has taken corrective measures.  The Government and
IDA have also agreed to hold country implementation reviews twice a year to
monitor the recurrent implementation problems more closely and to address them
promptly.
19.       Future World Bank operations are expected to consolidate past
achievements in the main infrastructure subsectors, spread the benefits of
agricultural and rural development projects to new outlying areas, accelerate
assistance to the Government in the energy field, and continue to meet the
large requirements of education and training. Particular attention will be
given to YAR's ability to implement projects by insuring the availability of
key staff and technical assistance needs. A petroleum products distribution
project, a geothermal exploration project and an education project have been
appraised.



- 6 -
An agricultural development project in the undeveloped Wadi Jawf region has
been prepared. Future operations are expected in the areas of industrial
finance, power distribution and transport, and could also include a supple-
mental credit in the water supply and sewerage sector.
20.       YAR has contributed an increasing portion of local currency
fiinancing in the years when the budgetary situation was favorable. However,
in view of the deterioration in the budget and the fact that YAR remains among
the least-developed countries, it still requires special assistance through
financing of a large part of project costs, including local expenditures when
necessary. As in the past, the costs of future projects are expected to be
substantially higher than the amounts that IDA can provide, and we shall con-
tinue to cooperate closely with other donors so as to maximize IDA's catalytic
role in stimulating cofinancing. IDA-supported projects have so far led to
about $360 million equivalent of cofinancing from other aid donors.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Back ground
21.       Until the late 1960s, the agricultural sector of YAR was largely
oriented toward the subsistence needs of a stationary economy that lacked even
the most rudimentary institutions of a modern state. It generated hardly any
surplus on which growth and development could be based but employed about 90
percent of the economically active population and contributed as much as 90
percent of GDP.
22.       In the wake of the 1973 increase in oil prices, the sector was sub-
jected to a sudden change in its economic environment. Higher wages in neigh-
boring oil-exporting countries lured many Yemeni workers into emigration.
Their remittances raised domestic disposable income significantly resulting in
an upsurge in the local demand for foodstuffs, including fruits, vegetables
and other crops, some of which were new to the Yemeni diet. The responses to
these changes were predictable. Marginal, rain-fed land cultivated with
traditional grains was abandoned and more effort was directed to cultivating
more rewarding, and often new types of cash crops. The cultivation of qat, a
mi:Ld stimulant whose production is very remunerative, has also increased.
Moreover, the yield for all crops, including cereals, increased because of
better techniques and varieties, and a number of profitable new crops were
introduced. Still, the growth in demand has far exceeded domestic supply of
foodstuffs. As a result, agricultural imports increased sevenfold during the
past decade.  In particular, imports of cereals increased from about 160,000
ltonis in 1974 to about 510,000 tons in 1981. Currently, imported foodstuffs
account for around 30 percent of merchandise imports. Meanwhile, exports of
agricultural products, which have always been modest, have declined.
23..      Now that the inflow of workers' remittances has stabilized, and given
the economy's limited potential for industrial development- and the uncertainty
surrounding mineral exploration, agricultural growth must be relied upon to
sustain the improvement in the standard of living of the population, albeit at



a slower pace than during the boom years of the mid 1970s. Fortunately, the
potential for agricultural growth is significant, and may be achieved by
applying yield-improving technology in rainfed areas (which account for 80
percent of the area with potential for development) and through improvements
in the irrigated areas (accounting for the remaining 20 percent). There has
already been some success in achieving higher yields and switching to higher
value crops due to the initiative and responsiveness of Yemeni farmers and, to
some extent, in response to the improved supporting services provided in the
areas of applied research, training, extension and credit, partly under the
aegis of IDA-supported projects. Much more needs to be done. IDA has recently
approved an agricultural research project which aims at achieving some of this
potential through the further strengthening of applied research, as well as an
agricultural credit project designed to strengthen the credit delivery system
(para. 27).
Government Objectives
24.       Government objectives in the agricultural sector, as identified in
the First Five-Year Plan (1977-81), and reaffirmed in the Second Five-Year
Plan (1982-86), are directed towards reducing dependence on food imports by
increasing agricultural production, raising the incomes of farmers and the
nutritional level of the population, expanding agricultural research, exten-
sion and credit, and training Yemenis in order to build up the country's
agricultural institutions. Public investments in the sector have focused on
irrigated agriculture, mainly in the coastal Tihama plains, rainfed agricul-
tural development in the high rainfall areas of the Southern Uplands, and on
institution-building, including training at all levels. Most production and
marketing activities are carried out by the private sector with the
Government essentially playing a complementary supporting role.
IDA Involvement in YAR's Agriculture Sector
25.       In support of the Government's development objectives, IDA's
strategy for agricultural sector assistance is triple-pronged; (i) support
to projects in zones of high production potential; (ii) assistance in the
development of improved technological inputs and in financing the purchase by
farmers of these inputs; and (iii) institution building aimed at strengthen-
ing major agricultural support services.
26.       The project would be the twelfth IDA-assisted project in agricul-
ture, including fisheries. IDA's involvement in this sector started in FY73
with the Tihama I project for the development of Wadi Zabid (Credit 376-YAR),
cofinanced with the Kuwait Fund. This project, which was completed in
December 1979, faced cost overruns, and supplementary financing was provided
by both cofinanciers (Credit 376-1). However, the benefits and the economic
rate of return were well above appraisal estimates. The Project Performance
Audit Report (PPAR) was generally favorable about all project achievements.
Three more Tihama projects (Credits 805-YAR, 880-YAR and 978-YAR) were
approved between FY78 and FY80. They provide credit and extension, rural
roads, water supply and irrigation for Wadi Rima and Wadi Mawr in the coastal
lowlands of the Tihama region. External cofinanciers involved in these



- 8 -
projects include the Kuwait Fund, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), the Federal Republic of Germany (KfW), the Government of
the Netherlands, the EEC Special Action Fund and the Government of the United
Kingdom. The Southern Uplands Rural Development project (SURDP) I (Credit
545-YAR) was approved in FY75 and completed in 1982. It was successful in
achieving its broad objectives of increasing rainfed cereal production and
improving rural infrastructure. Its economic rate of return exceeded
appraisal estimates.
27.       In general, IDA's role as a catalyst for the cofinancing of agri-
cultural and rural development projects has been substantial. Other IDA-
assisted agricultural projects in YAR include the FY76 Grain Storage and
Processing Project (Credit 636-YAR), cofinanced by the Saudi Fund; the FY77
Livestock Credit and Processing Project (Credit 662-YAR), cofinanced by the
Kuwait Fund, and by the Governments of the Netherlands and the United King-
dom; the FY80 Fisheries Development Project (Credit 1025-YAR), cofinanced by
the Danish Government; the FY81 SURDP II Project (Credit 1067-YAR), cofinanced
by IFAD, the Abu Dhabi Fund, and the Swiss Government; the FY82 Agricultural
Research and Development Project (Credit 1259-YAR), cofinanced by IFAD and
the Italian Government; and the Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 1308-YAR),
approved in December 1982. In addition, IDA was the executing agency for a
UNL-; eroject, Institutional Support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fish-
eries (MAF), which was completed in 1979. IDA is at present the executing
agency for a UNDP project which supports agricultural research and provides
institutional support to MAF, and which is cofinanced by IDA and the EEC
Special Action Fund under the Tihama II Project.
28.       Given the pervasive institutional weaknesses of YAR, project per-
formance has been mixed. Early projects have suffered from cost escalation
and all projects have Deen affected by the shortage of trained counterpart
staff. The former was dealt with by increasing the contributions of the
beneficiaries and the Government (e.g., SURDP I), by securing additional
cofinancing (e.g., Grain Processing and Tihama I), or both. The shortage of
Yemeni staff could ease in the mid to late 1980s as Yemenis who are at present
studying abroad complete their education and return to YAR and as the output
from the Agricultural Secondary School at Ibb expands. In the interim, the
Government has been recruiting international staff to secure needed mana-
gerial talent. The Fisheries Development Project (Credit 1025-YAR) has en-
countered particular implementation problems (para. 18) which are being dealt
with.
29.       IDA's involvement in the sector is viewed as a long-term associa-
tion designed to strengthen the capability of MAF to support agricultural
development in the country and to assist the Yemeni farmer raise his standard
of living. The achievements of the first two completed projects suggest that
IDA's continued involvement in the sector is very important. In particular,
the proposed project is modelled after the successful Southern Uplands proj-
ects and falls within IDA's strategy of replicating the successful experiences
in the various parts of the country with sufficient development potential.
MAF, and the YAR Government in general, continue to rely heavily on IDA's
assistance and have considerable regard for the policy and technical advice



- 9 -
they receive. As more of the IDA-assisted agricultural projects reach their
productive phases, it should be possible to generate a momentum of agricul-
tural growth that would have a tangible effect on the sector at large. It is
important to have a critical mass of agricultural projects, appropriately
located, that can sustain such a momentum, and the proposed project is one
such project in the important Central Highlands part of the country.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.        The project was prepared in late 1982 by the Food and Agriculture
Organization/Cooperative Programme (FAO/CP) in cooperation with the Govern-
ment. It was appraised in 1983. Negotiations were held in Washington in
February 1984, with a delegation headed by HE Ahmad Al-Hamdani, Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries, and which included other representatives of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF), the Central Planning Organization
and the YAR Embassy in Washington. They were also attended by representatives
from IFAD and ODA. A staff appraisal report entitled "Central Highlands
Agricultural Development Project" (No. 4463-YAR, dated February 16, 1984) is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of
the credit and the project are presented in the Credit and Project Summary
and in Annex III. A map of the project area is attached (Map IBRD 17323).
Design Features
31.        The project would be the first phase of an agricultural development
program for the Governorates of Sanaa and Dhamar in a region collectively
known as the Central Highlands. It would develop a target area of about
16,000 ha over a period of nine years. The key determinants of project size
are the availability of trained extension agents, and the rate of progressive
adoption by farmers of the technologies to be recommended. Agricultural
development would be promoted in terraced areas receiving more than 450 mm
rainfall or where farmers have irrigation. Development packages for rainfed
terraces would be taken from areas with similar rainfall in the Southern
Uplands and from actual demonstrations carried out in the area. Rainfed
packages are simple, involving mainly seed treatment, fertilizer use, plant
protection, and improved varieties.
Project Objectives and Components
32.        The project's key objective is to increase farm incomes through
production and productivity increases. The project would also improve the
quality of rural life by providing the farmers with potable water. To
realize these objectives, the project would build up the extension service
for the project area, construct rural water supply schemes, and provide
technical assistance. The project also includes studies of a possible second
phase project that may include areas in the eastern provinces. To complement
this project, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development has already
approved separately a loan of around $10.5 million equivalent to finance the
following investments: upgrading to gravel standards of two rural roads,
assistance for irrigation development and plantations and nurseries



- 10 -
establishment, construction and furnishing of a branch of the Cooperative and
Agricultural Credit Bank, all in the project area, thereby strongly comple-
menting this project.
33.       Extension Development.  To assist in the development of a sound
extension service in the project area, the project includes training of
extension agents and farmers, construction of office and residential build-
ings, and provision of vehicles, equipment, and technical assistance to pro-
vide back-up support to the extension agents. The project would also supply
necessary equipment and staff to 13 other extension centers being built, but
not fully staffed and equipped under the Agricultural Research and Development
Project (Cr. 1259-YAR). There would be close contact between extension per-
sonnel and research staff. The extensionists would transmit to the research-
ers technical problems confronting farmers so that these problems would be
incorporated in applied research programs. Research staff are also expected
to involve extension agents in field verification trials during which inten-
sive on-site training would be provided to the extension agents. Tours of
the research centers by extension agents would be organized on a regular
basis. A liaison officer is provided, on a full-time basis, under the Agri-
cultural Research and Development project (Cr. 1259-YAR) to serve as the main
link between research and extension and he is expected to coordinate his
activities closely with the senior extension advisors under this project.
Experience from other projects indicates that farmers are responsive to
demonstration, are highly motivated by profit, and readily adopt proven
improved techniques of production. Agricultural credit and inputs are
available through the Cooperative and Agricultural Credit Bank which is the
beneficiary of an IDA-assisted line of credit under the Agricultural Credit
project (Cr. 1308-YAR).
34.       Rural Water Supply.  Fifteen water supply schemes would be con-
structed to serve an estimated population of about 45,000 eventually. The
works would include the construction of access roads, drilling and testing of
wells, equipping the wells with diesel pumps, transmission piping to storage
reservoirs at high elevations and distribution piping to deliver water to
surrounding villages. A hydrological study, to confirm the availability of
adequate resources is being initiated, financed by an advance from the Proj-
ect Preparation Facility.
35.       Technical Assistance.  The following technical assistance would be
provided; (i) about 31 man-years of internationally recruited consultancy
services to set up the extension service, develop extension programs, train
counterpart staff, and assist in project implementation; (ii) 12.5 man-years
of internationally recruited consultant services for project administration,
monitoring and evaluation as well as technicians for the Engineering Services
Section; (iii) 20 man-years of training abroad for extension specialists;
(iv) 7 man-months of internationally recruited and 77 man-months of local
consultant services for studies for a possible second phase project; and (v)
18 man-months of internationally recruited consultant services for hydrogeo-
logical investigation for the water supply component.



- 11 -
36.       Studies Under Phase II.  Preparation studies for a second phase
would be undertaken during 1985-86 under terms of reference to be reviewed by
IDA and the project provides technical assistance for this purpose. In addi-
tion, the study would investigate the possibility of expanding the irrigated
area in the two governorates covered by the project and in the Ibb and Taiz
governorates as well.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project, including physical contingencies and
allowance for expected price increases, is estimated at $20.0 million, with
$10.9 million (54 percent) in foreign exchange. The project is exempt from
taxes and duties. This cost estimate includes physical contingencies of 10
percent for buildings and 15 percent for water supply schemes. Allowances
for expected price increases for the foreign cost component are estimated at
7.5 percent in 1984, 7 percent in 1985 and 6 percent for 1986, 1987 and 1988.
Allowances for expected price increases for the local component have been
calculated at 10 percent per year. Foreign consultancy/technical services
are estimated at an average of about $45,000 per man-year, including salaries,
fees, overhead, international travel and subsistence. These estimates are
based on recent experience in YAR.
38.       The proposed credit of $8 million equivalent would finance about 61
percent of the foreign exchange component of the project, about 14 percent of
its local cost, and about 32 percent of total costs. The remaining $4. 2
million of the foreign exchange component would be financed by IFAD and the
Government of the United Kingdom. Effectiveness of the agreements with the
cofinanciers is a condition of credit effectiveness (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 7.01). The Government and the Local Development
Associations (LDAs) would contribute about $7.0 million of the local costs
(77 percent).
Project Implementation
39.       MAF would be responsible for implementing the project.  To this
end, MAF has appointed a Project Manager, who would be supported by financial,
administrative and engineering staff including internationally recruited
advisors. Under the direction of the Project Manager, the regional branches
of MAF in the Dhamar and Sanaa governorates, each headed by a Deputy Project
Manager, would be responsible for agricultural activities. To assist in
carrying out the extension activities, the project management team would
include two internationally recruited senior extension advisors, and special-
ists in the fields of plant protection, livestock, farm machinery, home
economics, extension agronomy, and fruit tree production. The Government
would provide local counterparts to these experts. The organization of
extension services at the field level would be designed along lines similar
to those already proven under SURDP. The extension service would be the core
of MAF's service in the project area. Trainees would be selected from the
project area and trained by SURDP staff in cooperation with staff of the
Agricultural Research Station in Taiz starting in early 1984. The Government
would train at least 20 new extension agents annually from 1984 until project
completion (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.04).



- 12 -
40.       MAF would coordinate the implementation of the rural water supply
component. To initiate the identification of the schemes to be implemented
under the project based on technical criteria, a hydrogeological study, being
financed with an advance from the Project Preparation Facility, would identi-
fy potential sites for detailed investigations, including the construction of
test wells. Even though only 15 schemes would be implemented under the proj-
ect, there is a need to identify a larger number of eligible schemes, as their
implementation would be contingent upon agreement with the beneficiaries to
contribute towards project costs, and to bear all costs of operation and
maintenance of the schemes when completed. The beneficiaries would finance
the cost of: (i) land for pump houses and water reservoirs, (ii) access
roads, and (iii) the water distribution network from storage reservoirs to
the villages. They would also deposit 10 percent of such costs in escrow
upon concluding an agreement with the project administration. The villagers
are expected to contract the services of mechanics for operation and mainte-
nance, similar to the arrangement being followed under SURDP. Drilling of
new wells for irrigation in the project area would be deferred until hydro-
geological studies have proven availability of water for additional exploita-
tion (Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.03). A mid-term project evalua-
tion, in which all cofinanciers would be invited to participate, would be
held no later than December 31, 1985 (Development Credit Agreement, Section
4.06(b) (iv).
Procurement
41.       Vehicles that would be needed by the extension service and project
administration (costing about US$0.4 million including allowances for spare
parts and contingencies) would be procured following international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's guidelines. Project buildings and the
water supply schemes would be constructed in about three years in scattered
and remote locations and are unlikely to be attractive to contractors not
already represented locally. Therefore, they would be tendered under local
procurement procedures. Local procedures are competitive and allow bids from
foreign contractors; they are acceptable to IDA. Contracts under components
financed by ODA would be let out following procurement procedures of that
organization. All other project cost items are recurrent expenditures and
assorted small purchases against which IDA funds would not be disbursed.
Procurement of vehicles for the extension service and project administration,
and tendering for water supply schemes and buildings for the extension ser-
vice would be centralized under the Project Manager. For goods estimated to
cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more and for the civil works estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more, IDA would review and approve
tender documents before they are issued.
Disbursement
42.       The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed as follows;  (a) 100
percent of foreign expenditures for vehicles; (b) 60 percent for civil works
contracts for the construction of the water supply schemes, (c) 100 percent



- 13 -
of total expenditures for consultant services; (d) 85 percent of civil works
for buildings; and (e) repayment of the project preparation facility aclvance.
Environmental Impact
43.       The project is not expected to have any detrimental impact oni the
environment. Changes in land use would be minimal and the extension services
would take care to avoid any negative effects arising from the use of plant
protection materials.
Project Benefits
44.       All project outputs are expected to be consumed domestically, except
for some coffee (around 100 tons) which may be exported. With rapidly rising
demand for food caused by rising population and income, agricultural imports,
particularly food, have increased substantially. Project outputs would be
used to satisfy part of this growing demand.
45.       At full development, the project would increase the production of
sorghum, wheat, maize, vegetables, coffee, and fruit. Production of the
first three commodities would increase by over 7,000 tons per year; output of
vegetables, coffee, and fruit are projected to increase by about 12,000 tons,
150 tons, and 2,000 tons respectively.
46.       About 8,300 farm families representing 45,000 people would benefit
from the project.  At present, the net benefit to the farm family from crop
production activities ranges from $410 to $2,245 depending on the size of
holdings and types of crops grown.  Under the project, the net farm benefits
would increase by 70 percent to 100 percent on farms where there would be no
perennial crop development; for farms where there would be perennial crop
development, the incremental net benefits would exceed 200 percent but these
would be attained over a fairly extended period of about 9 years.  Therefore,
the farmers would have substantial financial gains which would serve as
incentive for them to participate in the project.
47.       Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return on the invest-
ment in the agricultural development component is computed at 27 percent.
Even if the cost of water supply is included in the cost streams without
quantifiable benefits attributed to this component, the ERR would still be
satisfactory at 21 percent. The net present value of the agricultural com-
ponent, discounted at 12 percent over an assumed project life of 30 years, is
computed at $17.5 million.
Risks
48.       As with similar agricultural projects, the project is subject to
the normal uncertainties associated with the amount and timing of rainfall,
particularly as they affect the application of fertilizers. To build farmers'
confidence, technological adoption would start with low-risk improvements



- 14 -
such as seed treatment, the use of improved seeds, inter-row cultivation, and
weed control. It would move gradually toward fertilizer application intro-
ducing split application to minimize loss in case of poor rainfall and to
maximize benefits in periods of good rainfall.
49.       The possibility of a slow start-up in implementation due to
insufficient funds or shortage of personnel is another risk. Regarding
funds, the design of the project takes into account the tight budgetary
situation facing the Government and, therefore, its scope has been limited to
a realistic size. The Government strongly supports this project which is
expected to receive priority in the allocation of public funds. As for per-
sonnel, particularly extension agents, the satisfactory remuneration allowed
under the Government's pay scale for staff working under special projects,
and the proximity of the area to the capital, may serve as adequate incen-
tives for local staff to participate. It may also be possible to transfer to
the project some staff who have been under in-service training in other proj-
ects.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Yemen Arab
Republic and the Association, and the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Association's Articles of Agreement are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
51.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in Section III of Annex III. The signing of financing
agreements with IFAD and ODA are conditions of effectiveness of the credit
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 7.01).
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
