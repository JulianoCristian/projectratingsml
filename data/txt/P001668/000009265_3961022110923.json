It will: 1) provide additional resources for programs\n            targeted at the poor; 2) promote a new approach to rural\n            development by involving communities in project preparation\n            and implementation, while encouraging government agencies,\n            non-governmental organizations and private institutions to\n            assist communities when needed; 3) support a district level\n            program of labor-intensive construction to be targeted at\n            the poorest districts as a safety net operation; and 4)\n            strengthen the poverty monitoring and assessment system\n            through financing a poverty monitoring support facility\n            (PMSF). The PMSF will support poverty reduction policies and\n            programs by bridging poverty-related gaps and developing\n            analytical skills in government and private institutions.\n            The project will have the following three components: 1)\n            community subprojects including an information, education\n            and communication (IEC) campaign to inform communities and\n            other participants about the demand-driven processes of the\n            project; 2) public works program which will finance a safety\n            net operation in poor and food-deficient areas through\n            labor-intensive public works constructing, rehabilitating\n            and maintaining economic infrastructure; and 3) poverty\n            monitoring support facility, which will finance capacity\n            building in institutions to coordinate, collect, analyze,\n            disseminate and use data relevant for poverty reduction\n            policies and programs."}, "docdt": "1996-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
