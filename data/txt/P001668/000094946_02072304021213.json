Nonetheless, lessons learned\n            address the need to balance the objectives in reaching the\n            maximum number of poor, with the creation of sustainable\n            assets, based on the creation of adequate social capital,\n            and participatory processes at different levels. Moreover,\n            to ensure an accurate understanding of the existing\n            capacity, and capacity building requirements, particular\n            attention should be given to the management unit at project\n            preparation, to deliver agreed processes, and to ensure\n            support from the sector ministry, avoiding compromising the\n            essence of the project. To this end, social funds should\n            make use of information education and communication\n            campaigns, as tools to rationalize community demand, and to\n            foster participatory community development. Additionally,\n            the technical quality of infrastructure needs to be improved\n            by increased technical support, and training to communities\n            for planning, design supervision, and contracting/accounting\n            of funds. Most importantly, the lack of effective,\n            responsive management of information systems, hampered the\n            program's ability to identify implementation problems\n            in a timely manner, to react to changing conditions, and to\n            promptly monitor program impacts. Thus, a comprehensive\n            management information system should be in place, with\n            baseline data, and indicators on impact evaluation. Other\n            lessons address the need to ensure linkages between central,\n            local governments, and social fund management units; for a\n            choice of institutional framework to determine the extent,\n            and timing of development impacts of social funds\n            operations; and, to ensure targeting of eligibility criteria\n            for safety net programs, to maximize impact with available resources."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
