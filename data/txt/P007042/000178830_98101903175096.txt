INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
THIRD LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$10.0 million
to the Republic of Ecuador.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the third operation for livestock
developm.ant in Ecuador. In April 1967, the Bank made a loan of US$4.0
million to finance the first stage of Ecuador's livestock development
program. This loan was fully committed in June 1969. In September 1969
the Association approved a credit of US$1.5 million to continue the
program pending the preparation and consideration of a broad, second-stage
project. The credit became effective only in June 1970 but already
more than half of it has been committed, and it is expected that it
will be fully committed by the end of 1970. In view of this high rate
of commitment, the credit is expected to be fully disbursed before the
closing date (December 31, 1973).
3.        The second-stage project was appraised in September/October
1969. After some delay occasioned by discussions with the Ecuadorian
Government concerning fiscal policies, negotiations were held in Washington
from August 14 through 21, 1970. Ecuador was represented by Mr. Carlos
Mantilla Ortega, Ambassador of Ecuador in Washington; Mr. Manuel
Calisto, Deputy Technical Director of the Planning Board; Mr. Jaime
Lurango, Commercial Attache at the Embassy of Ecuador; Mr. Carlos
Guarderas, Vice-President of the Banco Nacional de Fomento (NDB); and
Mr. Frank Thomas, Project Director of the first and second livestock
projects.
4.        The proposed credit, the fourth to Ecuador, would bring the
total of Bank/IDA lending to US$87.9 million (net of cancellations).
The foUlowing is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to
Ecuador as of September 30, 1970:

Total undisbursed                                  7.1  9.7     16.8
5.        Five loans have been completely disbursed.   On the remainder,
disbursements are now proceeding satisfactorily, although there were earlier
delays in disbursements for the Second Highway Project, the Education
Project, and the Fisheries Project.
6.        The Second Highway Project (Loan 379-EC/Credit 51-EC) is a
two-stage project which is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the United States Agency for
International Development (AID). Disbursements were slowed by a delay
in making the loan and credit effective, difficulties with one of the
contractors, adverse climatic and soil conditions, and tardiness in the
completion of detailed engineering for the highways to be constructed under
Stage II. Since the credit was allocated completely to Stage II, dis-
bursements of these funds were not started until later in the project.
The project is now progressing well and is being kept under close review.
About 90 percent of the project is expected to be completed by the end
of this year and the balance by the end of 1971.
7.        Many of the difficulties encountered by the Education Project
resulted from the fact that the executing agency (the Ministry of Education)
was new to the Bank/IDA and there was a new organizational structure (the



- 3 -
Project Unit) within the Ministry to implement the project. In addition,
there have been disruptions because of frequent changes in personnel at
the ministerial level and some difficulties in site acquisition. Now
the Project Unit seems to be functioning satisfactorily as an established
working group, and the problems of site acquisition have been largely
resolved. Furthermore, the supervision mission which reviewed the project
in April assisted the Project Unit in accelerating the phasing of schools,
and it may be possible to complete the project within the period originally
estimated.
8.         The Fisheries Project suffered from a substantial delay before
the loan was made effective, inactivity on the part of the organization
charged with formulating the training program for vessel crew members, and
delays in finding prospective sub-borrowers. However, the supervision
mission which visited Ecuador last August discussed with the authorities
a revision of the training program which seems reasonable in view of the
recent developments in the country's tuna industry, and applications have
been received from s everal potential borrowers. It may be feasible to
accelerate the phasing of vessel construction in order to complete the
project within the time allotted.
9.         IFC has made two investments, one in 1965 of approximately
US$2 million equivalent in equity and debt of La Internacional, a major
Ecuadorian textile firm, and the other in early 1969 of about US$250,000
equivalent in equity of Ecuatoriana de Desarrollo S.A. - Compania Finan-
ciera (COFIEC), a private development finance company.
10.        A project for industrial financing through two development
finance companies has been appraised and will be presented for considera-
tion by the Executive Directors within the next several weeks. Further
projects are being prepared for consideration by the Bank/IDA, but it is
not expected that any of these will be ready for presentation to the
Executive Directors before the end of fiscal year 1972. IFC is reviewing
a possible investment in a cement enterprise.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF IHE PROPOSED CREDIT
11.        Borrower:               Republic of Ecuador.
Amount:                 The equivalent in various currencies of
US$10.0 million.
Purpose:                To assist in financing the second stage
of a livestock development program in
Ecuador initiated with Loan 501-EC
and continued with Credit 173-EC.



Amortization:           In 50 years including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual instal-
ments of 1/2 of 1 percent frcm April 15,
1981 througn October 15, 1990, and of
1-1/2 percent from April 15, 1991 through
October 15, 2020.
Service Charge:         3/4 of 1 percent per annum on the
principal amount of the credit with-
drawn and outstanding.
Relending Terms:        8 percent (6-1/2 percent interest and
1-1/2 percent commission) to parti-
cipating credit institutions and 12
percent to ranchers/farmers.
Estimated Economic
Return on the
Project:               22 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.        An appraisal report entitled "Third Livestock Development
Project" (PA-35a) on the proposed project is attached.
13.        The Ecuadorian economy is predominantly agricultural, with
this sector contributing one-third of gross domestic product and employing
about two-thirds of the total labor force. Agriculture also generates
90 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings (bananas alone
account for 50 percent, while coffee and cacao together contribute
another 30 percent). Livestock accounts for one-fourth of total agri-
cultural production and, although it does not make a significant contri-
bution to exports, has grown to meet the expansion of domestic demand
for meat and dairy products.
14.        The national herd of about 1.8 million head is composed of
approximately 1 million beef cattle and about 0.8 million dairy cattle.
Beef production occurs primarily in the coastal region where 1.5 million
hectares of land are currently under pasture, and an additional 0.5
million hectares of unused land plus 0.1 million hectares of marginal
banana land could be utilized for pasture. The dairy industry is con-
centrated in the highlands (Sierra) where there is little possibility
for expansion of acreage but where substantial increases in production
cculd be achieved through improved pastures and better management.
15.        The proposed credit would finance the second stage of Ecuador's
livestock development program, the first stage of which was initiated with
Loan 501-EC and continued with Credit 173-EC. As part of the 1969-1973



- 5 -
National Development Plan, the second stage is designed to increase
production of both beef and milk in order to satisfy the expected growth
in domestic dermnd. In about 10 years, the project would result in an
incremental production of about 7,500 metric tons of beef and about 40
million liters of milk per year with a total value at current prices of
about US$9.0 million equivalent. The additional beef produced would
represent 25 percent of present annual production while the incremental
milk production would represent 20 percent of present output.
16.        The cost and price effects of the recent devaluation have been
incorporated intn the analysis of the project. The rate of return to the
economy is 22 pGrcGnt.
17.        The project is intended to increase total cattle numbers and
herd productivity through on-farm investment and improvements in animal
husbandry, nutrition -and health. About 350 beef ranchers and approximately
225 dairy farmers are expected to participate. The loans would be used
for pasture establishment, fencing, watering facilities, yards and dips,
machinery, improved breeding stock, and other related inputs. Other
components include (a) a research and training program for beef production,
(b) a seed production and certification program, (c) assistance for modern-
izing the operations of the NDB, and (d) technical assistance for project
administration.
18.        The principal participating banks through which the livestock
credit would be channelled are the NDB, a public entity, and COFIEC, a
private development finance company. These institutions were the parti-
cipating banks in the first two livestock development projects and have
functioned satisfactorily. The Ecuadorian Government has under active
consideration a decree which would permit private commercial banks to lend
on terrs applicable under the proposed project and hence, to become parti-
cipating banks.
19.        Coordination and supervision of the project would be undertaken
by a project commission composed of representatives of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock, the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning
Board, the Central Bank, the National Institute of Agricultural Research
(INIAP), the NDB, the participating private banks, the Coastal Cattlements
Association, and the Sierra Livestock Producers Association. A Project
Director, supported by two Regional Technical Directors and later by a
Deputy Project Director, would have technical responsibility for implement-
ation of the project. Loans to ranchers/farmers exceeding US$100,000
equivalent would be submitted to the Association for prior approval.
Technical assistance to ranchers/farmers in the preparation and super-
vision of ranch/farm development plans would be provided by livestock
technicians employed by the participating banks and seconded to the .
Project Director. The Central Bank would act as financial agent for the
Government and would also assume important functions of project adminis-
tration.



- 6 -
20.        The total project cost of US$19.7 million equivalent would be
composed of the following elements: US$16.5 million equivalent for long-
term development loans; US$1.5 million equivalent for the INIAP, Ministry
of Agriculture, and NDB programs; and US$1.7 million equivalent for other
technical services. The credit would finance US$10.0 million equivalent
(51 percent), participating banks US$5.o million equivalent (25 percent),
ranchers/farmers US$3.9 million equivalent (20 percent), and the Central
Bank US$0.8 million equivalent (4 percent).     The Central Bank would
channel the funds for long-term lending to the participating banks which
would in turn on-lend to the ranchers/farmers. In the case of beef develop-
ment plans, the ranchers would contribute 20 percent of the cost in addi-
tion to providing substantial working capital in the form of herd build-up,
participating banks would provide 20 percent, and IDA 60 percent. For the
dairy development plans, the farmers would contribute 35 percent, partici-
pating banks 20 percent, and IDA h5 percent.
21.        The terms of sub-loans to beef ranchers would be 8-12 years,
including a 3-5 year grace period, and to dairy farmers 7-9 years, including
a 2-3 year grace period. Repayments from participating banks would be based
on repayments from ranchers/farmers and would accrue to the Government. The
interest rate to ranchers/farmers would be 12 percent and that to the parti-
cipating banks 8 percent, including a 1-1/2 percent commission to the
Central Bank to cover the local costs of project administration. The
exchange risk would be borne by the Government.
22.        Goods required for the project would be obtained through existing
commercial channels, which are sufficiently numerous to ensure adequate
competition. Since items would be purchased by individual ranchers and
would not be of substantial value, international competitive bidding would
not be appropriate. All purchases of livestock would be subject to the
approval of the Project Director.
23.        The foreign exchange component of the project is estimated at
Us$5.8 million, or about 30 percent of the total cost. The proposed
credit would finance local expenditures of about US$4.2 million. Since
the ranchers/farmers and the participating banks would be providing the
maximum contributions which are considered reasonable for them, the
local cost financing would be needed to permit implementation of the project.
Because of the importance of this project to the development of the agri-
cultural sector and the growth of the economy., and because of its impact
on diversification of marginal banana-producing areas, I consider this
amount of local cost financing justified.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIFENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Ecuador and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d), of the Articles of Agreement
of IDA and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 7 -
25.       The draft Agreement contains covenants normally included in
agreements for livestock development projects. Particular attention
is drawn to the following provisions of the draft Development Credit
Agreement:
a) the Borrower will ensure that the participating banks
will have sufficient resources to provide adequate
working capital for the ranch/farm development programs
(Section 4.01(c) );
b) the Borrower will cause the Central Bank to provide an
advance to cover the shortfall of funds for the local
costs of project administration in the early years
(Section 4.13);
c) the credit will not become effective until the agreement
between the Borrower and its central bank concerning the
execution of the project and a relending agreement provided
for in paragraphs (a) and (e), respectively, of Section 6.01
shall have become effective.
PART V - THE ECONOIMY
26.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Ecuador" (WH-.201a) dated August 21, 1970, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 4, 1970. The report indicated
that the most urgent and immediate issue of development policy was the
necessity to correct the severe fiscal disequilibrium which threatened
the financial stability of the country.  However, until recently, the
Government did not effectively limit the growth of its current expendi-
tures. As a result, the Central Government's deficit reached a level
where expansion of credit to the public sector, even without growth of
private sector credit, was not consistent with balance of payments
viability and the sucre had to be devalued in August 1970 from S/18 to
S/25 per U.S. dollar.
27.       The crisis generated by the continued fiscal imbalance and the
devaluation brought Ecuadorian authorities to the realization that a com-
prehensive and consistent financial program was needed. Such a program
was developed in cooperation with the IMF and a stand-by agreement based
on this program recently has been adopted (September 11, 1970). The
stand-by agreement, combined with tax measures taken earlier in the year
and the favorable fiscal impact of the devaluation, is expected to reduce
the 1971 budget deficit to a level consistent with a moderate expansion
of credit to the private sector and the maintenance of the new exchange
rate. The Ecuadorian authorities took the opportunity of the devaluation
to simplify the exchange system, eliminating the dual rate system and other
multiple exchange rate features; they also eliminated all restrictions



- 8-
on current transactions, thus making the sucre a convertible currency un-
der Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement. The devaluation meas-
ure already has begun to have a beneficial impact on the balance of pay-
ments as it has provided increased returns to exporters and, especially
significant at this time, has improved the position of Ecuadorian produ-
cers vis-a-vis their Andean market competitors.
28.       Ecuador's external debt management has been generally sound;
the debt service ratio on the public external debt is estimated at about
13 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1970. Provided sound monetary
and fiscal policies are maintained, Ecuador should continue to be credit-
worthy for moderate amounts of additional external lending on conventional
terms. However, even under conditions of sound economic management,
Ecuador's low per capita income and relatively high fiscal burden place
a limit on public sector savings that can be generated, and at least part
of the capital required from abroad should be provided on concessional
terms.
29.       A basic data sheet is annexed hereto.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE W4ITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would com-
ply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
31.       I recormend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
