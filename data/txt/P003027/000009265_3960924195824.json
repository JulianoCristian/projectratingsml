Completion\n            Report (PCR) for the Oil-Palm Development Project in Zaire.\n            The Credit was closed on December 31, 1987, four years\n            behind schedule. It was not fully disbursed. Parts I and III\n            were submitted for comment to the Borrower on July 20, 1990.\n            No comments were received. Palm oil production on mostly\n            foreign owned commercial plantations in Zaire had declined\n            steadily since independence from 240,000 tons of oil per\n            annum in 1959 to about 125,000 tons of oil in 1976. The main\n            reasons were the turbulent period after independence in 1960\n            and the successive measures of Zairianization and\n            demonetization. The decision of the Zaire Government to\n            return the plantations to private management in the late\n            seventies did provide an opportunity for the Bank to help\n            reverse the long decline in a sector in which it was\n            believed that Zaire had a clear comparative advantage and a\n            natural potential to rehabilitate an important\n            agro-industry. Project execution ran into many difficulties.\n            It became effective only 4 years after approval, and the\n            project closing date also had to be extended by almost four\n            years, until December 31, 1987. The last disbursement was\n            made on October 20, 1988, about ten years after project\n            approval. Despite these difficulties, the project achieved\n            its technical goals by completing its planting and factory\n            rehabilitation program, most of its labor housing\n            construction program, and improving the oil palm seed-supply\n            situation in Zaire."}, "docdt": "1991-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
