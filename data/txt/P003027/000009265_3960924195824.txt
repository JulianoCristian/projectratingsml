PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Oil-Palm
Development Project in Zaire for which Credit 796-ZR in the amount of US$9.0
million was approved on May 2, 1978. The Credit was closed on December 31,
1987, four years behind schedule. It was not fully disbursed. About US$2.6
million has been canceled and the last disbursement was on October 3, 1988.
Preparation of this PCR was started in September 1988, and is based,
inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit, Guarantee and Project
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank, Co-
financiers and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Sector Division of the Africa
Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). Parts I and
III were submitted for comment to the Borrower on July 20, 1990. No comments
were received.

OIL-PALM DEVEL OPJIENT PROJECT
(CR.796-ZHI
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.      Palm oil production on mostly foreign owned commercial plantations in
Zaire had declined steadily since independence from 240,000 tons of oil per
annum in 1959 to about 125,000 tons of oil in 1976. The planted area
decreased also, from 93,000 ha to 72,000 ha, with most palms planted before
1962. The main reasons were the turbulent period after independence in 1960
and the successive measures of Zairianization and demonetization. The
decision of the Zaire Government to return the plantations to private
management in the late seventies did provide an opportunity for the Dank to
help reverse the long decline in a sector in which it was believed that Zaire
had a clear comparative advantage and a natural potential to rehabilitate an
important agro-industry.
2.      The Government had already recognized early on (1973) the importance
and the critical situation of the oil-palm sub-sector and had sought external
support for its "Oil Palm Plan" (Plan Palmier) to rehabilitate and expand
commercial plantations. The project was to carry out the first phase of this
initiative by financing three plantation companies-V over a five year period
(1978-1983) in the planting of 12,215 ha, the rehabilitation of three palm oil
factories, rehabilitation or construction of 3,100 labor houses, technical
assistance and cash-crop pilot projects, aimed at stabilizing the labor-supply
to the plantations. Total project costs, estimated at appraisal at US$47.4m,
would be financed for 54.7% by external funds from IDA, the CCCE, the ADF and
BADEA, for 42.6% by private companies, and for 2.7% by the Government of
Zaire.
Implementation Experience
3.      Project execution ran into many difficulties.  It became effective
only 4 years after approval, and the project closing date also had to be
extended by almost four years, until December 31, 1987. The last disbursement
was made on October 20, 1988, about ten years after project approval. Despite
these difficulties, the project achieved its technical goals by completing its
planting and factory rehabilitation program, most of its labor housing
construction program, and improving the oil palm seed-supply situation in
Zaire. Incremental palm oil production due to the project is estimated at
36,000 tons/annum by 1995 compared to an appraisal estimate of 33,000
tons/annum. However, the project shows an ERR of only 5.0% for PLZ and a
'/PLZ (Plantations Lever au Zaire), CCP (Compagnie de Commerces et
Plantations) and Busira-Lomami Company.



- iv -
negative ERR for CCP, due to much lower world market priceu for palm oil than
estimated at appraisal. Furthermore, due to a continued deterioration of the
investment climate in Zaire, the project did not induce other investments in
the sector and, as a result, did not improve its overall rohabilitation, as
was initially expected.
Rsults and Sustainabilitv
4.      The project posea serious cash flow problems for the participating
companies. The end-borrowers obligation to bear the foreign exchange risk
became a debilitating financial burden, due to the drastic devaluation by
about 500% of the Zairian currency in September 1983 and continued
devaluations thereafter; the steep drop of world market palm-oil prices in
1986, rendering palm-oil exports inviable; and the serious cash-flow problems
due to lack of foreign exchange and working capita, credit. PLZ solved its
problems by liquidating available fixed assets and prepaying the IDA loan, but
the CCP was facing a bankruptcy situation and was sold off by its parent
company last year. The third company (Busira-Lomani) withdrew from the
project before credit effectiveness.
Lessons Learned
The lessons from this project can be summarized as followsa
(a) the palm oil production project was designed under identifiably
uncertain economic circumstances and only shortly after a major change
in the management structure of the sub-sector. Under these
circumstances the project did not address sufficiently the sub-sector
issues.
(b) the basic idea incorporated in the project design, that
experienced private companiea could execute the rehabilitation
programs efficiently, has proved to be corrects planting/replanting
of oil palm and factory rehabilitation were carried out as planned
albeit delayed, and at lower than estimated costs, with a likelihood
that production will exceed appraisa7. targets;
(c) a major lesson has been that imposing the foreign exchange risk of
the loan on the sub-borrower, especially for a long-term investment,
is very risky in a situation of high inflation and rapid devaluation,
and in which the product can only be sold in the domestic market;
(d) the project did contribute substantially to policy formulation
through the execution of in-depth studies on the perennial crops
sector in Zaire. These studies have (i) illustrated convincingly the
decline of the oil palm plantation sector, and shown that this
situation will not be reversed easily; (ii) recommended plantation
companies to diversify into outreach schemes with surrounding small-
farmers, as this could lead to lower cost production; and (iii)
concluded that artisanal palm oil production which has continued to



- v -
rise rlowly hut steadily, has a better future than plantation
production providet oil quality can be improved by the introduction of
intermediate technology processing (mini-mills). The project, at the
end, did teat out the latter by financing the purchase of one mini-
mill on credit for a private entrepreneur.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1. PROJECT IDENTITY
Project Name:       Oil Palm Project
Credit Number:      Cr. 796-ZR
RVP Unit:           South Central and Indian Ocean
Department
Sector:             Agriculture
Sub-sector:         Industrial Crops
2. BACKGROUND
2.01         Zaire has always been an important producer of palm oil.  Palm
oil is produced by small farmers, mostly through collection of fruit bunches
from natural groves and processed with simple hand equipment, and by large
scale commercial plantations who in addition to their own production, also
process in factories the fruit bunches purchased from local farmers. Before
independence, the commercial plantations sector produced some 240,000 tons of
palm oil per year (1959) mostly for export, making the country one of the
larges; world exporters at that time.
2.02         Since independence, however, palm oil production on commercial
plantations has - with some variation - steadily declined, to reach about
76,000 tons of production and only 40,000 tons of exports in 1976, the year
that Government proposed its "Emergency Oil Palm Rehabilitation Program" (Plan
Palmier). The causes of decline were initially the political turmoil, and
thereafter the lack of investment due to the Government's nationalization
policies in the 1973-75 period and the high cost of production (lack of
foreign exchange leading to lack of spare parts; declining yields on the ag!Lg
plantationsor increasing transportation problems and shortage of labor).
2.03         The "Plan Palmier" objective was to achieve the replanting/new
planting of oil palm on 100,000 ha - over a ten year period, to be combined
with large scale factory rehabilitation. These targets were to be reached by
attracting private investment. To achieve this, plantations were partly
returned to their former owners, and prices of inpvts and outputs were
liberalized.

3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01         Objectives:  The Bank supported the Government's objective, but
considered the rehabilitation of existing plantations the most cost-effective
solution, rather than the establishment of new plantations. A FAO/CP mission
in May 1976 prepared on this basis a pre-appraisal report using cost data
provided by the participating companies.
3.02         The Palm Oil Development Project direct benefits were to be an
increase Li the production of palm oil by 33,000 tons and of palm kernels by
8,000 tons per annum, with a value of US$18 million at 1977 prices by 1995.
It would also improve and expand social infrastructure, employ additional
staff and train existing staff, and improve the labor supply situation through
food crops pilot projects.
3.03         The project would primarily produce for the domestic market and a
Coordinating Committee (para 4.02) would in its three monthly meetings review
from time to time the progress obtained in the project, producer prices,
salaries and wages in the sub-sector, and any circumstances or policy changes
at the national, industrial and local level, which might interfere with the
success or efficiency of project execution.
3.04         Proiect Description:  The Oil Palm Development Project (Cr.796-
ZR) provided a line of credit to three private plantation companies to
finance:
(i)       About 2,600 ha of new plantings, and about 9,600 ha of
replantings including the provirion of seeds for all new
plantinge.
(ii)      Rehabilitation of two existing oil mills at PLZ's Lokutu
plantation, and a new steam boiler at PLZ's Yaligimba mill.
(iii)     Equipment for land clearing for plantations, construction
sites and roads, necessary for the timely completion of the works
at the PLZ plantations.
(iv)      Construction of 1,400 new and 1,700 renovated houses for
plantation workers; 60 staff houses; 25 social facilities;
storage space and offices where needed;
(v)       Purchase of fertilizers for existing young plantations of Busira
and CCPS
(vi)      Recruitment of additional local and expatriate staff to
complement existing staff during implementatict- of the planting
program, and training of existing staff;
(vii)     Development of pilot projects for the production of food crops
by estate labor; and



(viii)    Recruitment of two additional expatriate reoeatchers and
provieion for housing, transport, scientific instruments and
other f&cilities at the Binga research and seed
multiplication station to train eight Zairian researchers.
4. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.01         The project was thought to be well timed, because it intervened
at a moment of critical decline of the palm oil industry, and it responded to
valid government concerns. However, the long term perspectives were not
clearly defined. While the Bank aimed at a project, that would serve as a
mcel for future rehabilitation by the private sector, the Government
considered it as a first phase investment of the oil palm plan (Plan Palmier
I) to be followed by a second one. Given the uncertain economic situation,
the project should have given more attention to sector wide issues (such as
credit, input supply and transport) as well as sustainability.
4.02         Each of the participating plantation companies was to be
responsible for the execution of its own planting, factory rehabilitation, and
construction programs included in the project. Government was to be
responsible for the staff-improvement and pilot project components. SOFIDE
would administer the subsidiary loans and be responsible for projsct
monitoring and evaluation (para. 5.13).  Overall coordination would be carried
out by a Coordinating Committee for oil Palm, composed of representatives of 7
ministerial departments, the Bank of Zaire, SOFIDE and the three executing
agencies, chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.03         Total project cost was estimatei at US$ 47.4 million (Z 41.1
million). Project financing was to be provided by IDA (US$9.0 million), ADF
(US$ 6.1 million), BADEA (US$ 4.4 million), CCCE (US$ 4.2 million) and the
Government of Zaire (USS 2.7 million). The companies participating in the
project would contribute US$ 21 million to the project (PLZ US$ 18.5 million,
Busira US$ 0.8 million and CCP USS 1.7 million). Project expenditures
incurred by the oil palm companies wo .xd be reimbursed by IDA and CCCE in the
ratio 65/35. It was agreed that IDA procurement guidelines would be followed
by CCCE for jointly financed project components.
4.04         The lending and onlending terms (given in table 6b of Part III)
were different for the three major creditors IDA, CCCE and ADF, but sub-
borrowers al). paid a 10% interest rate, and all bore the foreign exchange
risk. The CCCE made an additional loan in 1986 for the financing of a boiler
for PLZ with a 7% interest rate. Due to the substantial delays in credit
effectiveness (para. 5.01) IDA agreed to retroactively finance the replanting
program, in order to maintain a regular and balanced replanting policy.



- 4 -
5. PROJECT IMPEMENTATION
5.01         C.redit Effectiveness.  The date of credit effectiveness was
delayed for almost thirty months. The primary reasons weret (i) changes in
the Zairian investtnent code that would limit the Government's liability on the
CCCi  loan to SOFIDE, which was unacceDtable to CCCE; (ii) problems with the
draft subsidiary agreements between St FIDE and the oil palm companies
centering around the deductibility of interest charges from taxable income and
the reluctance of oil pal.n companies to carry the foreign exchange risk; (iii)
delays in the effectiveness of the BADFA and ADF loans; (iv) the withdrawal
in June 1979 of Busira Lomami from the project, officially because management
of the company feared th%t they would be unable to attract sufficient labor to
complete the planting prozram, but unofficially because they felt that pa_m
oil prices were too low to justify the investments required. Their withdrawal
necessitated an amendment of the credit agreement; (v) a directive of the Bank
of Zaire, issued in 1980, that exporters would only be able to utilize 10
percent of their export proceeds for imports, making it impossible for the oil
palm companies to obtain the foreign exchange necessary for imports of
equipment and fertilizer; and (vi) the complicated system of cross-
effectiveness of all the credits and loans. IDA finally declared the credit
effective on January 30, 1981.
5.02         Other project chanqes.  The amendment c&  the credit agreement on
March 6, 1981 included also changes in allocations of the proceeds of the
credit, such as reductions in funding for PLZ factory rehabilitation,
consultants, research, and pilot projects, inclusion of factory rehabilitation
of CCP, and scholarships.  The emenOment failed, however, to better define the
pilot projects. In fact, at the start-up, government and donors fac .d a
project quite different from the one appraised. This should have been a
reason to strengthen the coordination and monitoring. The concept of
coordination by a committee of 10 entities was not worked out. in sufficient
detail and proved unsuccessful.
5.03         Project implementation started well for the replanting and new
planting of oil palm trees. In 1980, prior to credit effectiveness, IDA had
decided that expenditures for the planting program envisaged under the project
and accrued prior to credit-effectiveness would be eligible for reimbursement,
in view of PLZ'b reluctance to embark on an important planting program without
adequate financing guaranties and because of the urgency of the planting
prograa. Also, PLZ would make serious effoLte to include the 900 ha
originally scheduled for planting by Eusira-Lomani in their own planting
program. Thus, implementation of the planting program, co-financed by ADF and
CCCE, started long before the loan became effective, but the implemenzation of
other components was adversely affected by the delay in credit effectiveness.
The economic situation during the 3 year delay had dnteriorated nubse.antially,
and as a result, the corporate policies of the participating companies had
changed. In particular vLZ changed its planning for factory rehabilitation
several times and final agreement was not reached until May 1983. The pilot



fnod crop projects were never implemented due to lack of interest from the
plantation companies and the absence of proper component preparation (para.
4.02 and 4.07). Implementation data are given in tables 3a and 3b of Part
III.
5.04         EJ completed the projected project planting program of 10,868
ha, including the 900 ha foreseen for the Busira Lomami plantations, with some
delays. The envisaged overhaul of 2 factories, after much discussion and with
a misprocurement of the boiler for the Lokutu factory in December 1984, was
completed in April 1987. The factory at Lokutu operates regularly and should
be able to reach an extraction level of 21%. The labor housing construction
program encountered delays caused by a lack of financial resources and
transportation difficulties, but was finally completed in 1986 exceeding
appraisal estimates (2,360 labor houses compared to 2,000 at appraisal). Of
the 82 social structures (other houses, schools, dispensaries) envisioned at
appraisal, only 7 were completed. No dispensaries or stores, only 6 out of 60
staff houses, and only 1 out of 7 planned schools were built.
5.05         CCP completed its factory rehabilitation within the estimated
execution period of 3 years after project effectiveness. Planting exceeded
original estimates (1,927 ha compared to 1,415 ha at appraisal), but the
housing programs was only 20% completed at the closing date, mainly due to
lack of funds. At the extension of the closing date, funds were reallocated
to CCP for additional factory improvements and a fertilizer supply program for
the new plantings.
5.06         The implementation of the Government component encountered many
obstacles, was implemented with great delays, and needed partial redesign.
The training abroad of Zairian nationals was broadened to training of
plantation company staff in order to maintain management capabilities. In
total, 30 staff participated in training abroad. Results remained below
expectation, due to the lack of preparation and follow-up. Reports on
training were frequently late, of varying quality or not prepared at all. In
general, the execution of this component has not made a measurable impact on
oil palm development in Zaire.
5.07         The pilot Projects were not identified at the appraisal stage,
but were added afterwards at the insistence of the Programs Department.
Several attempts were made to develop such projects, but they never reached
implementation, due to: (i) lack of interest of the plantation companies,
which were also not consulted before inclusion in the project; and (ii)
insufficient expertise at government level to handle this component. In
September 1985, Government proposed, and the Bank agreed, to use available
funds under this component for (a) the installation of small palm-oil mills of
a maximum capacity of 1 ton of bunches pa: hour (mini-mills) to exploit more
efficiently the existing natural palm groves; and (b) perennial crop sub-
sector studies, to provide basic data for follow-up activities after the
closing date or for a wider sector loan. The completion of these components
required several extensions of closing date, and the project was finally
closed on December 31, 1987, four years later than foreseen.



- 6 -
5.08         The mini-milles clot project encountered problems in the
preparation of bidding documents and the identification of suitable local
entrepreneurs. Because of the extremely high prices of international bidders,
it was finally agreed to establish in Equateur province a locally constructed
mill by Zaire Trading and Englneerlng Company (ZTE) under lLcense with a well
reputed internatLonal flrm. Financing was to be carried out by SOFIDE, which
was also responsible for administering the other project subloans (para 4.02).
At present, the mini-mill is producing satLsfactorily; no financial evaluation
has been made so far.
5.09         The sub-sector studies consisted of two parts: a plantation
sector analyeis and the preparation of various project proposals. The first
study was satisfactorily completed in 1987 and the second in 1988. The
studies were executed by Socfin Consultant Services of Belgium.
5.10         Consultant services and strenctheninc of staff.  Government
initially cooperated in providing consultant services (in particular, for tha
research activities at Binga estate). Later on, however, Government did not
Lssue all requested work permits for expatriate staff needed for on-site
practical training of Zairian staff leaving the agricultural educational
system, and in particular for those needed for seeds research.
5.11         OLl palm research.  In opite of many difficulties the research
efforts have been successful in establishing a seed selection and production
program. This program is now able to produce and sell germinated Tenera
3eeds, with an expected production level in Zaire of about 18 tons of fresh
fruit bunches per ha, as well as the first selected wilt-disease tolerant
seeds, albeit at lower yield levels.
5.12         Auditinq.  Auditing has been generally unsatisfactory, mainly
because no separate project records were kept. While PLZ employed Price
Waterhouse to audit its accounts, the CCP had its company accounts controlled
by a "Commisaire aux comptes", which was not acceptable to IDA. After the
merger of CCP with the AGRICOM group, their full company accounts were audited
by a qualified internal auditor of AGRICOM. The companies were not willing to
finance the additional expenses involved in independent auditing (CCP) or in
keeping separate accounts (CCP and PLZ). A separate audit of the Government
executed component was not carried out.
5.13         The monitorina and evaluation sub-component, under responsibility
of SOFIDE (para. 4.02) had a quick start, but did not develop beyond the stage
of progress reports. The results were not commensurate to the rather high
fees of USS 100,000/year paid to SOFIDE. Donor financing of this sub-
component was committed for two years (ending 1985), whereafter the quality of
performance rapidly declined. The last annual report was received in December
1987.
5.14         Palm Oil Price Developments:  The Coordinating Committee for Oil
Palm did not convene to review producer, wholesale or retail prices. These
were only discussed in general terms during committee meetings with



- 7 -
supervision missions. Government pricing policy consisted of an ex-post
control of price. established by the producers. Producer prices were
discussed in the palm oil committee of ANEZA who submitted its palm oil price
proposals to the Department of National Economy and Industry for approval,
which was regularly obtained. Prices were first adjusted yearly but as
inflation accelerated in the earlier eighties, price. changed more often.
5.15         Local oil palm prices are calculated Ex-Storage Tank Kinshasa,
the main distribution point for human consumption and the processing industry.
Palm oil prices in the interior are about 30-100% higher. Local palm oil
prices initially followed increases in production costs. Over the longer
period, however, domestic prices continued to rise faster than local
inflation, due to the increasing ocarcity of palm oil, a government policy of
restricting imports and price cartel arrangements. (price details are given
in table 7e of Part III). Above all, world market prices decreased by fifty
percent at the time when new plantings came into production. Companies did
not export oil-palm products to obtain foreign currency, in spite of lack of
foreign exchange because Government, faced with domestic deficits, objected
and world market prices were below domestic costs of production. The
implications for the companies were: (i) a constant and serious cash flow
problem; (ii) difficulties in importing essential inputs, and (iii) a crushing
financial burden caused by the obligation to repay project sub-loans in
foreign exchange equivalent. PLZ solved the problem by selling existing
assets and prepaying the loan in 1985; CCP however, could not and did not make
any loan repayments and the company was merged with another company (AGRICOM),
which later sold off all its interests in Zaire.
6. PROJECT COSTS
6.01         Total actual costs are estimated at US$33.8 million compared to
US$47.4 million at appraisal. Part of the reason for the lower amount is the
rapid appreciation of the US dollar vis-&-vis the major currencies, during
execution of the project and the rapid devaluation of the Zaire currency.
Also, partial implementation of the building program, a reduced use of funds
for the pilot projects (para. 5.07-5.08) and the withdrawal of Busira (para.
5.01), contributed to lower costs.
6.02         Disbursements:  Estimated and actual disbursements of Cr.796-ZR
are given in Table 4 in Part III. Initial disbursements were delayed, due to
late credit-effectiveness (para. 5.01). Subsequent delays occurred in: (i)
the CCP and PLZ housing rehabilitation and construction program; (ii) the PLZ
'actory rehabilitation program; and (iLi) the implementation of the GOZ
supervised training and smallholder component. Of the original Credit of
US$9.0 million, US$520,000 was canceled in December 1985, due to PLZ's
misprocurement of a boiler (para 5.04) and US$1,173,906.06 was canceled at the
time of the second extension on December 3, 1986, since these were funds no
longer needed under the project. A further US$0.8 million was canceled at the



- 8 -
tLm of flnal dlebursement on October 20, 1988. Retroactive financing
amounted to about US$700,000 (para 5.04).
6.03         Credit Allocation:  The original and revised allocation of the
proceeds of Cr. 796-ZR ie shown in Table 5, Part III. Original allocations
were revised (a) in March 1981 due to Buoira's decision to withdraw from the
project (para 5.01); and (b) in April 1986 due to the redesign of the pilot
projects (para. 5.07).
- PROJECT RESULTS
6.01         Overall performances  The project provides an interesting
experience of an attempt to help private entrepreneurs to rehabilitate a
traditional industry. It has been successful in bringing in private
plantation companies to carry out long term investment in oil palm
planting/replanting, which they had not been doing for a long time. Moreover,
appraisal targets in planting/replanting and factory rehabilitation were by
and large reached; the quality of plantings has been very good and extraction
rates are expected to be slightly higher than estimated. On the other hand,
the project's financing arrangements were clearly unsustainable; they led to
the refusal of one company to participate (Busira-Lomami) and were a major
factor in the financial difficulties of the second company (CCP). Only PLZ,
through its ability to prepay the loans by disposing of other assets, was able
to extricate itself from what turned out to be untenable financial
obligations.
7.02         Technical Aspects:  A planting/replanting program of 12,785 ha.
has been carried out by two companies, against an estimate of 12,215 ha. by
three companies; 2,700 labor houses were built or renovated (3,100 estimated
at appraisal, and three oil factories were rehabilitated (same at appraisal).
Details are presented in Table 3 of part III. The incremental production for
these new plantings is expected to reach 36,000 tons of palm oil and 9,000
tons of palm kernels in 1994 (against 33,000 and 8,000 tons respectively,
expected at appraisal). Details are in Table 7a of Part III. Actual
production estimates are based on better than expected yield performance of
the palm varieties planted; these varieties have been developed through a
highly successful research/multiplication scheme at Binga, mostly implemented
by the plantation companies but with minor project contributions. This scheme
has also succeeded in developing wilt tolerant seeds, which are now being
tested.
7.03         If these production levels are indeed reached at full development
in the mid 1990s, (due to the long growing cycle of palm trees), they would
reverse the 20-year long trend of decline in plantation palm oil production of
the participating companies. However, the decline will resume thereafter if
new investment is not forthcoming soon, and even the expected increase in
productLon will not be enough to cover the increase in domestic demand. In
order to foster expansion of artisanal production (which is already rising)
and improve its quality, the project financed the purchase of a small oil mill
(mini-mill) with a capacity of one ton of fresh fruit bunches per hour which



is now being run on a pilot basis by a private entrepreneur, who is expanding
his own plantings and buys fruit bunches from local farmers.
7.04         Financial Aspects:  The obligation of companies to carry the
foreign exchange risk (i.e. repay the loan and pay interest in foreign
exchange) has clearly proved to be unsustainable, given the macro-economic
climate prevailing in Zaire during the project's implementation period.
Already at appraisal, it was expected that most of the production was destined
for the local market; it thus required an act of faith to assume that domestic
palm oii prices would move in line with the cost of forvign exchange.  In the
1980-1988 period, domestic palm oil prices increased faster (by a factor of
46) than average domestic inflation (by a factor of 33), but not nearly as
fast as the amount of local currency needed to buy foreign exchange (by a
factor of 98). Obviously, it would have been better to provide, from the
outset, for alternative onlending arrangements in local currency, even if they
would have been at positive interest-rates or if the principal would have been
indexed to inflation or to the domestic palm oil price.
7.05         There have been repeated attempts by the participating companies
to change the onlending arrangements from foreign exchange debt to local
currency debt. This was, however, refused by IDA as it wanted to avoid
Government to assume the foreign exchange risk. Also, alternative solutions
would have been difficult to find as Government maintained its policy of
highly negative interest rates in agriculture, although at a later date
(1987), Government accepted the foreign exchange risk on development loans for
food-production purposes. In summary, the serious distortions in the
financial sector made it impossible to come to a lasting solution; a planned
financial sector adjustment operation which would have addressed these issues
has been postponed due to the present political situation in Zaire.
7.06         Marketing aspects:  As explained above, the project was to be a
first effort to rehabilitate the oil palm plantation sector which had been in
a long term decline since the early 1960s, but whose competitive advantage was
not really questioned provided that labor supply problems and transportation
difficulties could be solved. The decision to finally undertake the project
in 1978 (Government had already been requesting financial assistance for it
since the early 1970s) was based on (a) the return of nationalized/zairianized
plantations to their former owners; (b) high world market prices for palm oil
and basically optimistic price projections for the future; and (c) a growing
domestic deficit in palm oil.
7.07         The market situation for palm oil changed fundamentally during
project implementation, and changed the strategy on which the project was
based. First, the steep decline in world market prices in the mid-1980s,
combined with steadily rising domestic demand for palm oil, has turned the oil
palm companies exclusively towards the home market. This move was further
strengthened by Government's decision not to "allow" any imports of palm oil,
which had the effect of increasing domestic prices in real terms thus making
local sales more profitable. Second, the strong devaluation of the local
currency, coupled with the persistence of labor supply and transportation



- 10 -
problems, has made the profitability of plantation palm oil versus artisanal
production increasingly questionable; the sub-sector studies have shown that
throughout the decline of the plantation sector, artisanal output has been
steadily increasing (although insufficiently to compensate for the overall
decline in output).
7.08         Rate of Return:  A financial rate of return can not be
calculated, as none of the two participating companies have kept separate
financial records of project activities. The rate was almost certainly
negative buicause the project caused a situation of technical bankruptcy for
UCP, and PLZ had to reduce its operating costs (in particular fertilization)
and liquidate aBsets to enable it to repay its loan.
7.09         The economic rate of return is calculated at 5.0% for PLZ and
-2.2% for CCP, compared to respectively 15% and 14% at appraisal. The
calculation is based on actual new plantings and replantings given in table 3a
of part III and estimated yields during the project implementation period.
However, actual yields obtained so far from the plantings exceed estimated
yields. A revision of future yield estimates, based on these higher yields
would increase the ERR for PLZ to 7.2%, and for CCP to -0.4%. However, the
PCR assumes the more conservative calculation, since future favorable
developments remain rather speculative. The prices for palm oil and kernels
used in the ERR calculation, are the equivalent import substitution prices,
and are shown in Annex I. The production costs are based on Perennial Crops
Report data. The official exchange rate was used; at the time this rate was
close to the shadow foreign exchange rate. The lower rate for CCP plantations
is mainly due to their lower average yield level (9.5 tons/ha/annum against
10.8 tons) and CCP's relative higher investment in factory and infrastructure
rehabilitation per ton output/year of palm oil (US$37 for CCP versus US$17 for
PLZ).
7.10         The main reason for the low actual ERR is the sharply lower world
market price for palm oil, both during the implementation period and in future
forecasts, compared with appraisal estimates. If the government would allow
for unlimited imports of palm oil, production from domestic plantations would
not be able to compete, at present world market prices. However, this picture
could change if world market prices increase and/or if transportation costs in
Zaire could be significantly lowered.
7.11         Results of Government.  Government's contribution to the project
was small and the actual amount in real terms was much less than anticipated
at appraisal. Theoretically, income generated from the onlending of the CCCE
and IDA loans would have far outweighed the Government's own contribution to
SOFIDE and the pilot projects. In practice, however, since (i) PLZ repaid its
Loan before interest charges were due; (ii) CCP has been unable to meet its
interest payment obligations; and (iii) taxes received from CCP are likely to
be small considering the poor financial condition of the company, net revenue
is most likely negative.

7.12         Imvact of Project:  The project has had a positive impact on palm
oil production in Zaire: it is estimated that production increases
attributable to the project will be about 36,000 ton/annum by 1994, and will
contribute to a slight improvement in overall palm-oil output in the country
in the 1990-95 period. However, as no other investments have taken place and
lack of maintenance of other plantations has by and large continued, the
decline in overall output is likely to resume thereafter. The project has not
solved other pressing problems either, such ca credit availability, transport
bottlenecks, local taxation problems, and labor supply. It in fact did create
serious financial problems for the participating companies, in particular CCP.
7.13         Proiect Risks and Sustainabilitv.  The project results
illustrated the perils of accepting the foreign exchange risk of financing
long term planting programs, under unstable economic conditions. The Bank-
appraisal £dentified labor shortages and transport difficulties as the major
risks, but the difficult economic situation in Zaire and the uncertain
investment climate, proved to be more important, because they led to major
project changes and delayed important decisions and project implementation
(paras. 5.01, 5.02). Although PLZ complied with the project credit conditions
and implemented with the credit an important and sizeable rehabilitation
program, CCP completed only its technical program while undermining its
financial independence and indeed its existence.
7.14         The sub-sector studies made under the project (para. 5.09) have
illustrated convincingly that plantation oil palm production will further
decline and local demand for palm oil will increase. There appears to be an
urgent need for a continued rehabilitation effort, but the original project
concept would not be replicable. A revitalized oil palm industry would have
to be based on the principle of supplying the local market, and need to have
long term credit at acceptable terms access to foreign exchange in the banking
system and a solution for the vital transport problems. Finding a solution
for these problems appears to be urgent, since the only alternative will be to
import palm oil in steadily increasing amounts.
8. PARTICIPANTS PERFORMANCE
7.01         Government Performance. Government complied adequately with
credit conditions but was slow in implementing the component activities under
its responsibility and did not give the Coordinating Committee for Oil Palm
the necessary support and authority to contribute effectively to sector
rehabilitation coordination. The committee in fact, only met during
supervising missions and never did carry out its assigned role of policy
advisor.
8.02         Bank Performance has been uneven, although a major effort was
undertaken to make the project effective and give it a good start. During
project implementation, supervision and follow-up at the Government and
project level were insufficient. As a result, corrective actions, such as for
transport, staffing and labor supply were not properly carried through.
Moreover, further reaching solutions should have been sought for alternative



- 12 -
on-lending arrangements for the participating companies when the financial
problems became apparent.
8.03         Sub-borrowers' Performance.  In general, the sub-borrowers
implemented the project efficiently and in a timely manner, with the exception
of the Lokutu factory rehabilitation by PLZ and the housing program by both
companies. The former was delayed because of PLZ'a re-evaluation of its
investment program and a misprocurement by PLZ due to its insistence to buy
from a particular supplier. Tne latter was the remtilt of the severe financial
constraints the companies were facing as a result of the depreciation of the
zaire.
8.04         Proiect RelationshiDs.  Of the co-financiers, ADF disbursed 98%
of its loan and CCCE disbursed the full amount expressed in FF (see table 6 of
Part III). Relationships with co-financiers have been weak, and supervision
teams rarely included representatives of co-financiers. Inter donor
deliberations were held initially during coordinating comm'ttee meetings, but
contacts became sporadic subsequently.
8.05         Consultant services.  The few consultant services employed have
been effective. The oil-palm studies, carried out as part of the Perennial
C:ops study by consultants, have been of excellent quality.

Schedule 1 in total 12 categories. The credit agreement was amended
at the date of effectiveness of March 6, 1981.
9/   The financing percentage has been changed in an amendment of 8.29.83
from 65% to 100% for foreign expenditures for training, and from 40%
to 100% for the pilot projects, because Government could not provide
under the then current economic circumstances the necessary funds.

6.  PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Proiect Costs
A table with the detailed actual cost of the project is not possible to
produce, since CCP and PLZ have not kept separate accounts of their own
contributions to the project. Even though it was possible for SOFIDE to
estimate with a certain degree of accuracy the overall project cost, breaking
this estimate down over the categories, would require so many assumptions,
that the result would become completely unreliabie. The latter especially in
light of the many changes that took place during project implementation.
Total project cost are estimated at US$33.9 million, as opposed to an
appraisal estimate of US$47.4 million.

13/  USS 520,000 was canceled due to t:he misprocurement of a boiler by PLZ
in December of 1985. CCCE provi6ed financing for this boiler instead.
At the time of the second extens.a n on December 3, 1986,
US$1,173,906.06 was canceled.  A  .crther US$868,847.17 was canceled on
October 20, 1988.
14/  Canceled loan because of a default o  the Government of Zaire on other
loans from B.DEA. Cancellation of th-s loan had no impact on the
project.
5/  In US dollar terms, CCCE disbursed less than estimated at appraisal.
In FF terms, CCCE disbursed the full amount agreed upon at appraisal.
The difference is due to the appreciation of the US Dollar vis & vis
most currencies in the period 1982-84.
1"/   In USS terms PLZ and CCP contributed less than anticipated to the
project. This discrepancy can be explained by the rapid depreciation of
the Zaire and the partial implementation of the construction program.

'9/  The contribution of the Government to the pro.Sect remained the same in
nominal terms, as axpected, but declLned in real terms due the

Underlying Assumiptions:
The economic price for palm oil was based on importing palm oil rather than
exporting, as Zaire is no longer a net exporter of palm oil and its domestic price is
no longer competitive. The economic farmgate price was estimated at US$227 in 1986.
The exchange rate used was based on the official exchange rate.
The yields per ha used were the same as those shown under the column "Appraisal" in
Table 7d.
The production costs per ton of palm oil are based on the average production cost
for a new, modern plantation in Zaire (Source: Perennial Crops Study). The official
exchange rate was used; at that time, this rate was close to the shadow exchange rate-

Implementation delays. This decrease in supervision contributed to the slow progress of the project. Table
