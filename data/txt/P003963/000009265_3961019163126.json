The objectives of PHRDP were\n            to improve: (a) human resource policymaking and planning;\n            (b) the quality of professional, technical and managerial\n            staff to ensure improved performance in policymaking and\n            implementation in critical areas of economic development\n            concerned with growth, with sustainable development,\n            industrialization, increasing private sector participation\n            and decentralization; and (c) the quality of scientific and\n            technological research and development, enhance its\n            management and improve the application of research and\n            technology to industrial development. Overall performance of\n            the Bank was satisfactory. Borrower Performance was quite\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            opening fellowships to private citizens would have probably\n            increased the impact of the fellowship; (ii) to recognize\n            the importance of open competition outside the civil\n            service; (iii) all resources went to overseas education,\n            even in situations where adequate programs had been\n            developed domestically; and (iv) to conclude, an expensive\n            overseas fellowship makes economic sense requires a finding\n            that the typical fellow will make a substantial impact on\n            the economy that will be sustained over a long period of time."}, "docdt": "1995-12-05T00:00:00Z"}
