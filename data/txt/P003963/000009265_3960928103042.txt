MEMORANDUM AND RECO*ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A PROFESSIONAL HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$117.5 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan woul have e term of 20 years, including 5 years
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  One of the critical factors for continued successful
implementation of Indonesia's development policies of growth, industrializa-
tion, privatization and decentralization will be the quality of higher level
professional and technical staff. Implementation of these policies calls for
important changes in the role of the civil service and new responsibilities,
skills and attitudes of civil servants. Another factor for successful indus-
trial development will be the efficiency of application of research and tech-
nology and effective links between government and the private sector.
3.       The main issues are:  (a) weaknesses in overall coordination of human
resource development policymaking and implementation; (b) shortages of high
level professional staff with skills and attitudes appropriate for the
changing role of government to implement successfully the Government's policy
agenda; (c) employment of relatively large numbers of expatriate consultants;
(d) shortages of well-qualified scientists and technologists for research,
development and application to support industrial development; (e) low
efficiency of staff utilization in the public sector and lack of career
development opportunities and incentives; (f) inadequate capacity of the
domestic university postgraduate system which is relatively new and small and
concentrated on the priority task of upgrading university teachers; and
(g) weaknesses in planning, implementation and monitoring of science and
technology research and development and absence of close links between
industry and government research.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project would complement Bank
support for deregulation, privatization and decentralization by providing well
trained and qualified staff to implement the policies at central, provincial
and local levels. The project would continue support for human resource
development and address outstanding policy and institutional issues to improve
the efficiency of high level professional and technical staff training and the
utilization of trained staff. The management of overseas training would also
be improved. The policy and institutional developments in science and
technology and the high level training of scientists, technologists and
managers would extend and improve the quality of research and development and
provide a foundation for increased application of technology in industry and
form an important counterpart to Bank support for industrial development.
5.       Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are:  to improve
human resource policy making, planning and implementation; improve the quality
of professional, technical and managerial staff and increase the efficiency of



- 2 -
their training and employment to ensure improved performance and policy making
and implementation in critical areas of economic development, and to improve
the quality of scientific and technological research and development, enhance
its management and improve the application of research and technology to
industrial development.
6.       Proiect Description.  The project would supportt  (a) improvements in
planning and management of human resource development (HRD) throught
(i) improving coordination of HRD planning and carrying out of policy studies
in BAPPENAS and strengthening HRD planning and implementation capacity at
provincial and local government levels: and tii) strengthening the Overseas
Training Office (OTO) through institutional and staff development, provision
of physical facilities and support for policy studies; (b) professional and
managerial staff development and training through. (i) an overseas
postgraduate fellowship training program administered by the OTO for about
1,100 key staff of central government agencies, provincial and local
government, private universities and N¢Os, focussed on public policy analysis,
sustainable development and environmental conservation, management and
administration of public institutions and public and private enterprises and
increasing the participation of women in trainingt and (ii) a program of about
300 fellowships for overseas and domestic postgraduate training administered
by the Ministry of Finance (MOP) in finance and monetary policy and related
fields for staff of the MOP, related agencies and relevant staff of other
ministriesi and (c) Science and Technology for Industrial Development (STAID)
through: (i) improvement in S&T policy analysis and strengthening of S&T
institutions through setting up a S&T policy unit, funding policy studies on
S&T research and priorities for S&T support to industrialization,
strengthening machinery for technical and economic analysis of research
projects and proposals, improving personnel management and career development,
establishing a research information system and studies to improve budgeting,
finance and administration of research inastitutes; and (ii) supporting 370
domestic and 780 overseas fellowships for staff of the government S&T research
institutes and strategic industries, in science, technology and management
including training in industry, cooperative programs of study and industrial
experience, and programs linking the research institutes, domestic
universities and overseas universities.
7.       The project is estimated to cost a total of US$168.8 million of which
US$117.5 is expected to be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank lean of
US$117.5 would finance 70? of the project cost net of taxes. Estimated costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of pro-
curement and the disbursement schedules are shown in Schedule B. The time-
table of key events in project processing is summarized in Schedule C. The
status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is shown in Schedule D. A map
showing the location of science and technology development is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
8.       Actions Agreed.  The following were agreeds  (a) a report would be
submitted to the Bank annually by December 31, commencing on December 31,
1990, on the implementation of fellowship training, including the training
programs; costs of training; selection, placement and reentry procedures; and
allocation of fellowships for academic qualificationt and domestic and overseas
training, and the Bank's comments would be taken into account; (b) the
follouing would be established by March 31, 1990: the Steering Committee for



- 3 -
Finance Training, the Finance Training PIU, and the STAID Implementation Team,
Projects Management Unit and Fellowships Management Unit, and staff would be
assigned to the units in accordance with agreed staff development plans;
(c) pending the establishment of the Committee, Teams and Units in 8(b) the
existing arrangements and staffing would be maintained; and (d) in accordance
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and with assistance of
external consultants, there would be a mid-term review of the implementation
of the project, and a report furnished to the Bank by September 30, 1992 on
the findings and recommendations, and thereafter taking into account the
Bank's comments, if any, the required adjustments would be made in the
implementation of the project to attain the agreed objectives.
9.       Benefits.  The principal benefit in the long-term would b- the
improvement in policy analysis and policy formulation and ii.proved performance
in planning and implementation of the programs which underpin Indonesia's
development strategy for growth, industrialization, privatization and decen-
tralization. Staff trained under the project would provide an important
source of future leaders of government and industry. The career structure for
scientists and technologists would be improved and enable full and effective
utilization of the high level staff trained under this and other projects.
The improved systems and procedures for science and technology policymaking,
and the identification of science and technology priorities for industrializa-
tion would be an important step towards effective development and application
of research and long-term technological development of industry. Another
important benefit would be the integration and improved management of high-
level staff development and coordination of overseas training to ensure more
efficient use of the funds available for training.
10.      Risk.  The main risk in investment in high level staff development is
the possibility that the expectations and potential of the overseas trained
professional staff might not be matched by employment opportunities, incen-
tives and rewards in government service. However, the close relationship
between selection and training and priority institutional needs and the steps
to improve career development opportunities would lessen this risk.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the ixecutive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
