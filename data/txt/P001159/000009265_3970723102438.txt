IVORY COAST
SECOND RIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:       The Republic of the Ivory Coast
Loan Amount:    US$110.0 million equivalent
Terms:          Standard
Co-Lenders:     APDB (US$50.0 million equivalent)
Commercial Banks (US$33.4 million equivalent).
Sector Program: The loan would support a three-and-a-half year
US$230.7 million equivalent Highway Sector Program
covering the period mid-1985 to end 1988. The program
would contain all road construction, upgrading,
strengthening, rehabilitation and maintenance works to
be undertaken by the Borrower In the program period on
the public road networac of the country, as well as
legislative and government measures destined to improve
the efficiency of the road transport industry and
encompass (i) investments in new road construction, and
in rural road upgrading and rehabilitation; (ii) a
proper level of routine and periodic maintenance of the
entire road network of the couutry; (iii) training of
road maintenance staff at all levels and the
introduction of persoDnel management systems for such
staff; (iv) legislative changes to deregulate the road
transport industry and provide it with a system of
freight allocation based on market force competition;
Cv) a program of enforcing vehicle load limits; and (vi)
the preparation of a national transport plan. The Loan
would provide financing for civil works by contract;
road maintenance works by force account through the
purchase of fuel, spare parts, materials and a limited
amount of equipment; and technical assistance and
consultants' services for road maintenance, personnel
management, deregulation and reform of the road
transport industry, enforcement of road traffic
legislation and the preparation of a national transport
plan.



- iv -
Benefits
and Risks:       Transport costs inside the Ivory Coast and for transit
to the adjacent cnuntries would be significantly reduced
through a decrease in vehicle operating costs,
improvement in competition among transporters, and
reduction in administrative constraints on road
transport. The program would consolidate the practice
of allocating resources in the highway sector in
accordance with priorities based on economic AnAlysis.
The main risks stem from political considerations
overriding economic ones in determining the selection of
program activities and the allocation of funds.
However, since investment and allocation criteria have
been agreed at negotiations, and Government counterpart
funding of road maintenance would be a condition for
utilization of the loan for purposes of new investments
in roads, this risk is considered acceptable.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ivory Coast has requested the Bank's
assistance in financing a three-and-a-half year follow-up project to the
ongoing First Highway Sector Loan (Loan 1914-IVC of Nov. 1980). The
proposed operation would cover the Government's entire highway
sub-sector program for the period mid-1985 to end 1988, comprising a
balanced program of new construction, rehabilitation, and periodic and
routine maintenance works, as well as a set of policy reforms and other
supporting measures to improve the overall management and efficiency of
the sub-sector.
1.02      During the implementation of the First Highway Sector Loan,
substantial advances have been made in investment planning and
execution. The emphasis of investments has gradually shifted towards
upgrading of secondary and feeder roads in support of agricultural
development, and preservation of the paved network. On the other hand,
the maintenance effort on the unpaved network has decreased over the
past few years due to reduced funding, lack of serviceable equipment and
inadequate management. Redressing this situation, improving the
efficiency of the country's road transport industry, and further
reinforcing the progress attained towards rational use of economic
criteria in selecting priorities in the roads sub-sector are essential
tasks in the years ahead. Hence the importance of Bank participation in
the sector. Equally important, continued Bank involvement would
contribute to maintaining prudence in the overall level of highway
investments in light of the country's macro-economic constraints, as
well as channeling and directing support of the international financial
community in the development of the sector.
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
2.01      The Ivory Coast, with a land area of 332,000 km 2, is situated
on the Gulf of Guinea. With f2w exceptions, the topography of the
country is flat or rolling, presenting few serious constraints to
transport development. Climate and vegetation vary considerably as a
function of rainfall from rain forests in the south to savannas in the
north.
2.02      Since independence in 1960, the Government has consistently
accorded a high priority to the improvement of transport infrastructure
in support of its agricultural development strategy. Durtng this 25-year
period the transport sector was allocated on average between 20 to 25Z
of all public investments. In the second half of the 1970's transport



- 2-
investments increased rapidly, reaching a peak of CFAF 95 billion (then
US$400 million equivalent) in 1978 at the height of the coffee and cocoa
boom. With the arrival of economic recession and increasing budgetary
stringency in the early 1980's, investment levels declined to about CFAF
40 billion (US$90 million equivalent) in 1984, roughly in line with the
overall decline in the public investment budget. The share of highways
in transport investments averaged 63% between 1973-83, while railways
and maritime transport received 12% esch and civil aviation 11%
(Annex 2-1).
2.03      The ambitious transport investment program of the late 1970's
turned out to be of mixed quality. A number of large scale investments,
particularly in highways and airports, were undertaken with expensive
commercial financing while yielding very low economic returns.
Furthermore, lax contracting procedures and inadequate supervision often
led to high unit costs. However, following the adoption by Government in
1981 of a financial and economic adjustment program, past excesses were
gradually reduced through the introduction of a more centralized and
tighter controlled investment selection and budgeting process, as well
as greatly improved contract administration. On the whole, the quality
of the investment program has improved over the past few years, at least
partially due to the fact that the principal and also least
discriminating source of funding ior transport investments -- external
commercial financing -- has largely dried up since 1982.
2.04      Following the massive transport investments of the past
decade, Ivory Coast currently boasts a modern and well developed
transport system by West African standards, comprising: (a) about
48,000 km of roads of which 3,620 km are paved; (b) two excellent
deepwater ports at Abidjan and San Pedro; (c) three international
airports at Abidjan, Yamoussoukro and Bouake, and 22 smaller airports
serving other towns; and (d) a 1,156 km regional railway line between
Abidjan and Ouagadougou in Burkina (630 km in Ivory Coast).  Abidjan,
the principal population and commercial center, remains the focus of the
transport system, with the country's principal port and airport, and
heavily trafficked trunk roads and the rail line radiating inland.
2.05      The inter-urban transport market is increasingly dominated by
road transport at the expense of rail transport. Roads currently
account for 92% of total freight traffic (in ton-km) and 90% of
passenger traffic (in passenger-km). The railway carries 7% of freight
traffic and 9% of passenger traffic, while domestic air transport
accounts for 1% of domestic passenger traffic (Annex 2-2).
2.06      Rail transport is provided by the Regie des Chemins de Fer
Abidjan-Niger (RAN), a bi-national enterprise owned by the Governments
of Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. International traffic currently
accounts for 88% of RAN's ton-km and 65% of its passenger-km,
underscoring the comparativxe advantage of the railway for long distance
transport of bulk commodities and low-income passengers, as well as the
importance of RAN for Burkina's external trade of which it carries
between 70 and 75%. RAN's domestic traffic within Ivory Coast and
Burkina is steadily decreasing as it is taken over by road transport
(Annex 2-3).



3-
2.07      RAN's performance has severely deteriorated in recent years
due in part to the conflicting pressures exerted on the enterprise by
the two countries. Its management has not performed well despite
considerable technical assistance provided under the Bank supported
First Regional Railway Project which was completed in 1983. RAN's
investment strategy favored new, in some instances unnecessary, capacity
investments over maintenance of existing assets. In operations,
loss-making higher class passenger services were given precedence over
more remunerative ordinary passenger traffic and freight transport.
Freight traffic declined from 750,000 tons in 1980 to 625,000 tons in
1983 (-17X), while over the same period passenger traffic declined from
4 million to 3.1 million passengers (-22Z). In addition, employment was
allowed to increase at a time when traffic went down, while tariff
adjustments lagged behind increases in operating costs. In 1983, there
was a net loss of CFAP 7.5 billion, about equal to one third of that
year's revenues. Restoration of RAN's efficiency would require decisive
reform measures, which are presently being discussed between the two
Governments, the Bank and other donors (Annex 2-4).
2.08      Of the two deep-water ports at Abidjan and San Pedro, the port
of Abidjan (PAA) is the country's main commercial port; It serves export
and import traffic for Burkina and Mali as well. The port's cargo
handling capacity came close to its limit in 1980 with traffic reaching
9.4 million tons. However, due to the economic recession, traffic
declined to 7.6 million tons (-19Z) in 1983. The port of San Pedro has
handled 1.3 million tons in 1983 (about one-third of its capacity),
90X of which were exports, particularly tiumber. With the recent opening
of a cement clinker grinding plant and a flour mill, as well as the
growing importance of agro-industrial plantations in the region, traffic
is likely to become more balanced in the future. The two ports are well
managed and well equipped with private companies performing all cargo
handling and stevedoring operations. The financial performance of PAA
has been satisfactory; it enjoys a low debt-equity ratio, and even with
the recent decline in traffic, its operating results remain positive.
However, like other public enterprises, it is subjected to a restrictive
financial and accounting regime. In the course of preparation of a
proposed Abidjan Port Project, the Bank has started discussions with
Government with a view to allow PAM to operate as a commercially
oriented public enterprise. PAA's traffic is shown in Annex 2-5 and
San Pedro's in Annex 2-6.
2.09      The development of a national maritime shipping capacity has
been accorded high priority by Ivory Coast and the country plays a
leading role among Third World countries promoting the so-called New
International Maritime Order. The Ivory Coast has successfully
negotiated bilateral agreements with its major trade partners for the
application of a 40-40-20 rule (cargo sharing scheme for liner shipping,
under which the national shipping companies of each trade partner would
transport 40X of cargo, and other international liners the remaining
20%). Already in 1979, the Ivorian flag carriers filled their 40X quota
for those commodities that were covered by the agreements.
2.10      The air transport network includes three international
airports at Abidjan, Yaioussoukro and Bouake, and 22 regional airports.
Since 1982 the airports are managed by the Agence Nationale des



- 4 -
Aerodromes et de la Meteorologie (ANAN), an autonomous publie
enterprise- ASECNA, the international agency Which operated the
airports previously, is now only responsible for flight control at the
Abidjan airport. AHAM revenues are insufficient to cover the operation
and maintenance costs of the airports and it receives Government
subsidies to cover the deficit.
2.11     Air traffic increased rapidly between 1973-80 at an average
annual rate of 17.1Z, reaching 1.1 million passengers in 1980, but has
stagnated since then. This progression, however, shows large
differentials by categories of traffic. Inter-African traffic shows
steady growth, While Intercontinental traffic stagnated between 1979-82
and domestic traffic developed erratically due to wide fluctuations in
tariffs. Freight traffic is about 30,000 tons per year, virtually all
international. Abidjan airport dominates air transport, accounting for
87Z of total passenger movements in 1983. Scheduled domestic flights
are provided by Air Ivoire, a Government-owned airline, managed and
operated by the mdlitary. Despite recent tariff increases, it operates
at a deficit, and is heavily subsidized through mlittary operational
support (flight crew salaries, etc.). Air traffic data are shown In
Annex 2-7.
2.12      The planning and management of the transport sector basically
comes under the purview of the MinTltere des Travaux Publics, de la
Construction, des Postes et des Telecommunications (1TPCPT), with the
exception of ports and shipping which are under the technical control of
the Minsitry of Marine, and Air Ivoire which is administered by the
Mi.nistry of Defense.
2.13     Up to 1980, the technical ministries and autonouous agencies
enjoyed considerable freedom in the preparation and execution of
investments as they had virtually independent access to external
financing. As part of the measures introduced in 1981 to control budget
expenditures and foreign debt, Goverment adopted two measures vhich had
an important bearing on the management of the transport sector. First,
it strengthened the role of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (REF) in
the investment decision-making process by giving it sole authority below
the President to procure and/or approve financing for projects proposed
by the technical ministries for inclusion in the three-year rolling
investment budget. This new policy proved significant in two respects:
(i) it restricted the freedom previously abused by technical agencies
and parastatals to contract directly with suppliers wbich offered their
own commercial credit, often under onerous financial conditions; and
(ii) it set the stage for MEF to curb past excesses in the selection and
design of projects through the requirement that in principle al1 project
proposals be supported by an economic justification. As a result, the
quality of the investment program has improved over the past few years.
The second measure consisted of the centralization of contracting and
supervision for major projects under a single entity, the Direction et
Controle des Grands Travaux (DCGTX), with the aim to reduce excessive
project costs caused by lax contracting procedures and administration in
the past. The DCGTX was in 1981 transferred from the MTPCPT to the
Presidency with the mandate to manage and execute, on behalf of
technical ministries and state enterprises, all civil works contracts
with a value above CFAF 700 million (US$1.4 million equivalent). DCGTX
rapidly developed into a well managed and efficient organization,



-5-
successfully bringing unit construction costs under control. Based on
its excellent record in comparison with other Government agencies, DCGTX
gradually expanded its field of activities in response to ad hoc
requests by the President and technical ministries.
2.14      Intermodal coordination has traditionally been weak in Ivory
Coast in the absence of a central planning and coordinating agency in
the sector. Following an internal reorganization of the NMPCPT in 1984,
a new Directorate of Studies and Programming (Direction des Etudes et
Programation, DEP) was established to play this role for the road, rail
and air transport modes.
B. The Road Transport Subsector
2.15      The road network of Ivory Coast currently consists of about
48.000 km of national (class A), regional (class B) and local (class C)
roads. The proportion of paved roads is still quite low at 8%
(3,620 km) of the network. Countries like Ghana and Senegal, which are
comparable in size but with much lower per capita incomes, have paved
road densities as a ratio of population that are equal to, or
substantially higher than, in Ivory Coast (Annex 2-8).
2.16      Inter-urban road transport in 1983 was estimated to total some
5.5 billibon passenger-km and 3.5 billion ton-km. A rough estimnate of
the corresponding total financial transport costs is about CFAF 185
billion, indicating that the roads subsector is an important consumer of
resources (GNP was about CFAF 3,100 billion in 1983). During the period
1975-83, passenger traffic increased by a3most 10% per annum and freight
traffic by about 12% per annum (Annex 2-2). Although no comprehensive
traffic counts were conducted during the period 1976-81, derived demand
i-dicators (notably fuel consumption) suggest that the growth in road
traffic was concentrated during the years 1976-80, after which traffic
declined probably by about 10-15X due to the combined effect of the
economic recession and high fuel prices . Preliminary results of 1984
traffic surveys sees to indicate a resumption in traffic growth; for the
rest of the 1980's it is reasonable, in line with previous experience,
to expect traffic to grow slightly faster than GDP, that is. 4-5% per
annum. The vehicle fleet size was about 150,000 units in 1983. As this
figure is based on cumulative new vehicle registrations adjusted by
theoretical scrapping rates, the estimate could be subject to a
considerable m-rgin of error. New vehicle registrations (about 12,000
per annum), currently are well below the level necessary to maintain the
present fleet size. Especially for trucks and semi-trailers, new
registrations have dropped to extremely low levels which might be an
indication that the trucking industry has started the process of
adjustment for present low fleet utilization (para. 2.32). Ultimately,
with the resumption of growth in transport demand, it is expected that
the vehicle fleet will show renewed growth. The development of the
fleet and vehicle registration statistics are presented in Annex 2-9.
2.17      Paved roads, although accounting for only 8X of the total
network, carry over 70% of total traffic. About 950 km of paved roads
have traffic levels in excess of 1,000 vehicles per day (vpd). Traff ic
is concentrated in the Abidjan, Daloa and Bouake regions and to a lesser
extent in the San Pedro region. Ivory Coast began its program of
building paved roads later than other countries in the region and a



- 6 -
number of roads with sufficient traffic to warrant paved standards still
exist in the country. The paved network has been expanded at the rate
of 300 km per annum between 1976-80 and by 135 km per annum between
1981-84. The relative slowdown in recent years is largely explained by
the need to reconstruct or strengthen older bituminous roads which had
come to the end of their useful life. During 1981-84, road strengthening
progressed at the rate of about 150 km per annum with Bank financing
under the First Highway Sector Loan. As a result of these efforts,
close to 50% of the bitumous network has a pavement age of less than 5
years; of the remanining, 250 km (7Z) are in poor condition, of which 210
km are currently being rehabilitated. Therefore, a resumption of the
paving effort of high-traffic gravel roads is now timely as contained in
the proposed sector program (para. 3.03). Additionally, the condition
of the unpaved rural roads has deteriorated substantially in recent
years due to a progressively declining maintenance effort. Therefore,
rehabilitation of the gravel and earth roads should also receive
priority over the coming years (para. 3.07).
2.18      Highway administration: The NTPCPT is responsible for the
design, construction and maintenance of roads, and the formulation of
road transport policy and regulations. It is supported in its tasks by
three autonomous agencies: the DCGTX; the Public Works Laboratory
(Laboratoire du Batiment et des Travaux Publics, LBTP); and the Road
Safety Office (Office de Securite Routiere, OSER). The MTPCPT has ten
central directorates, four of which are directly concerned with roads
and road transport; and seven regional directorates which are
responsible for the execution of road maintenance. The Directorate of
Roads (DR) is responsible for the preparation and execution of minor
investments (up to CFAF 700 million), and the formulation of maintenance
programs based on information provided by the regional directorates. It
undertakes the budgeting and monitors the implementation of the
maintena'ice program. The Equipment Directorate (Direction du Materiel
des Travaux Publics, DMTP) owns and maintains the road maintenance
equipment fleet, which is used by the regional directorates to execute
their maintenance tasks. The Directorate of Transport (Direction des
Transports, DT) is in charge of the monitoring of the road transport
industry through regulations and tariffs. The organization chart of
MTPCPT is presented in Annex 2-10.
2.19      Highway investment proposals are generated through a
collaborative effort between various agencies. Within the DR, the Road
Data Service (Service des Donnees Routieres, SDR), with the assistance
of the regional directorates, collects and analyses road inventory data,
and conducts vehicle traffic counts covering the national and regional
network. The LBTP maintains a condition inventory of the bituminous
network. On the basis of this, the DCGTX establishes a preliminary
listing of potential major projects and then carries out pre-investment
studies for each project to determine the optimal technico-economic
solution, and finally prepares or contracts out detailed engineering
studies and verifies the conclusions of the economic studies. DCGTX has
recently set up its own economic studies capability which allows close
integration with the technical design process through the use of
advanced computer facilities.  The planning methodology utilized has
been developed under previous highway projects and is satisfactory to
the Bank. The newly established DEP together with DR is responsible for
the preparation and analysis of other investments up to CFAF 700



-7-
million, as well as for the collection and coordination of road
transport investment plans prepared by other agencies (primarily DCGTX).
MEF checks the viability of the program proposed by the MTPCPT,
coordinates highway investments with those in other sectors of the
economy, and incorporates the result in the draft budget submitted to
Government for approval.
2.20      Design and construction of roads has undergone important
changes in recent years. A decade ago geometric design standards were
becoming increasingly excessive resulting in unjustified investments.
The trend has recently been reversed, with economic justifications
increasingly used for determining design elements such as design speeds
adapted to terrain conditions, and cross section geometry selected in
the light of expected maintenance costs. There is a very large body of
knovledge available in the LBTP and the DCGTX on road construction
materials and the performance experienced with different types of
design. The principal elements of present design practice are outlined
in Annex 2-11.
2.21      The geometric and structural design of roads and of all but
the largest drainage structures are now undertaken by the DCGTX which
designs part of the works itself and subcontracts the remainder to
private consulting firms. DCTGX is amply equipped for both design and
works supervision, with a staff of over 600 of which 120 are qualified
engineers. Materials research work is normally subcontracted to LBTP
which has a staff of similar size and quality.
2.22      Construction, major rehabilitation and strengthening of main
roads are done by contractors. A large number of vholly or partially
foreign-owned contracting firms are established in the country, with an
annual road construction capacity in excess of US$200 million
equivalent. The sharp decline in construction activity in recent years
has created a highly coWpetitive environment among these firms. A
contracting industry of small local firms engaged in road works has
developed only to a limited extent; they are mainly subcontractors for
the larger firms or are engaged in works of limited scope, mainly on
rural roads. Work supervision is the responsibility of the DCGTX for
large contracts (over US$1.4 million equivalent), and of the 1IPCPT's
regional offices, for smaller ones.
2.23      Rural roads improvements have traditionally been carried out
by force account. Maintenance is being carried out (i) under MTPCPT
management, by force account for routine maintenance of all roads and
periodic maintenance of gravel roads, and (ii) under DCGTX management,
by private contractors for periodic maintenance of bituminous surfaces.
2.24      Through the 1970's and early 1980's, road maintenance in the
Ivory Coast was among the best in Africa. Throughout this period there
was a steady increase in funds allocated to road maintenance, roughly in
step with the expansion of the road network, and management and
supervision of force account works were adequate. In the early 1980's,
supervision and management became increasingly lax and, after 1982,
maintenance funds first stagnated, then declined sharply. Faced with
this disappointing performance, the Government began to rely
increasingly on contracting for road maintenance, with Bank assistance
under the Feeder Roads and Highway Maintenance and First Highway Sector



- 8 -
Projects. Experience with this indicates that the local contractors are
suitable for constructing drainage works (culverts and small bridges)
but not for undertaking extensive regravelling programs, for whlch the
Government now intends to emphasize, once again, force account vorks
while addressing the deficiencies in m-nagement and supervision. This
seems a sensible approach since it had yielded satisfactory results
already for more than a decade in the past (para. 3.09).
2.25     The force account maintenance is organized through the seven
iTPCPT regional offices and carried out under 32 departmental services.
It covers the tasks of cleaming drainage stru,,tures, grading and
regravelling gravel roads, pothole repairs, patching of bituminous
surfaces and maiutenance of signalization.  Altogether, the MIPCTP has
a work force of some 6,200 persons and an equipment fleet of close to
900 major units for road maintenance works. Work is planned and
executed through the Directorate of Roads (DR). while equipment
asnagement and maintenance is divided between the DR for vehicles and
trucks and the Directorate of Public Works Equipment WHITP) for heavy
equipment. This division of responsibility has led to unnecessary
duplication of maintenance workshops at the regional level and a
corresponding number of superfluous administrative and mechanical staff.
The DMIP is equipped to carry out the full range of maintenance and
overhaul work in its central workshop in Abidjaan.  Moreover, with new
equipment financed under a concessionary loan from Japan and an
equipment rehabilitation effort well within the reach of the DHTP, there
will be little need during the program period for replacing and/or
reueving the equipment fleet which will have an average age of 5 years
In 1985. The regional offices check on their maintenance progress, in
particular equipment utilization, through a comprehensive cost
accounting system. The system is presently used predominantly to monitor
aaintenance works, but could, wlth little effort, be used also for work
planning purposes.
2.26     Training needs.Under the ongoing First Highway Sector Loan,
training is aimed at upgrading about 800 operational personnel of DR and
DIIP. Training is the responsibility of a joint venture of two local
Ivorian schools, called FORHAROUTE: Ecole Nationale Superieure des
Travaux Publics (ENSTP) and Institut National Superieur de
lVEnseignement Technique (INSET). At the end of the loan period
(mid-1986), the objectives are expected to be largely achieved. In
addition, 14 local training officers and instructors have been tralned,
existing facilities have been upgraded and equipped, and adequate
equipment allocated to the training.
2.27     Future training for DR and DMIP personnel will need to focus
on (i) the ERSTP engineering students in the field of road maintenance;
(ii) heads of departments, regional directors and engineers in
managerial and technical fields (road and equipment maintenance);
(iii) newly recruited personnel or personnel to be promoted to occupy
vacancies (mechanical technicians and foremen, and storekeepers) and to
replace a large number of middle level technicians and skilled workers
who will retire during the next few years (heads of brigades, operators,
mechanical foremen and mechanics); (iv) training officers assigned to
FORMAROUTE and local instructors; and (v) personnel to be assigned to
the new personnel unit created under the proposed project (para. 2.28).



-9-
2.28      In addition to training. personnel management needs
strengthening. Under the Administrative and Financial Directorate, a
Personnel Sub-Directorate is responsible for managing all DR and DMTP
personnel including training activities. This Sub-Directorate is
understaffed and can only handle matters of routine nature. In order to
improve this situation, a small personnel management unit will be
created under the DR Director and headed by an ENSTP engineer.
2.29       Road user taxatlon is based on considerations of general
revenue rather than on principles of cost recovery. The financing of
highway expenditures is therefore a function of overall resource
availability and of relative priority accorded to the sector. Available
data for 1982 suggest that total user charges were sufficient to cover
the short-run marginal costs of road use but that heavy vehicles are
making a largely insufficient contribution to the variable road costs
attributable to them. The principal user charge is taxes on motor fuels;
Ivorian fuel prices are among the highest in West Africa. Current pump
prices are: for premium gasoline CPAF 350 per liter (US$ 2.70 per
gallon) ; for regular gasoline CFAF 325 per liter (US$ 2.51 per gallon);
and for diesel CFAF 255 per liter (US$ 1.97 per gallon). Because of a
comprehensive tax reform implemented in March 1985 which also affected
various road user taxes, the 1982 results are valid as background only
and an updated analysis of road user charges is required before definite
conclusions can be drann on the user charge issue, and specific tax
measures recommmended to resolve identified deficiencies (para 3.11).
Estimated road user charges and costs for 1982 are presented in
Annex 2-12.
2.30      The financing structure of highway investments. which averaged
about CFAF 45 billion between 1978 and 1983, has undergone a marked
shift towards foreign borrowing. While in 1978, Government's own funds
accounted for 68Z, the situation completely reversed in subsequent years
due to the drying up of cocoa and coffee surpluses, and increased
recourse to foreign commercial credit. In 1981, own funds contributed a
mere 17% while commercial credits accounted for 67Z and official aid for
16Z. In 1983, as a result of increasing limitations on commercial
credit, its share fell to 52Z while that of official aid rose to 292 (of
which 24Z Bank) and own funds accounted for 19Z. Considering that the
tax element in highway investments averages about 25Z, the net
contribution of Government has become negative in recent years.
Maintenance operating costs are financed through a Road Maintenance Fund
(PERJ, which is replenished by periodic transfers from the general
budget. Most salaries and administrative overheads are met from the
general budget, while major purchases of masntenance equipment and major
rehabilitation contracts are funded through the investment budget.
After 1981. allocations to the FER have declined in absolute terms,
amounting in 1985 to only CFAF 6.8 billion or 351 below the desirable
level of CFAF 10.4 billion. The evolution of the highway investments
financing structure and of maintenance funding levels are shown in
Annex 2-13 and Annex 2-14, respectively.
2.31      The road transport industry is dominated by a large number of
small, privately-owned companies, typically operating 1 to 5 vehicles.
Virtually all common carriers are members of the National Union of
Transporters, which, through its local chapters, exerts considerable
influence over the transport market (para. 2.32). To enter road



- 10 -
transport, a number of Government regulations (e.g. transport
authorizations, tariffs, freight documentation and route selection) have
to be complied with, which, in practice, are inconsistently enforced.
Furthermore, the numerous and uncoordinated road blocks set up by
various government agencies (police, customs, Ministries of Agriculture
and Mines) along the country's main routes result in considerable time
delays and additional expenses for transporters.
2.32      The present freight marketing system is not well developed. A
National Center of Freight Bureaus (Centre National des Bureaux de
Fret, CNBF) intended, inter alia, to provide freight-brokerage services,
is in the process of liquidation. The absence of an efficient system of
local freight bureaus has permitted the development of monopolistic
practices by transporters with the local chapters of their union
controlling supply of transport capacity. This has resulted in limited
supply and high freight rates for short distance transport, and excess
supply for long distance transport, as truckers have problems in
obtaining return loads in areas which are not controlled by their own
union chapters. This situation is, at least partly, reflected in the
low utilization of the trucking fleet. Fleetwide average annual Mileage
is estimated at only 37,000 km compared to a more normal average of
50-60,000 km. There is therefore considerable scope for raising vehicle
utilization; poteutial savings to the economy from improved fleet
productivity could well be in the order of US$10-20 million per annum.
Further, with the prevailing monopolistic practices and the restrictive
regulatory regime, it may well be that reduced transport costs as a
result of road improvements are not fully passed on to users and may
therefore not have the anticipated development iwpact; hence the need
for reforms in the regulatory and freight allocation systems
(para 3.11). A more detailed analysis of the road transport industry is
presented in Annex 2-15.
2.33      Whereas enforcement of legal axle load limits was discontinued
in 1981* available information suggests that overloading of trucks is
videspread. To avoid damage to the network, a systematic control of axle
loads should be reinstituted (para. 3.12).
C. Bank Involvement in the Highway Subsector
2.34      Since 1968. the Bank Group has lent a total of US$223 million
for seven projects in the highway subsector in the Ivory Coast. Under
the First Highway Project (Ln. 542-IVC, US$5.8 million, 1968) a
UNDP-financed transport sector survey was carried out by consultants
with the Bank as executing agency. This survey concluded that priority
should be given to highway development and called for an extensive
program to upgrade primary roads and to improve the capacity to plan and
execute road maintenance. The subsequent four highway projects (Second
Highway Project, Ln. 761-IVC, US$20.5 million, 1971; Third Highway
Project, Ln. 837-IVC, US$17.5 million, 1972; Fourth Highway Project,
Cr. 406-IVC, US$7.5 million, 1973; and Fifth Highway Project,
Ln. 1161-IVC, US$43.0 million, 1975) were designed to meet these
priorities. The construction components of these projects were generally
satisfactorily completed, but efforts to build an efficient maintenance
organization did not produce lasting results. However, there were
important advances in building up of local transport planning capability
(Project Performance Audit Report No.3665 of October 28, 1981).



- 11 -
2.35      Currently, the Bank has two ongoing highway operations; the
Feeder Roads and Highway Maintenance Project (Lu. 1501-IVC,
US$29.0 million, 1977) and the First Highway Sector Loan (Ln. 1914-IVC,
US$100 million, 1981). The results achieved under the Feeder Roads and
Highway Maintenance Project have been rather negative due to: (a)
significant delays in project execution and serious shortfalls in
production targets; and (b) persistent severe weaknesses in the
administration of force account works and in the control of loan funds
for this purpose. The disappointing performance of the unit responsible
for road betterment works prompted the Government to dissolve it in 1982
and increase the use of private contractors in this type of works. It
emerged that the choice of the most suitable mode of execution depends
on the type of works to be performed, contractors being preferable for
drainage works and force account for regravelling (para 2.24). The
project is expec.ed to be completed by mid-1985.
2.36      After a slow start, activities financed by the First Highway
Sector Loan gradually picked up in 1983 and 1984. Available loan funds
were virtually committed by the end of 1984 and final disbursements are
expected by mid-1986. The DCGTX showed itself to be very efficient in
the handling of contracts for civil works, which with few exceptions,
were completed on time and within budgets. Institutional development,
in particular investment planning and road maintenance manpower
training, has also progressed satisfactorily. A major step forward was
Government acceptance of the concept that highway investments should be
based on sound economic and engineering criteria, including the flexible
application of design standards. On the other hand, maintenance efforts
have in recent years declined below acceptable levels due to reducad
funding and deteriorating management.
2.37      The Bank role in the highway sub-sector has been expanded
through the use of the sector loan concept. This has provided the
vehicle for a much broader and intensive dialogue than possible under
conventional projects, and stimulated the Government to make substantial
improvements in the management of the sub-sector. Continued Bank
involvement on a subsector-wide basis would therefore be justified and
would contribute to s.rengthening the Government's resolve to
(a) consolidate and further expand on advances made in investment policy
formulation; (b) restore maintenance funding and capacity to adequate
levels; and (c) address important non-investment policy issues such as
road transport regulations, traffic control, road user charges and
manpower development.
III. THE SECTOR PROGRAM AND LOAN
A.  Program Objectives and Description
3.01      The main thrust of the Government's 1985-88 program for the
road sector is to selectively expand and improve the road network, to
improve maintenance and management of the highway system, and to enhance
the overall efficiency of the sector. Major features of this would be
to (i) insure that resources made available to the sector are used with
maximm efficiency; (ii) accord priority to road maintenance and to
feeder roads works in support of agricultural development; (iii) improve
the enforcement of traffic legislation; and (iv) deregulate and open the



- 12 -
markets for the road transport industry in order to lower the cost of
public road transport.  To this end the proposed loan would be used to
help finance a three-and-a-half year national program l/ of
expenditures on the country's entire public inter-urban road network
for:
(a) highway investments to be selected on the basis of agreed
technical and economic criteria; (53.9%)
(b) periodic and routine road maintenance of the road
network, including deferred periodic maintenance of
gravel-surfaced roads; (44.7%)
(c) training of the highway personnel in MIPCTP in road
maintenance planning, execution and supervision; (0.3%)
(d) technical and organizational assistance to improve the
efficiency of the road transport industry; (0.1%)
(e) enforcement of road traffic legislation and policy;
(0.6%) and
(f) the preparation of a national transport plan. (0.4Z)
3.02      Activities Financed.  The proposed Loan would be used to
finance expenditures as follows:
(a) for road construction and improvement: the cost of a
number of sub-projects for road construction and improvement,
all of which would yield satisfactory economic results. An
initial program for execution during the project period
has been selected, but may be amended from time to time
provided that all sub-projects meet agreed selection criteria.
(b) for road maintenance: periodic maintenance of bituminous
roads by contract, and a part, declining through the program
period, of the incremental cost over present levels of
expenditures of the Government's force account program of
routine and periodic maintenance, including a regravelling
program for feeder roads; and supervision of all road
maintenance.
(c) for training of the road maintenance staff: the cost of
technical assistance and a limited amount of equipment to
FORMAROUTE, and technical assistance to the DR.
1/   The relative share of expenditures (including non-incremental
expenditures for maintenance) are shown in brackets.



- 13 -
(d) for improving the efficiency of the road transport
industry: the cost of consulting services and technical
assistance.
(e) for the enforcement of road traffic legislation: the cost
of rehabilitation of weighbridges and organization and
execution of an axle load control program.
(f) for establishment of a national transport plan: the cost
of provision of consultant's services.
B. Road Construction and Improvement Program
3.03      Investment ceilings. The indicative program of investments for
construction and improvements in the road sector, during the program
period, has been discussed and agreed with the Government. It has been
established taking into account the needs of the sector (paras 2.16 and
2.17) and prevailing macroeconomic constraints. Covering all investments
in the sector for the period, it entails investments of CFAF 8.0 billion
for the second %alf of 1985, CFAF 23.5 billion for 1986, CFAF 25.4
billion for 1987 and CFAF 14.7 billion for 1988, all in constant 1985
prices. Th=c ievels will be updated yearly between the Bank and the
Government in light of the country's economic situation. During
negotiations, the indicative program and the review procedure for
possible .rnnual adjustments were confirmed with the Government.
Government also agreed that in annual budgeting of funds for the road
sector, funding of maintenance would take precedence over new
investments.
3.04      Selection criteria.  Within this over-all framework, the
selection criteria to be used for individual sub-projects have also been
discussed and agreed. The criteria are similar to those developed under
the First Highway Sector Loan, with a minimum acceptable economic rate
of return for any individual sub-project of 12%, except in the
economicaUly disadvantaged northern part of the country vhere a minimum
rate of 1OZ will apply. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government that it will undertake no road investments that do
not meet the agreed criteria (Annex 3-1).
3.05      Design standards will be those adopted by the Govermment and
selected on the basis of economic and cost criteria (para. 2.20). Where
traffic volumes do not yet justify imediate paving, alignments and
cross sections will be constructed to allow paving later, in accordance
with those standards. Standards for strengthening of existing roads
involve structural reinforcement only, with no changes in geometric
standards. Standards for rehabilitation of feeder roads involve the
provision of a 4.5 - 6.0 m wide surface in selected gravel or laterite,
the width to be determined as a function of traffic volumes. The
standards, which have been discussed and agreed with the Government,
were confirmed during negotiations (Annex 3-2).
3.06      Over the three-and-a-half year period, the present programming
calls for construction of about 875 km of new bitumen roads, about 200
km of new gravel roads, and a key bridge crossing. The composition of



- 14 -
the program would be reviewed annually in the light of work progress on
on-going subprojects and of updated road sector developments. This was
confirmed with the Government at negotiations.
C. Road Maintenance Program
3.07      The maintenance program covers the entire network of roads
classes A, B and C (para 2.15). The present condition of roads classes A
and B (both bitumen and gravel surfaced) is in general good enough for
deferred maintenance and rehabilitation not to be required. The rural
roads in class C are in considerably varying condition and their
maintenance will contain rehabilitation of earthworks and structures as
required. The program insures periodic maintenance of bitumen roads by
contract, and force account maintenance of bitumen and gravel roads in
the form of bitumen patchings, shoulder repair, drainage cleaning and
grading of gravel surfaces at intervals determined in relation to
traffic intensity. This will contain a total of 45,000 km of routine
maintenance, including 90,000 m2 of bitumen surface patching,
1.7 million m3 of regravelling on the class A and B network, and
2.6 million m3 of regravelling on the class C network. This program
would result in regravelling a total of about 4,200 km of gravel roads
annually, composed of 1,400 km of primary and secondary (class A and B)
and 2,800 km of feeder (class C) roads. The regular regravelling will
be supplemented by reconstruction of bridges, culverts and other
drainage structures, to materially improve all-weather capability of
feeder roads where passage is impeded by flooding during the rainy
season.
3.08      Periodic maintenance of bitumen roads is done on the basis of
technical and economic justifications; planning of the road maintenance
works in force account has been done on the basis of (i) forecast
development of the network and rates of deterioration over time related
to traffic volumes and climatic conditions, and (ii) improved rate of
equipment utilization reaching 1,200 hours/year. Provided that this can
be achieved, all maintenance needs can be met by the own forces of the
Directorate of Roads supported by the equipment maintenwnce facilities
of the DMTP. With the recently purchased road equipment from Japan
(US$ 25 mlllion equivalent), and a limited amount of rehabilitation of
existing equipment, there will be no or only minimal requirement during
the project period for additional equipment.
3.09      The MTPCPT has the organizational and personnel framework as
well as the necessary equipment, to carry out the required volume of
maintenance works now planned in force account. Work efficiency will be
ensured by greatly strengthening supervision which was previously
deficient (para 2.24) through independent monitoring and reporting by
DCGTX. Yearly reviews between the Government and the Bank of
maintenance performance and prograuming will be carried out to identify
any corrective action required. The domestic construction industry will
be strengthened through their participation _ the bridge and culvert
reconstruction program (para. 3.07). The choice of executing most road
maintenance by force account has been discussed and agreed with the
Government. The maintenance planning, review, execution and supervision
arrangements were confirmed at negotiations.

D. Training Program
3.10      The training program will have as primary function to prepare
present staff of the NTPCPT to take over the functions of about 200
supervisors, mechanics and operators that are expected to retire during
the program period, and to insure continuous recycling of staff to
conserve their skills. The program will have two main thrusts : (i) to
continue and complete the program embarked upon by FORMAROUTE under the
First Highway Sector Loan; abd (ii) to insure that subsequent training
is properly planned for the needs of road maintenance and carried out in
a cost-effective manner making optimum use of existing facilities both
inside and outside the MTPCPT.  For these purposes, FORMAROUTE will be
restructured and become the fourth specialized school under the National
Public Works School (ENSTP). The training program is integrated with a
program to recruit capable staff from inside and outside the hTPCPT. It
is estimated that all regional (civil and mechanical) engineers and cost
accountants will receive 1 to 2-week refresher courses annually; while
about 40 field supervisors, brigade chiefs, foremen and operators will
receive 2-6 months of basic training annually; and 22 workshop heads and
chief mechanics will go through 2-year courses of basic training. In
addition, all specialized staff would go through 1-week refresher
courses yearly. The personnel management function of the MTPCPT will
also be strengthened to provide integration of training coordination and
career development for road maintenance staff. During negotiations the
training program was agreed with the Government. Annex 3-3 contains the
detailed training program.
E.  Road Transport Industry Program
3.11      A program of reforms will be introduced to deregulate and
enhance the efficiency of the road transport industry, and ensure that
road investments significantly induce economic development. This would
include: (i) making the issuance of road transport authorizations
contingent only on professional competence and the possession of a valid
commercial registration; (ii) replacing mandatory tariffs by a system of
recommended (reference) tariffs, based on road conditions and weight or
volume of commodities transported; (iii) abolishing the obligatory bill
of lading (lettre de voiture) for all national road transport; (iv)
completing the liquidation of the CNBF; (v) reducing the number of road
blocks for the control of road transport by 60 to 70% nationwide; and
(vi) carrying out a feasibility study of a pilot freight bureau project
involving two or three cities. During negotiations, the Government
indicated that the requirement for bills of lading has been abolished
and the CNBF has been dissolved, and agreed that formal confirmation of
these steps having been taken will be a condition of Loan effectiveness.
During negotiations the Government also agreed to (a) change the
regulation of road transport authorizations not later than June 30,
1987, (b) replace mandatory tariffs with recommended tariffs by June 30,
1986 for all commodities except coffee, cocoa, fuel, cement, cotton,
rice, fertilizer and sugar, and by December 1987 submit to the Bank a
timetable for eliminating mandatory tariffs on these commodities, (c) by
December 31, 1985 largely reduce the number of road blocks, (d) by
December 31, 1986 submit to the Bank a feasibility study for a freight
bureau pilot project, (e) and by June 30, 1987 submit to the Bank a road
user charge study, including recommended measures to correct identified
deficiencies in the user charge structure.

F. Enforcement of Road Traffic Legislation
3.12      The present pervasive overloading of trucks requires improved
enforcement of axle load limitations to diminish premature damage to
road surfaces and structures and avoid excessive wear and tear on
vehicles. The axle load controls that were abandoned some years ago
(para 2.33) will be resumed and the uumber of load checkpoints increased
to eleven from the present nine inoperative points. New equipment
costing about US$ 0.5 million equivalent would be installed, and the
operation of the checkpoints would cost some US$2.2 million during the
three-and-a-half year program period, including equipment maintenance
and personnel costs. During negotiations, this was confirmed with the
Government.
G. National Transport Plan
3.13      The national transport plan to be established under the
program will cover (i) intermodal planning including international
traffic and container movements; (ii) investment programming;
(iii) recommendations for improvements in the management and operations
of agencies and enterprises active in the sector; and (iv) review and
analysis of the transport pricing policies of all transport modes.   The
Government has prepared a detailed study proposal which is acceptable to
the Bank. During negotiations the objectives of the Plan were confirmed
and agreement was reached that the study would be submitted to the Bank
by December 31, 1987 and its agreed recommendations thereafter
implemented in accordance with a timetable established by the Government
and agreed to by the Bank.
H. Cost and Financing
3.14      The Loan will help finance components with a total cost
estimated at US$230.7 million equivalent, of which 46% is foreign
exchange costs and 54Z is local costs including 5% of taxes and duties.
The estimate is based on February 1985 costs and expressed in current
prices, considering price increases for local costs of 5% for civil
works and 7% for other items annually, and for foreign costs of 5% in
1985, 7.5Z in 1986, and 8% annually thereafter and excludes the present
level of Government funding for maintenance (about US$77 million
equivalent over the program period). Contracts for civil works will be
exempt from the customary value added tax of 25Z, and the estimate only
includes those taxes and duties that will actually be paid on civil
works, goods purchases and services, and are estimated at about 5%. The
cost of technical assistance and consulting services is based on current
rates observed in the Ivory Coast. During negotiations, the cost
estimate was discussed and agreed with the Government. Annex 3-4
cottains detailed cost estimates and Annex 3-5 the financing plan.
3.15      The program will be financed by a $110.0 million equivalent
loan from IBRD, US$50.0 million equivalent from APDB and US$37.3 million
equivalent from Government.  This presently leaves a financing gap of
US$33.4 million which is proposed for cofinancing by commercial banks
under a B-type loan. The Bank participation in the B-type loan in an
amount of up to US$10.0 million would be funded from the proceeds of the
proposed IBRD loan. The Government's contribution will be in addition



- 17 -
to its present annual level of about US$ 22 million of financing for
road maintenance expenditures.  Durlng negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government on a complete financing plan and on the
Government according priority, within its agreed funding, to the timely
and complete funding of its obligations to the rpad maintenance
programs, as a condition for approval of any new investment
sub-projects. The annual estimated funding needs for these maintenance
programs for the period mid-1985 through 1988 are shown in Annex 2-14.
I. Implementation
3.16      The program will be implemented under the responsibility of
the DCGTX. The road investment program will be carried out by
contractors under direct supervision of the DCGTX. The road maintenance
program will be carried out by force account by the MTPCPT through the
DR and DMITP, and will also be supervised by the DCGTX. The practices and
reporting details of this supervision were agreed with the Government
during negotiations. Training will be implemented through FORMAROUTE
under the ENSTP, and training coordination and personnel management will
remain the responsibility of the DR training officer. The pilot study of
freight bureaus will be done by DCGTX assisted by consultants. The
program of enforcement of axle load legislation will be initiated and
executed for two years by DCGTX, then transferred to the NTPCPT. The
preparation of the national transport plan will be done by the DCGTX
assisted by consultants. Preparation is completed for the road
investment program for 1985/86, the outline of the maintenance program,
and the training and axle load legislation enforcement components. The
monitoring and reporting schedule for road maintenance is shown in Annex
3-6, and the program implementation schedule in Annex 3-7; their
contents were discussed and agreed with the Government during
negotiations.
J. Procurement
3.17      Procurement will be in accordance with Bank guidelines;
amounts and methods are given in the table on the following page.
3.18      Standard procurement documents for civil works have been
reviewed and agreed with the Government. All civil works contracts
above US$6.0 million equivalent, and contracts for goods and materials
except: fuels above US$300,000 equivalent, will be on the basis of ICE
procedures that are acceptable to the Bank. Contracts below these
levels and contracts for fuel will be let according to LCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank. The rather high LCB-ICB cut-off point for civil
works is explained by the fact that the Ivorian environment, with about
16 foreign contractors permanently based in the country, is highly
competitive. Based on past experience, it may be assumed that
contractors not based in Ivory Coast are unlikely to be attracted to
compete for contracts of less than US$6 million. Also mitigating in
favour of a high cut-off point are the facts that LCB may be
internationally advertised, is open to outside foreign contractors
without restrictions, and that the only significant difference between
ICB and LCB is the currency of payment, for LCB mandated as the CFAF
which is a currency freely convertible into French Francs. Purchases of
proprietary spares for equipment upkeep under the road maintenance



- 18 -
program vill be directly from authorized dealers. Bank flnaced
contracts over US$1.0 million equivalent will be subject to prior Bank
review and approval, which will cover nearly 85Z of all Bank financed
contracts.  Other contracts will be subject to selective post-award
review. During negotiations. confirmatio. of these procurement
arrangements including lnternational advertising for LCB for civil works
was obtained from Government.

K. Disbursements
3.19     Disbursements from the Loan will be made as shown below.
Disbursements for civil works and consulting services would be on the
basis of contracts approved by the Bank. Individual disbursements would
be above US$50,000 equivalent each. Disbursements for highway mainten-
ance expenditures would be against purchases of fuel, spares and
materials. In order to expedite the flow of disbursements, a Special
Account would be established in the Caisse Autonoue d'Amortissements
(C&A). Ak advance of CFAF 1.0 billion would be made by the Bank in the
Special Account representing about four months' foreseen needs for
external financing of the maintenance program at the start of



- 19 -
implementation. The Governmeut's part of eligible expenses for fuel and
spare parts would be disbursed through the Treasury in accordance with
current practices, which are acceptable to the Bank. CA& would effect
the payment of the Bank-financed share up to agreed annual limits from
the Special Account only after documenta-y proof that the Government's'
share has been paid; each payment would be fully supported by certified
SOE's. The M)PCPT would be responsible for preparing SOE's and all
supporting documents and the Treasury will v-:rify and authorize the
payment. The advance to the Special Account would be made after the
declaration of loan effectiveness.  Applications for replenishment of
the advance to the Special Account would be made on a monthly basis or
whenever payments are in excess of CFAF 250 million.  Agreement was
reached during negotiations on the operation of the revolving fund; the
establishment of the Special Account will be a condition of
effectiveness. External auditors acceptable to the Bank will be engaged
to carry out specific yearly audits of the Special Account. During
negotiations, agreement was reached on the auditing arrangements.
Disbursements above a ceillng of US$27.0 milllon will only be made once
the loan agreement with the AFDB has become effective.

3.20      The standard disbursement profile for highway projects in the
West Africa Region indicates that an eight-year period is required to
obtain full disbursement, but the profile pertains to conventional
project lending and is not considered appropriate for the proposed
project. Given the experience under the First Highway Sector Loan and
the advanced level of preparation of subprojects. the proposed Loan is
expected to be fully disbursed after four and a half years. This makes
allowance for a one-year delay in project execution. The proposed Loan
closing date is December 31, 1989. The estimated disbursement schedule
is presented in Annex 3-8.
IV. ECNONMC EVALUATION
A. Assessment of Program Benefits
4.01      DCGTX has carried out an economic evaluation for most road
works in the proposed construction and rehabilitation program. The
procedures and methodology applied were those agreed under the First
Highway Sector Loan and further developed and refined during project
preparation. The cost estimates are based on detailed engineering
studies and the benefits, depending on the specific subproject,
primarily consist of savings in vehicle operating costs from existing
traffic, and diverted or generated traffic, Where applicable.
Additional benefits derive from road maintenance cost and time savings,
reduced road accideuts, and, in specific cases (i.e. when permanent road
access is provided to hitherto isolated areas), benefits from generated
agricultural development. Traffic levels and vehicle composition are
determined by a country-wide system of traffic counting stations,
supplemented by specific traffic counts and origin-destination surveys
as required. Vehicle operating cost tables are being updated and
refined by DCGTX on the basis of local surveys to better estimate
vehicle speeds and fuel consumption under various road conditions in
Ivory Coast. The proposed introduction of the Highway Design Model
(HD() developed by the Bank would permit further refinement in this
area. The minimm economic return for subprojects to be included in the
program is established at 12%, with 10X for the least developed regions
in the northern part of the country. At negotiations, the economic
evaluation procedures and methodology, as well as the criteria to be applied
in the annual updating of the highway investment program, were confirmed
(para 3.04).
4.02      The investment components of the sector program for the period
mid-1985 to end-1988 that lend themselves to quantitative economic
anAlysis, i.e., new construction, paving and major rehabilitation works,
account for 83Z of total program costs. Of these, the subprojects
already evaluated and likely to start during the first year of the
program make up 44Z and have a weighted average economic return of 21%
(Annex 4).
4.03      The maintenance component of the program (13% of program
costs) providing for additional funding for routine and normal periodic
(regravelling) maintenance has not been subjected to a separate economic
analysis; however, road maintenance costs have been included in the
economic evaluation of subprojects. Roads are to be maintained in



- 21 -
accordance with agreed criteria (primarily as a function of traffic
levels) to ensure that they will continue to have the standards to which
they were constructed. Experience from similar Bank programs suggests
that coordinated measures to increase the efficiency and coverage of
maintenance operations, yield a high return, normally in excess of 30Z.
4.04      The economic assessment of the software components, that is,
the technical assistance and training elements, and other special
components, accounting for 4Z of program costs, is more complex and, by
necessity, of a qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. The
training program for road maintenance staff has been designed as a
follow-up to, and using the experience gained under, the First Highway
Sector Loan, and it is expected to substantially improve the efficiency
of the maintenance organization.
4.05      The special software components include some items that are
well defined and straightforward, such as the axle load control program
and the strenghtening of DCGTX's data processing facilities, while the
proposed pilot freight bureau project has only been defined at the
conceptual stage and would be further developed during project
implementation. The National Transport Plan Study would permit the
Government to make a comprehensive assessment of the medium and long
term investment needs of the transport sector, as well as identify and
address important institutional, management and intermodal policy
issues. All these items are aimed at achieving either an increased
understanding of the transport sector or an improved operation of tne
same, and are therefore considered well worthwhile.
B. Assessment of Risk
4.06      The sector program has been designed with a view to carefully
balance allocations to new investments, rehabilitation and maintenance,
raking into account, on the one hand, present economic circumstances of
Ivory Coast and outlook for the next four years, and, on the other hand,
the absorptive capacity of the executing agencies and the construction
industry. One risk to the project is that if the economy does not
improve at the rate predicted, further restrictions on road investments
might be required, delaying and cutting the investment program.
However, the impact of such a measure on the viability of the program
would not be very great as road works are programed in relatively short
segments so that new subprojects can relatively easily be postponed
while priority is given to timely completion of ongoing investments, so
that at least their benefits can be realized without delay. Indeed, the
sector loan format affords sufficient flexibility to respond to changing
investment requirements during critical periods. The potential effect on
loan disbursements of a cut-back In the investment program has been
taken into account in the disbursement estimates through the application
of a delay factor in program execution.
4.07      Another risk to the project concerns the possibility that
maintenance targets are not achieved, either due to a shortfall in
Government funding or because expected improvements in efficiency do not
materialize. To minimize such risks annual budget review procedures
have been set vhich would allow the Bank to support the executing
agency's request for sufficient budgetary levels, if necessary, at the
expense of budget allocations for new investments (para 3.03). With



- 22 -
respect to a shortfall in operational efficiency, the project component
has been designed to minimize this risk by giving an independent agency
with proven record on quality control, the DCGTX, a monitoring and
supervising role in the physical implementation of the  aintenance
component.
4.08      One uncertainty is the extent to which the Bank will be able
to Influence sector policies. However, over the past few years, as part
of the country's overall Structural Adjustment Program, the Government
has shown its commitment to institutional and policy reforms that are
geared to greater efficiency of its economy. Furthermore, the project's
broad coverage and level of Bank participation should permit a
continuous and intensive dialogue on major policy issues and monitor
progress in the adoption of appropriate measures.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, in addition to standard covenants,
agreement was reached on the following points:
(a)  the total level of investments in new road construction during
the program period, and the yearly review procedure of this
level (para 3.03);
(b) the selection criteria for new road investments (para 3.04);
(c) the design standards to be employed (para 3.05);
(d) the present tentative composition of the investment program
(para 3.06);
(e) the road maintenance planning, review, execution and
supervision arrangements (paras 3.08 and 3.09);
(f) the training program (para 3.10)i
(g) (i) the dates by which the Government will take the legal
steps to change the regulation on transport authorizations,
and the tariff system, (ii) the date by which the number of
road blocks will be significantly reduced; and, (iii) the
terms of reference and tiaiug of the pilot freight bureau
study (para 3.11);
(h) the date by which a road user charges study will be carried
out and measures recommended to correct identified
deficiencies in the structure of road user charges (para
3.11);
(i)  the introduction of enforcement of axle load limitations
(para 3.12);
(j)  proposal for and schedule of the national transport plan
(para 3.13);



- 23 -
(k) the cost estimates and financing plan and the priority accord-
ed to road maintenance in the allocation of funds (para 3.14
and 3.15);
(1) the monitoring and reporting requirements and the
implementation schedule (para 3.16); and
(m) proposed procurement methods (para 3.18) and disbursement and
auditing procedures (para 3.19).
5.02      Dtiring negotiations, the Government agreed to the following
conditions of Loan effectiveness:
(a) the establishment of the Special Account (para 3.19); and
(b) confirmation that (i) the National Center of Freight Bureaus
has been dissolved; and (ii) bills of lading for domestic road
transport are no longer required (para 3.11).
5.03      Disbursements above a ceiling of US$27.0 million will only be
made once the AfDB loan agreement has become effective (para 3.19).
5.04      The proposed highway sector program is technically and econom-
ically sound and is suitable for a loan of US$110 million equivalent on
standard terms.

ANNEX 2-15
Page 1 of 5
IVORY COAST
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
Road Transport Industry al
1.        Private (i.e., transport of own goods) and public road
transport of goods in Ivory Coast is subject to Government
authorization, the ultimate objective of which is to control the total
capacity and composition of the vehicle fleet. Authorization is
required for all vehicles with a total weight (including load capacity)
of 4 tons or more. The authorization is issued for one out of four
different types of goods transport. The office in charge of the
authorization, Direction des Transports (DT), considers all applications
on a case-by-case basis, often after consultations with the local
chapter of the truckers union (para. 7).
2.        The Government, tbrough the Ministry of Public works,
Construction, Post and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Commerce,
establishes mandatory tariffs for goods transport. The tariffs apply to
all road haulage except (i) loads of less than 3.5 tons, (ii) transport
over a distance equal to or less than 100 km, and (iii) the transport of
bananas, pineapples, food crops (except for milled rice), fruits,
vegetables, perishables, fish, animals, meat, quarry products, and salt.
The tariffs are specified with a maximum and minimum value and are
differentiated with respect to the type of goods transported. For large
contracts it is possible to negotiate rates which are up to 15Z below
the official minimum, subject to the approval of the Ministry of
Commerce. The tariffs are determined on the bas.s of conventional
vehicle operating cost calculations for different types of vehicles. No
distinction is made with respect to the type of road or road condition.
In other words, road improvements do not necessarily lead to lower
tariffs.
3.        The Centre National des Bureaux de Fret (CNBF), a parastatal
created in 1969, is in the process of liquidation. One of the tasks
originally envisaged for CNBF was that it would be instrumental in
establishing contacts between clients and transport companies. This aim
was never achieved. Since 1975, CNBF has been in charge of issuing the
'lettre de voiture" (LdV), a mandatory document which identifies the
transporter, the client, the nature of the goods and the cost of
transport. The LdV is required for international and domestic road
transport of goods except for that not subject to tariff regulation, and
for interregional transport not linked with the ports. However, it is
a/   See Transport and Marketing of Agricultural Products in the Ivory
loast, H. L. Beenhakker and N. Bruzelius, Transportation
Department, March 1984, for a complete discussion.

ANNEX 2-15
Page 2 of 5
always required for coffee, cocoa, and copra when departing from
production centers, and for transport of oil products from a number of
specified oil depots.
4.        To issue the LdV, CNBF charges a fee of 2X of the transport
cost plus a value added tax of 25Z; the fee is to be divided equally
between the transporter and the client. The data collected by CNBF are
inadequate as they only pertain to certain commodities, and also tend to
underestimate commodities' tonnages, as truck owners try to avoid CNBF
because of the paperwork and fees to be paid. This latter aspect,
together with the fact that truck owners and their clients have little
or no confidence in CNBF, an organization they consider to be in charge
of controlling tariffs, have led to the failure of CNBF. The lack of
confidence is mainly attributed to CNBF's failure to arrange for the
insurance of goods transported.
5.        Some additional Government interventions in the road transport
industry concern the transport of certain agricultural products. For
instance, road transport of paddy to a mill, of milled rice from a local
mill, or of imported rice, require two documents, i.e., a "bordereau
d'achat", which shows that the rice has actually been bought, and a
'bordereau d'expedition", which shows that the rice may be transported.
6.        In sum, there are a nvmber of regulations to comply with to
undertake road transport. To control compliance with them and to avoid
illegal transport of timber and other natural resources, road traffic
encounters five different types of roadblocks in the country's highways,
i.e., those controlled by the police, gendarmerie, douane, and officials
of the Ministeres des Mines, and Eaux et Forets. The controls are often
carried out with great diligence and can involve considerable time
delays.
7.        Another aspect of the Ivorian road transport industry is that
it is subject to monopolistic practices. The monopolies operate at the
local rather than the national level, as it is the local chapters of the
truck owners union (Syndicat National de Transporteurs de Marchandises
et de Voyageurs de Cote d'Ivoire, SNTMVCI) which controls the supply of
transport capacity. The results of this market structure are high rates
for short (up to 100 km) distance transport, coupled with a limited
supply, and an excess supply of capacity for long distance transport,
since truck-owners have problems in obtaining return loads in areas
which are controlled by other chapters. In other words, the local
chapters can only control long distance traffic in the outgoing
direction. Also, the national body of the union is weak vis-a-vis the
local chapters.
8.        The problems affecting the road transport industry are well
illustrated by the transport of seed cotton and cotton fiber. In order
to avoid being completely in the hands of the local truck-owners unions,
the agency responsible for the marketing of cotton has its own fleet of
trucks, which undertakes about 50% of the transport of seed cotton in
Ivory Coast. This solution is very costly, and the costs of seed cotton



- 40 -
ANNEX 2-15
Page 3 of 5
transport could be halved if effective competition in the supply of
transport services were introduced . Through competition, large
savings, although not of the same order of magnitude, could also be made
in the transport of cotton fiber, as it would lead to better utilization
of vehicles for long-distance transport. The marketing of other
agricultural commodities is affected in a similar way.
9.        The local chapters often do not agree with, or respect the
rules and views of, the national Syndicat:
(i)    according to the national Syndicat, membership is not
restricted. Anyone who can obtain an authorization can
automatically become a member of the Syndicat. Each
member, irrespective of the number of trucks he owns,
pays a fee of CFAF 2,000 a year, half of which is for
the national office and half for the local office.
There are no other fees to be paid. In reality,
membership often appears to be restricted and subject
to the approval of the committee of the local Syndicat.
Membership is sometimes determined along ethnic lines
(for instance, in Mankono and Bondoukou, members are
Dioulas, in Korhogo all are Senoufos). Fees include
not only the yearly CFAF 2,000 but also an amount
ranging between CFAF 8,500 and 50,000 per vehicle
owned, and to be paid once only.  The money is being
put into a fund from which the owners may borrow when
in financial difficulties;
lii)   when a local chapter helps to arrange freight, the
national Syndicat dictates that this has to be done in
the order of registration. No preference is to be
given to the local truck-owners. In reality,
assistance is never given to members of other chapters;
in fact, they are "forbidden" to compete for freight.
It appears possible to sign up on the waiting list at
the local chapter in Abidjan, but this is meaningless
as the normal waiting time is too long (3-5 days);
(iii)  according to the national Syndicat, local chapters
should charge for each shipment a fee of CFAF 1,000 for
10-15 ton trucks, and CFAF 2,000 for 25-30 ton trucks.
This fee is to be paid even if the chapter has not
actually been instrumental in arranging the freight.
The fee charged per shipment is indeed CFAF
1,000-2,000. It is reported, however, that local
chapters are known to impose other fees as well, as
appears to be the case when there is an excess demand
and the local chapter cannot supply the capacity
required. Thus, during the coffee and cocoa transport
season outsiders have to pay special fees to obtain
loads;

ANNEK 2-15
Page 4 of 5
(iv) when the local chapters assume the responsibility for
negotiating large contracts, the national Syndicat
allows them to impose special fees on the truck owners.
For rice and cotton transport, a fee of 5% is charged
to cover administrative costs and the risks involved,
as the local chapters assume responsibility for the
execution of the contract. The local chapters may, for
such contracts, also require the truck-owners to put up
a bond, to ensure their adherence to the terms of the
contract. A fee of 5% is indeed charged for large
contracts. However, the large fees mentionea under
item (i) above are often not linked to these contracts
but are payments required for membership in general.
To participate in the large contracts it is, therefore,
not necessary to put up a bond; and
(v)    capacity control is to be achieved by informal contacts
between the national Syndicat and DT. The present
excess capacity in the road haulage sector is,
according to the national Syndicat, largely due to the
slack in the economy. On the other hand, the view
expressed by most local chapters is that there is at
present a shortage of capacity. That this is their
view can be explained by the fact that the local
chapters control the supply in th!eir area. Trucks on
long-distance return trips, however, generally return
empty. This situation has aggravated over the past few
years.
10.       At present there are no real freight bureaus in the country,
i.e., companies which market transport services on a local, regional or
nationwide basis. The tasks of freight bureaus are at present partially
being performed by (i) the local chapters of the truckers union, and
(ii) the "Cocksers" or informal individual intermediarIes (see para. 12
below).
11.       The Syndicat works as an intermediary between clients and
truck owners in the following way: for large-scale transport, one or
several local chapters of the Syndicat may negotiate a contract on
behalf of its members, and then allocate the work between those truck
owners who "sign up" for sharing in the contract. The local chapter
takes on the responsibility for the execution of the contract, and
handles all billing and payments. Such arrangements are on an ad hoc
basis and only for one commodity at a time, e.g., rice or cotton. The
local chapters of the Syndicat normally charge truck owners a fee of 5%
of the tariff, but higher rates have been reported. Other fees may also
be involved in these kinds of arrangements (para. 9).
12.       The "cocksers" are the men in the street who act as
independent fixers of transport. One reason for the existence of
cocksers is related to the unevenness of the load for long-distance
transport. The normal situation is that of a full load in the outgoing



- 42 -
ANNEX 2-15
Page 5 of 5
direction, and an almost empty one on the return. The drivers, there-
fore, try to add to their incomes by scouting for a return load on their
own, and may have to rely on a cockser for this purpose. The price for
such transport, often done without the knowledge of the vehicle owner,
is, of course, not related to the costs; the cockser's fee can be as
high as 25Z of the transport fee. for this kind of arrangement it can
be expected that all the necessary papers are often not in order and it
is, therefore, likely that the driver will have difficulties passing the
many roadblocks. Also, the truck owners may use the cocksers because
the local chapters mostly do not assist with arranging backloads. The
cocksers, of course, assume no responsibility for the shipment.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
Outline Terms of Reference for Freight Clearinghouse Pilot Project
1.        The Second Highway Sector Loan provides for a feasibility
study on a pilot project to set up two freight handling clearinghouses.
2.        Examination of the functioning of the transportation market in
Ivory Coast and early experience with CNBF lead to the conclusion that
the creation and operation of a freight handling clearinghouse should be
matters for private initiative and responsibility and for participation
by professionals and organizations directly engaged in the transporta-
tion field (carriers, consignors, agents, Chambers of Commerce, local
banks, etc.). Such a clearinghouse would thus take the form of a
corporation constituted under private law.
The participation of any one interest group should amount to
less than 50%.
3.        Since its purpose would be to bring about a better balance
between the supply of and demand for transportation services, and in
particular to reduce empty returns, the clearinghouse would not be a
substitute for the regular commercial relations existing between con-
signors and carriers. There would accordingly be no obligation to deal
through it. Likewise, were the system of consignment notes to be
retained, their issue and handling would not be a matter for the clear-
inghouse.
4.        As far as the pilot scheme is concerned, consideration of the
major flows of goods and of existing material possibilities for instal-
lation demonstrates that the locations with the best potential for
success are towns in the interior such as Bouake, Korhogo and perhaps
Gagnoa.
5.        The authorities are to conduct and take responsibility for the
study, for which they may obtain expert assistance in this subject area.
Approximately five man-months of such services -- provided entirely in
Ivory Coast itself - are expected to be required. The expert chosen
will be expected to devote a considerable part of his time in the field
to contact potential users of the clearinghouse. Details of the study
timetable will be prepared.
6.        The study should focus on the ensemble of technical, equipment
and legal problems that remain to be solved, namely:
(i) the best structure for the corporation and ways of
representing the various interests in its capital stock;

(ii) location within the urban center selected;
(iii) the scale of the main buildings necessary (offices,
dispatching hall, etc.), essential equipment and other
resources (telex, telephone);
(iv) the range of desirable auxiliary services (warehousing,
maintenance, parking, repair shops and garages, banking,
insurance office, etc.) and ways of managing them;
(v) operating procedures and internal regulations (dispatch
arrangements, level of charges, method of collection,
etc.), operating budget and income statement;
(vi)  means of obtaining guarantees on merchandise (guarantee
fund, sureties);
(vii) overall cost of the investment and possible means of
financing;
(viii) promotional measures by which the authorities or
interested parties engaged in the field could assist in
launching the clearinghouse;
(ix) a plan of action and timetable for completion of the
operation;
(x) the nature, scope and cost of the technical assistance
likely to be necessary once the clearinghouse is in
operation, and ways and means of financing that assis-
tance;
7.        On completion of his mission, the expert shall furnish a final
report covering points (i) to (x) above and in a format to be agreed
upon with the Ivorian authorities.

Cr'teria for the Economic Evaluation of Road Investments
A. Introduction
1.        Prior to their inclusion in the government's three year
rolling investment program, potential projects will be subjected to an
economic evaluation in accordance with the methodology outlined below.
2.        The types of works for which an economic evaluation will be
carried out are:
(i)    upgrading of unpaved roads and construction of new
roads;
(ii)   bridge construction or modernization; and
(iii) strengthening or resurfacing of existing paved roads.
3.        Various technical alternatives will be developed and tested
with a view to allow determination of the project solution which would
minimize total transportation costs.
4.        A summary data sheet (Attachment) will be prepared for each
potential project and submitted to the bank to seek its concurrence for
inclusion of the project in the Government's investment program.
B. Principal Economic Benefits to be Considered for Each Type of Works
5.        Upgrading of Unpaved Roads and New Road Construction:  The
benefits of such road works would consist of vehicle operating costs and
time savings for normal (in the case of upgrading), generated and
diverted traffic, as well as maintenance cost and road accident cost
savings (the latter based on the findings of the "Etude des Accidents de
la Route" of November 1984 or as subsequently updated). For new roads
penetrating undeveloped areas a producer surplus approach is to be
applied.
6.        Strengthening and Resurfacing of Existing Paved Roads:  The
choice of investment will be determined by comparing various periodic
maintenance options, e.g., through the use of the Highway Design and
Maintenance (HDM) model (release III) when this becomes operational.
Only normal traffic will be taken into account.
7.        Bridge Construction and Modernization:  Principal benefits
would be vehicle operating cost and time savings from alternate



-  46  -                       ANNEX 3-1
Page 2 of 2
routings. Another source of benefits could be avoided production losses
in cases where no alternative evacuation routes exist.
C. Principal Parameters to be Used in Economic Evaluation
8.        Traffic:  Continuous national traffic surveys are carried out
by the Service de Donnees Routiares (KTPCTP), providing basic traffic
data on the main network and to be gradually expanded to cover part of
the feeder roads network. When a specific project could cause a
significant shift in historical traffic patterns this would be
complemented by origin and destination surveys. Generated traffic will
be calculate for the opening year by multiplying transport cost savings
by an elasticity factor and will subsequently increase at the normal
growth rate. The normal traffic growth rate will be based on historical
patterns 3nd other relevant parameters such as forecast growth in GDP
or, in readily identifiable cases, specific expected developments in the
immediate zone of influence of the project.
9.        Vehicle Operating Costs:  Vehicle operating costs are based on
the BCEOM study 'Costs d'Exploltation des Vehicules de Transport
Routier' of May 1983 which derived its estimates using the relationships
of the HDN model developed on the basis of data obtained in Kenya.
Following the installation of the HDM model release II1 in DCGTX and the
collection of data on ivorian road characteristics (inter alia
roughness), these estimates will be refined.
10.       Time Values:  Time values are applied to bus and car
passengers travelling for work-related purposes. Occupancy factors and
trio purpose breakdowns were estimated on th- basis of surveys carried
out several years ago and will be updated under the proposed National
Transport Study.
11.       Investmant Costs:  Inmestment costs cover civil works,
pre-investment studies and supervision, net of taxes and duties. A
residual value at the end of the life of the investment will be taken
into account, depending on the type of improvement.
12.       Accident Cost Savings:  Reductions in road accidents from road
imprcvement will be taken into account based on the findings of the -
"Etude des Accidents de la Route" of November 1984, or as subsequently
updated.
13.       Shadow Prices:  For the opportunity cost of capital a rate of
12Z will be used. No shadow prices for labor and foreign exchange will
be applied.
14.       Sensitivity Analysis:  The evaluation results will be tested
for changes in critical variables such as investment costs, normal
traffic growth rate, the elasticity factor used for calculating
generated traffic, time values and road accident cost savings.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR LOAN
Training of Public Works Personnel
Background
1.        Under the First Highway Sector Loan, the training effort aimed
at the upgrading of about 800 DR and DM personnel: middle level field
supervisors (heads of regrading and regraveling brigades, foremen
assigned to the departmental workshops), and skilled workers (equipment
operators and field mechanics). Training was carried out jointly
by two local Ivorian schools called -Formaroute': Ecole Nationale
Superieure des Travaux Publics - ENSrP - and Institut National SupErieur
de l'Enseignement Technique - INSET. At the end of the loan the
following objectives should have been achieved.
(a)  Institution buildi
Fourteen local training officers and instructors will have
received training through the technical assistance and overseas
fellowships.
(b) Personnel trained.
The personnel assigned to the 70 regrading and 46 of the 48
regravelling brigades including the field mechanics should
have been trained at the end of the project. The methodology
used was relevant to the training objective: first the
employees were trained in their technical fields, second as
members of a team, i.e., in regrading or regravelling brigades
according to the type of brigade they would be assigned to
after their training is completed. The personnel to be
trained were selected by the instructors; furthermore, the
operators were assigned to the type of equipment the most
appropriate to their skills and behavior. All the trainees
have been evaluated at the beginning, during and at the end of
their training. A final evaluation has been sent by
FORMAROUTE to the trainees' supervisors.
(c) Resources
Existing facilities will have been upgraded and equipped
(classrooms, workshops and hostel) and pieces of equipment and
tools allocated to this training center.
Further needs for manpower improvement
2.        Needs will remain at the end of the project for personnel
planning and development: the personnel management function has to be
strengthened and training of personnel is still required.
(a) Personnel management function
A specific unit is needed to efficiently manage DM and DR
personnel, i.e., to inventory and evaluate the existing
personnel, to forecst the personnel needs, to improve the
career development plans, to implement a training policy and
administer DM and DR training programs given by FORMAROUTE and



- 51J-                              ANNEX 3-3
Page 2 of 7
other organizations, such as DGTX, and existing vocational
institutions in the Ivory Coast. This unit is justified
because the Personnel Sub-Directorate, under the
Administrative and Financial Directorate, responsible for
managing all Ministry's personnel and training activities,
cannot follow closely enough all the problems related to
management of DR and DM personnel; indeed it is understaffed
in relation with the tasks it has to perform in a huge
Ministry which has the responsibility for roads, housing, and
posts and telecocmunication.
(b) Trainin_ needs
(i) supplementary training of FORMAROUTE training officers and
instructors is necessary because they will be responsible
for training actions at a higher technical level (in the
mechanical field in particular) than they were under the
first sector loan
(ii) the personnel to be assigned to DR and DM personnel unit
to be created under the project should be trained in
personnel management system
(iii)   the ENSTP engineering school should introduce a road
maintenance course into the curricula for the civil
engineer and high level technician students
(iv) the managerial and technical knowledge of the directors
(heads of departments, regional directors and engineers)
of road and equipaent maintenance should be improved
'v) newly recruited and existing personnel should be trained
so that they could fill vacancies (mechanical technicians
and foremen, and storekeepers) or replace many of the
middle level technicians and skilled workers who will
retire during the next few years (heads of brigades,
operators, mechanical foremen and mechanics)
(vi) already trained personnel may also require training in
order to keep updated their knowledge and improve their
performance.
Objectives
3.        The objectives of the training component, limited to Road and
Mechanical Engineering Directorates (Direction des Routes DR et du
Materiel - DM), are:
(a)   strengthening the personnel management system including
training function
(b)   improving the road maintenance management system
(c)   improving the equipment maintenance management system
Description
4.        The project would assist the MTPCPT with (a) personnel
planning and development strengthening, (b) training of local personnel
assigned to the DR and DM training unit, (c) training of local
instructors assigned to FORMAROUTE, which will become the fourth ENSTP



-  52  -                            ANNEX 3-3
Page 3 of 7
school, and (d) staff training. First priority will be given to the
training of local personnel, i.e., the head of DR and DM personnel unit,
and the training officers and instructors assigned to FORMAROUTE.
5.        A personnel unit to be responsible for DR and DM personnel in
management will be created under the project. It will be headed by an
ENSTP engineer who will receive specific training under the project.
The responsibilities of the unit are defined in Attachment 1 hereafter.
6.        The training for DR and DM personnel will be organized and
carried out by the ENSTP. This institution already includes three
schools and a training unit: Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingenieurs
(ENSI); Ecole Nationale des Ingenieurs des Techniques (ENIT); Ecole
Nationale des Techniciens Superieurs (ENTS); and Cencre de Formation
Continue (CFC). FORMAROUTE will become ENSTP's fourth school. It will
be responsible for training middle level technicians and skilled
laborers in fields where there is no institution providing s milar
training. The training activities include vocational and induction
training for newly recruited personnel, upgrading and refresher courses
for the existing personnel, which will consist of:
(a) road maintenance courses to be added to the curricula of Ecole
Nationale SupErieure d'Ingenieurs (ENSI) and Ecole Nationale
des Techniciens Superieurs (ENTS). The civil engineers and
technicians employed by the Ministry are graduated from these
schools;
(b) refresher seminars on managerial and technical topics to be
organized twice a year for the DR Directors (SD, SR, and
headquarters) by CFC; and
Cc) technical training and retraining of field supervisors,
equipment operators, mechanical technicians (techniciens
supfrieurs, chefs de garage et contremaitres) to be
implemented by FORMAROUTE.
The figures related to the training program to be implemented are shown
in Table 1 hereafter.
7.        Recruitment of personnel to fill the vacancies and replace
retiring personnel will include external and internal recruitment
according to the following principles:
(a) external recruitment
(i) qualified personnel available in the market will be
sought out and recruited;
(ii) personnel to be recruited will have to have a specific
educational background as far as possible (for example,
equipment operators should have a trade test certificate in
mechanics);
(iii) newly recruited helpers will be tested for a short
period by operators already retrained under the first
sector loan. After their motivation and willingness have
been assessed, they will take formal training in FORMAROUTE
school.



-  53  -                           ANNEX 3-3
Page 4 of 7
(b) internal recruitment
e,xisting personnel who have demonstrated their qualities at
work and during training courses will be promoted after
going through a training course (for example, case of
operators could become heads of brigades).
8.        The people needed to implement the training program are as
follows:
(a)  one ENSTP engineer for the DR and DM personnel unit assisted
by a technical assistant to be provided by the French
bilateral aid agency (F.A.C.);
(b)  DR and DGTX engineers for the road maintenance courses at
ENSTP engineering schools and for the refresher seminars;
(c)  one director and up to seven instructors for FORMAROUTE: three
for training road maintenance personnel (one to be in charge
of training of heads of brigade, heads of sectors and
storekeepers, two to be in charge of training of operators and
the practical training of heads of brigades), and two for
training in the mechanics (one specialized in vehicles and one
in equipment maintenance and repairs);
Cd)  instructors from the INSET school and other vocational
institutions in Ivory Coast. Part of the training in
mechanics will be sub-contracted by ENSTP to existing training
institutions.
The number of instructors needed for FORMAROUTE is based on (i) DR and
DM long-term personnel needs, (ii) use of existing vocational schools
and (iii) lack of road maintenance vocational schools for middle level
supervisors and operators.
9.        The training efrort will be evaluated according to the
following scheme:
(a)  the DR and DM personnel unit will be responsible for the final
evaluation (external evaluation) of the training effort. To
do this evaluation, the personnel unit will have to involve
the managers and supervisors of the trainees and also the
training institutions, lecturers and instructors. Managerial
tools, such as an accounting system, will be used for this
evaluation;
(b)   each institution (ENSI, ENST, CFC, and FORMAROUTE) will
evaluate (internal efficiency) the training effort it is
responsible for. FORMAROUTE will require evaluations from the
sub-contracting institutions (INSET, DGTX, etc.).
(c)   each institution (ENSI, ENST, CFC, and FORMAROUTE) will
prepare a report every three months on the tasks implemented,
the ones to be performed during the following periods, the
results of training achieved (number of trainees and
evaluation of results), evaluation of instructors performance
and budget expenditures; it will also include proposals for
improving the training program. These reports will be
transmitted to the ENSTP' General Director who will add his
proposals for payment of supplementary salaries to FORMAROUTE
instructors. The reports will be sent to the head of DR and



- 54 -
ANNEX 3-3

DM personnel unit who will review them, make his comments and
proposals, confirm payment of the supplemeitary salaries to
FORMAROUTE instructors, and add description of the task his
unit has performed during the last three months and the ones
to be performed during the following three months. This final
report will be sent to DR and DM directors, and a copy to the
Bank.
10.       To carry out the above training program the project would
finance:
(a) felln  auips ror Lich-level staff in the field of (i) personnel
management system for ,he head of the DR and DM personnel
unit, (ii) training, road and equipment maintenance for local
training officers and inst-ictors; and (iii) equipment
management system for DM engineers;
(b)  fees and supplementat salariee  (i) for part-time lecturers
and instructors from vocational institutions (INSET in
particular) and (ii) for the instructors from FORMAROUTE to
adjust their basic salaries to the ones of the Ministry of
Vocational Education;
Cc) 2er diem for the instructors and trainees;
Cd) pirchase and operating cost of vehicles; and
(e)  training materials and aids to replace the obsolete items and
supplement the existing ones.
Operating costs for equipment of training production units will be
financed by DR and DM budget.

Monitoring and Supervision of Road Maintenance Outputs
1.        The output of road maintenance works will be monitored and
reported, independently from )TPCTts own internal monitoring, by the
DCGTX. The purpose of the monitoring is to provide an independent
assessment of the adherence by the regional directorates to the work
targets set at the beginning of each work season. The monitoring will
focus on (i) the timely availability of financial, staff and physical
resources and (ii) the output of field brigades. It will cover all
regional directorates and their work brigades as well as the DMIP
central workshop and the DR and DMTP regional workshops.
2.        The monitoring will for each regional directorate provide, at
3-monthly intervals, a concise report comparing key indicators of
resource availability and outputs as planned with those actually
observed. The reporting will be used to determine, jointly by DCGTX,
MTPCPT and the NEF, any corrective action required during the course of
the on-going work season, and will also serve as the borrower's report
to the Bank on road maintenance performance.
