It will encompass:  (i)\n            investments in new road construction, and in rural road\n            upgrading and rehabilitation as well as (ii) a proper level\n            of routine and periodic maintenance of the entire road\n            network of the country. The program will further involve\n            (iii) training of road maintenance staff at all levels and\n            the introduction of personnel management systems for such\n            staff and (iv) legislative changes to deregulate the road\n            transport industry and provide it with a system of freight\n            allocation based on market force competition.  Finally, it\n            will include (v) a program of enforcing vehicle load limits;\n            and (vi) the preparation of a national transport plan."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
