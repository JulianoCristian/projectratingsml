Second Highway Sector\n            Loan Project for the Ivory Coast was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, institutional\n            development was modest, sustainability is likely with\n            adequate funding, and the performance of both the Bank and\n            Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the elimination of the proposed\n            cross-effectiveness clause with the AfDB from the draft loan\n            was a wise move, as it enabled the Bank loan to be disbursed\n            and the project to proceed long before the AfDB loan became\n            effective. Second, while the Bank's lending for road\n            maintenance was only about 10 percent of the total\n            maintenance expenditures, this modest participation played a\n            significant part in achieving the successful execution of\n            this component. Third, the method to be used in bid analysis\n            should be clearly stated in detail in the bidding documents.\n            Fourth, the project demonstrates that excellent results can\n            be achieved in Africa on road construction and maintenance\n            components by good management, adequate funding, use of\n            incentives, and other innovative features which greatly help\n            to achieve work targets and hold down costs. Finally, the\n            project demonstrates the pros and cons of transferring main\n            contracting activities for road construction from a\n            technical ministry to a competent and well-managed agency."}, "docdt": "1992-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
