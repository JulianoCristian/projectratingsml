             Formula for Calculation of Relending Rate
                from the Borrower to Participating
                      Financial Institutions
1.   The interest rate payable by Participating Financial Institu-
tions to the Borrower on funds out of the Loan shall be a variable
rate per annum equal to the  average weighted interest cost of the
Participating  Financial  Institutions'   (excluding  BAPINDO  and
UPPINDO) loanable funds  arising  out  of  their customer deposits
(i.e.,  excluding  free  funds   from  government  and  parastatal
agencies) over a six-month  period.  This  rate will be determined
according to the following  formula  and adjusted every six months
or such other period of time  to  be determined by the Borrower in
consultation with the Bank:
                   t=6
                     rTt (Tt) + rSt (St) + rDt (MDt)
I = (1/6)
                    (Tt + St + Dt) - (RTt + RSt + RDt)
                   t = 1
Definitions
t    =    the last day of each of the most recent six months prior
          to an Interest Period for which BI has consolidated data
          on the deposit base of the PFIs
rDt  =    interest rate payable on  PFIs' demand deposits, at time
          t
rTt  =    interest rate payable on PFIs' time deposits, at time t
rSt  =    interest rate payable on  PFIs' saving deposits, at time
          t
Dt   =    the amount of PFIs' demand deposits, at time t
Tt   =    the amount of PFIs' time deposits, at time t
St   =    the amount of PFIs savings deposits, at time t
MDt  =    minimum  average  balance   of   PFIs'  demand  deposits
          outstanding during month immediately preceding time t
Page  18
RTt  =    reserves on time deposits of PFIs' at time t
RSt  =    reserves on savings deposits of PFIs' at time t
RDt  =    reserves on demand deposits of PFIs' at time t
I    =    interest rate applicable  on  Subsidiary  Loan (from the
          Borrower to all PFIs) for each interest period.
2.   Notwithstanding the above  cost-of-funds formula, the relend-
ing rate of the Participating Financial Institutions, shall not be
less than the interest rate on the Loan plus a margin of 1.75%.
