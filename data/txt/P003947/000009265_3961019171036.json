The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the project has been too ambitious in terms of its multiple\n            objectives and institutions involved; (ii) be very selective\n            in the choice of participating financial intermediaries\n            based on strong institutional capacities in delivering\n            credit and related services to designated beneficiary firms,\n            and on a clear understanding of their funding strategy and\n            constraints for delivering term finance to the beneficiary\n            firms; (iii) choose formula for determining on lending rates\n            in domestic currency, of Bank funds to financial\n            intermediaries which are based on current market rates of\n            alternative banks' funding sources; and (iv) In Bank\n            supervision, combine and integrate as much as possible the\n            supervision of Bank projects with similar participating\n            institutions and beneficiaries."}, "docdt": "1995-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
