1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)


1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country context
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Ghana experienced a serious economic decline, which eroded the
social and economic gains that the country had made during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1980s,
Ghana embarked on massive structural adjustment project, which was hailed by the international
community. However, in the 1990s, Ghana's economic performance remained less than spectacular.
By 1990, inflation and fiscal deficits were restrained and Ghana's currency, the cedi, had been
moved to a managed float. The country experienced economic downturn in 1992, in the wake of the
transition from a military to a democratic regime. Subsequent years were marked by a declining
growth rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and an increasing rate of inflation, which peaked at
59% in 1995. The current account deficit (excluding official transfers), rose to 9% in 1992 and
remained above sustainable levels. Fiscal and monetary discipline faltered again in the run up to the
December 2000 elections. Beginning in the later half of 1999, Ghana suffered major terms of trade
shocks. This was principally due to the falling prices of gold and cocoa (Ghana's two main exports),
and the rising petroleum prices. These shocks, along with a time lag for adjusting fiscal and
monetary policy, resulted in both a sharp deterioration of Ghana's macroeconomic performance, and
a build-up in arrears of its external debt servicing. These were further compounded by time lags in
adjusting domestic petroleum prices and utility rates.

Education Sector Context
(i) Literacy skills
Generally, the illiteracy rate declines in countries largely because an increasing proportion of the
population completes primary school and thereby hopefully becomes literate. Thus the rate is
affected by the size and proportion of the population that never attended school; primary school
admissions; and primary school completion rate as well as by learning achievement. In addition to
the national averages, countries need to pay attention to disparities. In countries with relatively large
poverty rate, here is a high risk that large and homogenous segments of the population will not
benefit from the improved access to basic education. While the average improves thanks to
improved access of those with higher earnings and better supply, the poor, rural communities fall
behind without adequate public notice. In other words, the national average may conceal
considerable inequalities within the society: non-poor versus poor, urban versus rural areas, and
gender inequalities.

Therefore, illiteracy rates in Ghana as of 1997 were high among the poor, particularly among poor
women especially those living in the rural areas. In 1997, the national adult illiteracy rate for the
population aged 15 years and above was estimated at 52%- 38% for men, and 64% for women-
while the absolute number of adult illiterates was estimated at 4 million (GCWIQ-1997). In the rural
areas, 74% of men living in rural communities were in the poorest quintile, never attended school,

                                                   9
compared to 15 % of the richest quintile. Among rural women, 84 % of the poorest quintile and 53%
of the richest quintile were illiterate.

(ii) Access to Education: Gender, social, rural and urban disparities
Since the second half of the 1980s, several government programs, and supporting development
projects have aimed to improve education and literacy in Ghana. Between 1987 and 1997, the
Government of Ghana (GoG) substantially increased its public expenditure on education. As a
proportion of GDP, annual education spending increased from 1.4% in 1983 to 4.0% in 1997 and to
5.6 % by the middle of the next decade. Basic education received roughly two-thirds of the recurrent
education budget; however, as enrollment rates improved, the share allotted to post-basic education
declined. More importantly, up until the end of the 1990s, no public resources were used to mitigate
the disparities between deprived and less deprived districts and social groups.

Although primary school enrollment rates have increased since 1989, disparities remained, affecting
negatively affecting enrollment of girls, or children from very poor households. In 1993, the overall
primary school admission rate was 81% for girls and 90% for boys, while only 60% of children from
very poor households enrolled. In 1993, the completion rate was 79% for girls and 88% for boys.
Student achievement was also low, only 5.5% of grade six students reached mastery in English and
1.8% in mathematics. An assessment in 1997, just before the present project was appraised, showed
wide gaps in education attainment by income levels, and location. This showed that 28% of poor
children in rural areas completed at least primary school, compared to 64% of non-poor children. In
urban areas, the proportions were better (64 and 74 % respectively), but still they reflected
disparities by income level.1.

(iii) Literacy projects in Ghana
Adult literacy initiatives in Ghana date back to the 1950s when the government undertook a massive
effort to increase adult literacy. However, government literacy reforms, which peaked in the 1960s,
declined by the early 1980s. Nevertheless, in 1991, the Government of Ghana (GoG) re-launched a
national literacy program to combat adult illiteracy in the country. In 1992, the GOG negotiated a
credit with the World Bank/IDA to support the expansion of the national literacy program through
the launching of the Literacy and Functional Skills Project (LFSP). Therefore, from 1992-1997, the
World Bank supported the LFSP through credit 2349-GH, which closed in December 31 1997. The
main objective of LFSP was to improve the quality of life of the poorest Ghanaians, especially those
in the rural areas, by equipping them with basic and numeracy skills. After having been extended
twice, the LFSP closed in December 31, 1997.

LFSP enrolled 1,373,571 learners but by expanding the program, it surpassed the original enrollment
target by over 60%. Completion rate was 78 % among learners, with 85 percent of the facilitators
being retained. Between 1987 and 1997, the illiteracy level dropped by 16 percent. Much of this was
due to students who had completed the literacy courses under the LFSP.

After the end of the project, the government continued with the National Functional Literacy
Program (NFLP) allocating 0.68 percent of the public resource envelope for 1999.2 NFLP was built
as a follow-up from successful cost-effective activities, lessons learned from LFSP, and other pilot
activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the project was to increase the number of Ghanaian adults (15-45 years),
particularly among women and the rural poor, who would acquire literary and other functional skills.
At appraisal, a functionally literate person was defined a person who can engage in activities in
which literacy is required for effective functioning for his or her own and the community's
development. The project aimed to enroll one million adult illiterates in five yearly cycles in
functional literacy programs by working with 200,000 learners per five yearly cycles.

Key Performance Indicators:

Progress towards the achievement of the PDO was measured by the following key performance
indicators:

At the end of each basic literacy cycle, 70% of adults were expected to:

      ·   read and comprehend a short essay of 3 paragraphs in one of the 15 selected local languages;
      ·   write a simple one-page letter in one of the 15 selected local languages;
      ·   perform simple calculations in 4 arithmetical operations with numbers of up to one million;
      ·   participate in development activity projects;
      ·   demonstrate behavioral change in civic awareness.

With respect to the English Pilot Component of the project, 70% of learners were expected to:

     ·    read and comprehend a short essay of three paragraphs at the end of each English literacy
          cycle, and
     ·    write a simple one-page letter in English at the end of each English literacy cycle.

Following project appraisal, a learner assessment and tracer study system was developed that
defined baseline information set targets in key literacy skills and behavioral changes.

                                                  11
The primary target group included mostly women, and the rural poor, especially those in the
Northern regions, areas with high average illiteracy rates.

The project also aimed to (i) create enabling literate environment by improving access to reading
materials; (ii) improve existing radio broadcasting literacy classes; (iii) cover four more national
radio stations, and enhance English language interactive radio; and (iv) improve institutional
capacity by way of improving human resource development and staff decentralization.

The achievements of the expected project outcomes were measured by key performance indicators
as described in section 6.2 above and by tests and learner assessment that was administered three
times to measure baseline skills, progress at mid-point and at project completion.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1: Basic Literacy and Development Activity Component (US$27.6m)

This component was designed to develop basic literacy, numeracy, and functional skills for adults in
15 Ghanaian languages, through the acquisition of classroom inputs, reading and other materials,
working tools and training for facilitators and supervisors. In addition, the component aimed to
strengthen basic literacy curriculum; to pilot post-literacy development activities to improve English
language literacy for adults and to strengthen the operations of the Non-formal Education Division
(NFED) through increased mobilization and sensitization of community participation activities.

Component 2: Expanded English Pilot (US$1.0m)

This component was designed to develop basic literacy, numeracy, and functional skills for adults in
15 Ghanaian languages, through the acquisition of classroom inputs, reading and other materials,
working tools and training for facilitators and supervisors. In addition, the component aimed to
strengthen the basic literacy curriculum, which included piloting post-literacy development activities
to improve English language literacy for adults, strengthening the operations of the Non-formal
Education Division (NFED) through increased mobilization and sensitization of community
participation activities.

Component 3 Literate Environment (US$1.2 m)

This component was designed to develop a literate environment to sustain the literacy skills of
newly trained adults through the introduction and acquisition of reading materials (easy to read
books, entertaining story books, community news papers, comic books and literacy board games,
anthology), and provision of technical advisory services.

Component 4: Monitoring, Evaluation and Research ProjectComponent ( US$1.4m)

This component was designed to strengthen the capacity of NFED to carry out project monitoring
and evaluation of the functional literacy activities. The project was monitored by regular project



                                                 12
supervisions, learner assessments, tracer studies3 and research. Project activities and financing also
included training of supervisors and facilitators, acquisition of manuals, improvement of
management information systems (MIS), provision of technical advisory services and acquisition of
materials, vehicles, and equipment.

Component 5: Radio Broadcasting (US$2.0m)

This component was designed to develop a literate environment, to sustain the literacy skills of
newly trained adults through the introduction and acquisition of reading materials (easy to read
books, entertaining story books, community news papers, comic books and literacy board games,
anthology), and the provision of technical advisory services.

Component 6: Management and Institutional Enhancement (US$5.3m)

This component aimed to:

(i) Strengthen NFED's capacity to carry out the functional literacy programs and projects via
training of the NFED staff, technical advisory services, and through the acquisition of equipment
and vehicles;

(ii) Develop and implement a human resource strategy for the NFED;

(iii) Develop and implement a strategy for decentralizing the management of functional literacy
services to regions and districts;

(iv) Develop a medium term non-formal education policy framework;

(v) Establish a database of organizations providing literacy services through surveys; data collection,
and technical advisory services;

(vi) Establish partnerships with other literacy training providers and non-governmental
organizations;

(vii) Strengthen learners' capacity to obtain financing for, and manage income generating activities
through technical advisory services.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

 The Tracer Study and Learners Assessment was intended to undertake an in-depth analysis and
evaluation of a sample of learners to measure the impact of the NFLP on their lives and communities
over a period of time. The phases to be covered were baseline (upon entry) at mid-point (after 12
months) on completion of the literacy program (after 21 months) and two years after completion.

1.7 Other significant changes

No significant changes were made to the design and scope of the project. But the IDA approved a
request from the GoG for the extension of project closing date and the related credit proceeds
reallocation.

Impact of Implementation Delays on the Project Design

Significant implementation delays marred the project during the first half of its life. First, project
effectiveness was extensively delayed and later, Government change caused further problems (see
2.2 for details). Following these and corrective measures, the GoG requested IDA in August 2004 to
extend the project closing date, and reallocate credit proceeds. Accordingly, the GoG reduced credit
proceeds for civil works, and increased the allocations for operating costs. At upstream stage NFED
had aimed to build planned preventative workshop for easy maintenance of vehicles and motor
cycles. However, with delays, the completion of the workshop would have gone beyond credit
completion. Therefore, NFED decided to build storage facilities for the districts to store primers,
instead. Primers had hitherto been kept in rented rooms.

IDA also agreed to increase fund allocations for equipment and vehicles to enable NFED to enhance
efficient supervision. Accordingly, NFED purchases more motorcycles for supervisors and
computers for the districts. NFED reduced credit proceeds for radio equipment and for consultancies
for Component 5 based on the assumption that the delays would not leave enough time for the full
completion of the related activities. IDA approved the project extension for additional 20 month and
also agreed to the reallocations.

On April 2006, the project management sought IDA approval for reallocation of credit proceeds in
order to facilitate faster disbursement of project funds for all ongoing activities before project
closure. The reallocation aimed to enable the project implementation unit to complete all planned
procurement consultancy contracts, contracted studies and planned disbursements prior to project
closing. Procurement of equipments were increased from SDR8.4m to SDR12.2m. Consultant
services and training funds increased from SDR4.2m to SDR6.4m, to enable the NFED to train
people for the beneficiary assessment surveys and the tracer studies. Table 1 below provides details
of the reallocations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Lessons Learned at Project Design

The project preparation team factored into the design, lessons learned during the implementation of
LFSP, with the following recommendations:

      (i)     Monitoring and evaluation systems needed a stronger focus, including setting baseline
              data, and timely collection and processing of data to measure performance

      (ii)    There was a need for increased flexibility for adjustment to local conditions and
              operating within a framework of agreed parameters and indicators of quality.

      (iii)   Learners needed to acquire skills and practices that will allow them to increase their
              social and economic potential. Also, the design team considered establishing greater
              collaboration with NGOs, donors and the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.

      (iv)    Offering rewards to facilitators to encourage better performance appeared to be a good
              practice to be continued

      The team also took into account some lessons from two generations of non-formal education
      projects that were financed by the Bank. These included increasing attention to quality and
      targeting through site and beneficiary selection criteria, involvement of government and


                                                        15
    community groups, increased reliance on financial institutions managing funds for income
    generation groups and closer relationship between formal and non-formal education is desirable.

    In addition, the appraisal team drew lessons from previous activities on monitoring and
    evaluation including poor supervision quality, lack of instructions to facilitators and inefficient
    MIS. These are discussed below (7.3) in detail.

Risk Assessment


The appraisal team identified risks factors that could inhibit the achievement of project development
objectives (PDO). These included: (1) the risk of high staff turnover; (2) delayed release of
counterpart funding; (3) low demand for literacy classes; (4) low interest and enrollment by targeted
groups; (5) low political, community and civil society support.

The 2000 presidential elections was not expected to have a negative impact on the project. At that
stage, the appraisal team had assumed that by the time the presidential elections would be held, the
project implementation would be able to demonstrate enough progress to persuade the government
against interference and to continue to provide support to the implementation of an ongoing project.


Stakeholder Participation

The project preparation team carried out a need assessment and a stakeholder consultative workshop,
which was held with donors, government, and beneficiaries. During the workshop, the participants
proposed solutions, innovations regarding how to manage funds, monitor project costs, and decide
allocations between activities. The participants also proposed to include training for income
generating activities by learners and to establish a scheme to give soft loans to learners who
demonstrate or acquire relevant skills. The consultative group recommended new solutions for
financial reporting and helped develop a logical framework refining the key indicators and
objectives.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken, as
applicable)

Project Effectiveness
The Board of Directors of the World Bank approved the project in June 1999 but there was a
significant delay in declaring project effectiveness. The DCA was signed by the World Bank
President in October 1999, three months following approval, during his visit to Ghana. The signing
took place on a field trip to the Upper West Region. In the absence of the Minister of Education, the
Upper West Regional Minister signed on behalf of the Government however, his signature was not
recognized by the Ministry of Finance. Consequently, the DCA had to be redrafted and resigned.
This was eventually completed in August 2000. The delay of 14 months caused further problems as


                                                    16
the start of the implementation process, which slipped into the election period and further into the
tenure of the new Government.

Impact of Political Interferences

Following the December 2000 presidential elections the project suffered further delays. The new
government apparently perceived the creation of the Non-Formal Education Division (NFED) to be
politically motivated and its management to be linked to the previous Government. The new
Government also considered the NFED staff unqualified. The new Government therefore, decided to
restructure the NFED division, reduce staff size and bring in new, more qualified personnel. During
this period, some 55% of NFED offices were closed. The NFED personnel, including facilitators and
supervisors, had mostly consisted of staff who were qualified and had been employed as regular
teachers before their NFED positions. Eventually, some NFED offices were reopened with new staff
and some management changes, but only after lengthy negotiations and Bank intervention.

In 2002, during the government reshuffle, a new Minister of Education was appointed. The new
Minister re-established the government support for NFED, and committed to scale up its operations.
Consequently, all the NFED regional and district offices were re-opened, positions of all regional
and district offices were advertised and filled, although some level of vacancies has remained for a
longer period. However, the initial logistical problems, political interferences caused delays


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Lessons Learned

The key lessons learned from the LFSP on M&E included poor quality of supervision, lack of
instructional support to facilitators; and an inefficient Management Information System (MIS).
These problems hampered NFED's ability to receive timely and reliable information about
operations and impact. Field workers during the LFSP had to fill out twelve different MIS forms and
these often contained, and brought forward inconsistencies in data. The team designing the NFLP
simplified reporting, monitoring questionnaires, and reducing the number of reports. The team also
redesigned the M&E system; enhanced learner assessments and introduced self-assessments of
learners and facilitators.

Revamped M&E operations

The M&E team undertook regular visits to review teaching and purchase plans, which included
teaching methodologies and ongoing classes. The team reviewed written supervision and progress
reports and also gave feedback from communities about the programs. In addition, the team
conducted training data collection, processing, and management, programming, report production
and improved dissemination of results.

The revamped M&E operations helped improve the implementation of a number of areas including
the efficiency of training activities, primer production, and income generation. During tracer studies

                                                 17
at mid-point and at project completion, the M&E unit collected and evaluated data and these showed
significant improvements.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):

Disbursement

At mid-term (December 2003), implementation progress was rated unsatisfactory because the
disbursement rate was only 29%. However, by the end of project, the project disbursed US$44.94m
of the project total costs and US$33.86m representing about 106% of the originally planned and
94% of the available credit amount. The difference between the original IDA and the amount
available at project completion was based on the changes in the US$ exchange rate. The
strengthened M&E system helped NFED management monitor the disbursement status of the
project on weekly basis to ensure timely information about adherence to the schedule and that
disbursements did not exceed the approved category limits.

Financial management

According to project audit reports the FPMU kept proper books of accounts and complied with the
credit agreement's procedure for preparing financial statements. An independent audit conducted in
December 31 2003, found that the GoG contribution to operating costs did not appropriately reflect
in the project costs, and that the project accounting software had not been adequately utilized. The
FM staff was trained to utilize the software, but they were transferred to the Accountant General's
Department (AGD). The 2006 audit report is yet to be submitted.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The GoG allocated 60b cedis (US$6.5m) for the NFED to continue its operations beyond the closing
of the NFLP. The NFED finalized a proposal for a third phase of the project for ministerial
approval.4 The proposal covers the following activities and changes:
    (i)    extension of coverage to areas that have not been covered during implementation of
           Phase 2;
    (ii)   seeking more community involvement in preparation and implementation;
    (iii) further strengthening the M&E to be able to measure impact more readily and to integrate
           it with the EMIS for the entire sector;
    (iv)   working with associations and representatives of various vocations, (e.g. hairdressers
           association, seamstresses associations etc.) to bring in more vocational programs into the
           operations;
    (v)    scaling up the English language program nationwide;
    (vi)   assuring that all learners benefit from micro-credit;
    (vii) approaching other donors to supplement Government support;
    (viii) improve methods of instruction for writing,
    (ix)   broader dissemination of achievements of the NFED to national and the international
           communities.

    Formally, the Government did not approach the Bank to finance phase 3.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objective is highly relevant to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG
2) including achieving universal primary education by 2015 given literate mothers are more likely to
enroll their children, including girls, in school (see section 8.2 below). The Bank is also a key
partner in the Education for All (EFA) movement, which is a global commitment to provide quality
basic education for all children, youth and adults. According to Goal No. 4 of EFA, adult literacy by
2015 should be 50 per cent better than it was in 2000. The needs of women should receive particular
attention. In addition, all adults should have opportunities to go on learning throughout their lives.

The objective of the project is in line with the overall Country Assistant Strategy (CAS) that focuses
on improving the productivity and welfare of Ghanaians. The CAS places strong emphasis on
education as a key sector to help reduce poverty. Furthermore, the CAS aims at promoting broad
based social and rural development and implementing direct poverty alleviation measures. Poverty is
a critical factor because it strongly impacts literacy levels, which directly affects behavioral changes
in areas such as hygiene, child health, school attendance of learners' children, community and civic
responsibilities, and income generating skills. Furthermore, the Bank's support strategy for the
education sector in Ghana focuses on improving the quality and effectiveness of education service
delivery from non-formal (functional and adult literacy) to higher education levels.

The project objective is also consistent with the GoG's development agenda, which is strongly
focused on improving the quality, access and sustainability of social services and also promoting
faster growth. In addition, the Government established the Education Strategic Plan in 2003, which
focused on the key policies of mid-term budgetary frameworks, and yearly performance reviews. A
core component of this plan was to offer non-formal education programs focused on adult literacy.

The project design adequately reflected the original objectives and remained relevant throughout the
operation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall, the project satisfactorily achieved its objective. The quality of learning improved as a result
of the basic literacy and skills activities. The tracer studies conducted at the baseline stage, at mid-
point, and at the completion stage which assessed reading, writing, and numeracy skills, indicated
significant improvements in the three areas. The study compared the performance of enrolled
learners to that of non-learners, and found out that learners' performance was significantly higher
than that of non-learners. The project achieved the expected level of literacy in reading and
numeracy. In the meantime, it fell short of the expected results in writing, which is generally the
most difficult area in adult literacy programs. Also, the regional targeting has not been achieved as it
had been envisioned at appraisal, the reasons of which need to be taken into account at the
continuation of the project. Finally, but equally significantly, the project had significant impact on


                                                  19
behavioral issues, community participation and use of social services. These have significant impact
on poverty alleviation.

(i) Reading skills: During the baseline stage, 38.1% of the tested learners scored above the 50% (at
least 15 out of 30 marks) pass mark5. At mid-point, the proportion of learners who scored above
50% increased to 68.3%, and at project completion 85.4% achieved the 50% or above. Non-learners
were also tested at mid-point and at the project completion point. Their respective scores were 7.4
% and 19.9%.

(ii) Writing skills: During the baseline stage, 10% of the learners scored above 50%. at mid-point,
28% and at project completion, 45.5%. At mid-point 4.7% of the non-learners scored above 4.4%
and that remained the proportion of the high achievers at project completion.

(iii) Numeracy skills: During the baseline stage 17.8% scored above 50%, at mid-point 48.6% and
at completion 69.4%. Among non-learners the respective proportions were 7.2% at mid-point and
12.6% at project completion.

(iv) Targeting: According to the PDO, the NFLP was supposed to increase literacy and functional
skills of Ghanaian adults of 15-45 years, particularly women and rural communities.

                 45 +              19.9                 28.6               26.5

The 15-45 age group is clearly the key beneficiary group for the project as the proportion of this age
group ranges between 70 and 76 %.

The proportion of female graduates from the three regions of the North was 49%, falling short of the
60% target. Several factors contributed to this shortfall, including the declining demand and also the

5
    considered acceptable skill level

                                                 20
incomplete targeting mechanisms. It is clear in Ghana ­ as elsewhere ­ that deprived regions also
present challenges to demand certain social services. Literacy programs clearly need to make extra
effort to inform the population about the benefits. NFED officials indicated that the initial interest
also declined to some extent because the large majority of the population did already benefit from
the program. To assess whether the decline is "legitime" may only be made if information about the
literacy level of the population by regions and districts is assessed again. But a likely conclusion is
that outreach needs and targeting of services/funding need to be strengthened.

(v) Impact on awareness and use of social services, participation

The non-formal learning program had a positive impact on attitudes towards education, health and
sanitation of learners. Learners were more inclined to send their children to school with the intention
of encouraging them to learn valuable environmental sanitation and personal hygiene skills, and
better maternal and child health care. The general impact of the project on these behavioral patterns
on the project is significant as these patterns are essential ways to reduce poverty, stimulate social
development at local level through community-based interventions and also improve gender
relations. The details and the measures of impact are in section 3.5 below.


3.3 Efficiency
The economic rate of return was estimated in the PAD via cost-benefit analysis according to
standard practice in the economics of education. The PAD used unit costs estimated from cost per
participant, adjusted for expected completion rates and benefits estimated from the incremental
earnings-literacy relationship (based upon household survey data from Ghana, see Annex 5 for more
detail). The social rate of return was estimated to be about 18 % for males and 14 % for females.

The unit cost estimates at project completion are slightly smaller than that assumed in the PAD ($35
per graduate versus $38 per graduate estimated at appraisal) and the detailed tracer study carried out
in the project also show that the literacy achievements are close to what was assumed at appraisal.

However, earnings data from a later round (2003) of the GLSS, indicate that the relative earnings
premium for four years of primary education (the proxy used for literacy) has fallen. But
counteracting that fall in the wage premium is the clear evidence is that it is the cognitive skills of
reading and numeracy, and not just years of schooling, that pay off in the labor market (see Books,
Buildings, and Learning Outcomes, An Impact Evaluation of World Bank Support To Basic
Education in Ghana, OED 2004). Therefore, on balance, since the project achieved its actual
literacy goals, the estimated rate of return from the PAD appears to be validated by the project
experience (see Annex 4 for more details).

The project also employed a couple of cost-effective interventions, which impacted positively on
learning outcomes, one of which was the use of adaptive eyeglasses. Given that majority of NFED
enrollees are adults a great deal of them had eye problems. In its effort to address this issue, the
NFED sought a cost effective way of providing eyeglasses to learners to improve learning outcomes.
NFED therefore, contracted Adaptive Eyecare, a not-for-profit organization, for the distribution of
adaptive eyeglasses to adult learners in the North as a pilot. The company used simple self-adjusted
eye glasses without the need for an optometrist, which was far cheaper than the traditional method of
correction. (See annex 5 for details).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The relevance of this project is high given that the literacy achievements of the project contribute
directly and indirectly to several sector, and country policy objectives. The impact of reading,
writing and mathematical skills is significant. The project generated significant development
benefits related to reading and numeracy, but did not achieve the original ambitious targets related to
writing and geographic coverage, while contributing to the growing political culture of community
development and civic awareness.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project has had substantial poverty, gender and social development impacts on enrolled adult
learners.

Learners' attitudes towards sending their children to school: At baseline, 58% of learners had at
least one child in school compared with 62% at mid-point and at project completion. The same
proportion among the non-learners also improved from 50% to 54%. In the meantime, poor parents
tend to engage their children in commercial or labor activities (even while enrolled in school). The
proportion of learners who had children engaged in some work while enrolled in school is about
16% and among non-learners the rate is 35.4%.

                                                    22
Maternal, Child Health, Family Planning: Breastfeeding improved during the project from 50%
to 84% among learners, and from 45% to 62% among non-learners. Immunization was used to
prevent diseases by 73% at baseline and by 97% at project completion among learners. The rate also
improved from 68% to 76% among non learners. Two thirds of the learners had a strong and
adequate understanding of the purpose of family planning and this proportion improved to 95% by
the end of the project.

Environmental and personal hygiene: More learners are conscious of the need to keep their
surroundings clean. At mid-point 88.9% of learners swept their surroundings at least once a day
compared to 52.6% of non-learners. Interestingly, the proportion of learners sweeping at least once a
day did not change significantly by project completion (87.7%). There has been a significant
increase in those who sweep their surroundings at least once a day among the non-learners to 86.2%.
This suggests a positive impact of the learner's behavior on the community. With respect to weeding
their immediate surroundings, 64.4% of learners as against 20.2% of non-learners weeded their
immediate surroundings at least once a month at mid-point. In addition, 91.6% of learners washed
their hands with soap as opposed to 82% at baseline, whereas the rate improved from 66% to 76%
among non-learners. Furthermore, the rate of those washing utensils after use improved from 72% to
87% among learners and from 59 to 69% among non-learners.

Participation in community development activities: The project also increased learners'
participation in community development activities. Additionally, 94% of learners from the basic
literacy classes became more involved in community development activities as opposed to 83% of
non-learners. The typical community activities included clean-up and tree planting exercises;
construction of wells; construction of school blocks and public places of convenience and
community farming.

Through the project, learners have acquired maintenance skills in repairing water pumps in their
communities. In particular, in the areas where the NFED collaborated with the World Vision, pump
maintenance and repair volunteers can now identify pump parts by name and purchase them for
repair work on community boreholes. This has ensured reliable provision of potable water in these
communities.

Civic responsibilities: 95.6% of learners participated in various areas of civic activities compared to
87.6% at baseline. At baseline, 83.6% of learners claimed participating in voting; the number rose to
93.9% during the mid-point phase. A significant proportion (26.5%) of learners at midpoint got
involved in election campaigns, compared to 15.2% at baseline. Many learners attend unit
committee meetings, and some stood for the 2006 district level elections. At baseline, about 56% of
learners had knowledge about the intestate succession law compared to 70% at midpoint and 77% at
completion.6 While awareness in civic responsibilities improved among basic literacy learners, it
was especially high among the English pilot learners. Furthermore, 70% of Expanded English pilot
learners had their knowledge in issues concerning child health, HIV/AIDS, and membership of local

associations improved compared to 56% of basic literacy learners. During the course of the
Expanded English pilot project, as much as 98% of learners became members of local associations.

Income generating skills: Through the basic literacy and development project more adult learners
have acquired income generating skills. A substantial percentage of the basic literacy learners use
their skills to manage their money and to generate additional income. At baseline, only 10.6% of
learners acquired income generating skills in oil-processing, food processing, crafts making,
weaving, animal husbandry, beekeeping, salt winning, and snail and mushroom farming etc. During
the midpoint phase, the percentage of learners who acquired skills increased to 44% and at
completion it increased to 52.4%. Approximately 40% of the participants earn $440-$1,650 of
additional income per year from oil-processing; and 79% keep their money in the bank or a credit
union compared to 9% of non-learners. Many illiterate adults (particularly cocoa farmers in the rural
areas) could have been forced to request a third party to do their banking transactions for them
during the cocoa marketing season. A great deal of adults confirmed to the ICR team that they could
now comfortably do their banking transactions (writing and signing checks, etc) without seeking
assistance. The project helped to increase learner's access to loan facilities. Approximately 44.3% of
beneficiaries borrowed from the micro-finance scheme to finance their income generating activities.
The loan recovery rate was estimated at 86.8%.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of the project has been substantial. The establishment of the
NFED offices at national, regional and district levels has strengthened the Ministry of Education
Science and Sports (MOESS) capacity to provide non-formal education in all communities of the
country. Through the NFED, community reading centers (CRCs) were established in some regions.
These reading centers play a special role in follow-up of English literacy.

The NFED trained and built the capacity of all IGA officers in various areas of income generating
activities. The project helped to hire and train schedule officers for income generation activities.
Headquarters staff train regional and district officers in income generating activities, and they in turn
are capable of imparting these skills to learners.

Additionally, the project established and strengthened the capacities of about 16 independent radio
stations nationwide. In partnership with Ghana Community Radio Network (GCRN), the project
supported various community radio stations throughout the country. These community radio stations
play vital roles in broadcasting and propagating the NFED projects in the selected 15 local
languages.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Administration and Management Staffing Capacity

Rating: Moderate

Adequate level and quality of staffing is key to sustaining the development outcomes. The NFED is
faced with serious shortage of core and auxiliary staff at regional and district levels. This shortage
                                                  24
has affected monitoring and supervision of activities and general administration of the regional and
district directorates. Due to administrative bottlenecks within the civil service the NFED has not
been able to recruit the requisite staff to strength the staff levels at the district and regional
administrative levels. The staffing problem has substantially impacted on day-to-day administration
of district coordinators. In some districts there are no coordinators and in others, there is a single
coordinator performing all functions. Also, while the NFED has computerized all its regional and
district offices, personnel adequately qualified to analyze data is often missing. The overstretched
and not fully qualified staff, therefore, has difficulty in ensuring effective processing of data,
reporting, and supervising classes.

In the meantime, the NFLP also showed that these problems are above the level of service delivery.
While in the long-term, these problems should receive attention, they did not have a negative impact
at the level of training and hence, the results were not compromised.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in preparation and appraisal is rated satisfactory. The Bank task team and sector
management worked closely with the GoG and the NFED in ensuring good quality at entry. The
Team fully supported the GoG and NFED in designing the project by way of providing guidance and
training to NFED staff. To facilitate preparatory activities, the Bank adequately provided the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF).

At appraisal, the task team took into account key lessons learned during the previous operation
(LFSP) and other similar Bank financed operations and incorporated them into the project design
(See section 7.1).

In collaboration with the NFED and other stakeholders, the team identified and mitigated potential
risk factors that could have a negative impact on project implementation. These risk factors, among
others, are (i) low support from the collaborating agencies, and NGOs; (ii) recruitment and retention
of high quality staff; and (ii) timely release of the agreed budget by the GoG.

The task team ensured that effective implementation arrangements were in place, and all fiduciary
arrangements were consistent with the Bank's fiduciary policies. The Bank's technical experts
reviewed and assessed the existing financial management capacity, policies and procedures and
systems- including internal controls, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing- of the Financial
and Procurement Monitoring Unit (FPMU). This enhanced the overall financial management of the
project.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                 25
The Bank team ensured smooth supervision of activities throughout the project cycle; working and
resolving key implementation issues in close collaboration with the NFED. Bank staff carried out
quarterly supervision missions, which enabled the supervision team to undertake frequent
monitoring and visits to project sites. During missions, the Bank's financial and procurement
experts, together with the FPMU, reviewed procurement and financial documents and resolved key
financial management issues. The review meetings allowed the NFED to keep focus on the direction
of implementation.

The new government in 2001 showed at first little interest in the project. This caused delay in the
implementation (see section 7.2). The Bank Country team proactively held several discussions with
the government. There was a high level discussion of the problems with NFLP during annual
meetings in September, 2002. This engagement brought about stronger commitment to non-formal
education by the new government. Ghana's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRS) and the
Education Sector Strategy Plan (ESPP) prepared by the Ministry of Education Youth and Sports
(MOEYS) both supported non-formal education and the GPRS established a strong linkage between
adult literacy and poverty reduction. The Bank Country Team also had a strong role in enhancing
stronger partnerships with the DfID, World Vision, Adaptive Eyecare, and other organizations that
provided support and contributed to achieving the project objective.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank Task Team, Country and Sector management provided strong initial support for the
project. In addition, they helped to establish adequate design, leadership at times of political
difficulties and technical assistance at times when implementation support had to be intensified to
catch up with the schedule. Without strong support from the front office and from management,
positive results would not have been achieved.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government showed little commitment initially toward project implementation (see section
7.2). This commitment improved significantly after the Government and Bank representatives
carried out high level dialogue about the strategic importance of adequate project implementation
and funding to run the NFED. Following these discussions the Government provided adequate
attention and funding for implementation of activities. In May 2003, the government appointed a
new Minister of Education. Having observed the contribution of the NFLP to reducing illiteracy and
poverty, the Government began to provide strong support to accelerating project implementation.
The Minister solicited funding from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) fund to
supplement funding for the project's income generating activities.

By the second half of the implementation, the GoG fully ensured adequate provision of counterpart
funding by making advanced provision in the overall government budgetary allocations to the sector.
These funds were lower than the original estimates as the costs and the exchange rates changed
during implementation. This has enabled the NFED to continue and sustain project activities. The

                                                 26
ICR team observed that all classes and income generating activities in the country were properly
functioning; and learners were satisfied with the ongoing activities.

However, the GoG may further improve the effectiveness of functional literacy programs through
fostering stronger relationships between the NFED and the District Assemblies (DAs). While some
DAs have embraced and fully supported the operations of NFED, others still have a lukewarm
attitude towards the program.

Further, the Government should learn the lessons from the results and strengthen targeting while
setting literacy outcomes more realistically.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The implementation agency's performance is rated satisfactory. At preparatory stage, the NFED
adopted a participatory approach by involving all stakeholders, including development partners in
the project design. In 1999, the NFED organized a workshop where the following key players were
all represented: Action Aid, GILLBT, Care international, the District Assemblies, and the
government.

The NFED staff was fully committed to the achievement of project development outcomes. All the
staff worked tirelessly to exceed the overall project enrollment target of 1,000,000 adult learners (see
annex 5). The NFED, held about 20 weekly and quarterly meetings with Bank staff to address key
implementation issues. The NFED effectively communicated via emails and phone calls with the
task team leader (TTL) to discuss key issues during off mission periods. Despite the initial delays in
implementation, the NFED managed the project, and attained approximately 99.2% disbursement
rate.

The NFED adopted operational strategies for efficient coordination and implementation of projects;
published and updated a database of entities that provided literacy services in the country. The
NFED involved the World Vision and Care International in project implementation. The World
Vision actively took part in the execution of the English Pilot component, and Care International
developed materials for cocoa growing areas at Sewhi Wiaso in the Western Region. The NFED
facilitated the work of the World Vision International (GH) in the provision of English literacy.
During the period of project hold-up, the NFED Executive Director carried-out extensive field work
visits to resolve political issues resulting from the change of Government in year 2000 and the
closing of some of its District Offices. The Director's field visit to iron-out all challenges with the
District Chief Executives in every District, where the project was being implemented, gave the
needed breakthrough for effective project implementation by World Vision Ghana.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Overall, the borrower's performance was marginally satisfactory. The new government's initial
reluctance and lack of full commitment was later counterbalanced by strong government support,
implementation performance and by commitment to sustain the program beyond the NFLP. While


                                                  27
most of the objectives were achieved, the Government can further improve its effectiveness in the
areas by drawing adequate lessons for setting new targets for these programs at more realistic level.

6. Lessons Learned
11.1: Launching a project in times of elections can critically affect project implementation. There is
a need to adequately mitigate the impact of political changes on project design and implementation.
The NFLP suffered considerable period of delay due to the fact that the impact of elections were not
mitigated. Broad stakeholder participation, including political parties, together with strengthened
dissemination can somewhat mitigate these risks.

11.2. Ensuring adequate staff levels is necessary during implementation. Furthermore, the
integration of functional literacy programs in the strategic and monitoring framework of education,
and a focus on staffing at regional and district levels, will effectively improve operations.

11.3 Effective donor support in designing, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the
implementation process is necessary for achieving and disseminating results, and establishing
demand for literacy and other non-formal programs.

11.4 Fostering good relations between the NFED and the District Assemblies will greatly improve
operations and thereby ensure sustainability of development outcomes.

11.5 Partnership with other literacy providers and stakeholders in the area of facilitating training
activities opened more avenues for learning, and sharing experiences. It also strengthened the
performance of training programs.

11.6. Continuing monitoring of the learners to see if they retain literacy achievements is important. It
is additionally worthwhile to exhibit desired development behaviors.

11.7 Improve targeting mechanisms, strongly follow outcomes, adjust operations and even expected
results when it is relevant.

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document): (the system displays entries in
Section 6)
 The objective of the project was to increase the number of Ghanaian adults (15-45 years),
particularly women and the rural poor, who would acquire literary and functional skills. Specifically,
the project targeted one million adult illiterates to become functionally literate at an annual rate of
200,000 learners per cycle of 12 months for 5 years.

The original objective and key performance indicators were not revised.

Annex 3. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Basic Literacy and Development

Through this component, basic literacy is now delivered in all the targeted 15 local languages in 110
districts of the country. The project succeeded in meeting its enrollment target of 200,000 learners
per year/cycle. Nationally, about 1,195,971 adult learners enrolled in the program. In total, 63 % of
adult learners were women. About 45% of learners enrolled in the three northern regions (Northern,
Upper East and Upper West) of the country. About 73% of the classes were located in the rural
areas.

To improve classroom instruction, the unit developed and revised four resource materials: (i)
facilitator's manual and guide; (ii) community entry guide; (iii) supervisors guide, and (iv) field
training manual. The project conducted community awareness creation activities, which involved
focus group discussions and community-issues-based drama in 38 districts. The communications
unit videotaped relevant activities and produced a CD for learning and expansion of community
entry.

The project contributed to the improvement of lighting in literacy classes; about 46% of classes used
electricity or solar lighting, while 54% used kerosene lanterns. About two thirds of the classes had,
at the start of the project, inadequate lighting but half of these received adequate lighting during the
project.

Adaptive eyeglasses, which remedy near-sightedness, far-sightedness, presbyopia were used to
eliminate the need for vision professionals. The NFED partnered with DfID and Adaptive Eyecare
(now Adaptive Eyewear) and implemented a pilot project in four regions: Greater Accra, Northern,
Upper West and Upper East. A total number of 11,000 pairs of ADSPECS were procured and
distributed to these regions. The DfID funded the cost of 1,000, and the NFED purchased the
remaining 10,000. Adaptive Eyecare trained 50 master trainers, who then trained the local
facilitators to fit the glasses. According to the users, the glasses greatly improved their eyesight;
boosted their confidence in reading, writing, and numeracy.

In addition to the core basic literacy classes, the special education unit of NFED conducted literacy
and development programs for people with various disabilities (blind, deaf, and physically
handicapped).

(i)Programs for the blind: The unit organized 30 literacy classes, and trained 30 voluntary teachers
of the blind as facilitators to teach enrolled learners in blind literacy classes in the Upper West
region. In collaboration with Action on Disability and Development (ADD) and the Blind Teachers
Associations of Ghana (BTU), the unit trained 30 more teachers for the blind in Braille literacy to
enable them to facilitate classes for adult blind learners in the Northern and Upper East regions. The
unit trained blind adult learners in agricultural skills such as: (i) land tilling, mounds preparation,
planting, harvesting and scientific storage. Some crops they cultivate include onions, cabbages, etc.
In addition, the project trained blind adult learners in the tree growing project at Eremon in the
Lawra District of the Upper West region. This formed part of their contribution to forestation and
desertification projects in the region. The project also trained ten illiterate blind learners who have
now become trained facilitators in their own literacy classes. Furthermore, blind women benefited
from income generating activities training in soap- making, rope-making, and weaving of mats.

                                                  33
(ii) Programs for the deaf: The project organized 15 classes for the deaf in the Upper West region.
Four graduates from NFLP for the deaf are now ordained pastors with the Evangelical Lutheran
Church, of Ghana. Three graduated from Dwenase Rehabilitation Center (DRC) as qualified
leatherworks craftsmen and carpenters who own their own shops with apprentices. The majority of
graduates are actively engaged in income generating activities, and some have come together to
form cooperatives and associations. Others are engaged in small trading, dressmaking, tailoring, and
weaving.

(iii) Programs for the physically handicapped: The GSPD literacy class in Wa district of the Upper
West region has, through voluntary contributions and assistance, opened a Day Care center and a
primary school to cater for their children's education. The schools provide concurrently, literacy and
vocational skills.

2. Component 2: Expand English Pilot

 In collaboration with World Vision International, the project opened about 1,500 classes throughout
the country and as many as 7,429 adult learners enrolled. The NFED and World Vision designed the
functional English literacy project. The two institutions together developed, field pre-tested and
printed primers to reach more than 7,000 learners. The NFED and World Vision provided field
logistics to establish classes in 202 communities in eight districts: in the Eastern, Ashanti, and Brong
Ahafo regions of Ghana. These regions constituted the World Vision's core areas of operation. The
NFED supported the World vision by initiating field supervision and project monitoring by technical
staff from its Headquarters.

The NFED satisfactorily conducted English classes, where learners met three times a week and spent
an average of two hours per meeting. Approximately 73.3% of learners who completed the basic
literacy project enrolled in the English pilot project.

To ensure quality of teaching and learning, the NFED technical team reviewed and revised, study
materials (English primer 1 and 2), workbooks, facilitator's guides, and functional English primers.
These books and materials were evenly distributed across the country, and in a timely manner. The
project supplied reading materials to about 95% enrolled learners throughout the country. In
addition, 79.2% of learners admitted they received the materials on time.

The project contributed to improving reading and writing of the English language literacy. 84.2% of
enrolled learners, nationwide, could read and understand the English language. 76.7 % of of learners
were able to write the English language, but only 53% of learners could write a one-page letter. The
project enhanced learners' comprehension levels; about 73.3% of learners can understand a short
story exceeding the 70% target.

Demand for English classes has significantly increased among learners. During the ICR team's visit
to basic literacy classes in some districts, majority of enrolled learners expressed interest in the
English classes.

3. Component 3: Enhance the Literate Environment

The project made available reading materials for learners at adequate level. It ensured increased
provision of reading materials, such as children's books, comic/cartoon materials, religious
materials, sign boards to learners. Essentially, 91.7% of enrolled learners have functional literacy
materials in their homes, while only 18% of non-learners have functional literacy materials at home.
The project made children's school books available in the homes of both learners and non-learners.
About 47.9% of enrolled learners have children's books compared to 36% of non-learners.

The project ensured adequate provision of primers to all classes. The NFED technical team revised,
developed, and distributed two primers per language for the 15 local languages. The project
produced 167 titles of supplementary reading materials in the 15 NFED languages. In all, about
265,449 books were produced. The project ensured procurement of 24,000 book boxes to all the
district offices, and published a significant amount of easy to read books.


Component 4: Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER).

This component enhanced monitoring and evaluation of project activities through the carrying out of
tracer studies and impact assessments of activities. The project conducted two tracer studies
(baseline and midpoint). The mid-point tracer study monitored the distribution of inputs,
methodology, learning achievements and assessed project impact on learners.
                                              35
As part of the implementation of the overall Education Management Information System (EMIS),
the project successfully completed installation of Management Information System (MIS) templates
on all regional and districts computers. This has greatly facilitated data processing at regional and
district levels throughout the country.

The MER unit conducted research into the following areas: (i) assessment of the need to develop a
continuing education for out of school children; (ii) midterm evaluation of the NFLP; (iii)
assessment of beneficiaries' learning achievement and development impact; (iv) baseline data
collection for tracer study of batch 10 learners; (v) identification of demand for literacy and need for
other services; (vi) formulation of a policy framework document for non-formal education; (vii)
midpoint data collection for the tracer study; and (viii) the use of supervisors for quality
improvement of instruction in the NFLP. These research studies contributed immensely to project
delivery and enabled the NFED to effectively make the necessary readjustment for improvement.

However, because of lost time, the NFED carried out a few formative evaluations. When
management detected high dropout rates among women in some regions, the unit reviewed the
programs and concluded that they dropped out because most facilitators were men. NFED launched
sensitization for the program, amongst husbands about the importance of the project and also
recruited female facilitators for classes with high level female dropouts.

Component 5: Literacy classes supported by radio broadcasting

Under this component, the NFED conducted an assessment of 35 radio stations to find out their
readiness and capacity to broadcast the functional literacy radio projects. After the assessment, it
selected 18 community radio stations for partnership, to carry out the activities of the radio
component. These 18 radio stations signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which spelt
out their obligations, with NFED.

In order to expand the production capacity of the radio stations, the NFED procured and installed
supplemental radio equipment for 16 of the 18 stations. Two stations were not included because they
were not yet on the air.

Furthermore, the NFED organized a twelve-day radio production training workshop for 32 radio
producers from the 18 stations, to strengthen their skills to produce functional literacy projects for
literacy classes. The NFED supplied radio sets to all classes, and this enabled facilitators and
learners to listen and discuss radio projects aired by the collaborating stations.

Overall, the radio broadcasting project created awareness for the non-formal classes. In the view of
beneficiaries, radio broadcasting made the teaching and learning more interesting and easier to
remember, and easier to practice what they have learned through radio projects. It made learners
understand clearly issues in the primer. However, the pilot radio program for English classes could
not be implemented. And the project covered only 10 out of the 15 NFED languages

Component 6: Management and Institutional Capacity Enhanced

Under this component, the NFED decentralized the management of financial, human and
information resources to regional and district offices. The NFED has put in place a system whereby
bulk money is sent to the regions for onward budgetary transfer to the districts. The NFED has
                                                  36
devolved its staff recruitment functions. The regional coordinators recruit district officers, and the
district coordinators recruit facilitators and supervisors. In conjunction with the district assemblies
(DAs), the district coordinators recruit supporting staff.

 The project facilitated activities of various income generating groups throughout the country by
providing them with microfinance facilities. Nationally, over 139 microfinance beneficiary groups
obtained micro-credit facilities. The project disbursed a total amount of 169,630,500.00 million
cedis (US$18,410.68) to these IGA groups. Of this amount 141,266,700.00million cedis
(US$15,332.24) has been repaid with a repayment rate of about 83.3%. A total amount of
27,100,000.00 million cedis (US$2,941.27) has been recycled to groups with good repayment
records. The following table provides a summary of credit given to the IGA groups.

The Human Resources development Unit (HRU) of the NFED conducted field and management
training sessions for all officers. Under the field training exercise, the NFED trained a total number
of 46,960 facilitators, out of which 43,343 successfully established adult literacy classes. The NFED
carried out a number of management training sessions for its headquarters, regional, district and
zonal based staff. A total number of 6,858 officers were trained and equipped with skills in basic
literary, library management, monitoring and evaluation, income generating, special education,
logistics, accounting, fleet etc.

The project enabled the NFED to collaborate effectively with NGOs and other literacy providers,
namely, Action Aid, World Vision International (GH). The NFED also maintained strong advocacy
relationships with decentralized government departments, Department of Community Development
(DCD), District Health Services (DHS) etc.

 The project supported training of providers and cooperating partners in entrepreneurial development
for professional provision of income generation activities. For example, the NFED contracted
GRATIS Foundation (an NGO) to train its regional IGA officers. They in turn trained the district
staff, and the contractors supervised the training for impacts.




                                                                   37
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The PAD envisioned economic and broader social benefits of the project based upon achieving the
project outcomes of literacy and numeracy at a relatively modest cost of doing so. The economic
analysis of the PAD took the conventional approach of analyzing economic benefits in terms of the
additional productivity that comes from increased education and literacy. Increased earnings due to
education and literacy are conventionally used as a proxy for increased productivity. In the case of
literacy, educators usually take achievement of literacy through adult literacy programs as being
equivalent to achieving about four years of primary education. It is fortunate for the case of Ghana
that there is good data available from the various rounds of the Ghana Survey of Standards of Living
(GLSS) on the earnings-education relationship that could be used for an estimate of the economic
benefits that derive from achieving literacy.


The project also collected good data on the actual literacy and numeracy achievement of project
participants through tracer studies that included a baseline, mid-point and terminal sample survey of
project participants. The project met its target of enrolling about one million participants in total
over its five years. Based upon its tracer survey studies, about 70 % to 80 % of the participants
achieved basic literacy goals. The achievement of literacy is based upon tests given to the sample of
participants, rather than relying upon the self-reported literacy as is often the case in literacy
surveys. Thus the expected benefits turned out to be in line with those assumed at the time of the
PAD.


On the cost side, the assumptions of the economic analysis of the PAD were also validated by the
project data. The PAD assumed a cost per learner of $38, which was in the mid-range of a group of
reference countries used for the cost benchmarks of this project. Taking costs and benefits into
consideration, the PAD estimated a social rate of return to this project as being 18 % for males and
14 % for females, and a private rate of return of 43% for males and 24% for females. These
estimates of the PAD appear to be validated by the cost data collected by the project and the
literacy/numeracy achievement data collected in the tracer studies under the project.


In addition to validating the direct assumptions of the economic analysis, the tracer studies collected
detailed information about the wider economic and social benefits that would lead to the conclusion
that the social rate of return of this project would be significantly higher than the one calculated
narrowly on the basis of the incremental earnings method. For example, children of rural mothers
who successfully participated in literacy training were much more likely as a result to be enrolled in
primary school. In addition, both male and female participants were more likely to be involved in
community development activities. Their household health and hygiene practices were also much
more likely to improve as a result of participation in the literacy project. Finally, increased self-
esteem was also an outcome.


That these benefits were achieved at reasonable costs speaks well for the sustainability of the
literacy project after its lifetime. One interesting facet of cost effectiveness is described in the
section below concerning the innovative project for provision of reading glasses to the adult
participants, thus overcoming obstacles of vision problems common with adult learners.

1.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISMS

1.1   Project Goals and Objectives

      The Project Development Objective was to increase the number of Ghanaian adults (15 ­ 45 years of
      age), particularly women and the rural poor, who acquire literacy and functional skills. A
      functionally literate adult was defined as "one who can engage in activities in which literacy is
      required for effective functioning of his/her group and community and also for enabling him/her to
      continue to use reading, writing and calculation for his/her own and community's development"

1.2   Project Design and components

      The total estimated cost of the NFLP Phase 2 at project appraisal was US$46.0 million, out of which
      the Bank was to contribute US$32.0million. The remaining US$14 was to be funded by GoG, the
      local authorities, and other donors. The components were as listed below:

              Component 1: Basic Literacy and Development Activity Program
              Component 2: English Pilot
              Component 3: Literate Environment
              Component 4: Monitoring, Evaluation and Research Program
              (i)   Supervision/MIS
              (ii)  Learner Assessment
              (iii) Tracer Studies
              (iv)  Research
              (v)   Capacity Strengthening
              Component 5: Radio Broadcasting
              Component 6: Management and Institutional Enhancement
              (i)   Institutional Development
              (ii)  Non-Formal Basic Education Policy Framework
              (iii) Program Management
              (iv)  Partnership with other providers and NGOs
              (v)   Income Generating Activities

1.3   Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
      The project was implemented over a seven year period (1999-2006) with the Non- Formal Education
      Division of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports and the Ministry as the Executing Agency.
      The project was coordinated by NFED Management Team led by the NFED Executive Director.
      Implementation progress was monitored quarterly through Joint Implementation Meetings between
      MOESS, NFED and the Bank.

      The FPMU was responsible for procurement planning and implementation and contract
      administration based on procedures acceptable to IDA.
      The FPMU was also primarily responsible for the Program Financial Management, reporting, and
      auditing following systems and procedures acceptable to IDA. Accounting records were kept for all
      project - related expenditures and financing following generally accepted accounting principles.
      Project accounts were audited annually, and submitted by June of the following year based on
      international auditing standards. The project special account was managed by FPMU, with the NFED
      Executive Director as co-signatory.


                                                  44
      An effective Monitoring and Evaluation regime was established for the project based on parameters
      put in place such as the Project Design Summary/Logframe , the PIP; and the Annual Work Programs
      (AWPs).
      Annual program implementation reviews were regularly held, including a Program Mid-Term
      Review (MTR) from November 25 to December 9, 2003 conducted jointly by GOG, IDA and other
      stakeholders.
      In addition, quarterly implementation progress reviews were held by NFED, MOESS and the Bank;
      periodic monitoring and field supervision visits were undertaken by NFED; and a mid-term learner
      assessment tracer studies was undertaken alongside regular MIS reporting.

2.    OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND OUTCOME/OUTPUT RESULTS

2.1   Implementation of Programme Objective
      Project implementation was assessed by means of:
               A/ Outcome/impact indicators; and
               B/ Output indicators of the components of the project.
      To attain the PDO, implementation strategy ensured that at the end of each basic literacy cycle, 70%
      of a sample of enrolled adults learners were able to:
                   read and comprehend a short essay of 3 paragraphs;
                   write a simple one-page letter;
                   perform simple calculations in four (4) arithmetical operations with numbers of up to
                      one million;
                   have participated in development activity projects; and
                   demonstrate behavioural change and civic awareness.

      The programme was implemented uniformly throughout the country, though there was a bias in
      favour of the three northern regions which together were to have about 40% of total enrolment. The
      programme design also contributed to effective implementation: the 21- month learning cycle; three
      classes per week; and two hours per class proved very convenient and effective. Throughout
      implementation, meeting times, duration, performance of facilitators, etc. were satisfactory. After
      initial delay, teaching and learning materials were also provided on time in most cases. NFLP 2 also
      shifted from the didactic to participatory mode of teaching.

      The major implementation problems included inconvenient meeting places (e.g. open places) in some
      regions and poor lighting at some centres.

      Satisfactory monitoring and evaluation were undertaken over the duration of the project, and mid-
      point tracer studies for selected batches of learners completed April 2006 indicated the targets were
      largely achieved; some by significant margins. Beneficiary Assessment Survey undertaken as part of
      this ICR confirmed most of the results of the tracer study.

      As indicated in Annex 1A and 1B a large percentage of adult learners are now able to read, write,
      perform simple arithmetic calculations, participate in development activity projects and demonstrate
      behavioural change and civic awareness. The proportion of learners who met the outcome/impact
      targets for functional literacy rose from 60% in a baseline survey (December 2001) to 70% in the
      mid-point tracer study (April 2006). In the Beneficiary Assessment Survey undertaken in July/August
      2006, 42.2% of those sampled were of the opinion that as much as 80% of learners in a cycle could
      read, write and do simple arithmetic. A further 33% said 60% of learners could read, write and do
      simple arithmetic. However, numeracy (72.2% of learners) and writing (16.7%) were considered
      more difficult aspects of the literacy programme.


                                                   45
      Achievement of the outcome/impact indicators relating to functional literacy was even more
      impressive. In the Mid-Point Tracer Study of June 2006, the percentage of learners who had
      participated in community development activities had risen to 83.9% from the baseline level of 70 per
      cent. A further finding was that the percentage of learners who had never engaged in any community
      development activity had fallen from 25% at baseline to 5.5% by the mid-point survey. In a
      Beneficiary Assessment Survey undertaken as part of this ICR, the percentage of learners involved in
      community development activities (clean up exercises, tree planting, construction of wells, school
      blocks and public places of convenience) had risen to 94 per cent. Learners also made significant
      improvements in areas such as decision making in the family and community.

2.2   Implementation of Basic Literacy and Development Program
      The major output indicators for this component were:
                     i/       coverage of 15 Ghanaian languages for instruction;
                     ii/      enrolment of 200,000 learners per cycle per year, totaling one million
                              learners over the five years of implementation;
                     iii/     out of 1,000,000 learners, 60 percent should be women.

                      iv/     out of 1,000,000 learners, 40 percent of the classes should be in Northern,
                              Upper East and Upper West Regions/ deprived areas
                      v/      out of 1,000,000 learners, 60 percent of the classes should be in the rural
                              areas; and;

      The first three were achieved as tabulated in Annex IB, and detailed below:
      i/      classes were maintained in the specified 15 languages (Asante Twi,Akwapem Twi, Buli,
              Dagaare, Dagbani, Dangme, Ewe, Fante, Ga, Ganja,Gurane, Kasem, Kusaal, Nzema,
              Sissali) over the entire duration of the project.

      Instructional materials were developed and produced in all 15 languages. Forty (40%) of facilitators
      from previous batches were retained and additional new facilitators recruited. Facilitators were
      trained in 15 local languages in all districts across the country. Supervisors and Zonal Coordinators
      were also appointed throughout the country.

      ii/     Learner enrolment was undertaken steadily from inception of NFLP 2 in 2000. The tables
              below tabulate recruitment, graduation and drop -outs. Cumulatively, 1,201,971 were
              recruited, 216,355 dropped out, leaving 985,616 graduating since 2000. Details are provided
              in Appendices 1 and 2.

      iii/    The baseline figure in October 31st. 2001 put the percentage of literacy classes in Northern,
              Upper East and Upper West Regions at 32 %. The Mid-Point Tracer showed that by 2004,
              the percentage had fallen, with only 25% of graduating literacy classes coming from the three
              regions, most likely due to the low female graduation rates in those regions. Through
              appropriate targeting performance was improved to 29% by April 2006, though this fell
              significantly short of the 40% target.

iv/   Based on Ghana Statistical Service classification of rural and urban communities and a survey
      undertaken by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, the percentage of learners from rural deprived
      areas was estimated at 72.9 % for Batch 9 learners and 71.9% for Batch 10 learners (see Table 3.3)
      Though similar surveys could not be undertaken for Batches 8,11and 12 learners, the average of
      72.5% for Batches 9 and 10 learners is indicative of the percentage of learners from rural deprived
      areas. The figure is significantly higher than the 40% target. The Mid-Point Tracer Study also
      indicated that 70.4% of learners in the National Functional Literacy Programme are between the ages
      of 15 and 45years, proving that the project is actually targeting the relevant population.

                                                   46
v/    The Mid-Point Tracer Study put the proportion of women learners at 60 percent, which was at par
      with the target in the SAR. This agrees with the proportion of women who were recruited and
      subsequently graduated from the various batches (refer Tables 3.1 and 3.2). The targets were
      achieved through appropriate targeting, ensuring that each batch comprised of the stipulated 60
      percent women or more.

      From the discussion above, the Output targets on:
             i/      coverage of 15 Ghanaian languages for instruction;
             ii/     enrolment of one million learners over the five years of
                     implementation; and
             iii/    out of the 1,000,000 learners, 60 percent of the classes should be in rural areas were
                     all met or exceeded.

      The following two Output targets were not adequately met:
              i/    out of the 1,000,000 learners, 40 percent of the classes
                     should be in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West; and
              ii/    out of the 1,000,000 learners, 60 percent of the classes should be in rural areas.

      NFLP 2 improved on community entry and awareness creation at all levels.
      Visits were made to chiefs, opinion leaders and Community Based Organisations (CBOs) to bring
      them into the programme from the start. Further, the literacy programme was adequately promoted
      through publicity activities, theatre, and radio and television spots. Another effective strategy was the
      formation of Literacy Advisory Committee for each class. Supervisory visits were also undertaken at
      least on monthly basis. In addition to the development and implementation of learner assessment, this
      provided effective monitoring for the success of the component.

       Success was, however, constrained by factors such as: poverty in communities; limited funding of
      the mobilization activities; short mobilization time-frame; lack of sponsorship; inadequate
      collaboration with media houses; large class size in cases; and the didactic teaching background of
      some facilitators.

2.3   Expansion of English Pilot
      The English Pilot was implemented nationwide as a follow-up to a limited pilot undertaken towards
      the end of NFLP 1. It targeted neo-literates who had graduated from the basic literacy class. Two
      levels of output indicators were monitored over the implementation:

      English Pilot Classes expanded from 100 classes in 2000 to 500 classes in 2004, cumulating to
      1,350 classes by completion of the project;

      At each English literacy cycle, 70 percent of a sample of enrolled adults able to:
                 · read and comprehend a short essay of 3 paragraphs;
                 · write a simple one page letter;

      Implementation experience of the English Pilot followed that of basic literacy as described above. It
      commenced with the training of 500 facilitators. Fundamental, intermediate and functional stages of
      learning were strictly followed; though there were deviations in some important criteria (e.g.
      targeting neo-literates from the local language literacy classes). English Primers I & II, Primer II
      Workbook, Numeracy Workbook and Functional English Primer were the main materials used. These
      were developed in close collaboration with World Vision. During implementation classes were
      monitored nation-wide. The above two major activities underpinned the effective implementation of
      the Expanded English Pilot Component. Findings and lessons learnt from sample surveys informed
      the opening of additional classes and running of classes for attainment of the output indicators.
      The original schedule of the Pilot English class expansion was:

      Classes

      As a result of executive interruptions due mainly to change of political era between 2000 and 2002,
      the above schedule of programme implementation could not be adhered to. But after the initial
      hiccup, English classes expanded rapidly from 500 classes in February 2003 to 1,500 classes in
      September 2004, to a total of 2000 classes. By project completion, a total of 3,000 classes had run/
      started the 21 month cycle.

      Enrolment of additional Batch 3 Learners in June 2006 resulted in the Output target of 1,350 classes
      being exceeded. So far 3,000 English classes have been opened. The corresponding number of
      learners enrolled was 75,000, though the number of graduated learners cannot be verified until a
      proposed Impact Assessment Study is undertaken. Appendix 3 summarizes respective Batch 1 to 3
      enrolments.

      Implementation of most activities under the English Pilot were delayed. For example, the Baseline
      and Leaning Needs Assessment Study were not undertaken until mid 2005, and in only three regions.
      For reasons as above, the indicator of 70 percent of a sample of enrolled adults being able to read,
      comprehend a short essay of 3 paragraphs and write a simple one page letter could not be verified at
      the time of the preparation of the ICR. Indeed, the Impact Assessment of the English Pilot classes
      could not start by the August 31 2006 closing date of the programme. Initially, there was delayed
      request in the NFLP category reallocation. After the re-allocation, funding for the sub-component run
      out and alternative funding application had to be made to GoG. Outcome figures could, therefore,
      not be verified. The first output target of expansion to 1,350 classes was, however, exceeded by 650
      classes.

2.4   Enhancing Literate Environment

      The Output Indicators used for assessment were:
      Five new titles developed and produced in 15 languages annually, distributed to all classes; and
      50% of learners with access to post literacy materials

      The component was undertaken to ensure that reading materials were available during the literacy
      cycle and remained available to neo-literates after their literacy courses. Two subcomponents (
      Publication of Easy to Read Books and Publication of Entertaining story Books) were undertaken
      successfully throughout the country though constrained by a number of factors such as delay in
      printing; limited publications; difficulty in translating stories into local languages, etc. The remaining
      three components (Community Newspapers, Comic Books and Literacy Games and Anthology) were
      not adequately funded and were not implemented in significant number of communities.

      Indeed, implementation of the component was not very smooth towards project completion. While a
      number of titles were developed annually, the Materials Development Committees (MDCs) in the
      regions were either not in place or were unable to translate and produce post literacy materials into 15
      languages. Book boxes generally contained between 10 and 15 titles instead of the stipulated 50 and
      boxes distributed to classes were of poor quality and deteriorated rapidly. Further, boxes were not
      available in sufficient quantities due to limited distribution. As at June 2005, book boxes and
      supplementary boxes were in stock at some district and regional offices while supplies at classroom
      level were almost empty or had in - adequate materials. This was, however, addressed before project
      completion.

                                                     48
      Although distribution of book boxes was carried out subsequently, the targets of the component were
      not achieved at the two levels. e.g. only 38% of facilitators reported receiving follow-up Reader 1
      after the distribution. According to the Mid-Point Tracer Study, no facilitator received follow up
      Reader 2. One Survey established that wood for the book boxes was of poor quality; there were few
      titles of books in the boxes; easy to read books were limited; and coordinators could not differentiate
      between supplementary follow-up, and easy to read books.

2.5   Monitoring, Evaluation and Research Program
      Implementation of this component was weak. Monitoring visits were undertaken for most part of
      implementation but were irregular. During Headquarters monitoring visits in 2005, for example,
      Upper East and Upper West were left out due to inadequate funding at the time. Upper East was later
      covered and Upper West scheduled after project completion. Regional and District Level Monitoring
      visits were generally more regular and better sustained.

      Implementation of the MIS sub-component raised some concern. By December 2005, eight months to
      final project completion, MIS training of supervisors had been undertaken in only five of ten regions;
      supervisors in the remaining five regions received their training in January 2006.

      MIS templates which were to be installed on regional computers in the second quarter of 2006 (after
      re-scheduling several times ) to allow for processing of data at regional level for inclusion into the
      national EMIS of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sports(MOESS) was again delayed due to
      inadequate funding.

      By project completion, final training, data capture and analysis had not been undertaken because of
      the delay in the installation of the MIS templates on regional computers. Thus, the integrated MIS,
      which was to drive data collation and information dissemination for the implementation and reporting
      on NFLP 2, was not consistently implemented. A five ­week data capture was, however, undertaken
      in 2004 to develop the base data for Batches 8 and 9 learners.

      The Annual Learner Assessment indicator was similarly not consistently undertaken. During
      programme implementation, one Learner Assessment was undertaken in 2004. However, the Mid-
      Term Tracer Study provided results of further Learner Achievement indicators. The Mid-Term Tracer
      Study (June 2006), was itself completed only a few months to project completion.

2.6   Support for Literacy Classes through Radio Broadcasting
      Implementation of the component started late in the second half of 2004. Memoranda of
      Understanding were signed with 18 radio stations which were then provided with supplemental
      equipment such as tape recorders, editing suites, and motorcycles in exchange for the literacy
      programming over the long term. Appropriate training was also provided. The more rural target areas
      of the programme (the Northern Regions) were not sufficiently represented because of the limited
      number of radio stations in that part of the country. Selection of radio stations was informed by an
      Expansion Feasibility Study that assessed radio coverage and its relevance to the NFLP.

      Impact Assessment Study to determine effectiveness of radio progress was undertaken only towards
      the end of the project, and as result the findings could not inform project implementation. However,
      since the programme is continuing beyond IDA funding, the information could still be used.

      Radio sets were distributed to classes nationwide, but findings during field visits showed that in some
      cases class radios were in the possession of district coordinators rather than in classes. The situation
      improved later and in the Mid-Point Tracer Study, 73% of facilitators reported that classes had radio
      sets.


                                                    49
2.7   Enhancing Management and Institutional Capacity
      Following the political transition, implementation of Component 6 was satisfactorily launched in
      2002.

      The quantitative and qualitative targets set for Management and Institutional Capacity were all
      achieved by programme completion. The NFED restructuring study was completed in 2002, paving
      the way for the re-opening of 110 NFED district offices and appointment of district coordinators.
      Clear selection criteria and job descriptions in the restructuring study were applied in appointments.
      At headquarters positions, structures, roles were reviewed to pave the way for restructuring.
      Implementation included clarification of staff positions and roles as well as unit responsibilities. In a
      few cases departments had only departmental heads as sole staff until project completion. Most
      training programmes were, however, completed.

      The implementation of the English Pilot reflected a successful collaboration with local NGOs, in this
      case with World Vision. The NFED worked with World Vision to revise, upgrade five Basic Literacy
      Manuals and six Instructional Manuals. The two institutions also jointly undertook a nationwide
      sample monitoring of English Classes and a Baseline and Needs Assessment Study for the Pilot
      Vocational English Project.

      NFED also collaborated with GRATIS foundation, another NGO, in the implementation of the
      Income Generating sub-component. In 2003, GRATIS Foundation provided training to 15 NFED
      IGA staff as well as 130 viable IGA group leaders from the non-formal classes. By the first quarter of
      2005, 35 groups had received micro financing (about ¢272 million as seed money) and 65 groups also
      received micro credits totaling ¢260 million in a pilot in Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Ashanti
      and Volta regions. Follow- up monitoring visits indicated that about 70 percent were able to operate
      profitably and pay back.

      At programme completion in August, MOESS was in the process of soliciting additional funding
      from Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP) to support IGA for functional literacy
      learners.


3.    FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

3.1   Disbursement
      The budget for NFLP 2 was $46.0 million, with the bank component of US$32.0 million. The credit
      became effective early 2000, but the project never really took off until 2002. The project closure date
      was later extended by 21 months. Reallocation of funds among categories was undertaken on April
      28, 2006, and by project completion in August 2006, funds were fully disbursed. Disbursement was
      mostly centralized at NFED Headquarters, though funds transfer for regional and district operations
      were undertaken very swiftly. Disbursements over the project duration were as follows:


              Year                                           US$
              1999                                            -
              2000                                      1,535,267.82
              2001                                        562,351.85
              2002                                      4,544,429.10
              2003                                      2,885,674.45
              2004                                      7,902,003.45
              2005                                    12,175,403.44
              2006                                       5,428,209.89
              TOTAL                                           35,033,340.00
                                                    50
3.2   Replenishment
      Replenishment from the credit to the Project Account was very prompt. In most cases replenishments
      were made within one week of the receipt of applications. A total 148 withdrawal applications were
      made from which 127 replenishments (including direct payments to suppliers and contractors) were
      made to the project. Of the 127, 19 were direct payments to suppliers and contractors from the Bank
      in Washington.

3.3   Financial Management and Accounting
      At the apex, the Funds and Procurement Management Unit of the Ministry of Education, Science and
      Sports provided a comprehensive oversight and implementation leadership. An accounts department
      was also established within NFED headed by a Chief Accountant. Finance officers were recruited and
      trained at the Regional and district levels to ensure greater levels of effectiveness. Further, a clear
      definition of the work schedule of the accounting staff was undertaken to strengthen the financial
      management. The financial management system was also fully computerized.

      The overall project financial management was considered adequate and satisfactory. It had an
      accounting procedures manual which guided the accounting staff. The internal control systems in
      place were also generally adequate and effective.

3.4   Monitoring and Supervision
      Funds and resources were disbursed to the Regional and District offices from NFED headquarters in
      Accra. The regions and districts employed the resources in the execution of planned and approved
      eligible activities and subsequently submitted monthly reports to NFED Headquarters on these
      activities.

      NFED did not produce Financial Management Reports nor periodic control reports to aid
      management decision making. Exercises conducted by the Bank, however, found the existence of
      adequate procedures for approval and authorization, satisfactory records management, adequate
      financial management, internal control and accounting systems.

4.    PROCUREMENT
4.1   Objective, Processes and Guidelines
      Programme implementation arrangement was designed to accommodate elaborate annualized
      procurement plans with the institutional structure and arrangements for delivery. The Funds and
      Procurement Management Unit (FPMU) of MOESS played a key integrative role in the development
      of procurement and disbursement plans.
      The processes used closely followed World Bank format and procedures for various categories of
      procurement, including International Competitive Bidding, National Competitive Building, Selective
      Tendering, etc., The selection of the mode of tendering were all based on the levels of expenditure,
      budget or cost as set out in the Procurement Plan and expenditure guidelines at the beginning of the
      project. In all cases World Bank templates were used in the bidding process


      The project procurement process followed the World Bank guidelines as set out in the Bank's latest
      edition of January 1999. Regular supervisory and monitoring visits by the Bank ensured that the
      guidelines were strictly adhered to.




                                                   51
4.2   Key Issues
      Key issues which came up in the procurement process included i/ nullification of initial bids resulting
      from stalling of programme between 2000 and 2002 ii/ lack of synchronization in the procurement of
      related components and categories iii/ and the long process of ICB relative to NCB and other modes
      of procurement.
      The break in procurement resulting from interruption in programme implementation between 2000
      and 2002 made procurement to lag behind other aspects of programme implementation and affected
      procurement up to programme completion. Indeed, this necessitated reallocation of funds in April
      2006 in favour of goods and services that could be procured before programme completion in August.
      With all initial tendering processes that were undertaken between 1999 and 2000 nullified when the
      programme resumed in 2002, procurement became the bottleneck of the entire programme.
      The break in procurement also resulted in the lack of synchronization in the procurement of various
      goods and services. For example, in many cases, learner recruitments and facilitator training were
      completed without the teaching and learning materials in place. Classes could therefore not
      commence, and facilitators tended to forget what they had learnt at training.
      The long process of ICB invariably contributed to the two other issues discussed above. The other
      procurement processes were easily expedited to match corresponding activities in project
      implementation. ICB could not be expedited in the same way.


5.    CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES

      Capacity building under NFLP 2 was massive. Over 7000 Facilitators and Supervisors were trained
      annually on how to handle the Basic as well as English classes; Headquarters, regional and district
      officers were trained on MIS; a further 110 district officers were trained in MicroFinance/ Credit.
      Other capacity building programmes undertaken included:


                      Training of Trainers programmes organized for various categories of staff and
                      collaborators covering 30 Trainers of the Central Training Team; 105 Trainers of
                      Regional Training Teams; and 442 Trainers of District Training Teams. This
                      category of training preceded training of facilitators for each Basic Literacy Cycle
                      and for English Classes;

                      Staff Capacity Enhancement Training Programmes, covering specialized training for
                      Media Officers, IGA Officers, Monitoring and Evaluation Officers, Logistics and
                      MIS Officers and MIS Supervisors;

                      Training in Basic Accounting and Administrative Procedures for 10 Regional and
                      110 District Coordinators; and

                      NFED collaborated with GRATIS foundation in 2003 to train15 NFED IGA staff as
                      well as 130 viable IGA group leaders from the non-formal classes; 234 groups and
                      were trained in Basic Management; and 50 groups were trained in Bee Keeping. In
                      addition, 130 Regional and District staff and 120 Supervisors were trained in IGA,
                      while a further 110 District Officers were trained in Micro Finance / Credit.

6.    EVALUATION OF THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE

      Lending
      i/     Identification
      Based on recommendations from the implementation of NLFP 1, the Government of Ghana
      approached IDA to fund NFLP Phase 2 (1999-2006)
                                                   52
        Within the framework of IDA's overall Country Assistance Strategy(CAS 1999-2003) for Ghana and
        its orientation towards becoming a `listening bank', the GoG request was supported.

        The Bank's previous experience in Ghana's education sector, and the prior experience in the design
        of NFLP Phase 1 provided the necessary basis for cooperation and support to MOESS. The Bank
        then provided technical and specialist input at MOESS' request and offered relevant peer review of
        draft documents.

        IDA thus effectively supported GoG's program request, and provided technical and peer support.

(ii)    Project Preparation
        The Bank's support to MOESS/NFED in NFLP 2 included providing a high level of technical and
        specialist assistance. The Bank worked with GoG to set the Development Objective and Measurable
        Outcome Indicators. The operational objectives and the associated output indicators for program
        delivery were also appropriate in measuring the implementation of programme components and
        categories.

        To ensure effective programme implementation, the Bank worked with GoG to design and agree on
        implementation arrangements that worked. A major design adequacy of NFLP 2 was that the output
        and outcome indicators were easily measurable as the project was being implemented (e.g. setting
        enrolment targets to ensure that each literacy cycle had 60 % enrolment of women).The preparation
        of NFLP 2 also conformed to the Bank's safeguard policies.

(iii)   Project Appraisal
        The Bank's appraisal of NFLP 2 was thorough. Stakeholder involvement and participation formed a
        fundamental aspect, given that the project was a direct request from beneficiaries and GoG, and the
        Bank's role was only to support a viable request.

        The capacity of NFED/MOESS to implement NFLP 2 was assessed. NFED was set up to implement
        the literacy program; and the programme was core to its existence and activities. The Funds and
        Procurement Management Unit (FPMU) was also in place to support the procurement and financial
        management activities.

        From the time of Bank appraisal, the sustainability of NFLP 2 was never in doubt, given existing
        institutional structure and arrangements for the literacy programme. A remarkable aspect of the
        project appraisal was the effectiveness of credit and project in February 2000, soon after the signing
        of loan agreement in November 1999.

        Supervision
        The Bank made use of missions and other monitoring mechanisms, e.g. quarterly and other
        implementation reports for effective supervision of the project. Supervision missions exceeded the
        stipulated semi-annual visits. While two supervisory missions were held in 2000, 2001, 2004 and
        2005, four missions
        were undertaken in 2002 and three in 2003 immediately following the period of implementation
        difficulties. One mission was held in 2006, and in addition an ICR mission at project conclusion.

        The rich mix and diversity of specialists on the Bank missions was a clear indication of the high level
        of supervision exercised by the Bank. At various times, the Bank's team comprised specialists such
        as Education Specialist, Education Economist, Procurement Specialist, Financial Management
        Specialist, Monitoring & Evaluation Specialist; etc.

        The Task Leader, in between missions, continued the Bank's supervision, with unmatched interest in
        the successful implementation of the project.
                                                     53
     Quarterly Joint Implementation Meetings between MOESS, NFED and the Bank, monitoring reports
     and other specific reports, quarterly progress reports, specific implementation reports were some
     other means of supervision and monitoring the Bank relied on throughout project implementation.

     NFED/MOESS benefited immensely from timely advice from the Bank in resolving some critical
     issues that could have marred project implementation. For example, to break the impasse in project
     implementation between 2000 and 2002 following change of government, the Bank issued a pre mid-
     term report that acted as a catalyst and contributed greatly in the resumption of project activities.

     Successful disbursement of the credit facility by programme completion demonstrated the level of
     advice offered by the Bank and essential follow up of agreed actions during programme
     implementation.

     Another important area of the Bank's supervision process was enforcement of loan covenants in the
     project agreement. No covenants were flouted over the entire implementation period.

     The Bank showed flexibility during project implementation, perhaps aided by the evolvement from a
     lead-role player to that of a "listening bank". For example, the Bank supported institutional reforms
     during project implementation; granted two extensions to project completion date; and finally
     allowed for category re-allocation towards the end of the project to ensure that funds were re-
     allocated for activities to be completed.

     Aide Memoires were also provided on schedule and these were thoroughly discussed with the
     implementing agency before being issued.

     Through close supervision, the Bank ensured that there were no deviations from its policies and
     procedures. As indicated earlier on, the nature of the National Functional Literacy Programme with
     class-oriented learning, meant there were limited issues regarding safeguard policies.

     With support from the Funds and Procurement Management Unit the procurement arrangements
     specified in the loan agreement were strictly adhered to with the Bank's supervision. Disbursement
     was equally well supervised, though cost overruns were recorded in some categories prior to category
     re-allocation. In cases where procurements/disbursements were not referred to the Bank for `No
     Objection', these were funded from GoG sources.

     Overall Bank Performance
     The Bank's performance was rated Highly Satisfactory in Project Preparation, Project Appraisal and
     Supervision. It was rated Satisfactory in Project Identification, which was actually initiated by
     NFED/MOESS.

7.   EVALUATION OF GHANA GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE

     NFLP 2 was developed under one government and implemented under another, but the macro-
     economic policies were not adversely affected. Indeed, the macro-economic environment of the
     project rather improved. Though no specific macro-economic performance targets were set for the
     project duration, indicators such as GDP, inflation, currency stabilization and interest rates all
     improved remarkably over the implementation period.

     Education sector policies were similarly steady and consistent with the country's Short and Medium
     Term Sectoral Strategies. Basic education and adult literacy continued to receive greater levels of
     government support over the period, including improvements in government recurrent budget
     allocation both to the non-formal education and the overall education sector.

     Over the period 2000 to 2006, Government policy on Poverty Reduction assumed wider and deeper
     dimensions. Ghana opted for the Highly Indebted and Poor Country Initiative by the World Bank;
     implemented appropriate policies and strategies; and reached the HIPC completion, which event
     paved the way for debt relief to address further poverty reduction and growth. The country's medium
     term development strategy was also restructured as Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy under
     GPRS II to further re-emphasize government's commitment to poverty reduction and growth.

     Additionally, support from the GoG to the NFLP 2 was in areas of decentralizing regional and district
     non-formal education activities; supervising the fulfillment of effectiveness conditions included in the
     loan conditions, such as FPMU financial management procedures manual, operational manual;
     recruiting qualified accounts staff; appointment of professionally qualified Principal NFED
     Accountant; and ensuring timely disbursement of counterpart funding.

     GoG ensured adequate provision of counterpart funding and made sure these were planned for in
     advance in the context of overall government budgetary and allocations to the sector.

     Following the impasse at early stages of implementation, the new Government accepted full
     responsibility for the project and supported the implementation process. Decentralisation of NFED
     structures, restructuring, implementation of the various components of the project were implemented
     with the full commitment of MOESS.

     While GoG provided support, there was limited interference with the implementation arrangements.
     The exception was the period of impasse between 2000 and 2002 when it took the new incoming
     government time to learn what the NFED and the NFLP aimed to achieve.

8.   LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMMENDATIONS



     1.      NFLP 2 was to be implemented from 1999 to 2004, but never really took off until 2002.
             After the resolution of the impasse, the original completion date of 2004 was maintained.
             This created implementation constraints and problems ­ and NFED was overwhelmed with
             the task of completing a well-designed 5- year programme in less than 3 years. Even though
             the project closure date was later extended for 21 months, the compressed implementation
             schedule influenced strategies used and adversely affected overall implementation and
             outcomes.

             In retrospect, programme extension date should have been sought in 2002 for the normal 5-
             year schedule to run. However, Bank extensions are only granted towards the end of the
             project. The accelerated implementation to beat programme closure dateline affected
             implementation of some components.

             It would appear useful to normalize implementation time for projects that encounter setback
             in early stages of implementation to ensure thorough implementation in line with the original
             schedule in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

     2.      The re-allocation of funds among categories towards programme
             completion appeared to favour activities that could be speedily implemented, to the
             disadvantage of those that could not be completed so close to programme closure. This
             affected implementation of some components.



                                                   55
3.   Programme Implementation was beset with weak coordination of the various components,
     perhaps because of the initial shortened implementation period. For example on several
     occasions logistics to classes were supplied late, long after facilitators' training. Throughout
     implementation, training activities were not in tandem with other activities. The long
     procurement arrangements, e.g. the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) used for most
     classes of inputs made the synchronization even more difficult.

     In future programmes, training courses should not be run until other components (e.g. class
     enrolment, supply of logistics) are also ready for implementation.

4.   For the English Pilot Classes, supervisors had limited idea about the operations, methodology
     and facilitation as they had not been trained. Supervisors thus often went on supervisory
     visits without first determining what to look out for.

     Generally, supervisors should be trained along with facilitators so expectations can be
     managed. For the English Pilot Class, the methodology of facilitating English in literacy
     classes should be incorporated into future training programmes for Zonal Supervisors of the
     local language programme.

5.   Disbursement records were not compiled according to Component on which reporting is
     undertaken, but rather according to Categories. Figures could, therefore, not be compiled for
     some Tables in the Implementation Completion Report.

     In future, records should be compiled in Components as well from
     the beginning of disbursement to afford sound basis of comparison with projections in the PA
