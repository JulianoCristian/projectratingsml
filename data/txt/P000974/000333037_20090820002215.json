{"cdata!": "Ratings for the National Functional\n            Literacy Project (NFLP) for Ghana were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: launching a project in times of elections\n            can critically affect project implementation. There is a\n            need to adequately mitigate the impact of political changes\n            on project design and implementation. The NFLP suffered\n            considerable period of delay due to the fact that the impact\n            of elections were not mitigated. Broad stakeholder\n            participation, including political parties, together with\n            strengthened dissemination can somewhat mitigates these\n            risks. Ensuring adequate staff levels are necessary during\n            implementation. Furthermore, the integration of functional\n            literacy programs in the strategic and monitoring framework\n            of education, and a focus on staffing at regional and\n            district levels, will effectively improve operations.\n            Effective donor support in designing, planning, monitoring,\n            and evaluation of the implementation process is necessary\n            for achieving and disseminating results, and establishing\n            demand for literacy and other non-formal programs.\n            Partnership with other literacy providers and stakeholders\n            in the area of facilitating training activities opened more\n            avenues for learning, and sharing experiences. It also\n            strengthened the performance of training programs.\n            Continuing monitoring of the learners to see if they retain\n            literacy achievements is important. It is additionally\n            worthwhile to exhibit desired development behaviors. Improve\n            targeting mechanisms, strongly follow outcomes, adjust\n            operations and even expected results when it is relevant."}, "docdt": "2007-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
