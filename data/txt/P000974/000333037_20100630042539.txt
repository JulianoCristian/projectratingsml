About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
 instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
 ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http:lhnrorldbank.orglieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
       This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the second phase of
Ghana's National Functional Literacy Project (NFLP 11). The total project cost at closing was
US$46 million and financed through the IDA Credits No. 32460 and No. 3246A in the amount of
US$33.9 million (SDR23.7 million). The NFLP I1 was approved by the Bank's Board on June
17, 1999, became effective 14 months later, on August 15,2000, and closed on August 3 1,2006,
20 months after its original closing date of December 3 1,2004.

        The report was prepared by Victoria Monchuk. The key sources of evidence on which
this PPAR relies are World Bank project files; government project reports and evaluations; and
independent published and un-published project assessments. The PPAR is also based on
interviews conducted during a mission to Ghana in March, 2009, with government officials,
development partners, and members of civil society who were knowledgeable of Bank support in
the area of adult literacy, and with Bank staff and consultants at headquarters and in the Ghana
Country Office. The IEG team conducted field visits in the Greater Accra, Northern and Ashanti
regions of Ghana where it met with regional and district program officers, facilitators and
beneficiary groups. The report also draws on the qualitative assessment analysis from 15 focus
groups with NFLP I1 participants prepared by Ms. Elizabeth Asante, IEG mission member. The
IEG team gratefully acknowledges all those who made time for interviews and provided
documentation and information. Mission support by Ms. Rose Abena Ampadu in the Ghana
Office was also greatly appreciated. Janice Joshi, Marie-Jeanne Ndiaye, and Viktoriya
Yevsyeyeva provided administrative support.

      Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR have be sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for review and comments. Their comments are presented in
Annex E.
 Summary
 Background

The government of Ghana's current long-term development approach became formalized in the
mid- 1990s. In the area of human development the government took a broad-based approach
including improving the access to basic services especially for the poor, women, and in deprived
areas. In the education sector, reducing illiteracy was a national priority. In the mid-1990s the
government, through the Non-Formal Education Department (NFED), implemented the first
functional literacy program supported by the Bank. When it closed in 1997 it had enrolled 1.3
million adults and trained them in basic literacy and functional skills (in areas such as health,
nutrition, sanitation, and environmental cleanliness).

But despite reaching its targets, disparities in schooling between men and women remained and
deprived regions such as the north lagged behind. In 1997 the national adult literacy rate was 48
percent but only 28 percent for rural women. The experience of the first project showed that
literacy programs need to become more relevant to participants' needs, strengthen quality of
delivery and monitoring and evaluation arrangements, and encourage a strong literate
environment after completion of the literacy training.

The Ghana National Functional Literacy Project (IVFLP ZI) (IDA-32460 and 3246A) disbursed
US$33.9 million of the IDA credit (total project cost was US$44.9 million) and was designed as
a follow-on to the first phase of the project (1992-97), taking into account the challenges of the
previous program and sectoral constraints in mind. The project's development objective was: "to
increase the number of Ghanaian adults (15-45 years), particularly women and the rural poor,
who acquire literacy and functional skills. In the credit agreement the objective was stated: "to
assist the Borrower in delivering quality, cost-effective basicfunctional literacy skills inmeen
national languages to about one million adults, particularly women and the rural poor.

Relevance and Design

The objectives of the NFLP ZI were consistent with the government's Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy (2000-02) which focused on poor people's capacity to earn incomes. Female literacy
rates were recognized as a key indicator on human development performance. A core component
of the government's 2003 education strategy was to offer adult literacy programs. In the
following Poverty Reduction Strategy (2006-09) the priority of improving literacy rates
remained, although the focused shifted away from adult literacy programs to other formal and
non-formal mechanisms. Based on the evolving but continuous relevance of the project
objectives to Ghana's priorities and needs, relevance of objectives is rated substantial.

The core project design rested on teaching basic literacy and functional skills to adults in 15
Ghanaian languages. In addition, the project aimed at strengthening the radio broadcasting
component as well as the broader literate environment in order to better sustain project outcomes
in the long run.Also the project was designed to improve monitoring and evaluation activities
and management and institutional processes. Finally, participant groups would be encouraged to
undertake income generating activities (IGAs), such as animal rearing, palm oil processing or
mat-weaving, and the project would deliver a pilot on English literacy based on demand.
Relevance of design is rated as substantial. Inadequate attention to demand constraints in the
north, and significant political risk were the main shortcomings. Overall the design logic of the
project was strong and the results framework, despite weaknesses, was above the norm for non-
formal projects.

Implementation

The credit became effective on August 15,2000 and closed on August 3 1,2006. The NFLP 1       1
suffered serious implementation delays for three different reasons: disagreement over the legal
signature of the credit agreement on behalf of the government; hesitations by the new
government about the objectives of the NFED; and a restructuring of the implementing agency.
At closing the credit was 98 percent disbursed.

Monitoring and evaluation, although sufficient in design, lagged behind in implementation. The
system was greatly improved from the first phase. Two learner assessments were carried out and
one tracer study. Utilization of the findings was substantial. Therefore, monitoring and
evaluation quality was substantial.

Outcome and Efficiency

The objectives of the NFLP I1 can be broken down into three sub-objectives. The first sub-
objective delivering basic literacy and functional skills in 15 national languages to one million
adults, especially women and the rural poor ages 15-45, was substantially achieved. The project
reached its objectives on enrollment and drop-out rates. It was well targeted to women in the
productive age group and in rural areas. Although 60 percent of participants were from the north,
as planned, the project experienced difficulties enrolling northern women.

Second, the project substantially reached its objective of providing basic literacy and functional
skills. The project has helped improve literacy skills in Ghana but did not reach its target of
making 70 percent of participants functionally literate. This was mainly a result of the poorly
grounded targets, especially on writing. Although the achievement targets were only met in
reading and strongest for participants who had previously been formally schooled, there were
significant positive improvements made in writing and numeracy. Participants also undertook
development activities, although most participants were already engaged in these prior to the
project. Moreover, the project has lead to behavioral change and better awareness in areas such
as health and child care, schooling of children, and decision making and participation.

Thirdly, the objective of delivering quality and cost-effective training was modestly achieved.
Although quality of literacy delivery was enhanced through the project as envisioned, much of
the capacity development and implementation upgrades occurred late and only those batches of
participants that enrolled in the later stages could benefit. Unit cost calculations for the NFLP 1 1
lie in the mid-range of similar projects in other countries. But these data significantly
underestimate the true cost of literacy delivery as baseline levels of literacy and functional skills
are not accounted for.
Given the modest cost-effectiveness and likely overestimation of the project's rate of return due
to decreases in the return to education and lack of labor mobility among the participants,
efficiency is rated modest.

Ratings

Outcome of the NFLP I1 is rated moderately satisfactory. This rating is based on substantial
relevance, modest efficiency, and substantial achievement of two objectives and modest
achievement of the third. The project likely contributed to reductions in illiteracy and to progress
on other development goals albeit to a smaller extent than anticipated. However, evaluations of
project performance are not rigorous enough to confidently attribute improvements to the
project. The achievements were made mainly thanks to the knowledge of the shortcomings from
the first phase, strong and committed NFED leadership, and timely Bank supervision.

Risk to development outcomes is significant. Following the end of Bank support in 2006, class
and batch sizes have dwindled, fewer facilitators were recruited, and infrastructure deteriorated.
Although the government's commitment to reducing illiteracy is strong, sustainability of literacy
gained from adult literacy programs in general is notoriously low. Moreover, the IEG mission
found that difficulties in accessing micro-credit limited the sustainability of IGA groups and
therefore also reduced the potential for additional family income. The sustainability of functional
skills and behavior changes is likely to be higher.

Bank performance was satisfactory both at entry and during supervision. Borrower performance
was moderately satisfactory. Although the implementing agency delivered, their capacity was
generally low throughout most of the project and poor initial government support caused major
delays and inefficiencies.

Lessons

       The NFLP 1 demonstrated that non-formal education projects, such as adult literacy and
                    1
       skills projects, can build results fiameworkr linked to            achievement and test
       scores. Many similar non-formal projects in other countries have not built in tests of
       participant achievement in project design but rely on participant enrollment and
       graduation rates for assessing project objectives. Even though the NFLP I1 targets were
       not well grounded in reliable pre-tests and could not be fully reached, the project was
       able to demonstrate that participants' literacy improved significantly over the course of
       the project (see paragraphs 4.3 and 6.8).
       Even in a demand-driven project such as the NFLP II, context specijk factors may
       reduce uptake in deprived regions. Although literacy and skills training is highly
       demanded by poor communities on the national level, it was well known that demand
       was lower in the three deprived northern regions. Here, the project experienced
       difficulties in meeting its enrollment targets, especially for women. In certain local
       contexts, providing incentives and reducing barriers to participation are necessary for
       stimulating demand in parallel to supplying training (see paragraphs 5.4 and 6.9).
Literacy and functional skills projects that involve income generating activities should
build continuous support for IGA groups into design in order to enhance sustainability of
skills. Over half of the NFLP I1 learners participated in an IGA group. The possibility of
earning an income was an important driver for learners to participate in the literacy and
skills program. Engaging in an IGA also exposes participants to activities in which they
can make use of literacy and nurneracy skills. But IGA groups, generally small and
resource poor, are highly dependent on access to finance and markets for sustaining their
activities. Providing training and access to credit and markets needs to be better built into
project design to increase the chances of the sustainability of income generation as well
as of literacy skills (see paragraphs 5.15-16, 5.22 and Box 3).

1. Background and Context
Economic Development History
1.1     Ghana is a country of great ethnic and linguistic diversity. It has over 55 languages. The
economy relies heavily on agriculture income1and a large share of the population lives in rural
areas. In the 1980s, transitioning Ghana from the post-independence era military regime, the
Rawlings government introduced tough economic reforms. In the 1990s, the economy was
characterized by persistent reliance on exports of a few primary products (cocoa, gold, and
timber). Plagued by high inflation and interest rates, currency depreciation and a large debt,
economic growth fluctuated (Figure 1). Despite economic fluctuations, poverty incidence
dropped from 50 to 40 percent during the same period.

 1.2    Ghana's long term development strategy began in the mid-1990s with the Ghana Vision
2020-a 25 year perspective for improving wellbeing. The Medium Term Development Plan
(MTDP 1997-2000) focused on economic growth, human development, rural and urban
development and the development of an enabling environment (Government of Ghana 2003). In
the area of human development the government took a broad-based approach including
improving the access to basic services especially for the poor, women, and in deprived regions.
Efforts also focused on improving rural productivity and promoting income generating activities
for the poorest. In 2003, the government produced the first Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy

'In 1990 45 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) came from agriculture; by 2008 the share had dropped to 32
percent (World Bank 20 10).
(GPRS 2003-05). The GPRS placed a heavy emphasis on reducing inequities, improving
economic growth, and alleviating poverty. In the early 2000s the government started to partner
with civil society in service delivery, but it was not until 2004 (also stated in the 2004 Country
Assistance Strategy, CAS) that the involvement of private providers and Non-Governmental
Organizations (NGOs) for more efficient service delivery was really emphasized. The GPRS
2003-05 also prioritized programs which helped the poor, especially poor women, gain access to
credit and skills upgrading. At the same time the government began efforts to decentralize both
administration and financing of programs to the district level and to move some of the power to
district assemblies and local governments.

Education Sector - Priorities, Spending and Outcomes
1.3    The Rawlings government strongly emphasized reducing illiteracy as a national priority.
The education sector strategy was two-pronged including increasing access and quality of basic
education while improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of adult literacy service delivery.
But around the year 2000, government social expenditure was tilted toward non-discretionary
spending, particularly salaries, and public spending on health and education was rather regressive
(Government of Ghana 2003). Education expenditures as a share of GDP were low compared to
other African countries.*

1.4    With the new government3coming to power in early 2001, education as a means for
reducing poverty and strengthening growth remained a priority. Ghana joined the Education for
All (EFA) Fast Track Initiative (FTI). Education strategies were viewed as an engine for growth
through their goal of increasing productivity. In the first few years of the new millennium,
education expenditures increased gradually. Basic education (primary and secondary schooling,
grades 1- 12) was the main recipient of the increased funds.

 1.5    Due to the heightened priority of basic education, Ghana made improvements in school
outputs and outcomes. After 1985 more Ghanaians attended and completed school.' Gender
disparities and differences in schooling between the poor and the non-poor narrowed slightly,
especially in post-primary education. From 1988 to 2003 the gender gap in years of schooling
was cut in half.' However, regional disparities persisted and rural boys were four times as likely
to attend school compared to rural girls (Government of Ghana 2003). Cost and the need to work
were the main reasons for children not attending school in rural areas (World Bank 2004a).

1.6    English is the main language in school nationwide. English literacy increased among
children but adult literacy rates were relatively stagnant during the 1990s (Figure 2). Increased
school quality was the main contributor (57 percent) to the increase in literacy rates between

 In 1999 government expenditure on education was 2.9 percent of GDP but increased to 5.0 in 2006 (IMF 2009).
On average in sub-Sahara African countries, government spending on education was 4.4 percent of GDP in 1999
and 4.6 in 2006 (IMF 2009)
 In 2000 Ghana's first democratic elections were held.
  Primary enrollment and completion rates (ages 15 and above) rose from 20.6 and 4.8 percent, respectively, in 1985
to 28.6 and 6.6 percent in 2000 (World Bank 2004a).
 In 1988 the expected years of schooling for men aged 25-34 years old was 60 percent higher than for women (7.8
and 4.9 years). In 2003 the gap was to only 30 percent (World Bank 2004a).
1988 and 2003 (IEG 2004). Rural women, however, remained largely illiterate. In 1997, the
national literacy rate was 48 percent, while for women it was 36 percent. Fifty-five percent of
rural men were considered literate, but only 28 percent of rural women (World Bank 1997). Box
1 summarizes the theoretical links between literacy and economic growth.

Box 1. Literacy, Incomes and Growth-the Theory
World-wide, as a country develops illiteracy generally declines when more children enroll in school.
However, in rural areas and among deprived population groups high illiteracy rates often persist as access
to education is limited. Over time, disparities of this sort may continue to grow and negatively affect
incomes as large deprived groups are persistently falling behind national averages. The inability to read,
write, and count limits participation in the labor market, constrains income generation, and slows farm
and non-farm productivity. Research shows that literate adults are more effective workers (see for
example Orbach and Delaney, 2004; OECD and Statistics Canada, 2000). This applies both to workers in
wage jobs and to the large majority of women and men in developing countries that are self-employed or
employed in the informal sector (World Bank, 2002). More informed workers and business owners use
better inputs, earn higher incomes, take advantage of credit options and hence benefit from higher welfare
and lower poverty. Moreover, low literacy rates have been shown to be negatively associated with human
development outcomes such as health status, fertility rates, child development and schooling and
women's empowerment. Literate adults raise better off children, and are able to participate more actively
in society. For a country such as Ghana, enjoying relative stability, low literacy rates are adversely
impacting growth.


The History of Adult Literacy Programs in Ghana - NFLP I
1.7     In Ghana, efforts to reduce illiteracy, especially in rural areas and among the poor and
socially excluded date back to colonial times. Starting in the 1950s, the independent government
introduced mass literacy campaigns but with limited success. The reasons for their poor
performance are plentiful; supply driven approaches without participant interest; poor links to
occupational and civic needs; and ineffective teaching methodologies (Aoki 2006).

1.8    Under the Rawlings regime eradicating illiteracy was declared a national priority and in
1991 the government established the Non Formal Education Division (NFED) in the Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) in order to implement adult literacy programs. The goal
was to eliminate illiteracy among the 5.6 million illiterates by the year 2015 (Owusu-Boampong
2007; Owusu-Mensah 2007). Eradicating illiteracy was considered a strategy for "empowering
people to develop themselves" (Aryeetey and Kwakye 2005 p. 5).

 1.9    The NFED developed the first phase of the National Functional Literacy Program (NFLP
     ~
I ) with the main objective to "improve economic opportunities and quality of life for the most
vulnerable and disadvantaged Ghanaians" (World Bank 1999, p. 3). The Bank supported the
$27.8 million program with a US$17 million IDA credit from 1992-97.7The NFLP I focused on
equipping the poorest Ghanaians adults8with basic literacy, numeracy, and new knowledge
through: (i) institutional support; (ii) research, monitoring and evaluation; (iii) classroom
teaching; (iv) a system of supervisors to monitor the progress of the participants and the
performance of the facilitators; (v) classroom materials and participant motivation; (vi) the

 Also called the Literacy and Functional Skills Project (LFSP).
'Norway also contributed financially and the UK, Canada and UNICEF provided technical support.
 The project was self targeting, around 60 percent of the learners were women, around 70 percent had had no
formal schooling. The average drop-out rate was 22 percent (World Bank 1998).
creation of a literate environment; (vii) radio studio and transmission facilities; (viii) post-
literacy classes; and, (ix) assisting NGOs and other Iiteracy providers with training and materials.

 1.10 When the NFLP I closed in 1997 it had enrolled 1.3 million adults (mainly between the
ages of 15-45) and trained them in literacy and functional skills in 15 Ghanaian languages.9A
large adult literacy program had been developed including a nationwide infrastructure for
implementation. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated the outcome of NFLP I as
Satisfactory. But national literacy rates remained stagnant around 50 percent between 1992 and
 1998 (GLSS, 1991/92 and 1998199). A beneficiary impact assessment by Korboe (1997) showed
that the project had some positive results in reading among adults'' and suggested that there may
have been some benefits in the areas of family planning, nutrition, and school enrollment of
children as a result of the NFLP I. Health benefits were weaker. On the other hand, Blunch and
Portner (2004) and Valerio (2003) who used Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) data, did
not find strong effects of previous literacy programs in Ghana on economic outcomes. Blunch
and Portner (2004) found a positive effect on consumption in households but only where no
member had formal schooling. Valerio (2003) also concludes that the impact of literacy
programs on employment cannot be verified. The GLSS data, however, do not measure the
duration and quality of the literacy programs attended by survey respondents. It is hence possible
that many of the individuals have participated in poor quality literacy training many years ago
and that any observed impacts were low andlor have diminished over time. Blunch and Portner
(2004) also point out that it is plausible that individuals, perhaps mainly women, attend literacy
training not for its expected economic benefits but for social and human capital building.

Adult Literacy Sectoral Issues
 1.11 In the early 2000s the progress towards joining of the EFA FTI included intensi@ing the
strategic dialogue on how to reach the goal of halving illiteracy by 2015. Quality and cost-
effectiveness of the existing NFLP program needed strengthening. Efforts also focused on
improving rural productivity and promoting income generating activities for the poorest. In 2000
the focus on poor peoples' capacity to earn incomes was strengthened in the government strategy
and female literacy rates were recognized as a core indicator for improving Ghana's human
development performance.

1.12        The main sectoral issues were:

           Illiteracy rates remained high among the rural poor, especially women, and there was a
           stock of young people lacking basic literacy skills. Illiteracy was highly correlated with
           location, income group and gender, It was highest among the poorest income quintiles, in
           rural and remote areas, and among women and girls. Even though primary enrollment
           rates had increased over the last two decades, inequalities were high. Moreover, low
           completion and learning achievement levels contributed to the stock of illiterate adults.



 In 2000 there were around five million illiterate adults (over the age of 15) in Ghana (UNESCOInstitute of
Statistics 2010).
lo   Learners could read out of the Bible and out of their textbooks.
         Basic literacy programs were of low relevance and quality. The evaluation of the NFLP I
         showed that it had had some positive effects for improving participants' literacy skills
         and boosted their awareness in important development areas (Korboe 1997). However,
         the evaluation recommended that the program be strengthened in the areas of relevance to
         participants' needs; selection and training of facilitators and supervisors; instructional
         quality aspects; and program monitoring and evaluation.
         Literacy skills needed to be sustained by creating a literate environment. The first phase
         of the program provided classes in 15 local languages and supplied continued reading
         materials to graduates. But post-literacy materials were difficult to produce and procure.
         NFED's capacity needed strengthening and it needed to collaborate with other literacy
         providers. NFED was the main provider of adult literacy in Ghana but the community of
         able NGOs is growing. There was an increasing-recognitionthat better collaboration on
         literacy activities was needed. Due to the fact that NFED was relatively recently founded,
         insecurity among staff was high and capacity was limited. The centralized program
         management system also had poor incentive structures for staff and inefficiencies were
         high.



2. Objectives and Design
2.1     NFLP I1 was designed as a follow-on to the NFLP I but with previous program
challenges and sectoral constraints in mind. The project was approved on June 17, 1999 and
became effective on August 15,2000." Between the closing of the NFLP I in 1997 and the start
up of the first batch12 (batch 8) of the NFLP I1 in 2000 there was a period of about two years
where NFED continued to supply classes without Bank support and on a smaller scale. After one
extension the NFLP I1 project closed on August 3 1,2006. The US$46 million NFLP I1 was
financed by an International Development Association (IDA) credit of SDR23.7 million ( U S 3 2
million equivalent) to the Government of Ghana. At closing, 98 percent of the hnds were
disbursed (World Bank 2007a). No other donors contributed to the NLFP I1 financially."

Objectives
2.2    The development objective as listed in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was "to
increase the number of Ghanaian adults (15-45 years), particularly women and the rural poor,


" The reason for the 14-month delay was disagreement over the contract signature on behalf of the government. The
credit agreement was signed by the World Bank President in October, 1999 during his visit to Ghana. In the absence
of the Minister of Education, the Upper West Regional Minister signed on behalf of the government. However, his
signature was not recognized by the Ministry of Finance. Consequently, the credit agreement had to be redrafted and
resigned.
l 2 The project delivered literacy and skills classes in five sequenced batches. The aim was to enroll around 200,000
adult learners in each batch. At closing, NFLP I1 covered six batches (8-13) of the NFED program. See Annex C.
l3 Participating communities and NGOs-such as World Vision Ghana, Action Aid, Ghana Institute of Literacy
Languages and Bible Translation (GILBT), and Care International-contributed to the project in kind (US$0.5
million).
who acquire literacy and functional skills" (World Bank 1999 p. 1).l 4 The credit agreement states
that the development objective was "to assist the Borrower in delivering quality, cost-effective
basic functional literacy skills in fifteen national languages to about one million adults,
particularly women and the rural poor". The objective in the PAD focuses on final outcomes in
terms of reducing adult illiteracy. The objective in the credit agreement focuses on improving the
literacy and skills activities undertaken by the government. These outputs would, in turn,lead to
reductions in the adult illiteracy outcomes. In assessing the achievement of the development
objective this report will consider both the outcome-oriented PAD objective and the output-
oriented credit agreement objective.

2.3    The key performance indicators listed in the PAD focused on final literacy outcomes. At
the end of the basic literacy cycle it was expected that 70 percent of enrolled adults would:

         be able to read and comprehend a short essay of three paragraphs in one of the 15
         selected local languages;
         be able to write a simple one-page letter in one of the 15 selected local languages;
         be able to perform simple calculations in four arithmetrical operations with numbers of
         up to one million;
         participate in development activities (such as community clean-up, bush fire prevention,
         etc.); and
         demonstrate behavioral change and civic awareness.

2.4      On the outputs side the project expected to enroll 200,000 participants in each cycle for a
total of one million participants; at least 40 percent of classes would be held in the north (Upper
East, Upper West and Northern regions), 60 percent of classes would be held in rural areas, and
60 percent of enrolled participants would be women. The project aimed at delivering classes in
15 local languages and English and to produce more reading materials through regional
mechanisms.

2.5     The quality and cost-effectiveness of the training would also be strengthened at many
different levels. This would be achieved via the institutional reforms and strengthening
supported by the project: a) developing an NFED policy framework, including decentralization
strategies; b) increasing collaboration with NGOs and other providers; c) facilitating obtaining
micro-credit for those groups who were engaged in income-generating activities (1GAs)-such as
animal rearing, palm oil processing, soap making, and fishing; d) establishing an effective
monitoring and evaluation system; and e) improving quality through training, materials
development, supervision, and a more efficient radio system.

Project Components
2.6     The project had seven components. Table 1 lists and describes each component and the
outcomes and outputs to be achieved. The project components and overall design were not
altered.

l 4 The program used UNESCO's definition of a functionally literate person as "one who can engage in activities in
which literacy is required for effective functioning of hislher group and community and also for enabling himher to
continue to use reading, writing and calculation for hisher own and the community's development."

Implementation Arrangements
2.7     Service Delivery: The NFLP I1 implementation unit was the NFED with supervision and
implementation support by the MoEYS. Outsourcing of delivery of literacy courses to NGOs
was discussed, but at the time of appraisal their capacity was deemed limited and phase I1 of the
project made use of the already established NFLP phase I infrastructure for course delivery and
program maintenance.

2.8      Coverage and targeting: The project was designed to cover all 10 regions of Ghana and
was labeled as self-targeting to the neediest groups-women, rural populations, and the
populations in the northern three regions-as they were considered the poorest and also the most
interested in participating in the program. The main target groups were 15-45 year olds. In this
regard, the program had the implicit objective of reducing inequalities in accessing literacy
training. Recruitment to the program was demand-based. As NFLP initiatives were well
developed and accepted in Ghana at this time, communities who had heard about the program
either through neighboring villages or through radio broadcasting, expressed their interest in
participating. NFED also undertook awareness-raising campaigns to advertize the benefits of
literacy. Communities would jointly make decisions on whether to adopt the program and start a
literacy group. They would also make decisions on class location, scheduling and intensity and
whether they wanted to engage in an income-generating activity. Classes would be coeducational
or for women only, with around 25-30 students per class.

2.9     Curriculum and instruction: The program length for each batch was 21 months and
totaled more than 300 hours. The integrated curriculum included basic literacy skills (reading,
writing and numeracy) for the purpose of using these skills in everyday life to improve the
welfare of families and communities. The literacy, life-skills, and developmental activities were
taught in classes via the use of two primers and follow-up readers. The primers included modules
that taught participants to form words and sentences while discussing common community issues
and practices. Moreover, the acquisition of life skills and participation in development activities
were encouraged. Life skills included learning about health care, family planning, personal
hygiene and safety, water and sanitation, children's schooling, empowerment and gender equity,
civic awareness, and improved agricultural and livelihood practices. Participants were
encouraged to form groups to undertake development activities, such as community clean-up,
bush fire prevention and tree planting, and to form small for-profit groups engaged in an income-
generating activity. The type of the activity chosen would depend on the group's interests and
the resources and markets available. The program also delivered an elective English literacy
program based on popular demand.

2.10 StafJing: Volunteer facilitators were recruited directly by communities. They were not
under NFED contracts nor did they receive pecuniary compensation from the NFED. Instead
they received incentives (such as bicycles, roofing sheets, and solar light supplies) at the end of
each training cycle. Facilitators were supervised by zonal coordinators who visited learning
groups every two weeks and reported to district officers. The district officers reported to 10
regional coordinators. Overall oversight was provided by Accra headquarters staff. Facilitators
and NFED staff were to receive training under the program.

2.1 1 Lessons learnedporn the earlier program reflected in design: The NFLP I1 factored in
several lessons from the earlier phase. These called for; increased flexibility of training to
participants' lives and needs; improved monitoring and evaluation arrangements; a review of the
practice of paying facilitators in-kind (instead of cash); and strengthened mechanisms for
creating a literate environment for the neo-literates.



3. Implementation
3.1     The NFLP I1 suffered serious delays for three reasons. First, the loan did not become
effective until August 15,2000, 14 months after approval (June 17, 1999), due to disagreement
over the government's signature (see footnote 11). During the long delay NFED undertook
preparatory work under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Participants in batch 8 started to
enroll in 1999 but without Bank support.
3.2     Secondly, when the new government was declared in October 2000, the extent to which it
would support literacy activities was uncertain, so the implementation of the core basic literacy
component was held back.15 Adult literacy initiatives in Ghana tend to be popular during times of
reform, but providing literacy and skills training to the poor have not been supported by all
political parties. Despite the uncertain political environment and the lack of clarity on the
appointment of the project director, implementation slowly took off towards the end of 2000.

3.3    Thirdly, the new government wanted to take a closer look at the project implementation
plan and, with the agreement of the Bank, a NFED restructuring study was launched.16 It was
agreed that activities that were not contingent on the restructuring" should be allowed to
continue without disruption. Regional offices remained closed,18however, and necessary
materials and supplies were not delivered to supervisors and learning groups.

3.4     Eventually, as the program started to show results and after much encouragement by the
Bank, government support grew stronger. The Kufor government in 2002 provided strong
support for continuing the program. In May 2003, a new Minister of Education with a strong
poverty focus and a more open mind towards adult literacy programs was appointed, which
ensured new commitment to literacy education and to the NFLP 11. Offering adult literacy
became a core component of the government's Education Strategic Plan in 2003. By 2003
classes became fully active, supplies that had been in storage were delivered, regional
coordinators were appointed and the planned tracer study was launched. In an attempt to make
up for lost ground 350,000 participants were enrolled in the 2003 cycle.

3.5     However, at the end of 2003 it became clear that due to the delays in the early part of the
project the development objective would not be reached by project closing in December 2004.
The implementation progress and project development objective were downgraded temporarily
by the Bank in 2003 and again in 2004. Ethnic conflict in the north also limited reaching the
target of launching 40 percent of classes in the three northern regions. Annex C lays out the
timing of Batches 8-13 of the basic literacy cycles supported by the project.

3.6    Implementation picked up in 2004 and, supported by the positive outcomes reflected in
the beneficiary assessment available in May 2004, the project closing date was extended to
August 3 1,2006. In May 2006, with the planned enrollment of Batch 13, it was assessed that all


l5 The new government viewed the non-formal education initiative as a political move by the former administration
to gain the support of the rural poor. The new government alleged the previous government to have used NFED
class supervisors in political campaigns.
l6 Imas consulting was contracted by the government to assess a potential restructuring of NFED. Imas found that
many staff were unqualified for their posts. Although staff training had taken place, it had been unstructured and
unrelated to needs. Inefficient practices wasted resources and supervision and financial and procurement processes
were weak. The report recommended downsizing staff, ensuring recruitment and retention of qualified staff,
improving NFED effectiveness, deepening collaboration with NGOs, strengthening of the MER unit, and creating an
updated non-political image for NFED.
l7 NFED was reorganized including a reduction in staff size, recruiting more qualified staff, and revision of titles
and the organizational structure.
l8 On July 3,2002 the MoEYS ordered all district and NFED regional offices to hand over their operations to district
and regional administrators during the restructuring exercise in order to bring in more qualified staff.
but one output target (percent of participants fiom northern regions) would be met or exceeded
and the development outcomes would be achieved in all areas but writing. Beyond program
completion the government allocated 175 billion Cedi (US$12.0 million using July 2009
exchange rates) fiom the 2006-08 budgets to continue non-formal education.

Costs and Financial Management
3.7     Total project costs were appraised at US$46 million in the PAD (Table 2). Of this the
Bank provided US$32 million or 70 percent. Sixty percent of project funds were allocated for the
core activities of providing basic literacy training. At closing, 98 percent of available credit and
106 percent of what was originally planned was disbursed. Due to the implementation delays
disbursements were slow to take off. Although project implementation picked up in 2003 and
2004, only 45 percent of funds were disbursed by November, 2004. Most of the h d s were used
in the extension phase.

3.8     Financial management and procurement experienced problems throughout the project.
NFED staff confirmed that the bidding documents and contracts with suppliers were not well
specified and that the quality of the goods delivered to the project was many times lower than the
samples reviewed. For instance, lighting, necessary for holding classes in the evening, was
problematic throughout the project. The solar lights lost battery power quickly and only lasted
for short periods of time. Hurricane lights required lots of kerosene to give out a sufficient
amount of light. Communities, which had to buy their own fuel, could not afford the expense.
NFED also had difficulties securing reliable service from radio stations.

3.9     Until 2003 and during the period when regional offices were closed, supplies and
learning materials were held in storage facilities. In some regions, especially in remote areas, the
distribution of supplies to classes was fbrther delayed by problems with the NFED motorcycles.
Regional staff from the northern regions complained to the IEG mission that they needed more
budget allocation for transportation and gasoline as distances in their regions were longer than in
other regions. It was also difficult to print and deliver post-literacy materials due to the lack of
print shops that could handle the Ghanaian languages. When the boxes with follow-up reading
materials finally reached the participants, they were often shared with other groups. In several of
the learning groups visited by the IEG mission only a few follow-up readers remained in the
community and most were being lent to other learning groups or held in district offices.
    4. Monitoring, Evaluation and Research
    4.1     Overall, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), although sufficient in design lagged in
    implementation. The Monitoring, Evaluation and Research (MER) system was greatly improved
    from the first phase, but training and installation of the MIS was slow. Two learner assessments
    were carried out and one tracer study. The planned follow-up up round to assess sustainability of
    skills and behaviors was not completed. Utilization of M&E findings was, however, substantial.
    Therefore, overall M&E quality is rated substantial.

    Design
    4.2    As discussed in section 2 the development objective was stated differently in the PAD
    (outcome-oriented) and in the credit agreement (output-oriented). However, the two objectives
    were not conflicting. Rather, the output-oriented objective would take place earlier in the results
    chain and lead to the outcome-oriented objective.

    4.3      The results framework of the project was developed based on the outcome-oriented
    objective stated in the PAD. Relevant indicators for outcomes were set and the 70 percent
'
    learning achievement targets were established based on tests of NFLP I participants in 1997."
    However, the NFLP I tests were known to be of sub-standard quality and, as these test
    instruments would be revised, the NFLP I test scores were not used as baseline. Instead, the
    planned learner assessments would test participants and selected non-participants at the start of
    the training cycle and serve as baseline for NFLP 11. The learning targets would have been more
    realistic if the project had linked test data before appraisal with the level of literacy that was
    expected on the outcome indicators (for example, read and comprehend a 3 page essay, write a 1-
    page letter) and calibrated standards based on those results. It is not clear how the achievement
    on the NFLP I test corresponded with the NFLP I1 outcome indicators. As a result, the 70 percent
    target on writing was far from being achieved and two of the targets (the percent of participants
    that demonstrate behavioral change and participate in developmental activities) were already
    achieved at the start of the training cycle. Few indicators were established for measuring the
    output-oriented project objective-delivering quality and cost-effective basic literacy and
    functional skills (for example, develop NFED decentralization strategies, collaborate with
    NGOs, and strengthening the monitoring and evaluation system and radio broadcasting). They
    were also vaguely defined often without targets and baselines.

    4.4     The link between the project components and activities and the outcome and output-
    oriented development objectives was logical, although there was no discussion of how increased
    cost-effectiveness would be achieved. At the same time as continuing to deliver literacy and
    functional skills training, the quality of the training would be strengthened. However, given that
    lack of capacity and resources had limited the quality of training and the information collected
    on its outcomes in the past, it would have been better if the institutional strengthening aspects of
    the project would have been more frontloaded.

      NFLP I tested learners during the last two years of the project. The tests showed that learners performed well on
    the writing, numeracy, attitudinal and functional sections but slightly worse on the reading section. The NFLP I ICR
    does not report test scores but the NFLP I1 PAD (p. 32 footnote 6) states that, on average, learners who sat for the
    test scored between 64-74 percent in the various tests.
 4.5     The MER system was built into the project as a component and divided into three parts.
 First, monitoring consisted of record keeping (feeding into the Management Information System,
 MIS) at the class, zone, district, and regional levels of the progress of the literacy classes and the
 achievement of outputs and attainment of targets. Regular supervision visits by headquarter,
 regional and district level staff were scheduled. Zonal coordinators would make two visits to
 each class per month. Facilitators would document attendance and learning progress for each
 class period. Under NFLP I1 data entry was to be gradually decentralized to regional and district
 offices with the procurement of computers and training on data entry. Monitoring records
 provided periodic information on enrollment, attendance, and instruction.

4.6     Secondly, evaluation consisted of learner assessments and tracer studies2' to measure
progress on the outcome indicators such as participants' achievement in reading, writing and
numeracy, participation in development activities, and participants' behavioral change. Tracer
studies were a new addition to the MER program in NFLP 11. They would survey a sample of
participants just before they start the class, at mid-point, at termination, and 1-2 years after the
completion of the literacy class. Information would be collected from the participants, household
members of participants, class facilitators, and community leaders. Also, a set of individuals,
similar to the participants and from the same communities, would be selected as a comparison
group. The purpose of the tracer studies was to measure the impact of the literacy class on
development indicators and to gain an understanding on how well the literacy training was
progressing in the communities. NFED would cooperate with other areas in the MoEYS and
other government statistical organs to get a representative control group and questionnaire
design.

4.7     As part of the tracer studies, learner assessments would be undertaken among participants
and control individuals on a set of questions related to the outcome indicators on reading, writing
and numeracy. The test, revised from the previous phase, had 30 points for each of the three
parts. A score of 21 corresponded to being literate as defined in the project outcome indicators.
The learner assessments were to be undertaken every 1-2 years with a minimum of 50 classes
sampled randomly based on region and rurallurban location. A simple self-assessment of
participants and facilitators was also to be introduced to the majority of classes in order to
provide an indication of progress and proficiency.

4.8     Thirdly, research involved studying the performance of various aspects of the project.
The research findings would contribute to improving delivery and cost effectiveness. Some of
the research topics were: effectiveness of the radio component, use of supervision, management
of book boxes, effect of awareness creation, and outcome of the English pilot.

4.9     The quality of design of the MER system was substantial. The results framework was
adequate notwithstanding some shortcomings. The key weaknesses were the lack of indicators
on quality and cost-effectiveness improvements as well as the shortage of baselines at the start of
the project. Monitoring and evaluation under NFLP I had been weak and even though there were
improvements to the MER system for the second phase of the program, were not adequate to
address all the shortcomings.

20 The PAD does not clearly state the number of learner assessments and tracer studies that would be undertaken and
when during the project period they would be implemented.
Implementation
4.10 In the earlier phase, reporting and supervision of M&E implementation was poor. It had
been cumbersome to fill out field reporting forms and the MIS had been inefficient. Based on
these weaknesses the NFLP I1 simplified the monitoring questionnaires in 2003 and reduced the
number of monitoring reports (from 12 to 4). But the monitoring system under the NFLP I1 still
did not operate efficiently. Data collected during supervision visits and by facilitators were, due
to complications with the MIS installation at regional offices, not entered, analyzed or reported
to higher levels in a timely manner. Supervision visits by higher level NFED staff varied in
number between regions but were strengthened in the later stages of the project. Although
computers were installed at regional offices, NFED staff complained to the IEG mission that
they were old and did not function well. By December 2005, MIS training of supervisors on their
responsibilities and on data gathering and entry had only been given in five regions and the
installation of the MIS template for synchronizing with the MoEYS Education MIS (EMIS) had
been rescheduled for late 2006. Once the MIS templates were installed on regional office
computers they facilitated data processing at regional and district offices.

4.1 1 Thus, at project completion, final training, data entry, and analysis had not been fully
undertaken. Operationalization of the MIS for use in the NFLP I1 was not achieved. Because
structured reporting from the districts and regions was hampered, monitoring relied heavily on
class visits by headquarterslregional staff to assess progress and resolve issues. Contrary to
plans, the non-formal education MIS was not coordinated with the EMIS during the project.

4.12 Through 2003 only "proxy measures"21were used to estimate if participants became
                                                                   and
functionally literate. Two learner assessments in 2004 and 2 0 0 7 ~ ~ one tracer study were
completed.23In May 2004 the first phase of the learner assessment exposed that gains were made
in reading and numeracy but that participants were not performing well on writing. The tracer
study collected baseline data for batch 10 in 2004 and mid-term data in June 2006. The survey at
termination was only undertaken after the IDA funding ended. NFED confirmed to IEG that the
planned follow-up of participants 1-2 years after completion in order to assess sustainability of
impacts was not possible due to budget constraints. Sixty communities were sampled. Although
the tracer study and the learner assessments could not assess impact (rigorously attributing
changes in literacy to the project), it provided much information on the progression of learning
and skills development and helped inform project management about the strengths and
weaknesses in design, outcomes and achievement of the key performance indicators at closing.
Box 2 discusses selection issues in the NFED tracer study and learner assessment as well as the
independent assessment undertaken by Aoki (2006).



' These included a review of primers, drop-out rates, a quick survey of 27 facilitators, supervisors and coordinators
at a consultation workshop (Implementation Status Report, December 24,2003; December 24,2003 Back to Office
Report fiom the Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission November 25-December 9,2003).
22 The second learner assessment covered batch 12 learners. However, the assessment was completed after the
project had closed.
23 Aoki (2006) also carried out a study of literacy and behavioral aspects of learners and non-learners almost two
years after the cycle completion. The findings contributed to understanding the outcomes of the project objectives.
Box 2. Selection Issues in NFLP Tracer Study and Learner Assessments
NFED (2007) tested learners in 60 batch 10 classes (847 learners) at the beginning of the training, at mid-
point and at completion. They also administered tests to other people in the same community who did not
participate in the program (non-participants).The study does not clarify how the non-participants were
selected, only that they were from the same community. The study did not use matching techniques to
ensure that the comparator group had similar characteristics as the participants. In comparing the
descriptive statistics, the two groups were relatively similar on a set of characteristics such as sex, age,
occupation, and marital status. However, participants had slightly more formal schooling than non-
participants. Because the study does not control for self-selection of participants into the program it is
possible that participants were different from non-participants on other characteristics other than those
observed. Motivation to learn how to read and write could be one variable, interest in joining an IGA
group and the potential of earning an income and accessing credit could be another. In addition, it is
possible that non-participants in the comparison group may also have changed their behavior or acquired
skills as a result of their close contact with participants. These self-selection and spillover effects make
comparison between the two groups difficult.
Aoki (2006) administers written tests comparing 349 batch 8 NFLP I1 participants who completed the
training 1-2 years earlier with around 400 batch 10 NFLP I1 learners who had just started the training (a
few months into the program). Aoki regresses the post-learning score of batch 8 participants against the
pre-test scores (batch lo), the individuals' age, geographic location, household expenditure, and formal
schooling. Using this method, selection and spillover effects are likely small although it is possible that
the comparison group scores have been affected by what they learned in the few months of the program
that they have attended. Also, it is possible that batch 8 participants have gained skills from other sources
after the program ended but before the test was administered.
Aoki also administered oral tests to the 349 batch 8 learners and to 105 sampled control individuals in 7
communities which had never participated in NFLP but were located within the same districts as the
participating communities. The results of this method are likely affected by the fact that participating
communities opted on their own will to participate in the program, but comparison communities, for
unknown reasons, did not. Aoki recognizes that it is not possible to separate NFLP effects from possible
effects of other interventions such as agricultural and health extension work and mass media effects.
The issue of self selection and spill over in both of these studies increase the unreliability of the findings
and reduce the certainty with which the observed differences in literacy and functional skills and attitudes
between participants and non-participants can be attributed to the project.



4.13   Also, at least five research studies had been undertaken: a study on supervision and
supervised supervision; a follow-up of non-financially supported IGA groups; a study on the
expansion of the radio system; an assessment on the use of book boxes; and a study on
awareness creation. Implementation of the MER was modest.

Utilization of M&E Data
4.14    Utilization of monitoring information was good when it reached decision makers. For
instance, when the female drop-out rate in deprived regions was found to be high, it was
discovered that many women dropped out because most facilitators were male. Measures were
taken to increase the number of female graduates in the last batches to compensate for the low
completion in the early batches. Moreover, based on the learner assessment and tracer study
 findings reported in May 2004, progress toward achieving the development impact was judged
 satisfactory and the project was granted a two-year extension. These research studies contributed
 to project readjustment. For instance, many of the recommendations made in the radio study
 were implemented to strengthen radio broadcasting. M&E utilization was substantial.



 5. Achievement of Development Objectives
5.1     The assessment of the achievement of the development objectives is split into three parts
covering both the outcome- and the output-oriented objectives. The report will evaluate the
extent to which: a) delivery of basic functional literacy and skills was provided in 15 national
languages, to about one million adults, especially women and the rural poor, ages 15-45, b)
participants acquired literacy and functional skills, and c) the quality and cost-effectiveness of
hnctional literacy and skills services have improved.

Delivery of Basic Functional Literacy and Skills. Rating: Substantial
5.2     At project closing over 1,195,000 articipants had enrolled (Table 3). Of the 1,165,918
participants who enrolled in batches 8-12,Y4 83 percent continued the whole training cycle. Thus,
the average drop-out rate was 17 percent, 16 percent for women and 19 percent for men (NFED,
2008a). Assuming an 83 percent graduation rate for the whole project, around 992,612
participants followed the course to its end.25It was mentioned in the ICR that the English pilot
also surpassed its enrollment targets due to very high demand (data not available).

Sources: World Bank (1999); NFED (2007); NFED (2008a).

5.3     The large majority of the participants fell in the 15-45 age group but a sizeable share of
participants was over 45 years of age. Aoki (2004) and NFED (2007) data show that, depending

24   Another 30,000 learners enrolled in Batch 13.
25 Drop-out and attendance rates varied by region. The learners' assessment undertaken of batch 8 learners showed
that in the Northern, Eastern and Western regions 85, 66, and 40 percent of sampled learners participated for the full
2 1 months, respectively. The percentages of sampled learners who attended all classes was 76 percent in the
Northern, 50 percent in the Eastern, and 33 percent in the Western region.
on the time this measurement was taken, the share of participants between 15-45 ranged between
70-76 percent. The share of participants above 45 years old varied between 20-29 percent. There
was restriction on the age range of participants. Over 70 percent of participants came from rural
areas.

5.4     On the other hand, the project experienced difficulties recruiting the targeted 40 percent
of participants from the three northern regions (Upper-East, Upper West and Northern regions).
Only 29 percent of classes were in the north (World Bank 2007a). The 60 percent participation
of women was reached in all regions except the northern three regions where only 49 percent of
participants were women (NFED 2008a). Training took place in 15 local languages plus English
as planned. In the north populations are more sparse and poverty is generally higher. Tension and
conflict made project implementation in the north slightly difficult. Curfews were common
during the dark hours making travel to and from class sites difficult, especially for women.
Seasonal migration (when agriculture is not productive) of both men and women from the north
to the south contributed to the low participation rates.

Acquisition of Basic Literacy and Functional Skills. Rating: Substantial


5.5     In sum, the project has likely helped improve literacy skills in Ghana but did not reach its
target of making 70 percent of participants functionally literate. This was mainly a result of the
poorly grounded targets, especially in writing. Although the achievement targets were only met
in reading (Ghanaian languages and English) and strongest for participants who had previously
been formally schooled, there were strong positive improvements made in writing and nurneracy.
Evidence on sustainability of skills is weak and only based on oral tests but literacy skills seem
to have been relatively well sustained after the project ended. Participants also undertook
development activities although most participants were already engaged in these prior to the
project. Moreover, evidence suggests, although attribution is not possible to establish with
certainty, that the project has led to some behavioral change and better awareness in areas such
as health and child care, schooling of children, and decision making and participation. On
balance, the achievement of the objective of providing basic literacy and functional skills was
substantial.

5.6     Data on participant achievement from various sources are presented in Table 4. Strengths
and weaknesses of the evaluation methodologies are presented in Box 2. Although methodology
and outcomes differ, the results point in the same direction. In NFED's learning assessment of
batch 10 participants (enrolled 2004-06) 72 percent of participants scored above the 21 (of 30
maximum points) at the end of the training and were considered able to read and comprehend a

cycle and in contrast to non-participants. However, as participants self-selected into the program
they might have been more motivated and otherwise different compared to non-participants. The

26 The WFED (2007) test consisted of 30 points. A score of 2 1 or above corresponds to the objective of being able to
read and comprehend 3 paragraphs, write a one-page letter, and perform calculations in four arithrnetrical operations
with numbers of up to one million. They also tested 333 non-learners in the same communities at the mid-point and
at completion and used these are control groups.
 learner assessment does not control for the self-selection. Aoki (2006) finds that 82 percent of
 batch 8 participants (enrolled 2000-02) can read and com rehend an essay 1-2 years after
 attending the training.27Although as many as 65 percent2! could read and comprehend an essay
 at the beginning of the training, the difference is significantly higher than at the start of the cycle.

5.7     In writing, performance was much weaker. NFED (2007) and Aoki (2006) report that less
than 30 percent of participants were proficient in writing (could write a one-page letter), well
below the 70 percent target. However, the difference in skills compared to the control groups is
significant (the same participants at the beginning of the cycle, beginner participants in later
batches and non-participants in the same communities). IEG did not obtain the baseline data for
the batch 12 (enrolled 2006-07) learning assessment (NFED 2008b2'), but based on the test at the

''Aoki tested to which extent participants (in writing) could read and comprehend 3 paragraphs, write a one-page
letter, and perform calculations in four arithmetrical operations with numbers of up to one million. The test included
30 points, the pass mark was set at 21 out of 30 points, or 70 percent. Tests were also administered to batch 9
learners at the mid-point of their cycle but results are not presented here. Aoki also administered oral tests to batch 8
learners and to 105 sampled control individuals in 7 communities which did not participate in the NFLP 11. For
several reasons the oral exams are not considered as reliable as the written exams.
'*Aoki also presents other explanations, such as intervention by program staff during the exam, for why beginners
score relatively highly.
29 NFED   (2008b) tested 187 learners who had attended batch 12 in reading, writing and numeracy. The study
targeted 320 learners in two districts each in the Ashanti and Volta regions.
completion of the training 47.6 percent could write a one-page letter. In nurneracy, the
performance was moderate and below the target. Both NFED (2007) and Aoki (2006) report that
59 percent of participants met the objective of being able to perform calculations using all four
signs and numbers up to one million. Again participants scored much higher than comparison
individuals. Increases between the baseline/control group and the participants who completed the
cycle are significant.

5.8      It should be noted that people who had not attended the training scored very low on the
2007 NFED tests, although Aoki found that a much larger share of the participants had some
basic literacy skills already at baseline. In the 2008 NFED study of 187 batch 12 participants, 58
percent had not had any formal education, 28 percent had dropped out of lower primary school,
and 11 percent had entered upper primary school (NFED 2008b). In the tracer study conducted
between 2004 and 2007,35 percent of the 1,070 sampled participants had some formal education
at the start of the training (NFED 2007). Aoki notes that on average 72 percent of the 1,078
tested batch 8-10 participants had no formal schooling while 20 percent had some primary
schooling. In some regions however, the share of participants with formal schooling was over 50
percent. Forty percent of the participants who were just starting their training said that they read
and write at home and in the public life (Aoki 2006). Aoki finds that those with formal schooling
scored higher than those without. Also, test scores were inversely correlated with age. This
suggests that not all of the literacy attained by participants at the end of the project can be
attributed to the project.

5.9      Also, the 21 month cycle was to cover two primers, progressively advancing in difficulty
level. The NFED (2007) tracer study revealed that, at the end of the 21-month literacy cycle,
many learning groups had not progressed to the second of the two primers. Actual instruction
was hence slower than expected. Aoki finds that participants did better the longer they stayed in
the program. Differences between participants and the various comparison groups are large and it
is likely that the project has contributed to an increase in functional literacy levels among
participants. However, the tracer study and learner assessments were not carried out with
sufficient rigor to conclude with certainty that the project lead to increased literacy levels.

5.10 Although planned, NFED did not complete the two year post-graduation fourth phase of
the tracer study. But Aoki's tests were administered almost two years after batch 8 participants
graduated from the program and could therefore serve as a measurement for the level of
sustainability of skills. In her survey, 78 and 67 percent of the participants who were sampled 1-2
years after completion of the training confirmed that they use their spare time to read and write,
respectively, at home and in public life (Aoki 2006). Compared to non-participants, even though
they had more formal schooling, participants used their skills significantly more." Participants
say that they can, after participation in the project, read and understand student report cards,
doctors' notes, prescription labels, road signs, and know how to count and handle money in the
market. IEG was able to confirm these findings in 15 focus groups of about 350 NFLP I1
participants (mainly from batch 12) around two years after program completion. Most
participants could still read and write sentences unrelated to the primer they had been using and
could perform simple calculations. Although sustainability of literacy skills in adult literacy

two percent of batch 8 learners and 56 percent of comparison groups individuals had formal schooling.
projects world-wide has generally proven to be low (see chapter 6 on risk), these different
findings all point at relatively high sustainability of literacy skills in the NFLP 11. Had the post-
literacy readers been more readily available to participants the sustainability of skills may have
been higher.



5.1 1 According to baseline data the target of 70 percent participation in development
activities31was already achieved without the project's assistance. Nevertheless, two studies
                    ~)
(NFED 2 0 0 7 ~ and Aoki (2006) confirm that participants acquired awareness and demonstrated
behavioral change in many life skills and functional areas (Table 5). Participants gained new
knowledge and changed behavior in areas such as health and family planning, children's
education, and joint decision making. Community members and community leaders observed
more changes in the community over the period of the NFLP I1 program compared to before the
program (Figure 3).33AS stated above, because the studies did not adequately control for self-
selection into the program, spill over or contamination from other parallel changes to the
participants environment the positive outcome cannot be fully attributed to the project. However,
it is likely that the project contributed to the observed changes.

5.12 The majority of participants were already involved in developmental activities before the
project began. According to NFED (2007) over 97 percent of participants and 98 percent of
household members participated in development activities after the project compared to 75
percent among participants and 92 percent among household members at baseline (Table 5).34
But respondents agree that NFLP I1 participant groups commonly organized community
development activities. The most common activity was clean-up efforts. Participants also say
that they understand the importance and make more use of environmental practices such as

31   Such as community clean-up, push fire prevention and tree planting.
32The tracer study interviewed batch 10 learners, facilitators, other members in the same community, and
community leaders on the development impact of the literacy program.
33 At baseline respondents we asked about changes in the community over the last 5 years. At the mid-point and
terminal phase respondents were asked about changes in the community since the beginning of the literacy program.
34   A slightly different answer is obtained from the three groups of respondents.
sustainable land use and bush fire prevention. Although no evidence is presented by Aoki (2006),
she found that participants were more involved in communal labor for environmental
sustainability than in control communities. The study found that participants organized some tree
planting and bush fire prevention.

 5.13 Furthermore, participants' empowerment and civic awareness increased. Aoki (2004)
found that the program helped bond community groups and give people more courage to make
demands on district assemblies. In interviews by Aoki, 40 percent said they make more decisions
jointly in the household after attending the course. Sixty-two percent of men and women said
that decisions are made jointly and 35 percent said the husband makes household decisions.
Among non-participants 48 percent said they make joint decisions while 50 percent report that
the man makes the decisions. Moreover, participants also made more joint decisions on family
planning (Figure 4). IEG confirmed that women felt that their sense of self-worth had been
boosted after acquiring literacy skills. They were more confident speaking in public whereas
previously they would leave such public speaking to the men. Aoki (2004) noted much less
participation and community empowerment in control groups (no evidence presented). Women
also indicated that their ability to contribute financially to the household through the IGAs had
earned them the respect of their families and given them greater voice in their homes and
community.

5.14 There were a standard set of income-generation activities developed and taught in class
through the primers but groups could get engaged in the activity of their choice based on local
resources and market availability. Engaging in an income generating activities was often a
motivation for groups to enroll in the literacy program. Compared to the baseline, the number of
participants that were involved in IGAs quadrupled. The NFED (2007) tracer study showed that
52 percent of participants surveyed had learned income-generation skills in the NFLP I1 and the
 majority (76 percent) of participants said that the NFLP I1 was the on1 place where they had
 acquired IGA skills. The main activities were food and oil processing.7 5

5.15 Although not the objective of the project, evidence on increased productivity and income
as a result of the IGAs learned in the NFLP I1 is scant. Both the NFED (2007) study and Aoki
(2006) mention the inability of the program of transferring IGA skills as a weakness. The main
reason for not learning IGA skills was that they were not taught in the class. An NFED staff
provided an explanation for this finding by saying that many learning groups are church groups
and not interested in IGAs but seek to learn how to read and interpret the Bible (see objective 3
and Box 3 for more detail).

5.16 Participants state that they send children to school to a larger extent as a result of the
program, encourage them to advance, assist them with homework and monitor their
performance. Aoki (2006) reports that the percent of participants who send their children to
school is twice as high in the participant group (98 percent), compared to in the control group (49
percent). In the NFED (2007) tracer study both community members and community leaders
noted a reduction in the number of participants who did not send their children to school.
Interestingly, the study does not find any impact on the awareness of child labor laws among
participants. Instead, participants' school aged children are more engaged in economic activities,
mainly farming and trading, after (85.2 percent) compared to before the program (50.0 percent).
It can be speculated whether the increased involvement in income generating activities among
the participants also contribute to more work for children.

5.17 The tracer study also shows that participants improved their knowledge and practice of
health care and safe motherhood (Figure 5). Participants, community members and community


35 Common IGA activities were farming or fruit growing (cassavafgari, vegetableslmaize, coco, pineapples),
transformation activities (palm oil, sheabutter and gari processing, soap making, bread making), crafts (bead
making, batik printing, pottery, kente and mat weaving) and animal rearinglhusbandry (beekeeping, fish farming,
grass cutter, snail, sheep and bird rearing). In the 15 literacy classes visited by IEG women were predominantly
involved in sheabutter processing, soap-making or weaving or in mixed groups engaged in fish-farming, bird-
fattening or palm oil processing.
leaders confirmed that more babies were delivered in hospitals and clinics after the program
compared to before the program. Fewer babies were delivered using a traditional birth
attendant.36Moreover, Aoki (2006) find that participants have a better understanding of safe
motherhood, and prevention and consequences of teen pregnancy. In the Northern region batch
12 learning groups told IEG that before the project women would hide or remove their children
from the village when health care nurses came around for immunizations. They now understand
that immunization can help prevent childhood illnesses.

5.18 Although no rigorous impact evaluation has been undertaken of the project, it is fairly
unlikely that the outcomes and expected impacts could have been achieved to such a large scale
without the project (or without other large scale donor support). Smaller NGOs are active in    .
delivering literacy and skills in Ghana but the NFLP project is by far the largest in scope.
Moreover, community leaders indicated that there was no significant increase in community
organization, reading materials or mass media available in the area after as compared to before
the program. This suggests that few factors other than the NFLP I1 program may have caused the
impacts.

Delivering Quality and Cost-Effective Training. Rating: Modest
5.19 In NFLP I, the NFED had operated inefficiently with a large staff base especially weak in
supervision, financial management, and procurement capacity. The NFLP I1 intended to increase
quality and cost-effectiveness of basic functional literacy training mainly through: a) developing
a NFED policy framework including decentralization strategies; b) increasing collaboration with
NGOs and other providers; c) facilitating obtaining micro-credit for learning groups engaged in
IGA (for more details on the experience with IGA see Box 3); d) establishing an effective

policies in Ghana.
monitoring and evaluation system; and e) improving strategies for quality enhancement through
training, materials development, supervision, and a more efficient radio system.

Box 3. The Experience with Income Generating Activities during NFLP I1
To strengthen the IGA component of the literacy program the project intended to contract one or two
NGOs to help link borrowers to micro-credit institutions and provide technical assistance to a sample of
learning groups to help formulate a business plan. NFED partnered with the GRATIS Foundation which
provided training to NFED IGA officers and to leaders of some of the learning groups on marketing,
trading, and creating business plans.
At the same time, although the Bank team advised against it, NFED added their own micro-finance
service towards the end of the period of Bank support (2005) in order to better sustain IGA groups. The
micro-finance would help the various IGA groups with some "seed money" to get their activities up and
running and before seeking loans at proper micro-credit institutions. The NFED micro-finance was
piloted in five regions in a revolving fund where learner groups had to repay the loan within six months.
Micro-credit with local Banks generally ranged 10-12 months.
The IGA component suffered due to delays although improvements were made during the second half of.
the project. The ICR states that a total of 139 groups obtained and managed NFED micro-finance under
the project. The NFED reported that 335 IGA groups in six regions have benefitted from financial and
technical support from NFED since 1992. Reports and IEG interviews with regional coordinators from
Ashanti, Eastern, Greater Accra, Northern, Upper East and Western regions show that there were well
over 220 IGA groups in the these regions in 2009 and many of them were supported by technical
assistance andlor funding from the NFED. The recovery rate on micro-finance was high, around 90
percent.
However, IEG found that groups experienced difficulties obtaining credit from the NFED and elsewhere.
A major constraint to the success of IGAs was limited access to markets and inadequate business plans
which were required by banks for obtaining credit. The IEG mission found that difficulties in accessing
micro-credit limited the sustainability and extension of IGA groups and therefore also reduced the
potential for additional family income. Income generated from IGAs was often used for paying school
fees or for undertaking construction of latrines and additional school buildings.


5.20 In assessing achievement of the quality objective it would be appropriate to ask if the
program performed better in generating literate graduated as a result of the quality improvements
from this project, compared to the previous program (after controlling for the participant's
background characteristics). To answer this it would have required knowing if the success rates
of the later batches (that benefitted from the activities aimed at improving quality) were higher
than at the start of the project. In addition, it would have required monitoring information of the
teaching quality throughout the program. However, such rich information is not available.
Instead, in determining if quality has been improved this PPAR lays out what quality related
outputs were delivered and the timing of their achievement.



5.21 Despite it being a part of the development objective of the legally binding credit
agreement, the quality of basic literacy training was not formally monitored or assessed during
the project. Other than the tracer study which assessed whether inputs (teacher training, manuals,
teaching supplies, supervision etc.) had reached the learning groups of batch 10 learners at the
start, mid-pint and termination stage, there was no assessment to verify if quality of literacy
delivery was higher in the NFLP I1 batches compared to before the project (or the early phases of
the project). The PAD listed some vague output indicators on the institutional strengthening
aspects of the project. During the Mid-Term Review (MTR) the Bank team attempted to
establish more quantifiable indicators for measuring quality.37Using the indicators set in the
PAD (and updated in the MTR, see Annex E) this assessment measures quality enhancement
based on the types of quality related outputs that the project achieved as well as their timing and
relevance for obtaining the project outcomes.

5.22 Overall, most outputs were delivered suggesting that quality of literacy delivery was
likely enhanced from the NFLP I project. However, because of the serious delays in 2001-02,
quality improvements did not materialize until 2003-04 and were not completed until close to the
end of the project. Hence, much of the literacy training delivered by the project did not benefit
from the quality updates and the effect on learner performance and the sustainability of skills
after the program is weak. Annex E shows the outputs and outcomes achieved for each of the
five areas. In sum, quality enhancement was achieved as follows.

         NFED was established as its own legal entity with a strong and visionary director. In
         2003, a NFE policy was finalized and integrated into the Education Sector Strategy of the
         MoEYS.
         Materials decentralization and some financial decentralization were achieved but staffing
         and information systems remained mostly at headquarters level.
         The NFLP I1 started partnerships with the GRATIS Foundation and World Vision on
         IGAs and the English program but no strategic long term discussions on outsourcing of
         future delivery of literacy training were undertaken.
         IGA training was provided to NFED IGA staff and to 130 leaders of learning groups. At
         closing 139 IGA groups benefitted from NFED micro-finance (seed money) and the
         number has steadily increased since project closing. However, major constraints were
         poor access to markets and insubstantial business plans, limiting the scope for obtaining
         bank credit.
         As discussed in section 4, the MER system was strengthened from the last phase. But
         some areas remained weak, especially the MIS and supervision.
         The radio study was undertaken but completion was slow and the planned radio
         expansion was therefore delayed. The study recommended expanding to 18 stations
         nationwide. At closing, 16 stations were broadcasting literacy programs. But NFED staff
         were dissatisfied with performance of the radio component. Radio coverage was lower
         than expected. Nevertheless, radio programs were popular with participants and helped
         advertize the benefits of literacy.
         Even though all instructional and IGA supplies and materials were delivered and
         facilitators and supervisors were trained, these were long delays at the beginning of the
         project. Quality of literacy delivery, supervision, monitoring, and training on IGA and


           MTR recommended undertaking an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of delivery and a beneficiary
37 Also, the
assessment of batch 8 learners to assess quality of training before the learner assessment and tracer study become
available.
         developmental activities suffered as a consequence. The tracer study found that many
         learning groups were dysfunctional due to delays in procuring and delivering facilitators'
         incentives and infrequent monitoring. Materials development through local mechanisms
         and the creation of a literate environment was also slower than planned. Book boxes were
         few and of poor quality.



5.23 Although delivering cost-effective basic literacy training was part of the development
objective, key indicators on cost-effectiveness were not established and it was not clear how the
project attempted to measure and achieve this objective. In sum, actual unit cost per literate
participant was twice the estimate in the PAD. There are two important flaws in the unit cost
calculations used in the project. First the project uses overly ambitious assumptions on the
success rate, second it significantly underestimates the true costs as baseline levels of literacy
and functional skills are not accounted for.

5.24 The PAD (p. 36) calculated unit cost per successful basic literacy graduate at appraisal at
US$53.1 (see Table 6 row 1). This is based on an estimated cost for the activities supporting
basic literacy of US$38           one million enrolled participants and a projected graduation
success rate of 72 percent39including adjustments for drop-outs and number of participants who
would not achieve the outcome target on literacy skills.

5.25 But the underlying assumptions on the success rate were too optimistic. Assuming a 56
percent success rate would have been more realistic and along the lines of the target indicators of
the project.40Also, all project costs except costs for the English pilot should be included in the
unit cost calculations, as these costs would be incurred in order to achieve the objective. This
would have put the unit cost estimate at US$80.4 per successful graduate (Table 6 row 2).

5.26 Actual project costs reported in the ICR were US$42.8 million (excluding the costs for
the English pilot). As stated above, the number of actual participants was just over 1,195,000 and
the actual drop-out rate was 17 percent. The average actual pass rate (project wide) for basic
literacy was 53 percent.41This makes for a much lower than projected graduation success rate of
44 percent. However, true unit costs come to US$8 1.4 per participant, almost exactly the same as
the corrected estimated costs (Table 6 row 3). On the other hand, at best, if all of the 26.5 percent
who passed the writing exam also passed the reading and numeracy tests the overall pass rate


38 The estimated total costs for the project was $46 million but in calculating the total cost per enrolled learner the
PAD excluded costs of the English pilot, the literate environment, and the PPF and contingencies (PAD p. 36).
39
   For example, a 72 percent 'success rate' would be achieved if 100 learners enroll, 20 drop out, and of the
remaining, 90 percent (or 72 people) graduate and meet the target on the outcome indicators (World Bank, 1999). In
calculating the unit costs the PAD (p. 36, footnote 2) suggests that the aim of NFLP I1 is that 90 percent of graduates
pass the test even through the project indicators are set at 70 percent.
40 Assuming 20 percent drop out and, of the remaining, 70 percent graduate and meet the targets. In the PAD a 56
percent success rate is recognized as the likely scenario for other on-going World Bank supported literacy programs.
41 Average of 72.3 percent who met the reading target, 26.5 percent who met the writing target and 59.2 percent who
met the numeracy target (NFED 2007). It is not known what percent of participants met passed all of the three tests
but it cannot be higher than 26.5 percent.
     would be 26.5 percent. That puts the true unit cost at US$162.7 for those learners who were
     literate in reading, writing i d numeracy (Table 6 row 5).

 a The graduation rate refers to the percent of learners who follow the length of the cycle and sit for the test, the pass
 rate refers to the percent of test-takers who score above the performance criterion on the tests, and the success rate
 refers to the percent of participants who enrolled in the class at the start and who score above the performance
 criterion on the test.
   In calculating the unit costs the PAD (p. 36 footnote 2) suggests that the aim of NFLP I1 is that 90 percent
 of graduates pass the test even through the project indicators are set at 70 percent (PAD p. 16).

 5.27 But these success rate calculations include only the achievement on reading, writing and

 achievement on the two outcome indicators for functional skills the average achievement rate

 developmental activity and behavioral change is attributable to the project.
 to US$61.9 if both literacy and functional skills are included in the calculation of benefits (Table
 6 row 7).
5.28 However, these unit cost calculations do not adjust for the share of participants who were
already considered literate before the training. Adjusting the success rate for the fact that, on
average, 10 percent44of participants met the outcome indicators for basic literacy at baseline the
success rate drops to 35 percent. Adjusting also for those 76 percent45who exhibited the desired
awareness and behaviors and participated in development activities at the start of the project the
success rate drops further to 28 percent. These success rates are in line with success rates
calculated by Nordtveit (2008) for the Pilot Female Literacy Project (PAPF) in Senegal where
adjustments were made for literacy and functional skill levels before attending the learning.
Adjusting for pre-training basic and functional literacy skill levels the unit cost per successful
graduate comes to US$10 1.1 for literacy skills and US$128.7 counting both literacy and
functional skills (Table 6 rows 8 and 12). These costs are significantly higher than the corrected
predicted unit costs of US080.4 and twice as high that estimated in the PAD?

5.29 No cost-benefit calculations of alternative approaches (other than the previous phase) for
delivering literacy in Ghana are included in project documents makin it difficult to judge
whether the current project is more cost-effective than other options.4Y However, as implemented
                                                                                       ,

it was far less cost-effective than planned and much higher than in the NFLP I (US$47.3).

 Including also the average of the 75.0 percent who met the developmental activity target and the 76.1 percent who
45
met the behavior change and civic awareness target at baseline.
46The PAD (p. 36) only reports unit costs per enrolled learner (US$35.0) without accounting for the share of
learners reaching the outcome indicator skills levels.
47 Although not strictly comparable due to country context and program design differences, it can be noted that the
NFLP I1 unit costs were much higher than in the 2001-07 Bangladesh Post-Literacy and Continuing Education
Project (PLCE) (US$30.0) but lower than the Senegal Pilot Female Literacy Project (PAPF) (US$149.0) (World
Bank 2004c and 2008). Although these estimates do not account for the number of participants who were already
literate at the start of the project, it appears that the cost-efficiency of the NFLP I1 is around the average compared to
projects in other countries. Adjusting for literacy levels before project start Nordtveit (2008) argues that the cost per
successfbl graduate in the Senegal project could be as much as US$300. Finally, Aoki (2006) compares the cost
breakdown between the Ghana and the Senegal project in order to explain differences in costs betvieen the
government implemented project in Ghana with the NGO outsourcing method used in Senegal. It is observed that
the Ghana project spends less on salaries but more on class inputs and materials than the Senegal project possibly
due to the fact that the NFLP I1 relies heavily on unpaid volunteer facilitators compensated by material incentives in
terms of equipment. The NFLP I1 also spends less on operating costs but more on training and research than does the
Senegal project. Aoki explains this difference by the high supervision costs involved in outsourcing to NGOs in
Senegal and the stronger staff capacity building and MER efforts in the centralized Ghana project.
6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     This section discusses the rating of overall outcome consisting of relevance, efficacy and
efficiency of the NFLP I1 project. Table 7 summarizes the outcome ratings of the project. Based
on the substantial relevance and efficacy, but considering the modest achievement of one sub-
objective, and modest efficiency, the overall project outcome rating is moderately satisfactoty.
The project likely contributed to reductions in illiteracy and to progress on other development
goals albeit to a smaller extent than anticipated. However, evaluations of project performance did
not rigorously address issues of attribution.

a   Please see the discussion in the text below for a justification of the weighting used in deriving the overall ratings.



6.2    On balance, relevance is rated substantial because of its substantial relevance of
objectives despite some shortcomings in design.

6.3     Relevance of objectives. The development objectives were highly relevant to the country
conditions and government priorities at the time of appraisal. Providing basic functional literacy
would not just afford access to basic education for those who participated but would help boost
the demand for and use of services such as basic education, health services and clean water
through increased awareness and behavioral change. In the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy,
2000-02 the focus on poor peoples' capacity to earn incomes was laid out and female literacy
rates were recognized as a core indicator for improving Ghana's relatively poor human
development performance. The strategy also placed emphasis on reducing geographic and gender
disparities in poverty reduction. The Bank's strategy (2000 CAS) envisaged support to the
education sector to help improve access and utilization of basic services especially or women and
in deprived regions.

6.4    The objectives of the project were also relevant for addressing some of the existing sector
constraints (such as the poor quality of functional literacy programs, the lack of attention to
sustainability of literacy skills, the institutional role and capacity of the NFED, and collaboration
with non-governmental literacy and skills training providers). The Bank's support strategy for
education in Ghana focused on improving quality and effectiveness. The Bank placed strong
emphasis on the education sector for helping to reduce poverty.

6.5     In the GPRS 2003-05, attention was placed on strengthening monitoring and evaluation
of existing adult literacy programs and developing distance learning initiatives in remote areas.
The focus remained on skills building and more attention was paid to enhancing credit
opportunities and strengthening entrepreneurial, finance and management skills of poor people.
A core component of the government's Education Strategic Plan in 2003 was to offer non-formal
education programs focused on adult literacy.

6.6     In the GPRS 2006-09 the focus had moved more to the productivity related objectives of
skills programs and away from basic literacy training as an education sector strategy.
Government provision of functional adult literacy programs was no longer an active
development strategy. Instead the government strategy for non-formal education has shifted to
complementary education for youth drop outs and more formal mechanisms for skills training
(not community-driven). The Bank supported the government in trying to improve quality of
targeting of basic services such as in education and skills development (World Bank 2004b and
2007b).

6.7     Based on the evolving but continuous consistency of the project's objectives to Ghana's
priorities in the areas of human development, rural productivity and economic growth-all
supported by the Bank-the relevance of the project objectives is rated substantial.

6.8     Relevance of design. The program was built on a model of social change which was
expected to lead to the development objectives and to behavioral change outcomes. Important
lessons from the earlier phase of the project were carefully reflected in design such as increased
flexibility to participants' lives and needs, and improved monitoring and evaluation
arrangements. The results framework was adequate for assessing the achievement of the
expected outcomes and linked inputs and outputs to training modules and batches of participants.
Although stronger than most other results fiarneworks in non-formal education projects, its main
weaknesses included poor indicators and targets for the output-oriented objective (deliver quality
and cost-effective literacy). Also, it used poorly grounded targets on learning achievement. The
connection between outcome, outputs, and processes was strong, but the institutional
strengthening activities could have been more frontloaded so as to boost project outcomes and
impacts on participants.

6.9     Beyond the results framework, there were also some other shortcomings in design. First,
because it was well known that demand for literacy activities was low in the north it may have
been appropriate if the project took stronger action on stimulating demand (such as by providing
incentives, and reducing barriers to participation) in addition to supplying training.

6.10 Second, the centralized design was highly dependent on central government support and
sensitive to changes in the political climate. The hesitation of the new government leaders to
such a project placed the project at risk and caused major delays. Moreover, the need for
decentralization of government operations to the local levels was becoming increasingly
important in the FY01-04 and FY05-07 CAS periods. Government capacity in service delivery
was stretched and inefficiently operated (World Bank 2004b). As civil society developed, the
government, supported by the Bank, moved towards improving front-line service delivery
together with NGOs and the private sector. The project design included developing a strategic
plan for strengthened regional and district capacity but only to be implemented towards the end
of the project period. But retaining the overall centralized design from NFLP I was somewhat
inconsistent with the urgency of moving basic service provision under the control of local
government bodies in cooperation with civil society. In 1999, at the time of appraisal, options
were proposed to outsource delivery of literacy training to able NGOs and other organizations.
But the NGO sector capacity for undertaking such a large program was limited at the time and
the government favored a centralized design. Nonetheless, the project undertook preparations for
decentralization for M&E and resource management to regions and districts as well as
cooperation and engagement with NGOs for literacy training delivery.

6.1 1 Relevance of design is rated as substantial. Overall the design logic of the project was
strong and incorporated important lessons from prior experience. Although there were some
weaknesses in the results framework, it's relevance of design was relatively high. The main
shortcomings in design included inadequate attention to demand constraints in the north, and
significant political risk of the centralized and large-scale operation.



6.12 Efficacy is rated substantial due to the modest achievement of one objective and the
substantial achievement of two. The project enrolled more participants than planned and reached
almost all of its targeting and coverage targets. Learning outcomes were lower than anticipated
but participants demonstrated significant improvement in reading, writing, numeracy and
behavioral skills. Progress was made on improving the quality of literacy training in Ghana but
significant delays halted the impact of the quality enhancements on a large share of the enrolled
participants. The unit costs of the literacy services per newly literate adult, as implemented, was
more than twice as high as projected in the PAD.

6.13 It is likely that the project contributed to a reduction in the number of illiterate adults in
Ghana. As shown in Figure 1, literacy rates increased from 58 to 65 percent between 2000 and
2007 (corresponding roughly to the project period). On the other hand, a larger share of this
increase likely came from increases in primary and secondary enrollment and completion rates
and quality improvements in basic schooling (demonstrated in World Bank, 2004a).



6.14 Efficiency is rated as modest. Because it was part of the development objective, cost-
effectiveness is assessed in great detail in chapter 5. Cost-effectiveness calculations for the NFLP
I1 lie within the normal range for similar projects in other countries. But the unit cost calculations
used in the project significantly underestimate the true costs as baseline levels of literacy and
functional skills are not accounted for. Actual unit costs were twice the level projected.

6.15 Based on estimated unit costs and on GLSS data on earnings for individuals with basic
literacy (using four years of primary schooling as a proxy) the PAD (p. 11) estimates an
economic rate of return of 43 percent for females and 24 percent for males. The analysis was not
repeated at closing. However, for a couple of reasons the economic rate of return may have been
overestimated. First, the 2003 round of the GLSS indicated that the return to four years education
had fallen. Second, the return to literacy education of rural adults (of which 20 percent were over
45 years of age) may be less than that of four years of primary schooling due to the lack of labor
mobility. Third, as seen in chapter 5, actual unit costs per actual literate adult were significantly
higher than projected. Therefore, the economic rate of return may have been lower than
estimated at appraisal. On the contrary, although difficult to measure, there may be additional
social returns given the project's impact on behavioral change such as health and child care
practices and sending children to school.

Bank and Borrower Performance


6.16 On the whole, Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Both quality at entry and quality
of supervision were satisfactory.

6.17 Quality at entry. The quality of entry of the project from the Bank's side was
satisfactory. The Bank provided a thorough analysis of the sectoral issues and was well informed
of the functioning of the NFED and the context of the project from the beginning given the
Bank's involvement in the earlier phase. The project incorporated many lessons from phase I
which improved design (paragraph 2.1 1). The PPF was used for studies in the areas in need of
strengthening such as learner assessment and tracer studies, the radio component,
decentralization of materials development, and training for facilitators and supervisors. The
MER design was also strong including a tracer study and learner assessment.

6.18 Even so, problems with making literacy skills sustainable were known. The Bank could
have pushed for a stronger focus on these functional aspects of the project design and given more
attention during preparation to the importance of a strong literate environment and the need to
stimulate demand in the north. The Bank should also have ensured more realistic and grounded
outcome indicators. Although the implementation delays were the main cause for why quality of
literacy delivery was not enhanced until the later stages of the project, the Bank could also have
better sequenced the project activities to ensure that required quality improvements were
frontloaded before the literacy batches rolled out in large scale. Unit cost estimations were also
underestimated.

6.19 Nonetheless, the Bank team carehlly considered different design approaches such as
delivery by NGOs, upfront micro-credits for IGA groups, and remuneration for facilitators. In
each instance tradeoffs were discussed with the NFED and decisions were made on the most
feasible alternative at the time. The Bank supported the option of outsourcing literacy delivery to
NGOs and other local organizations. However, at the time of design NGO resources were still
rather limited in Ghana. Decentralized delivery also requires a strong monitoring and evaluation
system which was not yet established in the MoEYS. Future adult literacy initiatives may
however consider the outsourcing model.

6.20 Quality of supervision. Bank supervision was also satisfactory. The project team stayed
in close contact and on good terns with NFED and mission teams kept a close eye on any issues
that arose during implementation. Throughout the project the Bank team monitored progress
towards the development objective and carefully observed implementation progress including
visiting literacy classes. Aides-memoire and back-to-office reports accounted the progress and
recommendations were provided and agreements were reached with NFED as well as the
government.

6.2 1 Especially in 2000, when the new government had taken office and raised some
skepticism towards the NFLP 11, the Bank communicated effectively with government
counterpart to avoid closing of the project. Including the Country Director, the Bank worked
with the government in getting their acceptance of the program and getting it up and running.
Although the process took a long time, during the Annual Meetings in September 2002, the Bank
helped generate a strong government commitment to non-formal education. Moreover, at the
time of NFED reorganization the Bank pushed the NFED and the MoEYS to ensure that project
implementation was not jeopardized (although procurement hold ups did cause delays). Also, the
Bank flagged financial risks due to separate accounting procedures during the fragile time of the
project in 2002 and pushed to help regularize the NFED director for improving project stability.
The Bank also communicated with the MoEYS to put pressure on a speedy restructuring and to
gain crucial political commitment. Cabinet approval of the project was reached in late 2002 after
the Bank sent a letter of concern to the MoEYS.

6.22 The Bank was especially concerned over weaknesses in NFED capacity in the areas of
financial management and procurement, supervision, and monitoring, evaluation and research.
During the IEG mission, the Bank was praised by the NFED for helping to resolve the
procurement complications. The Bank team missions paid special attention to the MER system
achievement starting in 2003 and worked with the NFED to develop a working plan for
expediting results. In 2004 the Bank strongly urged the MoEYS to take action to develop tracer
and beneficiary assessments not to breach the schedule in the Credit Agreement. At the MTR the
Bank team tried to rectify some of the weaknesses with the results framework in measuring
progress on the quality objectives and helped reformulate indicators against improvement in
quality of literacy delivery could be assessed. On the other hand, the Bank knew that NFED
capacity was rather weak in many areas and could have worked more closely, for instance using
international consultants, to help build the capacity of the country's program staff early on in the
implementation process. It is questionable why the Bank chose to support a transition from a
central project coordinating unit (PCU) for the NFLP I1 to country ownership of a funds and
procurement management unit (FPMU) under such weak country capacity.



6.23 Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory overall. Central government
performance during the first years of the program was poor but picked up towards the end of the
phase. The discontinuity in approaches between national administrations has caused
inefficiencies. Implementing unit performance was satisfactory under the circumstances and
given their weak capacity.

6.24 Performance of the Government. At the early stages of the project, support by the new
government was very poor. The delay in effectiveness due to disagreements over a signature, the
uncertain political support of the project by the new government in 2000-01, and the NFED
restructuring exercise in 2002 severely delayed implementation and wasted valuable project
resources. The MoEYS did not regularize the new NFED director until 2002, leaving the project
without strong leadership and direction for a long period of time.

6.25 Significant inefficiencies in the implementing unit warranted a reorganization of the
NFED but generated further set-backs in the implementation of certain project components such
as the IGAs and the radio component. In 2002, prior to the agreement on the recommendations in
the consultant NFED restructuring report the government had ordered management of NFED
district offices to be closed and handed over to district assemblies. The Bank had not been
informed of these developments. As a result of the office closures, goods waiting to be
distributed were kept in storage and did not reach learning groups. Facilitators' incentives were
not delivered until very late in the project.

6.26 In 2002103, when the project started to generate some positive results, and after the
appointment of the new Minister of Education, who was more open to adult literacy programs,
the support of the government was renewed and strong. In the EFA action plan the government
made provisions for non-formal adult literacy as part of the strategy for halving illiteracy rates. A
deputy minister for education oversaw the NFLP I1 and had good knowledge of the project. From
the MTR until the end of the project government support remained strong and project operations
were running smoothly. The government ensured the Bank of its commitment to continue to
support the project financially after closure. On balance, government performance is rated
moderately satisfactory. The discontinuity in political priorities and development approaches in
Ghana has made project implementation uneven with lags and periods of inefficiencies.

6.27 Performance of the implementing agency. NFED was the implementing agency. Even
during project delays NFED's work under the PPF moved along and produced studies,
instruments for evaluation studies, revisions of the English manual and primer, and technical
assistance on a time plan for follow-up reading materials. NFED leadership demonstrated strong
commitment to achieving development objectives and was praised for their visionary style by
partners in the field. They also strengthened the collaboration with development partners for
achieving project goals as set out in the implementation plan.

6.28 From the first phase it was acknowledged that NFED capacity was poor, especially on: a)
monitoring, evaluation and research; b) supervision; c) procurement and financial management;
d) incentives and staff appraisal; and e) decentralization of data collection and entry. A NFED
reorganization to improve capacity and reduce inefficiencies was needed and undertaken. As a
result, capacity was strengthened but weak government support and directives made it difficult
for NFED to operate efficiently. During preparation the MER system was strengthened, but
implementation fell short. In 2004 the severe delays in getting the tracer and beneficiary
assessments on the ground raised issues with respect to credit agreement compliance. The Bank
urged the MoEYS to take quick action. Supervision and decentralization of monitoring
arrangements were also improved towards the end of the project. Procurement and financial
management remained challenging throughout the project but was reviewed as satisfactory under
new leadership in 2005.

6.29 Under the circumstances, NFED performance was satisfactory. NFED supplied the Bank
with up-to-date information on progress towards the development objectives throughout the
project and kept track of outputs and outcomes enabling quick alterations when issues arose or
indicators were off-track. Since project closure the NFED has continued to deliver literacy
training but to a much more limited capacity with around 30,000 enrolled participants per year
compared to 200,000 per batch during the project.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.30 The risk to development outcome of the NFLP I1 is rated as significant. Following the
end of Bank support in 2006 class and batch sizes have dwindled, fewer facilitators were
recruited, and infrastructure deteriorated. But the NFED is keen to restart a more scaled up adult
literacy delivery if financial resources are provided. Although the government's commitment to
reducing illiteracy is strong, the MoEYS strategy of reducing illiteracy and raising human capital
has shifted away from mechanisms such as basic literacy and functional skills programs and
towards targeting school drop outs via complementary education in parallel with formal skills
training. The rating on risk to development outcomes is justified by a number of risk factors that
each have some likelihood of occurring and each with some detrimental impact on outcomes.

6.3 1 The first risk factor is related to the sustainability of the skills acquired. Although skills
appear to be relatively well sustained after the project, sustainability of literacy gained from adult
literacy programs in general is notoriously low. Studies have found that the relapse to illiteracy is
widespread. Abadzi (2003) reports that sustainability in Bank-supported literacy projects is low,
although not commonly assessed. For instance, she reports that in the earlier phase of the NFLP
40 percent had relapsed into illiteracy (tested by Bennett 1995). Similarly there is evidence of
low sustainability of achievement in a number of other literacy programs in Africa and
elsewhere. In a 2005 study of Bangladeshi adult literacy participants 2 1 months after completion
only 25 percent of participants could read simple text, much lower than directly after the
program ended. As the post-literacy component of the project was not well achieved, there is a
significant risk that participants may fall back into illiteracy if skills are not carefully monitored
and maintained. Moreover, a major constraint to the success of IGAs in boosting incomes was
the inaccessibility of markets and credit. The IEG mission found that difficulties in accessing
micro-credit limited the sustainability of IGA groups and therefore also reduced potentials for
additional family income. The sustainability of functional skills and behavior changes is likely to
be higher.

6.32 The second risk factor is related to the continuation of the scope and quality of adult
literacy delivery by the NFED. At project closing in August, 2006 the government showed its
support for the continuation of the NFLP program with a commitment of 178 billion Ghana
Cedis (US$12.0 million using July, 2009 exchange rates) for 2006-08. These funds sustained
literacy course provision but only to around 30,000 new participants per year. These numbers are
significantly lower than during the project and do not have the envisioned substantial effect on
reducing illiteracy in Ghana. Unless a larger commitment for more funding comes through it is
unlikely that the NFLP can continue to operate efficiently. NFED regional and district
coordinators informed IEG that they have no funds for recruitment and training of facilitators.
Quality of delivery may hence decline.

6.33 Finally, there are broader institutional challenges in Ghana in reducing illiteracy. In the
event that large scale adult literacy activities would be undertaken again, there is a need for the
NFED to conform to government decentralization processes and to make more use of private and
non-governmental service delivery. If not, ineEciencies may rise and delivery mechanisms risks
diverting from government priorities and strategy. Collaboration with NGOs already started
during the NFLP 11. Also, currently, School for Life, an NGO in northern Ghana, is very active
in providing cost-efficient complementary education for children and youth. They enjoy strong
government support and have attracted b d s from external donors such as DfID and Danida.

6.34 At the time of this evaluation, president Atta Mills (elected in December, 2008) and his
government are considered supportive of non-formal education. As a result of the project, NFED
capacity was strengthened and a large infrastructure for delivering non-formal education is in
place, although several areas of program delivery need further improvement. For instance,
monitoring and evaluation arrangements need to be significantly strengthened to supervise and
monitor NGO implementation. A stronger strategy and program for NFED on how it is going to
contribute to reductions in illiteracy rates and strengthening of human capital in Ghana is also
lacking.



7. Conclusions and Lessons
7.1      Ghana's NFLP I1 was designed as a follow-on to a first project also supported by the
Bank. The NFLP I1 has likely contributed to reductions in illiteracy and progress on other
development objectives albeit to a smaller extent than anticipated and at a much higher cost. The
project enrolled more participants than planned and reached almost all of its coverage targets.
Learning outcomes were lower than anticipated but participants demonstrated significant
improvement in reading, writing, numeracy and behavioral skills after the program. However,
evaluations of project performance do not rigorously address attribution issues. Although quality
of literacy delivery was enhanced by the project as envisioned, much of the capacity
development and implementation strengthening occurred late and only participants that enrolled
in the later stages could benefit.

7.2      Two of the project objectives were substantially achieved, the third was modestly
achieved. Relevance was substantial and efficiency was modest, resulting in a moderately
satisfactory outcome. Risk to development outcomes is significant. Bank performance was
satisfactory. Although the implementing agency delivered, their capacity was generally low
throughout most of the project. Poor initial government support caused delays and inefficiencies.
Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory overall.

Lessons
       The NFLP 11 demonstrated that non-formal education projects, such as adult literacy and
       skills projects, can build resultsframeworks linked to learner achievement and test
       scores. Many similar non-formal projects in other countries have not built in tests of
       learner achievement in project design but rely on participant enrollment and graduation
       rates for assessing project objectives. Although the NFLP I1 targets were not well
       grounded in reliable pre-tests and could not be fully reached, the project was able to
       demonstrate that participants' literacy improved significantly over the course of the
       project (see paragraphs 4.3 and 6.8).
Even in a demand-drivenproject such as the NFLP II, context speciJicfactors may
reduce uptake in deprived regions. Although literacy and skills training is highly
demanded by poor communities on the national level, it was well known that demand
was lower in the three deprived northern regions. Here, the project experienced
difficulties in meeting its enrollment targets, especially for women. In certain local
contexts, providing incentives and reducing barriers to participation are necessary for
stimulating demand in parallel to supplying training (see paragraphs 5.4 and 6.9).
Literacy andfunctional skills projects that involve income generating activities should
build continuous supportfor IGA groups into design in order to enhance sustainability of
skills. Over half of the NFLP I1 learners participated in an IGA group. The possibility of
earning an income was an important driver for learners to participate in the literacy and
skills program. Engaging in an IGA also exposes participants to activities in which they
can make use of literacy and numeracy skills. But IGA groups, generally small and
resource poor, are highly dependent on access to finance and markets for sustaining their
activities. Providing training and access to credit and markets needs to be better built into
prbject design to increase the chances of the sustainability of income generation as well
as of literacy skills (see paragraphs 5.15-16,s.22 and Box 3).

      Dear Madam,

      Re: Ghana-Second Phase of the National Functional Literacv Proiect (Cr. 3246-GH) Draft
      Proiect Performance Assessment Report
      We write to acknowledge receipt of the Draft Project Performance Assessment Report (DPPAR)
      from the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group. We are particularly pleased about the
      evaluation and issues raised.
      We are glad to inform you that some of the issues raised and lessons learnt had already informed
      the NFED's design of the proposed third phase of the National Functional Literacy Programme
      (NFLP 111). New issues not yet considered will now be factored into the final design of the
      proposal for the third phase.
      We however will like to make comments on some of the issues raised in the attached document.
      Yours faithfully,

                                     NFED'S COMMENTS

ISSUE: 5.5 Page 17 and 5.7, Page 18
The project did not achieve its 70 % target in writing.
The underachievement in the indicator related to writing in NFLP I1 was noted. This could be the
result of the difficult writing posture due to the use of school pupil desks that adult learners had
to use. Additionally, it seems the indicator was set too high overlooking international research
which affirms writing as one of the difficult skills to be acquired by learners in adult literacy
programmes.

This shortfall has been noted and strategies planned in the design of NFLP 111.

   i       ... shortage of baselines at the start of the project.

     ii) No adequate baseline against which to measure achievement. Project achievements
         are not well grounded in pre-tests.
Baseline studies have been planned to be conducted on learners at the commencement of each
cycle.

2.      ISSUE: 5.22 Page 25, IGA
        i.   Low participation in the northern regions.
        ii.  Signs of ZGA skills sustainability slim If they were taught in class at all, they
             were not put into practice.

Demand for literacy and skills training programmes especially in the three northern regions of
Ghana will be increased in NFLP I11 in general and the IGA component through rigorous
sensitization activities. This is expected to stimulate demand and reduce the barriers to
participation, especially women.

Partnerships with national micro-credit institutions will be strengthened with the aim of
providing credit to more groups. This will reflect in the content of training to the target groups
especially in the areas of marketing, business plan development, the establishment and
maintenance of effective marketing channels and the scope for obtaining bank credit. NFED will
engage the services of experts to support the delivery of the component.

 i.    4.1 Page 12 Line 1; 5.22, Page 25 Bullet 5: Monitoring and Evaluation implementation
        lagged.

This was as a result of the late disbursement of funds and delayed development of capacity for
the delivery of the component. Arrangements are already underway to remove these challenges
in the design of NFLP 111.

 ii.    ISSUE 4.3 Page 12, Line 4:
        The word dubious should be replaced with either                     or sub-standard or
        unsatisfactorv.

iii.    ISSUE 4.1 0, Page 14
        Weak reporting and poor filling of MIS forms for facilitators.

The M&E system in NFLP I11 will strengthen delivery of project outputs by specifying
appropriate performance indicators needed for achieving the objectives of each component. More
monitoring activities will be undertaken to critically assess the achievement of these indicators.
A performance- based approach to management will be adopted and adhered to.

The content of forms filled by facilitators will be reviewed and content reduced. Capacity of staff
at the various levels responsible for management will be built. Templates will be developed and
a regular maintenance plan developed to manage data on a more consistent and timely basis.

The words national language should read Ghanaian languages because Ghana does not have a
national language except English.

vi.    5.9 Page 19,..many learning groups had not progressed to the second level of the two
       primers ...
To ensure facilitators follow the required instructional pace for the completion of the two
primers, supervision will be intensified and more working tools and incentives for facilitators
and supervisors acquired and used. Care will be taken to ensure that learning is at the pace of
participants. Facilitators and supervisors will be more rigorously trained to acquire the requisite
knowledge and skills to handle the primers.

A series of tracer studies will be instituted to capture all the four stages (baseline, mid-point,
completion and one year after completion) in the NFLP 111.
