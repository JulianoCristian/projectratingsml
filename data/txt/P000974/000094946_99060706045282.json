        Project aims to increase the number of Ghanaians adults\n            (15-45 years), particularly women and rural poor, to acquire\n            literacy and functional skills. There are seven project\n            components. 1) Basic literacy and development activity\n            program will teach basic literacy, numeracy, and functional\n            skills in 15 Ghanaian languages and will seek community\n            participation in the running of classes. 2) An English pilot\n            was conducted in response to strong demand for literacy\n            training in English. The review confirmed the need to\n            gradually increasing to 500 classes by the end of a\n            five-year period. 3) Literate environment will enhance the\n            access of the literate to reading materials. 4) Monitoring,\n            evaluation, and research program will measure and promote\n            both the quantity of the program output and the quality of\n            instruction. 5) Radio broadcasting will strengthen the\n            existing capacity and quality of the non-formal education\n            (NFE) radio component. 6) Management and institutional\n            enhancement will develop a human resources development\n            strategy and a strategic plan for a phased decentralization\n            of NFE Division activities to regions and districts. 7) The\n            last component will tackle the core organization of NFED and\n            its administrative costs."}, "docdt": "1999-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
