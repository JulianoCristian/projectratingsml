The adverse environmental impact will mainly\n            be related to construction work. Mitigation measures will be\n            applied when required. During construction, noise will be\n            minimized through scheduling and applying specific\n            restrictions for particularly noisy activities. Dust\n            suppression measures will be used to protect air quality.\n            Traffic routing will be used to reduce vehicle emissions.\n            Demolition and excavation debris will be removed and\n            disposed of at an approved location.
