THIRD SHELTER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower and
Beneficiary Agencys   National Housing Authority (NHA).
Guarantor:              Kingdom of Thailand.
Loan Amount:            US$21 million.
Loan Terms:             Repayable in 17 years including 4 years of grace at
the standard variable interest rate.
Project
Description:          The project would increase NHA's reliance on
domestically mobilized resources, promote lending to
lower-income households, strengthen NHA's management
practices, support housing programs for lower- and
middle-income families, and improve the availability
of housing sector data necessary for housing policy
development. The project includes support for the
construction of serviced sites and core housing for
about 11*000 lower- and middle-income households in
Bangkok and other cities which meet subproject eligi-
bility criteria and technical assistance for insti-
tutional development of NRA and to establish a data
system within RTG for monitoring housing sector
performanze.
Project Risks:          Based on NHA's performance in carrying out the two
previous Bank-supported projects, the risks of this
project are expected to be minimal. GHB's involvement
in the mortgage and construction financing of the
project could result in some unforeseen problems, but
the arrangement of joint NHA/GHB beneficiary selection
criteria and GHB's sound financial management and
position should ensure that the proper customers are
selected and that the required funds are available in
a timely manner for the project. While there is some
risk that NHA would not develop the ability to
maintain a steady program of activities in the near
term, technical assistance provided under the project
designed to strengthen its planning capabilities would
be expected to reduce this risk.

THAILAND
I.  SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Background
1.01      Although Thailand's overall level of urbanization is low, its
urban 1- population during 1970-85 increased at about twice the national rate
of growth, by an estimated annual rate of 5.0% compared to about 2.5% for the
total population.   In 1985 the urban population reached 9.2 million or 18% of
a total population of 51.8 million. Due partly to the diminishing supply of
agricultural land suitable for cultivation and the consequent pressure on the
rural population to migrate to urban areas, an estimated 55Z of new urban
population growth during the 1980s will stem from net in-migration. By 2000
the urban population    expected to reach 14.1 million people, or about 22% of
the total population._   The Bangkok Metropolitan Region dominates all other
urban areas of the country with its population of 6.7 million in 1M85. Over
the next 15 years Bangkok is   pected to house one quarter of the total popu-
lation growth of the Kingdom._   Of the estimated 70,000 new urban households
expected to be firmed in Thailand annually during the remainder of the 1980s,
the majority or about 50,000 households per year will be established in the
Bangkok area. Given the projected GDP browth rate of about 5% per year in
real terms over the period 1986-90, implying growing household incomes, the
demand for urban housing, particularly in Bangkok, is expected to remain
strong.
B. Present Housing Conditions and Recent Performance
1.02      Between 1980 and 1985, 217,300 legal housing units were built in
urban areas nationwide, averaging an annual output of 43,500 units. Since the
number of urban households increased by about 65,000 per year during that
period, this has created a housing shortage, estimated by Government at about
135,000 units in 1985. The housing shortage has particularly affected the
lower-income groups and has contributed to the growth of slums in urban
areas. Although no accurate statistics are available, it is estimated that
about 20% of the total population of Bangkok and comparable or larger propor-
tions of the urban populations of major regional cities are living in slum
areas. In Bangkok, where most of the slums are located, about 50% of the slum
populat:ion had incomes below the absolute urban poverty line of US$245 per
1/   Defined as municipal areas which includes cities (nakhons), towns
(muangs), communes (tambons) and sanitary districts.
2/   Assuming an average annual urban growth rate of 2.9% and national growth
rate of 1.3% over the remainder of the decade of the 19809.

capita in 1981; this is not thought to have improved much since ther.. The
physical environmental conditions of the slum areas often consist of swampy,
unfilled lands without proper access, drainage, water supply or other urban
facilities.
1.03      One of the major constraints to expanding the supply of housing in
Thailand has been the scarcity of long-term finance that permits homebuyers
and builders to repay he cost of a house over a period of 10 to 20 years.
A,cording to a study 4 conducted in 1981, only an estimated one in 100
households in the country had access to formal sources of housing finance,
with the average borrower coming from the top 20% of all income earners and
with 80% of all borrowers located in Bangkok. Most of the families who have
had access to housing finance have purchased homes in large housing projects
constructed by private developers who guar-ontee repayments to :he lending
institutions. Very litt:le housing finance from formal financial institutions
has been made available to individuals and none to the public housing sector's
lower-income clientele. As a result, the National Housing Authority
(para. 1.05) has had to provide its own housing finance to ensure the
saleability of units constructed. Due to the sc&rcity of housing finance,
housing standards, particularly for low-income families, are lower than what
would be affordabl! with access to long-term financing, since construction of
houses must be cash-financed and often built in increments over long periods
of time.
1.04      A second major factor sffecting the supply of housing has been the
lack of available serviced land, particularly in Bangkok. Most of the vacant
land in Bangkok with access to services and infrastructura is held by land-
owners who keep the land idle in anticipation of generating higher returns in
the future. In addition, developments on the periphery of the city have
contributed to the disappea-ance of lands which were rented temporarily to
low-income people. Consequently, land supply patterns are worsening,
particularly for lower-income families, and a large proportion of the low-
income population has had to settle on land without adequate urban services
and facilities and usually without secure tenure rights.
C. Development of Housing for the Lower-income Groups
1.05      The development of new housing for the lower-income groups in urban
areas is the exclusive responsibility of the National Housing Authority (NHA),
which provides housing both on its own account and for other public agen-
cies. From 1973, the time of NHA's establishment, to 1985 it constructed
about 84,000 new housing units, representing about 18% of the 457,000 legal
units constructed in total over the period, and upgraded slums which affected
about 35,000 units.
1.06      In its early years, NHA's program emphasized construction of
conventional apartments and detached and semidetached units which were heavily

subsidized for both development costs and interest rates. Because of the sub-
sidies necessary to sustain the program, the Royal Thai Government (RTG) sl;s-
pended approval of new projects in Pecember 1977 and asked NHA to prepare
alternative programs requiring lower subsidies. Based on the first Bank-
supported project which was prepared during 1976-77, NHA shifted its programs
to lower-cost approaches of sites and services developments with full cost
recovery and slum improvement schemes as alternatives to conventional, higher-
cost approaches and slum clearance projects. These new lower-income housing
approaches became the mandate for NHA's program under the Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1982-86) and are expected to continue under the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1987-
91).
D. Housing Finance
Institutional Setti
1.07      Thailand has a well-developed and dynamic financial sector compris-
ing numerous commercial banks, finance companies, credit fonciers, specialized
development finance institutions and others. Of these formal financial insti-
tutions, housing finance is available primarily to upper-income clients
through the Government Housing Bank (GHB), commercial banks, and to a lesser
extent through finance companies and credit fonciers. NHA is also an effec-
tive supplier of housing finance for its own projects (para. 1.03). By the
end of 1980, NHA had more clients than any other housing finance institution,
but because the average loan provided to each household was relatively low due
to the borrowers' lower incomes, NBA ranked third in terms of total housing
finance provided. Although more recent, reliable figures are not available
for all housing finance institutions, it is clear that NHA remains the only
institution providing housing loans for lower-income families. The distri-
bution of outstanding housing loans at end-1980 and end-1984 from formal
sources was as followss

1.08      Informal sources, for example, loans from friends, relatives and
employers, are estimated to provide annually about an equal amount of housing
finance as the formal institutions. Since the average size of a loan from the
informal system is estimated to be half as large as one from the formal sys-
tem, only one borrower in three is estimated to finance the acquisition or
improvement of a home from the formal sector.  Although still very limited,
housing finance from formal institutions is expanding. Further expansion of
housing finance, particularly for the lower income groups, is one of the
Government's objectives in the sector.
E. Housing Policy
1.09      Urtil 1983 the Royal Thai Government (RTG) had no articulated policy
for the housing sector. The RTG's response to the housing problem up to that
time was to encourage the NHA, the only public agency responsible for housing
and the main instrument for shelter policy, to move away from production of
subsidized housing to production of housing for lower- and middle-income
groups at prices which were both affordable and which recovered the appro-
priate costs of development. As a result of the recommendations of a housing
finance study (para 1.03) commissioned under the second Bank-supported housing
project, a permanent Housing Development Policy Subcommittee, composed of
members of the key ministries and institutions in the sector, was established
to develop a policy for the housing sector.  The work of this Subcommittee
culminated in the issuance of the Government's first formal Housing
Development Policy in October 1983.
1.10      The policy statement has two key elements:  first, a redefinition of
the institutional responsibilities in the public sector; and second, a general
statement of the financial policies to be pursued in public sector housing
programs. The policy statement reaffirms NHA's role in providing housing to
the lower-income groups and its movemenZ away from subsidized high-cost hous-
ing. Subsidies to NHA by the government are to be restricted to support its
involvement in slum upgrading in the near term; local governments are expected
to assume increasing responsibility for the implementation and financing of
these projects. NHA is also expected to eliminate progressively its long-term
financing of low-income units, a task for which it is not well-suited and
which is rapidly becoming a burden, and to transfer that role to GHB.  GHB
thus is expected to become the leading financial institution providing long-
term funds for housing development sponsored by both NHA and the private
sector. This will entail an expansion of GHB's activities, wh.ch have been
focused on upper-income groups living in Bangkok, to include the lower-income
grouns served by NHA throughout the country.
1.11      The financial policies for the housing sector stress the importance
of designing projects so that full costs can be recovered from the residents,
within their ability to pay. Interest rates for on-lending and deposits by
GHB, and for on-lending by NBA until its financing activities are phased out,
are to be set according to market conditions in order to facilitate
mobilization of funds and expansion of activities.



1.12      The Housing Development Policy represents .n important first step in
establishing a sound basis for the growth of NHA and GHB. Measures proposed
by the policy for future implementation have been discussed by the Government
and the Bank as part of their dialogue on development of the housing sector
and Bank support for the sector. A number of effective measures designed to
stimulate housing development and its financing have recently been introduced,
and other studies are currently planned to identify further measures to
improve performance in the sector (paras. 2.02-03). Although the policies
established to date are appropriate, the translation of the policy for
lower-income housing development .by NHA into effective programs has not
materialized partly due to NHA's weak planning capabilities (para. 1.14).
F. Bank Strategy in the Sector, Past Experience and Project Rationale
1.13      Since lending to Thailand for housing activities commenced in 1978,
the Bank's assistance has beer, geared to helping the RTG plan and implement a
clearly defined housing policy which addresses the needs of the lower-income
groups. The first project, the Bangkok Sites and Services and slum Upgrading
Project (Loan 1556-TH, 1978), partly financed a limited-scale demonstration of
new approaches to housing, wh ch helped NHA move away from relatively expen-
sive, heavily subsidized housing developments toward replicable, low-cost
schemes and slum improvement projects for the lower-income groups. Technical
assistance provided under the project also helped to identify and begin to
address key management and financial issues in the sector. A project comple-
tion report concluded that most project objectives were met, but that design
problems hampered achievement of the affordability objectives. These design
problems were corrected in the follow-on project, the National Sites and
Services Project (Loan 1870-TH, 1980), which introduced the new housing
approaches to regional cities, supported a study of housing finance and the
financing problems constraining sectoral performance, and assisted in
strengthening NHA's financial position, thus contributing to its institutional
development. The project was implemented satisfactorily.
1.14      While much his been accomplished as a result of the past projects,
including issuance of the housing policy statement, implementation of public
housing programs still suffers from a number of constrairts including NHA's
lack of an adequate planning capability, bureaucratic procedures which delay
approval of plans, and a lack of long-term financing. Bank objectives for the
sector would focus on removal of constraints affecting implementation of
public housing programs, support for the development of a housing finance
system, strengthening the key public institutions in the sector, and further
development of the housing policy to clarify public and private sector roles
in housing development.
1.15      The proposed project would complement the two previous projects by
reinforcing and expanding the past institutional development of NHA in the
areas of planning, management and finance. Rather than focusing on the
details of specific subproject plans and designs, this project emphasizes the
implementation of sound guidelines, principles and criteria to prepare,
approve and implement development projects. As such, it has and would
continue to serve as a vehicle for furthering the sectoral dialogue with RTG

on efficiency objectives and improved output for the sector. The Bank's
involvement in the project has been particularly important in initiating GHB
participation in financing long-term mortgages for housing constructed by
NHA. This would support RTG's objective of expanding housing finance
availability to the lower-income groups to improve their housing conditions.
II. THE SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
A. NESDB's Housing Development Policy Subcommittee
2.01      The Housing Development Policy Subcommitte was established in 1982
to oversee the sector and to establish a national housing policy for the
National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB). It is currently
chaired by an Advisor to the Prime Minister and is composed of representatives
from the Bank of Thailand, GHB, NHA, private developers, the Thai Real Estate
Association, Ministries of Interior and Finance (MOI, MOF), the National
Environmental Board and insurance companies. The Secretariat to the Committee
consists of the NHA, MOF and NESDB representatives.
2.02      The Committee has taken an active role in establishing and improving
policies for the sector. In addition to fotrmulating the first housing policy
statement, the Committee has gained Cabinet approval on a number of measures
designed to stimulate housing development and its financing. In particular,
insurance companies are now permitted to invest more than 10% of their assets
for housing purposes, and they can lend to housing cooperatives (small groups
of families who organize to build together). As of January 1986, up to
B 7,000 (US$270) of mortgage interest on a homebuyer's first house is tax
deductible. Also, the GHB has been encouraged with Bank support to lend to
NHA's clients, rely on domestic savings and establish branches, all of which
measures are under way. In addition, a recent Cabine-approved study earried
out by the Cotmnittee has identified measures for promoting condominium
development by private developers.
2.03      Topics currently on the Committee's agenda for further work include
(a) the modification of building code standards to encourage greater partici-
pation of private developers of middle- and lower-income housing, (b) promo-
tion of provident funds and insurance companies in the financing of NHA and
GHB's activities, (c) improvement of city planning in Bangkok, (d) revision of
property tax laws to encourage efficient development of vacant lands,
(e) drafting of laws for development of a secondary mortgage market, (f) iden-
tification of appropriate tax incentives for developers of low-income housing,
and (g) a study of the requirements for land banking and ways to use
expropriation of land for housing development. The Committee also sees a need
to establish annual housing targets for NHA and private developers and to
expand the housing policy statement to include more specific policies for the
private sector. The establishment of the housing information center under the
proposed project is expected to provide the basis for achieving these needs.

B. National Housing Authority
Background
2.04      The NHA is a state enterprise established in early 1973 by amalga-
mating four public housing agencies. NHA's main activities currently include
construction of lower-income housing for sale, including sites and services;
upgrading of slum areas; servicing and maintenance of housing developments;
provision of long-term finance for house purchase; and design and construction
of housing for other public agencies. NHA previously constructed rental
housing but this has been discontinued under its latest approved plan.
2.05      NHA reports directly to the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and operates
under a Board consisting of representatives from various government agen-
cies. Its chief executive officer, the Governor, is selected by the
Cabinet. Its capital budget and housing plans and projects are reviewed by
MOI and NESDB before being presented to the Cabinet for approval. The MOF
plays a key role in reviewing NHA's borrowing requirements and acquires and
guarantees loans for NHA. The Budget Bureau acts as an executing agency for
the government grants committed to NHA. Finally, housing development
guidelines for NHA are established by NESDB advised by its Housing Development
Policy Subcommittee.
Organization
2.06      NHA was recently reorganized into three units of construction,
finance and administration headed by its Deputy Governors covering six
departments (Construction, Construction Services, Treasury and Financial
?olicy, Marketing, Governor's Office, Community Development). Two other
departments (Policy and Planning, Center for Housing Studies) now report to
the Assistant Governor while the Estate Management Offices report to the
Senior Executive (see Chart 30671A). NBA has attracted generally well-
qualified technical staff, but needs further strengthening at the middle-
management level. Its staff currently numbers about 2,200, which is lower
than the maximum number of 2,540 in 1979 but still too large for current
output. MBA management is attempting to reduce staff levels further by not
filling positions which become vacant.
2.07      NHA's Policy and Planning Department is responsible for developing
program targets and undertaking market analyses for individual subprojects.
Project teams, which are composed of architects, engineers, accountants,
administrators and marketing specialists seconded from the relevant
departments, are responsible for preparation of feasibility studies, design,
construction and sales under hire-purchase arrangements-  of new projects,
following the planning parameters set out by the Policy and Planning
Department. Construction supervision is carried out by engineering staff and
technicians from the relevant project teams.
5/   Similar to a mortgage except that NHA retains ownership of the property
until it is paid in full by the purchaser.



- 8 -
2.08      Once soldt, projects are turned over to the Estate Management Offices
which are responsible for management of the estates. The Estate Management
Offices currently manage some 58,400 units consisting of 37,300 sale units and
21,100 rental units (another 25,600 units have been turned over to other
public aggzcies for management). NHA formerly provided the estates with
services - over the life of the developments, but is gradually turning over
these responsibilities to relevant local government agencies and the occupants
in order to eliminate operating deficits incurred on these activities. To
date, NHA has turned over complete responsibility for management of one
estate, partial responsibility in most others and is planning to complete the
transfer of about 6-7 more sites of the 20 hire-purchase estates during the
coming year.
Program Objectives and Achievements
2.09      Past Performance.  NHA's past performance in carrying out its pro-
grams, which is measured as the number of housing starts per year, is summar-
ized in Table 2.1 below and detailed in Annex 1. Prior to the redirection of
NHA's program in December 1977 to lower-income sites and services type housing
(para. 1.06), NHA's program for the 1976-81 period consisted of constructing
120,000 completed housing units for sale or rental at highly subsidized
rates. In December 1977, this program was reduced to 48,000 units partly
because of NHA's implementation capacity constraints and partly in response to
the policy shift. Some 22,000 sites and services and 30,500 slum upgrading
units were added to the plan as well as about 5,600 less-subsidized rental
units. Implementation of the overall plan was satisfactory at 85X of planned
construction, although completion of some of the projects continued somewhat
beyond 1981, primarily due to land acquisition problems. In this period, NHA
developed significant capacity in planning and implementation of sites and
services and slum upgrading programs.

2.10      The new program directions were continued for the following 5-year
period (1982-86) during which time NHA's plan called for the construction of
30,000 sites and services and 18,000 slum upgrading units. Construction of
subsidized, completed units was entirely eliminated. About 70% of the units
to be built were to be targeted to households below the 50th percentile of the
urban income distribution. Because NHA was expected to remain financially
viable without new government subsidies, the plan also permitted NHA to
enhance its financial position by constructing other special projects (e.g.,
commercial and condominium developments) not to exceed B 1,000 million.
However, various factors intervened to halt NHA's progress. Government
approval of NHA's 1982-86 plan was not obtained until 1984 because of
uncertainty about whether NHA or local governments should be responsible for
slum upgrading and deficiencies in the plan itself which did not demonstrate
how NHA would meet Government's goal of greater self-reliance.  This shortened
the plan period to 1984-86, necessitating a pro rata cut in the size of the
plan as well. Since long-term domestic funds were not available, further
delays of about two years were experienced due to a general reduction in
foreign borrowings by the Government.
2.11      Actual achievement to date has been only about 18% of the plan
targets, including some 2,400 units begun in 1986 supported by an Asian
Development Bank loan (US$38 million) and new slum projects affecting 6,000
families. No special projects have been carried out during the plan period.
Consequently, NHA has faced serious underemployment problems which would have
been even more serious were it not for carry-over works from the previous
plan. NHA's planning and management capacity is to be strengthened under the
proposed loan.
2.12      Development Program 1987-91.  NHA's housinig development program for
the Sixth Five-Year Plan Tt987-9Y, -now being prepared, is expected to include
the construction of about 10,000 lower- and middle-income core housing units
per year. This represents the estimated lower- and middle-income housing need
not being satisfied by the private sector. No funding for slum upgrading
projects will be included in this plan, since it will be provided by local
governments.,  Special projects wilL be requested for inclusion in the amount
of B 1,000 million as under the previous plan (para. 2.11). The core housing
program will have essentially the same features as the previous plan, with 90%
of the units to be constructed in Bangkok and 10% in other cities, reflecting
the housing shortages and demand, and 70% of the units targeted to the lower-
and middle-income groups below the 50th percentile of the urban income
distribution.
2.13      NHA would initiate only about 4,500 core housing units during 1987,
the first plan year, because of the lack of sufficient subprojects prepare4
currently in the pipeline. The number of units to be constructed over the
5-year period would therefore total 44,500 with an investment cost of about
B 6,386 million (US$246 million) in current prices. The first 3.5 plan years
would include construction of 27,500 units approved but not implemented under
the 1984-86 plan. Approval of the remaining 17,000 units to be constructed in
the last 2 plan years would be needed before end-1988 to permit sufficient
time for design. Also, in order to ensure timely implementation of the
6/   Which typically include operation of the area office as well as operation
and maintenance of roads, footpaths, street lighting, sewerage, public
parks and security.



- 10 -
program targets, about 2,500 rai of land will need to be acquired one to two
years in advance of construction in about eight sites in Bangkok and in about
two other cities costing an estimated B 476 million (US$18 million) in current
prices. Advanced long-term planning of the program in proper detail to ensure
timely purchase of land and ?reparation of subprojects for construction would
be necessary for the program s implementation within the plan period. NHA's
planning functions have not in the past responded adequately to this
requirement for advance planning. Technical assistance to strengthen NHA's
planning and prtgramming capabilities (para. 3.07) is expected to cortribute
to timeliness and quality of planning of current and future programs. During
negotiations agreement was reached that NHA's development program for 1987-91
and actual achievement of housing starts under the program would be reviewed
by end-December of each project year with the Bank and measures taken, if
needed, to ensure successful implementation of the program.
Financial Performance and Policies
2.14      Past perfodmance.  NHA's financial position is currently positive
and has improved si ni icantly since t982. Until that time, NHA persistently
ran operating deficits, its internal management controls were inadequate and
it relied heavily on government subsidies and foreign sources of funds. With
assistance under the first Bank-supported sites and services project, measures
to imiprove its financial operations weri identified which have been gradually
introduced. Despite these achievements, certain aspects of NHA's financial
management remain weak, particularly its collection performance, preparation
of financial statements, auditing performance and heavy reliance on foreign
funds. NHA's financial statements (including income statements and balance
sheets) for FY82-85 and its performance indicators are shown in Annex 2.
2.15      Operating Performance.  NHA's operating revenues are generated
mainly from the sale of constructed units, rental of housing units, fees for
management of housing estates, interest payments on hire purchase agreements
and government subsidies for slum upgrading. As mentioned above, NRA elim-
inated its operating deficits in 1982, and during 1981-85 total operating
revenue increased by more than 125% while operating expenditures increased by
only 63%. This improvement is primarily attributable to the increase in
interest income on hire-purchase accounts, due to the completion of new pro-
jects and an increase in onlending rates from 6-12% previously to 152 on pro-
jects completed since 1979, and various other measures including: (a) reco-
very of appropriate costs of new housing developments; (b) implementation of a
policy of zero-growth staff increase; (c) transfer of responsibilities for
operation and maintenance of infrastrtcture and facilities provided on housing
estates to appropriate agencies; and (d) increaseq of previously very low
service charges and rents in old projects.
2.16      NHA's operatin  performance for the past five years is summarized in
Table 2.2 below.  In 1985, NHA's net operating profit of B 178.5 million was
equivalent to 21% of operating revenues and 16% of its equity. Its debt to
equity ratio was 2.9, interest coverage was 1.6 and its net profit (after
covering exchange losses on foreign loans) was B 23 million. With an average
cost of borrowed funds of 8.4%, an average cost of total funds (including
subsidies) of 8.12 and an average on-lending rate for housing loans of 15%,
NHA had a spread of 6.9X on its operations for the year. This is adequate to
cover overhead charges and foreign exchange losses.

2.17      Sources of Funds.  In the past, the primary sources of funds for
NHA's development programs were government capital contributions and subsi-
dies, foreign borrowings and down payments from home purchasers. Government
subsidies have decreased steadily since NHA's initial (1976/77) program, when
all principal and interest on NHA housing loans with rates above 7% were sub-
sidized. The subsidies to home purchasers in NHA's intitial program amounted
to about 75%, on average, of the house capital costs. Since the 1978-82
program, subsidies were restricted to supporting only those capital costs
which NHA could not directly recover, i.e., off-site infrastructure for new
housing developments and slum upgrading works. In 1984, subsidies for off-
site infrastructure were eliminated while an increasing share of the cost of
slum improvement projects is expected to be provided by local governments in
the future. Rental housing construction, which required substantial
government subsidies in the past, has also been eliminated. As of end-1985,
government subsidies to NHA for rental and hire-purchase housing totaled about
B 2,300 million (more than US$100 million), of which about B 1,700 million
were passed on to home purchasers in the form of lowered housing prices.
2.18      Since NHA had to finance subsidy-supported activities initially with
borrowings which the Government is gradually reimbursing, about B 1,850 mil-
lion remain to be paid to NHA over the next 10 years for programs begun before
end-1985. This includes a B 1,000 million bond issue placed by MOF with
commercial banks which the Government refinanced during November 1986 and is
expected ultimately to redeem. The recent government budget approved for FY87
provides B 266 million for payment of additional past subsidies;.



- 12 -
2.19      Of the outstanding long-term loans at end-1985 used to finance NHA's
housing programs (excluding the B 1,000 million bond issue which would be paid
by Government), foreign loans represented about 98Z of the total, comprised of
loans from ADB, the World Bank, USAID guarantee program and other foreign
loans arranged by MOF (mainly irom Japan). Based on recommendations proposed
by a housing finance study included in the second Bank-supported project,
Government's housing policy calls for NHA to reduce its dependence on foreign
funds. Under the proposed project, agreement has been reached with a domestic
bank, the GHB, to provide counterpart construction finance and long-term hous-
ing loans to NHA's customers on a pilot basis. It is expected that this
established link with GHB and successful implementation of the projects so
financed would result in more assured financing arrangements by GHB for
subsequent NHA projects.
2.20      Asset Structure.  At end-1985 NHA's balance sheet showed total
assets of B 7,654 million (US$294 million), primarily composed of land for
construction (5%), construction in progress (17%), completed but unsold units
(1O0), rental units (16%) and hire-purchase agreements (40%). NHA has
recently changed its marketing policy to permit presales of units which were
previously sold only upon completion, and this should help to reduce the pro-
portion of units completed but unsold in its asset structure.
2.21      Collection Performance.  Current assets include arrears of about
B 185 million (US$7 million), which is about 25% of accounts receivable on
rental and hire-purchase properties during FY85. NHA has reserved a provision
for bad debts on rental properties of about 15% of rents overdue. To date
almost no bad debts have been incurred on hire-purchase properties since NHA
retains ownership of the property until it is paid in full and it is in a
strong position to take legal action for nonpayment. NHA charges a penalty
for late payment of hire-purchase payments and is supposed to issue a notice
of termination for renters and purchasers who are more than three months in
arrears. While 75% of current arrears are due from only 14% of its customers
on three large housing estates, NHA is concerned about the problem and
remedial measures are planned. Due to a lack of full cooperation between
NBA's Treasury and Financial Policy Department responsible for colle:tions and
Estate Management Offices responsible for follow-up action, both collection
and follow-up will be centralized in the Estate Management Offices. NHA is
also expected to retain additional private lawyers to assist its legal staff
in follow-up actions. These changes are expected to reduce arrears to 23% in
1987, 21% in 1988, 19% in 1989, 17% in 1990 and 15% thereafter. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with NHA that the above actions would be
carried out in a timely manner and arrears reduced accordingly.
2.22      Financial Management.  NHA's Treasury and Financial Policy Depart-
ment was formerly characterized by weak leadership, inadequate financial plan-
ning, inadequate preparation of information for management, and untimely
reporting of financial results resulting in a lengthy audit process. In 1984
NHA strengthened its financial planning capability and appointed on a
temporary basis a highly qualified staff who has been addressing NHA's
weaknesses in financial planning, reporting and accounting (para. 3.24). In
late 1986 NHA appointed on a permanent basis a new Director of the Department,
who is highly qualified, to continue to address these deficiencies.



- 13 -
2.23      Future Performance.  Projections of NHA's financial performance over
the period 1987-91, including income statements, source and applications of
funds statements and balance sheets, are shown i.i Annex 2. The projections
have been prepared assuming that (a) profits of 10% would be achieved on
housing sales, which is in line with past performance, (b) subsidies from past
programs would be received during 1987 as currently budgeted but due to the
inability of Government to commit to payment beyond that time, no provsSion
for the remaining subsidies has been included, and (c) special projects have
been excluded because of the uncertainty of government clearance for these
projects. The financial projections indicate that NHA's financial position is
expeLted to remain sound over the period. Its debt to equity ratio averaging
2.0 would remain well below a prudent level of 6.0, interest coverage and the
current ratio would be maintained above adequate levels of 1.4 and 1.2,
respectively, and net profits before possible debt revaluation would grow,
from 11% of equity to 17% over the period. Although NHA's cost of funds is
expected to increase due to a greater reliance on domestic sources of funds
and their higher expected cost, the risk of foreign exchange losses, amounting
to B 155 million (US$6 million) in 1985, would be reduced. NHA would also be
projected to maintain an interest spread of at least 2% on its hire-purchase
operations, which when combined with other income would be sufficient to
adequately cover overhead charges.   Actions currently under way to improve
the collection of arrears on hire-purchase and rental properties would be
expected to result in a decrease of the arrears as per para. 2.21. Should
subsidies from past programs be forthcoming after 1987 and special projects be
approved and successfully implemented, NHA's cash and operating positions
would be further enhanced. NHA's financial viability would largely depend on
the proper selection of projects and efficient construction cycle, which would
be achieved under the project agreements. To protect NRA's financial
condition, agreement would be reached during negotiations that NHA maintain a
debt service ratio of at least 1.5.
2.24      NHA's projected resource requirements for investment and land
purchase necessary to implement a program of 44,500 core housing units during
1987-91 would amount to a total of B 6,862 million (US$264 million). The
recently approved ADB II and proposed World Bank loans would support the
construction of about 37% of total units (16,580 units) or about 22% of total
resource requirements, and GHB would provide loans for about 7% of total
resource requirements. For the balance of the implementation program, the
sources of funds would be dependent upon the outcome of NHA's involvement with
GHB under the proposed project. Should the provision of construction and
mortgage finance by GHB prove successful, it is expected that NHA would be
able to supplement its internal cash generation with short-term construction
and long-term mortgage loans from GHB for developments in Bangkok. For the
majority of developments in other cities, NHA may continue to require long-
term loans for development and hire-purchase agreements, since GHB is not
likely to have extended its branches to these areas. The projections have
been developed on the assumptions that mortgage finance for future Bangkok
developments would be provided by GHB and construction finance for about 60%
of the cost of future other cities developments would be provided from other
long-term loans, representing about 17% of total resource requirements. These
assumptions are in line with GHB's desire to expand its operations and support
NHA's operations in the future. Funds for construction in Bangkok and other



- 14 -
purposes would be provided by NHA's internal cash generation contributing 54%
of total financing requirements over the Deriod, which would be a significant
improvement in NHA's ability to contribute to the requirements of housing
development. To properly monitor financial performance, agreement was reached
during negotiations that NHA would prepare a report by end-December of each
project year containing five-year financial projections, beginning with FY87,
to be reviewed by the Bank on an annual basis.
2.25      While the agreed policy for cost allocation and pricing of housing
units for the project are satisfactory, the pricing policy agreed for Bank
subprojects is not consistently applied to other projects. In order to pro-
perly institutionalize an appropriate pricing policy which allows for periodic
review of charging of overheads, technical assistance will be'provided to
NHA's Policy and Planning Department which would, among other things, advise
on an appropriate policy for other future projects (para. 3.07).
C. Government Housing Bank
2.26      Under the proposed project, GHB would participate for the first time
in financing NBA-constructed lower-income housing. GHB has agreed to support
the long-term financing of about 2,000 mortgages in the Bangkok area at the
Nonthaburi site (para. 3.18) and to provide a significant share (about 23%) of
counterpart construction financing for the total project representing about 6%
of NBA's resource requirements over 1987-91. Its participation is expected to
enable NHA to comply with Government's housing policy which encourages the use
of domestic borrowings. The arrangements for the provision of construction
and mortgage finance by CHB have been confirmed in writing to NHA.
2.27      GHB was established in 1953 to "render financial assistance to the
public in the acquisition of residences appropriate to their station in life."
It is a government-owned bank under the supervision of the Ministry of
Finance. Loans are provided to individual borrowers for purchase of land and
houses, building extensions and repairs, and refinancing, as well as to pri-
vate developers for construction of housing projects. Although authorized to
operate nationwide, it currently has no branches outside the capital. While
GHB's past lending has focused on middle- and upper-income families,
government housing policy now calls for it to provide housing finance to
lower-income families as well.
2.28      The organization is headed by a managing director, assisted by a
deputy manager responsible for evaluation and supervision of individual
loans. It has eight divisions for banking functions, credit evaluation (three
divisions), loan supervision, accounting, legal and general administration
(see Chart 30671B). Since 1980 the number of staff has remained stable and
currently totals about 390.
2.29      During 1975-80, GHB's annual lending increased rapidly from
B 61 million (583 borrowers) to B 2,698 million (12,995 individuals and 380
developers). The rapid expansion was severely curtailed in 1981 when only
6,645 mortgage loans were extended. This was due to an effective insolvency
apparently brought about by restrictions on foreign borrowings against which



- 15 -
long-term commitments had already been made and by poor evaluation and manage-
ment of a series cf developer loans which subsequently became bad debts. A
major government rescue operation was launched in 1981 to overcome the crisis,
including a large capital infusion and installation of new management. Since
then, as GHB concentrated on correcting its operational problems, lending
decreased further to 5,215 individual loans in 1982, 3,395 loans in 1983, but
is now on the upswing with 5,436 1oais advanced in 1984 and 6,305 loans in
1985 (Table 2.2).
2.30      GHB's new management has focused on a more effective redeployment of
its staff, whose qualifications are uneven, and improving internal financial
controls. In particular, a badly needed internal reorganization, the develop-
ment of operational manuals for each unit, the decentralization and clarifica-
tion of responsibilities and computerization of its accounts have taken place
over the last several years. This organizational streamlining has begun to
significantly improve GHB's long-term management capabilities and daily
operations.
2.31      The average size of a mortgage loan advanced by GHB has been
generally increasing since 1975, except for 1982 and 1985 when the average
loan size decreased, as shown in the following table:

GHB's average loan size is more than double the loan size needed by an average
NHA borrower (B 105,000-120,000), implying that its lending is still directed
to a predominantly middle- and upper-income clientele. The proposed project
would promote GHB's lending to lower-income households to support its mandate
of playing a leading role in housing finance in a significant way. GHB's
current staff and appraisal techniques are judged adequate to provide the
long-term mortgage loans required for the Nonthaburi subproject in Bangkok.
Its financial position is sound and because ic can adjust its interest rate
for deposits in accordance with mobilization requirements, it is expected to
have sufficient funds available for the mortgages for the Nonthaburi
subproject as well as for the counerpart construction loans for the total
project. GHB's recent income statements and balance sheets for 1984-85 are
presented in Annex 3.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Formulation
3.01      The project was identified in 1981 in the context of NHA's proposal
for the Fifth Five-Year National Economic and Social Development Plan (1982-
86). However, due to a general slowdown of investment activity in Thailand
during the Fifth Plan period and the country's recent economic and budgetary
difficulties, the earlier NHA program had to be modified and its implementa-
tion postponed until the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1987-91).
3.02      The Bank's continuing discussions with Government and the key sector
agencies resulted in the formulation of a project which expands upon the
experience of the previous Bank-assisted projects in two ways. First, in
contrast to the first two loans which were site-specific, the proposed project
would provide financing to support a significant share of NHA's program and
would focus on criteria and procedures for subproject selection and prepara-
tion. This programmatic approach takes into consideration NHA's growing
experience and would provide it with greater flexibility in implementing
government policy while at the same time ensuring that acceptable standards
will be met. Second, the project would initiate NHA's close working
relationship with a domestic housing finance institution, GHB, which would
provide the counterpart construction finance for the project as well as
mortgage finance for a large housing development in the Bangkok area. This
relationship is expected to provide Government with a better understanding of
the requirements for lending to NHA's lower-income clientele.
B. Objectives
3.03      The project is designed to support Government's housing policy and
would have the following objectives:
(a) to increase NHA's reliance on domestically mobilized resources
through the establishment of a functional relationship between NHA
and GHB which would finance part of NHA's new housing construction
and housing finance program;



- 17 -
(b)  to promote GHB's lending to lower-income households to support its
mandate of playing a leading role in housing finance;
(c) to strengthen NHA's management practices, planning capabilities and
policy development functions;
(d) to support NHA's core housing development program for lower- and
middle-income families and to promote sound cost recovery and
project evaluation policies; and
(e) to improve the availability of housing sector data necessary for
proper housing policy development.
C. Project Description
3.04      The project would finance:
(a) construction of about 11,000 core housing units and serviced plots,
including supporting infrastructure and community facilities, of
which about 85% would be located in about six sites in the Bangkok
area and the rest in six other cities; and
(b) technical assistance to (i) strengthen NRA's planning and policy
development functions; (ii) expand computer facilities and enhance
computer use in data processing within NHA, including development of
an efficient management information system; (iii) assist NRA in
developing more cost-efficient housing prototypes and infrastructure
standards; and (iv) contribute to the establishment of a Housing
Information Center to be attached to NESDB's Housing Policy
Subcommittee.
Subproject Eligibility Criteria
3.05      Each NHA development site represents a subproject for which the
design is outlined in a feasibility study. Subprojects eligible for financing
under the project would comply with site and design parameters as well as
financial and economic criteria which are summarized below and described in
detail in Annex 4.
(a) City/Site Selection. Except for sites in Bangkok where the demand
for low-cost housing has been demonstrated, the feasibility study
would include findings of a housing market review which demonstrates
the demand for lower-income housing and high existing/expected
growth due to particular industrial or other employment opportuni-
ties. Sites must be located close to centers of employment and with
suitable access to trunk infrastructure.
(b) Technical and Operational. Design parameters relating to land use
efficiency, plot size, type of core houses and infrastructure would
follow established NHA standards and practices developed under



- 18 -
previous projects and found acceptable. To ensure prompt transfer
of completed facilities to the appropriate agencies, the feasibility
studies would include preliminary agreements between NHA and the
institutions to be responsible for operation and maintenance of sub-
project infrastructure. The National Environmental Board would also
review the acceptability of the proposed sewage disposal systems.
(c)  Financial.  Subprojects would be affordable to households primarily
in the 15th-50th percentile range of the income distribution. Sales
prices and estate management fees would be calculated, utilizing
differential land pricing, to recover full development and recurrent
costs and overheads. Units would be sold to families which meet
particular beneficiary selection criteria.
(d)  Economic.  Subprojects should have an economic rate of return
(computed according to the Bank's standard methodology) at least
equal to the opportunity cost of capital in Thailand (currently
estimated to be 12%).
3.06      During project appraisal the feasibility studies for four subpro-
jects (Lampang, Nakorn Ratchasima, Pattaya and Nonthaburi in Bangkok), repre-
senting 28% of the units to be supported under the project, were found to com-
ply with the agreed criteria and are suitable for Bank financing. The key
features of the subprojects reviewed are summarized in Annex 5. During nego-
tiations agreement #as reached with NHA that further subprojects proposed for
Bank financing would meet these criteria.
Technical Assistance
3.07      Technical assistance would be provided to NHA to strengthen its
management practices, planninp capabilities and policy development functions
in three specific areas. First, in order to imp:ove the efficiency of its
operations, NRA would be assisted in identifying appropriate systems for com-
puterization, in implementation of the computer system and in training of
staff in computer use. Accounting staff in NRA's Treasury and Financial
Poiicy Department would also receive further training in the use of a com-
puterized accounting information system, already introduced. Second, assist-
ance would be provided to NHA's Policy and Planning Department to strengthen
its capability for program and subproject planning, to improve NHA's capa-
bility to coordinate with local authorities and utility agencies for sub-
project development and to establish an appropriate sales pricing policy for
all aspects of NHA's development program. Third, assistance would be provided
to NHA's Construction Department to explore lower-cost alternatives to infra-
structure and dwelling unit design and to establish a permament research and
development function within NHA. In addition, assistance would be provided to
NESDB's Housing Policy Subcommittee to establish a Housing Information Center
to monitor activities in the sector and to provide housing data in a timely
manner necessary for proper policy development. Draft outline terms of refer-
ence for the technical assistance components are included in Annex 6.

D. Cost Estimates
3.08      The total project cost is estimated at about B 1,882 million
(US$72,4 million equivalent) of which B 541 million (US$20.8 million) or about
29% is the foreign exchange component. Taxes and duties are estimated at
about US$7.3 million equivalent and are included in the cost estimates. Base
costs are expressed in December 1986 prices. Summary project cost estimates
are shown in Table 3.1 and detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 7.
3.09      Project costs were estimated by NHA for core houses on the basis of
average urit costs for NHA's standard house types as received in recent bids,
and for infrastructure on the basis of preliminary designs for fo--r project
sites. The land cost is the actual purchase price or bid price for land
proposed to be acquired. The consultant services to be provided by individual
specialists are estimated to require about 78 man-months in total, including
50 man-months of foreign and 28 man-months of local consultants. NHA's
engineering and management costs are estimated at 7% of civil works. Because
of the repetitive and standard character of works, physical contingencies are
estimated at 5% of base costs (excluding the cost of land). Price contingen-
cies for both local currency and foreign costs are based on expected increases
in construction costs of 3% in 1987, 1% p.a. in 1988-90 and 3.5% p.a.
thereafter. In total, physical contingencies are estimated at about 4% of
base cost and price contingencies are estimated at 4% of base cost plus
physical contingencies.

Note: Identifiable taxes and duties are about B 190 million (US$7.3 million
equivalent) and the total project cost net of taxes is B 1,692 million
(US$65.0 million equivalent).
E. Financial Artangements
3.10      The proposed Bank loan of US$21 million (B 546 million equivalent)
would finance about 29% of total project cost (equivalent to 32% of total
project cost net of taxes and duties), which would cover the foreign exchange
costs of the project. The remaining 71% of total project cost would be
financed by NHA from .nternal cash generation (B 834 million or 44%) and by
NHA borrowings in the form of bonds underwritten by GHB (B 502 million or
27%). NHA intends to identify suitable grant financing for the technical
assistance component (para. 3.17) and, if successful, NHA's share of financing
would be reduced accordingly. Interest during construction (B 337 million)
would be financed from NHA's internally generated funds. The financing plan
for the project cost and interest dvTing construction, summarized below, was
confirmed during negotiations.

3.11      The Bank loan would be made directly to NHA, guaranteed by the
Kingdom of Thailand, for a period of 17 years, including four years grace, at
the standard variable interest rate. NHA would bear the full cost of the
loan, including the foreign exchange risk and commitment fees. The NHA bonds
are expected to be underwritten by GHB, guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand,
for a period of about ten years, with the principal repayable at maturity, at
the prevailing market interest rate, currently about 12x. GCB would also
provide about B 320 million of mortgage loans (representing about 70% of the
total estimated sales prices of the housing units or about 13% of the total
financing requirements of the project) at market terms (described below) to
NHA's customers at the Nonthaburi site in Bangkok.
Terms of Loans to Beneficiaries
3.12      Loans to individual beneficiaries for hire-purchase agreements and
mortgages would be made at GHB's prevailing terms for low-cost residential
developments, which are currently up to 20 years at an interest rate of 15%.
Purchasers of commercial plots to be sold on hire-purchase terms would repay
the loans at a 15X interest rate over 15 years. Down payments of between 10-
30% would be required in advance from the purchasers of the various plots.
Inflation and Interest Rates
3.13      Inflation rates 71 in Thailand were about 1% in 1984, 3% in 1985 and
2% in 1986 and are estimated at 3% in 1987, 1% p.a. in 1988-90 and 3.5% p.a.
thereafter. Market interest rates have generally kept ahead of inflation in
Thailand. Interest rates to subborrowers would be set at prevailing market
rates and are therefore expected to be positive in real terms for the new
housing developments supported by the project.

- 22 -
F. Implementation Arrangements
3.14      The project would be implemented by NHA, as in past projects, in
close consultation with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), other
local governments, and water and electricity authorities. NHA relies on local
governments and public utility agencies in some instances to provide off-site
infrastructure and to maintain services upon completion of construction (e.g.,
electricity, water supply, garbage collection). In the past, NHA has experi-
enced problems at some sites due to the lack of provision of essential sup-
porting infrastructure at the time of project completion which has affected
sales progress. In order to ensure that designs are acceptable and that
arrangements for operation and maintenance of infrastructure and provision of
services are in place upon project completion, the subproject eligibility cri-
teria require agreements between NHA and the relevant agencies during the
planning stage for each subproject. It is expected that with advance notice
the public utility agencies would be able to plan for contributions to the
capital cost of the utility networks provided within NHA's housing estates.
Project Organization
3.15      In connectien with implementation of a new organization structure
(para. 2.06), NHA created a Project Management Committee in November 1986 to
be responsible for timely implementation of NHA's various projects. The
Project Management Committee is headed by the Governor and comprises the rele-
vant senior managers of NHA including the directors of the departments
involved in project implementation. The Project Management Committee oversees
the project teams, composed of architects, engineers, accountants, administra-
tors and marketing specialists, which are formed to prepare, implement and
market the subprojects. Each project team is headed by a Project Manager who
reports to the Project Management Committee through a Project Director and his
Assistant, who are members of the Committee. The Bank-financed subprojects,
together with other externally-supported projects, would be implemented by
four project teams reporting to two Assistant Project Directors and a Project
Director who is on the level of Assistant Governor. Agreement was reached
dur4;g negotiations that these project managepment arrangements would be
maintained during the project period.
Status of Preparation
3.16      Land has been acquired for eight sites accommodating about 70% of
the housing units to be supported under the project. Of the remaining three
sites, acquisition of one (Udonthani) is in progress. NHA's Board also
approved in principle the purchase of the remaining two sites in Bangkok,
which are being identified. Bidding documents for construction of about 28%
of the units, located in four sites, would be ready for invitation of bids
between January and April 1987 and contracts should be awarded between
February and May 1987. Design and bidding documents for the remaining sites
would continue to be prepared by NHA engineering staff. Since engineering
designs for a site can only be initiated after land for that site is fully
acquired, it would be important for NHA to proceed with acquisition of land
for the remaining three'sites. The project is expected to be implemented over



- 23 -
a five-year period from January 1987 to December 1991. The closing date would
be December 31, 1992. The proposed implementation schedule is shown in Annex
8. At negotiations agreement was reached that NHA would proceed with the
remaining land acquisition and would allocate adequate staff for preparing the
studies, designs and bidding documents within the implementation schedule.
3.17      With regard to technical assistance, NHA has requested the Depart-
ment of Technical and Economic Cooperation (DTEC) to assist in identifying
grant financing and DTEC is currently processing the request. It is expected
that such processing including appointment of advisors to provide technical
assistance would be completed in December 1987, so that advisory services may
start in April 1988 and be completed in December 1990. While the selection
and appointment of advisors would be the joint responsibility of NHA and the
financing agency, the Bank would discuss the suitability of the proposed
candidates. At negotiations, agreement was reached on the content of the
terms of reference, the financing of technical assistance (para. 3.10) and
that the component would be completed by December 1990.
Mortgage Finance
3.18      The provision of long-term mortgage finance by GHB for the home
purchasers at the Nonthaburi subproject is an experimental feature of the
project, designed to gain a better understanding of the requirements for lend-
ing to NHA's lower-income clientele. It is expected that NHA would conduct
preliminary screening of the applicants before sending them to GHB which would
then conduct credit searches under their normal procedures. Joint NHA/GHB
beneficiary selection criteria are detailed in Annex 4. Presales would be
emphasized in order to permit GHB sufficient time to evaluate the prospective
customers in time for subproject completion. NHA would subdivide the land to
permit the provision of individual titles to property purchasers at the time
of sale. Due to the large number of prospective GHB customers (about 2,000),
GHB is planning to construct s branch office in this growing area of Bangkok
which would greatly facilitate monthly mortgage payments.
G. Procurement

3.20      Following NHA's well established practices,8/ five major works con-
tracts for sites in Bangkok (US$43.9 million) would be divided into three to
five lots, each lot consisting of 400-500 core houses. These would be grouped
as practicable and procured through international competitive bidding (ICB),
in accordance with Bank guidelines; bids for separate lots would also be
acceptable. On the basis of past experience, it is expected that local firms
would win most of these. The remaining civil works (US$8.0 million) would be
carried out under six contracts worth US$1.1-1.7 million each, located on
scattered sites over the country. These are unlikely to be of interest to
foreign bidders and would be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB),
which is satisfactory to the Bank. The civil works contracts would include
construction of core houses as well as infrastructure within the contract
limits except for the electricity networks (US$2.2 million) on each project
site which would be negotiated with the appropriate electricity authority.
8/   In previous projects NHA gained experience with both large civil works
contracts covering the whole site and a number of smaller contracts for
subdivided sites. Its experience with the latter approach has clearly
been more favorable as it introduced greater competition, reduced the
risk of nonperformance by a single contractor and improved the speed of
selling core houses on the site.



- 25 -
The engineering and supervision of construction as well as sale administration
would be done by NHA staff. Advanced contracting for about US$4 million would
be permitted to expedite project implementation of two housing contracts.
3.21      Contract Review.  All bidding pack- ges for civil works estimated to
cost US$2.0 million equivalent and over would be subject to the Bank's prior
review of procurement documentation. This would cover about 85% of the total
estimated value of civil works contracts. The balance of civil works con-
tracts would be subject to post-review by the Bank after contract award.
Standard bidding documents and the technical specifications common to all NHA
civil works contracts have been reviewed during appraisal and found
acceptable.
H. Disbursement
3.22      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed against 40% of
total expenditures for civil works. All disbursements would be made against
standard Bank documentation.
3.23      The estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 9 along with
actual disbursement under the second Bank-supported loan to NHA and the coun-
try profile for all loan types. It is expected that disbursements would be
completed by end-1992, about one year after completion of civil works. The
disbursement period of six years is estimated to be the same as the second
Bank-assisted project in view of the similar character of both projects. Dis-
bursement profiles differ somewhat due to more advanced preparation of this
project as compared to the second Bank-supported project.
I. Accounts and Audits
3.24      NH!A has prepared unaudited project accounts and financial statements
in a timely manner as required under the project agreements for the two
previous Bank-supported projects, but auditied accounts have been received by
the Bank about two years after the end of the fiscal year. This was expected
for the first accounts of FY79 and FY80 due to major accounting changes being
recommended and implemented as a result of studies undertaken in the first
Bank-supported project. More recently, the slow receipt of audited accounts
has been due to a slowdown within NHA in processing financial information,
mainly accounts receivables, and preparing final accounts and a lengthy audit
process resulting from the need to resolve discrepancies in the accounts
receivables. An accounting firm was retained by NHA to bring the accounts
receivables up to date through end-FY83 on a new computerized system, which is
now completed. Delays in processing subsequent accounts have been experienced
by NHA staff due to start-up problems with the new computer system which are
now largely overcome. Technical assistance would be provided under the
project for further training of the accounting staff in computer usage (para.
3.07) to ensure that future financial accounts would be produced in a timely
manner. A timetable for receipt by the Bank of the overdue FY85 audit report
was established by NHA which provides for its receipt by no later than
15 months after the originally scheduled date (end-June 1987). Beginning with
FY86, future audit reports are expected to be received on time. During nego-



- 26 -
tiations, agreement was reached with NHA that the overdue audit report for
FY85 would be received by the Bank by end-June 1987.
3.25      For reporting on the use of Bank loan proceeds under this project,
separate project accounts would be produced by NHA as under the past two proj-
ects. Agreement was reached with NHA at negotiations that beginning in FY87
the project accounts as well as the financial statements including a source
and application of funds statement would be audited on a consistent basis by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, with the audit reports submit-
ted to the Bank by June 30 of the following calendar year. As part of the
audit of the project accounts, the auditor would provide a comment on com-
pliance with financial covenants under the Bank loan.
J. Supervision and Reporting
3.26      The Bank supervision effort would focus on review and approval of
feasibility reports prepared by NHA for individual subprojects which meet the
eligibility criteria. The review is intended to ascertain that all analyses
have been properly performed, that expected beneficiaries are within the tar-
get group and that economic rates of return are acceptable. It is estimated
that six to eight subproject feasibility reports for new housing developments
would be reviewed over the next two years. In addition, semi-annual progress
reports to be prepared by NBA for submission to the Bank will be reviewed to
monitor construction performance, performance of key indicators (Annex 10),
compliance with loan covenants and progress of technical assistance to ensure
that project objectives will be achieved. A project completion report (PCR)
would be prepared by NHA within six months of the loan closing date. In
addition, NBA would prepare an evaluation of the impact of the GHB scheme for
providing mortgages to NHA's customers in a timely manner to identify any
problem areas in the coordination effort and to evaluate how well the income
objectives of the project have been met. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with WHA that feasibilty reports meeting subproject eligibility
criteria and semi-annual progress reports would be prepared in a timely manner
by NHA in a format acceptable to the Bank, that a PCR would be prepared by NHA
within six months of the loan closing date, and that an evaluation report of
GHB mortgage financing would be prepared by NHA in a timely manner.
K. Environmental Impact
3.27      Planning and implementation of NHA housing programs are carried out
to minimize negative physical effects on the environment. Provision of health
services by each municipality and potable water, which would be supported
under the project, would prevent the occurrence of endemic diseases. Collec-
tion and disposal of solid wastes would be incorporated within the existing
system in each municipality, which would remain responsible for maintaining
such services. Since no central sewerage systems exist in project locations,
liquid wastes would be treated in accordance with existing practices in
Thailand in individual septic tanks, each complemented by a filter to remove
suspended solids. Desludging of tanks would be done by municipalities which
have adequate capacity for such tasks. Overflows from filters would be



- 27 -
collected by combined sewerage and drainage systems and discharged in the
nearest body of water (klong, river). The National Environmental Board
reviews the suitability of such arrangements for proper environmental control.
L.  Benefits and Risks
Economic Justification
3.28      The proposed project would help to address the housing shortage for
lower-income families in project cities, strengthen public institutions in the
housing sector, and contribute to development of appropriate housing poli-
cies. Approximately 9,100 uni:s in Bangkok and 1,900 units in other cities
along with supporting services will be provided under the project. The com-
mercial areas provided in the housing development would provide employment
opportunities close to their homes for primary wage earnerq atd their depen-
dents. Technical assistance would support the strengthening of NHA's manage-
ment practices, planning capabilities and policy development functions and
would improve the availability of housing sector data necessary for proper
policy development. In addition, construction under the project would
generate employment opportunities for workers in construction-reLated
activities.
New Housing Developments
3.29      The estimated rental values of dwellings to be constructed under the
project and estimated market values of the community facilities and market
areas at the various sites were used as measures of the economic benefit of
the subprojects. Estimates of rental values were based on current rents
charged for similar structures in the vicinity of the housing developments.
All land, development, building and recR;rent costs were considered in the
analysis and adjusted to exclude taxes,t interest charges and estimated
inflation. Costs as well as benefits were considered over a 30-year period.
The weighted average internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the 4 sub-
projects reviewed during appraisal, which account for 27% of the total project
cost, was 15% (Table 3.4). Sensitivity analyses show that with a 10% increase
in costs or a 10% decrease in benefits, the IERRs of all 4 subprojects would
still be above the opportunity cost of capital currently estimated at 12%.
The IERRs for the remaining subprojects are expected to be similar.

Project Impact on Urban Poverty Population
3.30      Based on Bank methodology, the relative per capita urban poverty
threshold in Thailand is currently about US$360 compared to the country's per
capita GNP of about US$820 in 1985. Based on an urban household size of
5.0 persons, this implies that approximately 5% of the urban households in
Bangkok are living below the urban poverty line. Urban poverty is more acute
in other cities where the share of households below the urban poverty line is
estimated to be about 28%. Based on thase figures, the overall urban poverty
content of the project is 3%. Of the new housing developments provided under
the project, two of the five housing options are affordable by the urban poor
in cities outside of Bangkok. Furthermore, the provision of new housing would
also benefit poorer households by freeing up rental accommodations where most
of the prospective home purchasers currently live. Although only about 3% of
project beneficiaries live in extreme poverty, about 70% or 38,500 persons of
the 55,000 persons benefitting from the project would be in the lower half of
the urban income distribution.
Project Risks
3.31      Since NHA has demonstrated its ability to carry out two previous
Bank-supported projects in a satisfactory manner, the risks associated with
executing this third Bank-supported project are expected to be minimal.
Delays due to land acquisition, the major source of delay in the second proj-
ect, would be averted since the majority of land parcels are already fully
acquired and approval from NHA's Board for purch&,e of the remainder has been
obtained. The involvement of CHB in financing project mortgages and construc-
tion could result in some unforeseen problems, but the arrangement of joint
NHA/GHB beneficiary selection criteria and GHB's sound financial management
and position should ensure that the proper customers are selected and that the
required funds are available in a timely manner for the project. Success in
the housing sector in reaching the lower-income groups will depend on NHA's
ability to develop sustainable programs over time and domestic financing



- 29 -
sources. While there is some risk that NHA would not develop the ability to
maintain a steady program of activities in the near term, technical assistance
provided under the project designed to strengthen its planning capabilities
would be expected to reduce this risk. Monitoring NHA's performance in this
area would be a focus of Bank supervision.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements at Loan Negotiations
4.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached regarding:
(a) annual Bank review of NHA's housing development program for 1987-91
and its achievement (para. 2.13);
(b) improvement of collection performance of hire-purchase and rental
accounts (para. 2.21);
(c) maintenance of satisfactory debt service ratio (para. 2.23);
(d) preparation of report of five-year financial projections
(para. 2.24);
(e) subproject eligibility criteria (para. 3.06);
(f) project management arrangements (para. 3.15);
(g) land acquisition and preparation of studies, designs and bidding
documents (para. 3.16);
(h) implementation of technical assistance (para. 3.17);
(i) overdue audit reports and auditing requirements (paras. 3.24 and
3.25); and

SUBPROJECT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
A. City and Site Selection Criteria
City Selaction    To ensure a fair distribution of low/middle income housing
Objectives:       among growing cities; to address the demand for low/middle
income housing; to meet national priorities.
1.        The cities will be selected according to the distribution of
national priorities for housing development, which calls for the construction
by NHA of about 8,500-9,000 units/year in the Bangkok area and about 1,000-
1,500 units/year in regional cities.
2.        All subprojects will be located in the urban areas of Bangkok,
regional cities or other towns which have a minimum population of 50,000 in
1984 and which have significant projected population growth rates of 2.5% or
more over the near term. Population data will be provided for the past five
years and projected over the next five years.
3.        Cities with population levels less than this minimum will be consid-
ered for eligibility provided that it can be demonstrated that population
growth will be substantially high due to particular industrial or other
employment opportunities.
4.        The urban areas selected will have substantial currently unmet
lower-income housing demand and/or substantial projected growth in demand as a
result of new employment opportunities, as indicated by a housing market sur-
vey carried out by NHA. The housing market survey will include, inter alia,
information on the current economic base and trends of economic growth, hous-
ing conditions and problems, housing demand-absorption rate by income groups,
household characteristics, and prices paid for various types of housing
expressed in rental values and/or sales prices.
Site Selection   To support the orderly growth of cities; to stimulate other
Objectives:      housing development; to ensure adequate provision of support-
ing services and infrastructure; to promote timely comple-
tion; to ensure tnat demand by the target population for
project housing can be met.
1.        Each subproject will be located close to centers of employment or
industrial activity or projected employment opportunities within reasonable
travel times and costs for the residents, as irdicated by distance, mode of
transport, and time and costs involved from the site to major employment
centers.
2.        Each subproject will be located with suitable access to trunk infra-
structure (e.g., water supply, electricity network, etc.) or can be connected

to trunk infrastructure with minimal additional investment, as indicated on a
location map.
3.        The subproject sites should be in "buildable" physical condition.
This would include minimal flooding (allowing for reasonable amount of land
fill, if necessary), topography for building and drainage, and adequate soil
conditions for load bearing capacity. Sites which can be corrected within
affordability constraints will be considered for eligibility.
4.        Arrangements with local government and/or other agencies will have
been worked out for necessary municipal services and supporting infrastructure
to the site, as demonstrated by an agreement of understanding between NHA and
each agency concerned.
5.        A subproject site has been acquired or sufficient progress has been
made in acquisition (including acquisition of leasehold rights where applica-
ble) so that this will not delay implementation.
6.        A subproject must be capable of being implemented before the closing
date of the Bank loan, as shown by an implementation schedule.
B. Technical and Operational Criteria
Objectives:    To promote the construction of housing which is affordable to
lower-income families; to ensure good and compatible land uses
to encourage positive city development; to ensure environ-
mentally sound development; to encourage responsive designs.
1.        Subprojects will be designed with due regard to efficiency and
economy to permit the construction of housing which is affordable to lower-
income families, according to NWA plan requirements (see Financial Criteria,
item 1).
2.        Subproject infrastructure and superstructure planning and design
standards will follow established NHA standards and practices which will also
be acceptable to local governments and infrastructure operating agencies.
3.        Land use plans will provide a marketable residential area of at
least 65X of the total size area. Community facilities will not be included
when assessing total land devoted to residential use. Shophouses will be
considered commercial properties and not included in the residential
category. The remaining area will be reasonably balanced among open space,
community and commercial facilities, parks and circulation use.
4.        The road system will be designed so as to maximize an efficient
circulation, minimize development cost and reduce the length of main roads in
the system.
5.        Open spaces will be designed with regard to their optimal location
in terms of distances to housing units, their size in terms of their
utilization potential and their separation from vehicular traffic to preserve
safety.

6.        Developments in the vicinity of Bangkok and within the designated
land subsidence zones in particular shall not utilize groundwater sources
without permission of the groundwater regulatory authorities.
7.        The water supply system will be designed to provide at least 150
liters per capita per day. In instances where the systems will be turned over
to water authorities for operations after construction, NHA will ensure
approvals of design by the respective water authorities prior to construction
and will agree on procedures and timing for turnover.
8.        The sanitation system shall be an on-site facility or water borne
collection system appropriate to the site and local standards.
9.        The subproject will be environmentally sound with regard to solid
waste and sewage disposal. The proposed system for disposal of liquid wastes
will reflect the National Environmental Board comments and recommendations.
Collection of solid waste will remain the responsibility of each municipality
and will be arranged in accordance with existing policies of the municipality.
10.       Industrial areas will not be included in future subprojects unless
the demand is substantiated.
C. Financial Criteria
Objectives: To ensure affordability by the target income group and financial
viability of the subprojects.
1.        All new housing subprojects will be targeted to b/ affordable mainly
by households below the 50th percentile of the appropriate _/ urban household
income distribution, with about 70X of the plots to be reserved for this group
in line with NHA plan targets as follows:

2.        Affordability calculations for new housing developments will be
prepared on the basis of the following assumptions:
(a) all subproject costs, including land, site preparation, on-site
infrastructure, house construction, off-site infrastructure, design
and supervision, interest during construction, general administra-
tion and marketing expenses and physical contingencies will be
recovered from the residents through plot sales by NRA under hire-
purchase arrangements or by GHB under mortgage payments or through
rents by NHA under lease arrangements in cases where NHA has
acquired leasehold rights;
(b) down payments of between 10-30% of the purchase price of the unit
will be required on the residential and commercial plots;
(c)  the interest rate to be charged will be the GHB rate for residential
properties prevailing at the time of sale;
(d) the repayment period for residential and commercial plots will
usually be 20 and 15 years, respectively; changes to these terms
will be discussed and agreed with the Bank;
(e) an estate management fee will be charged each homebuyer to recover
the costs for the first five years of the recurring expenditures
associated with estate management, which includes administration of
the area office and operation and maintenance of common facilities.
After five years, estate management will be the responsibility of
the community; and
(f) the monthly hire-purchase payment, monthly mort*ge payment or
monthly lease payment will not exceed 25% of total monthly household
income, and the total payment for housing including monthly payment
mentioned above, estate management fee, water and electricity
charges will not exceed 30% of total monthly household income.
3.        Project cash flows will be presented showing all sources and uses of
funds for project start-up, construction and repayment periods.
4.        Sales prices of units will be calculated, utilizing differential
land pricing, to recover the following actual costs:
(a) land at market value;
(b) full cost of civil works and core house construction;
(c) off-site infrastructure;
(d) design and supervision costs of 5% on civil works;
(e) interest during construction;
(f) general administration and marketing costs of 2% on civil works; and

(g)  profit on the overall cost of the development, determined on the
basis of affordability by the residents.
5.        Sales prices will be fixed six months before construction completion
and presales will commence at that time. Advertisements will specify target
income ranges for each unit type.
6.        Residents selected should meet the criteria of beneficiary selection
as in Table 3A.
7.        Subprojects partially financed by Asian Development Bank would not
be eligible for financing under the Bank loan.
D. Beneficiary Selection Criteria
Objectives: To promote the selection of the appropriate income groups in the
developments and minimize the risk of default.
For projects in which NHA is responsible for selection of residents:
1.        Priority will be given to applicants registered on an NHA waiting
list.
2.        Applicant must be a Thai resident.
3.        Applicant of low income unit must not have purchased any NHA unit
previously or own another house.
4.        Applicant must submit an income certificate from his employer.
5.        Incomes will be checked and verified to the extent possible with
employers or through home interview.
6.        Down payments of 10-30% would be required.
For projects in which GHB is responsible for selection of residents:
1.        Steps 1-4 above would apply.
Credit searches and income verification would be carried out under
norit GHB procedures.
3.        The mortgage loan would not exceed 20 times monthly income.
4.        Down payments of 30% would be required.

E. Methodology for the Computation of the ERR of Housing Schemes
Objectives: To test for the economic merit of subprojects and ensure an
adequate economic rate of return.
1.        The economic rate of return (ERR) for housing schemes is computed on
the basis of the standard comparison between project costs and benefits. The
ERR is the discount rate which equates the present value of the benefit stream
to the present value of the cost stream. Subproject capital costs for new
housing include land and infrastructure costs, building costs, design and
supervision costs, and physical contingencies. Subproject recurring costs
include all expenses necessary to maintain the project (infrastructure and
buildings) as appropriate. The following adjustments to the cost computation
are necessary to determine the economic costs of the project.
(a) land should be valued at its opportunity cost;
(b) taxes, duties and interest charges should be excluded since they are
internal transfers; and
(c) capital and recurring costs should be computed net of inflation.
2.        The mea3ure of benefits is generally computed as the annual rental
value of the units constructed. The underlying assumption in this methodology
is that the rent level is a measure of the willingness of the general public
to pay for the services provided through the subproject. For new construction
projects, the rental value would be estimated on the basis of the rent paid in
the project city for similar accommodations (e.g., in terms of size, location,
quality of finishing, etc.). Therefore, the benefits flow accruing to a sub-
project will be the estimated rental value of all the units in the subproject.
As in the case of the computation of costs, the flow of benefits should be
calculated net of inflation and transfers. The benefit stream should be pre-
sented over the economic life of the investment, which for housing projects of
this type is typically shown for about 30 years.
3.        The minimum acceptable rate of return for a subproject would be the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand, which is estimated at about 12% in
1986.
