strengthen NHA's management\n            practices, support housing programs for lower and middle\n            income families, and improve the availability of housing\n            sector data necessary for housing policy development. The\n            project includes support for the construction of serviced\n            sites and core housing for about 11,000 lower and middle\n            income households in Bangkok and other cities, which meet\n            subproject eligibility criteria. In addition, technical\n            assistance will be provided to support institutional\n            development of NHA and to establish a data system within the\n            Government for monitoring housing sector performance."}, "docdt": "1987-02-05T00:00:00Z"}
