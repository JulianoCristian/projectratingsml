The objectives of FIP were to pave the way for\n            sustainable irrigation development in theSenegal Valley and,\n            in particular, to modernize the irrigated areas and increase\n            cropping intensities.FIP was to be implemented over five\n            years and included the following components: (a)\n            modernization of three perimeters (7,000 ha); (b) training\n            of staff of the Soci&e d'Amenagement de\n            d'Exploitation des Terres du Delta du Fleuve Senegal et\n            des Valles du Fleuve SeMnegael t de la Faleme (SAED) and\n            farmers; (c) development of a credit network for farmers;\n            (d) financing for part of SAED's operating expenses;\n            (d) maintenance equipment and spare parts for SAED; (f)\n            studies on diversifying irrigation development in the\n            Senegal Valley; (g) strengthening SAED's planning and\n            development, accounting, and training departments; and (h)\n            support for research, reforestation, and health. Project\n            objectives were clear, realistic, and relevant to the\n            country and the sector and the planned physical targets were\n            considered to be achievable. The performance of the Bank and\n            the Borrower was satisfactory during project implementation,\n            however, more attention should have been paid by the Bank\n            during supervision to the production aspects. The main\n            lessons learned from implementation of FIP are: (a)\n            Large-scale irrigation schemes based on heavy investments in\n            infrastructure and pumped water equipment are very expensive\n            to operate and maintain. Their feasibility depends on\n            optimal land and water use, on higher yields and crop\n            intensity, and oncrop diversification. (b) The transfer of\n            operation and maintenance responsibilities to community\n            groups (WUAs) has to be accompanied, at a very early stage\n            by comprehensive training,including technical and managerial\n            training and technical assistance. (c) It would have been\n            better to disengage SAED gradually, rather than abruptly\n            from its production activities, and thus ensure a smooth\n            transition and prevent any possible disruption in\n            production. (d) Bank supervision missions should be\n            adequately staffed with a range of skills to address all\n            important aspects of project implementation. The future\n            production performance of FIP may be positively influenced\n            by the introduction of short-gestation \"Sahel\"\n            rice varieties facilitating double cropping; its financial\n            performance could be improved by the possible connection to\n            a higher level irrigation outlet at the Diama barrage,\n            converting areas presently under pump irrigation to gravity\n            irrigation, thus reducing irrigation costs."}, "docdt": "1997-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
