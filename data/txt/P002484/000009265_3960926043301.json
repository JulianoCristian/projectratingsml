Sablaale in 1981 to develop an\n            improved rainfed agricultural technology for Somalia's\n            semi-arid zones. Overall, the project aims to put in place a\n            technical and oganizational system as part of a larger\n            strategy which includes irrigation, livestock, health and\n            range development projects.  The project will: 1) refine and\n            improve semi-mechanized rainfed (SMR) technology in Somalia\n            through onsite adaptive trails; 2) study the institutional\n            structure for semi-mechanized farming activities and propose\n            a self-sustaining model for expansion of rainfed farming; 3)\n            transfer skills to Somalis to manage the enterprises and to\n            farmers to use SMR farming technology through training and\n            extension; and, 4) within the narrow limits of the pilot\n            area, increase smallholder production and incomes for 400\n            smallholder families."}, "docdt": "1987-03-02T00:00:00Z"}
