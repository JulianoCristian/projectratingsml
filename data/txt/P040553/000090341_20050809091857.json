Lessons learned\n            from the project: The rivalry between the two\n            municipalities, the Riga City and the Stopinu Pagasts, was\n            an impediment during Project preparation, and unfortunately\n            continued during the first years of implementation. The\n            appointment of management team by Riga City Council, could\n            have been done in a more efficient way. Additional\n            difficulty in the starting phase of the project was caused\n            by differences between Latvian and Swedish detailed design\n            standards, because the engineering consultant prepared the\n            drawings in accordance with the latter."}, "docdt": "2005-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
