 Solid Waste Management Project is to remediate environmental\n            pollution and modernize the Getlini landfill site to\n            international good practice standards.  The purpose of this\n            environmental assessment is to identify the potential\n            environmental impacts which may result from the proposed\n            remediation and extension of the existing Getlini landfill\n            site, to assess their significance and to identify\n            mitigation measures.  Leachate, which is produced directly\n            from liquid waste and refuse moisture content, will be\n            arrested, collected, and treated.  Surface runoff from waste\n            pile, which is a source of water pollution, will be directed\n            to surface ditches and treated prior to discharge to the\n            Daugava.  A study of water quality, pollutant loadings, and\n            hydrodynamics will be conducted to minimize the potential of\n            adverse impacts on water quality in the Daugava.  Road\n            maintenance and regular sweeping can minimize dust emissions\n            from landfill operation.  Noise generated from construction\n            and operation of the landfill site will be monitored, and a\n            noise action plan will be prepared.  Air quality impacts\n            from waste haulage vehicles can be mitigated by proper\n            maintenance of the vehicles."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
