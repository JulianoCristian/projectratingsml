      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) focusing on Nicaragua’s
Education Project. This project was financed through IDA Credit No. 3978 in the amount
of US$15.0 million equivalent and a planned Government contribution of US$0.7 million
equivalent. The credit was approved on September 2, 2004 and became effective on
March 17, 2005. It was restructured on June 30, 2008 and was closed on June 30, 2011,
three years after the original closing date.

This PPAR was prepared by Cecilia Zanetta, IEG consultant who finalized the PPAR
with the support of Erik Bloom (TTL) and Mark Sundberg (Manager). A three-day
mission to Washington, D.C. was conducted on July 16-18, 2014 during which the
consultant met with Bank management and staff that had participated in the Project. In
addition, a one-week mission to Nicaragua was conducted on July 21-25, 2014. The
mission met with current and former education authorities, as well as school
administrators, teachers, and parents in the three schools that were visited. A list of
persons met is presented in Annex B. The mission also examined: i) World Bank project
files; ii) project-related reporting and evaluation; and iii) education studies with data by
government and other Development Partners (DPs); as well as relevant research
literature.

The IEG team gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of the staff in
the Managua Office of the World Bank for expediting and supporting the work of the
mission. Ministry officials were generous with their time and in arranging visits to project
sites.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback, and comments received
from the Government have been included in Annex D.

Summary
This report assesses the development effectiveness of Nicaragua’s Education Project,
which was approved on September 2, 2004 for total cost of US$15.7 million equivalent
financed by an International Development Association (IDA) credit of US$15.0 million
equivalent with the rest financed by the Government.
Nicaragua is a low-income country with per capita income of around US$1,780 in 2013.
Its population of 6.08 million grows at about 1.5 percent per year. Nicaragua is still one
of Latin America’s least developed countries. Poverty, although declining steadily in
recent years, remains high and more than 80 percent of Nicaragua’s poor live in rural
areas, many in remote communities where access to basic services is still a daily
challenge. The country’s economy, once besieged by political turmoil and still vulnerable
to natural hazards, has been growing on average with Latin America over the past decade.
Nicaragua has made substantial strides toward improving education outcomes. Illiteracy
rates have decreased from 18.8 percent in 2005 to 10.5 percent in 2010-2011. Likewise,
the average years of schooling in the total population increased from 5.6 years in 2005 to
6.8 years in 2011-2012. The rural-urban gap decreased during the same period, from 3.4
to 3 years of educational attainment (PREAL, 2014). Despite these improvements,
Nicaragua’s education system still faces several challenges, including further increases in
access and retention, enhancing education quality, and addressing the substantial
inequities in education outcomes that still persist, not only between urban and rural areas
but also between richer and poorer households and between regions.
Nicaragua’s First Education Project
PASEN I’s original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) as described in the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were to:
       i) increase the enrollment of students for preschool, primary and secondary
       education in the Borrower's schools; ii) improve the quality and relevance of the
       learning process taking place in said schools; iii) improve the Ministry of
       Education, Culture and Sports' systems of governance and accountability and
       strengthen the community participation in the Borrower's education sector; and
       iv) harmonize donor assistance in the Borrower's education sector.
The operation was restructured on June 30, 2008. The operation’s revised PDOs as
described in the Amended DCA were to:
       i) improve the quality of education through monitoring and disseminating student
       learning outcomes; ii) improve systems of governance and accountability,
       including measures to strengthen community participation in the education sector;
       iii) harmonize donor assistance in the borrower's education sector; and iv)
       improve institutional management capacity and information systems to improve
       service delivery.
The relevance of objectives is deemed Substantial for both the pre- and post-
restructuring periods. The original and revised objectives addressed key challenges of
Nicaragua’s education sector, including limited access, low student learning levels,
                                            xii


limited capacity in the Ministry of Education (MoE) to manage the system, and the
fragmented nature of external assistance. While the objective of expanding access was
eliminated during the restructuring, it continued to be a high priority for Nicaraguan
authorities and continued to receive support under several other projects with multiple
sources of financing.
The original design included four components focusing on: i) strengthening MoE’s
institutional capacity; ii) developing a monitoring and evaluation system; iii)
implementing the Autonomous School Model; and iv) piloting a community preschool
program. The restructuring introduced a reduction in the number of components from
four to two, and in their scope, concentrating the focus of the operation on two areas: i)
institutional strengthening of administrative and management capacity; and ii) improving
the quality of primary and secondary education.
The relevance of the original design is considered to be Modest. Although the original
components and corresponding activities were supportive of the original PDOs, the
design exhibited several shortcomings, including an overly ambitious scope given the
lack of institutional capacity, operational weaknesses in the expansion of the
Autonomous School Program being supported under the operation, and the lack of inputs
(teacher training, learning materials) to support quality improvements. The relevance of
the revised design is considered to be Substantial. The revised components and
corresponding activities were largely supportive of the revised PDOs and more limited in
scope. The project provided direct support to improve quality through teacher training
and the development and provision of textbooks and other learning materials.
The change in government administration that took place in 2007 and the new
government decided to end the Autonomous School Model. The education policies of the
new administration constituted a drastic departure from the previous decentralization
strategy built around the Autonomous School Model and other activities, such as Report
Cards, that had been central to the Bank's portfolio in the education sector for over a
decade. Project activities were put on hold for over two years, during which there were
no disbursements. During this time, the MoE reshaped its strategic priorities, which
received support under the restructured operation in June 2008. At restructuring, the
closing date was also extended from the original date of June 30, 2008 to December 30,
2009 to allow for the implementation of the revised activities and the full disbursement of
the credit proceeds.
The operation’s efficacy with respect to PDO 1 – Enrollment, is deemed Substantial, as
there was a substantial increase in enrollment during the operation’s lifetime, particularly
at the pre-school and secondary levels between 2004 and 2011. Several actions supported
under this operation contributed to increased enrollment, including capitation grants for
autonomous schools at the primary and secondary levels, a summer school-readiness
program for children who had not attended preschool, an enrollment and retention
program for children at risk, as well as incentives for teachers in community pre-schools.
The operation also made an important contribution toward PDO 4- Harmonization of
donor assistance in education, with efficacy in this area being deemed High. In
particular, the operation was critical in moving away from a project-centered approach
managed by independent implementation units to a sector-wide approach managed by the
MoE. The operation was also critical in ensuring the transition from disjointed to
                                            xiii


harmonized and coordinated support from all donors in the education sector. These
achievements were not the result of a specific set of actions but rather the way in which
the project was prepared and implemented and the Bank overall leadership exhibited.
The operation made a substantial contribution to PDO 5 - Institutional strengthening of
the MoE. The project supported efforts to improve communication and information
sharing between the Ministry and local education authorities. While this investment did
not lead to better budget execution, which was the PDO indicator, it did lead to a better
flow of information and communication. In particular, the National Management
Information System (now called the Work System for Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation
and Education Statistics) has continued to evolve, reportedly leading to evidence-based
decision-making and enhanced planning, M&E, and procurement capacity. In addition,
the quality and timeliness of education statistics has improved.
Conversely, outcomes related to PDO 2 - Quality of learning and PDO 3 - Governance
and accountability were below expectations and efficacy in both areas is deemed
Modest. While the project supported several actions implemented that can be expected to
have contributed to increasing quality and relevance of learning however there is little
data and it is unclear whether the progress made in this area has indeed translated into
actual gains in quality of learning. For governance, the PPAR argues that while
information on performance has improved, there was no progress on other elements of
governance—namely on standards, incentives, or accountability
The operation’s Efficiency is considered Substantial based on both the cost-efficiency of
implementation and the Project’s expected economic return in the long term. The
operation’s IERR presented in the ICR (2011) was estimated at 13 percent, denoting a
significant return on the investment over the long term. The assumptions made in 2011
are still valid. In addition, the IERR calculated in the ICR reflects a lower-bound
estimation of the operation’s actual economic impact, as the benefits do not include the
impact of increased enrollment in pre-school and secondary education under the
operation, or the incipient gains in student performance. The project implementation was
delayed which resulted in the life of the Project being almost twice as long as originally
anticipated. While this indicates that the use of Bank’s financial resources was less than
optimal, the Bank and the government were proactive in restructuring the project to
ensure that it could achieve new objectives.
The operation is rated Moderately Satisfactory under the original objectives to reflect its
substantial relevance of objectives, modest relevance of design, modest-to-high efficacy,
and Substantial efficiency. The operation is also rated Moderately Satisfactory under the
revised objectives to reflect its Substantial relevance of objectives, Substantial relevance
of design, Modest-to-High efficacy, and Substantial efficiency. Thus, the operation’s
overall rating is Moderately Satisfactory.
Lessons

Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn:
       Flexibility by the Bank in the face of changing government policy may be
needed to secure continued development impact. When faced with the change in the
political economy, the Bank engaged in a long and frank dialogue to understand how the
                                            xiv


project could best be restructured to remain relevant. This required a major change in the
underlying logical framework of the project and the willingness for the Bank to accept a
new approach. Without this willingness to be flexible and to significantly adjust the
project design, the project would have likely been unsuccessful after the policy shift.
       Ultimately, the sustainability of an education reform depends on information
transparency, communications, and buy-in from stakeholders. While the school
autonomy model was developed incorporating strong technical support from the World
Bank, there appeared to be little attempt to build consensus around the model or to debate
alternatives. This led to political opposition that made it vulnerable to early cancellation.
The lack of data systems weakened the capacity of policy makers to understand what was
working. Likewise, communities had little information about the impact of the reform.
Information, including evidence on the impact of the reform, could have been used along
with community outreach programs to address community concerns. This contributed to
the lack of consensus about the new model and ultimately to its demise.
       World Bank support needs to go beyond technical aspects. In developing the
project, the World Bank provided strong technical support to design the school autonomy
model. However it appears that Bank did not provide sufficient support to the logistic
elements of the reform, such as piloting an information system or building local capacity.
Likewise it appears that the government and Bank did take into account the political
economy behind the reform. While technical support is important for the design of
reforms, its implementation needs different types of support that also need to be
developed during the design phase.
       Donor coordination and a SWAP can continue, and even be strengthened in
the face of adversity and significant policy change. One of the project’s objectives was
to strengthen donor coordination and reduce fragmentation in the education sector. The
changes in policy had the potential to reduce donor coordination as different donors look
for new alternatives in the education sector. The Bank was able to work with others to
strengthen coordination during the time of uncertainty. The work done to establish
protocols and agreements contributed to keeping development partners together.
        The use of country systems contributed to the long-term sustainability of
World Bank support to the education sector in Nicaragua. The project successfully
supported the use of country systems as one of its initiatives. This type of initiative is
usually justified as reducing transaction costs for the government. However in the case of
Nicaragua, it also appeared to have contributed to the stability of the World Bank’s and
the development community’s support for the education sector. Interviews suggest that
this initiative facilitated the restructuring and the development of the Education Sector
Strategy.

1. Background and Context
1.1     This report assesses the development effectiveness of Nicaragua’s Education
Project (PASEN I), which was approved on September 2, 2004 for a total cost of
US$15.7 million equivalent, financed by an IDA credit of US$15.0 million equivalent,
with the rest financed by the Government.

Socio Economic and Political Context in Nicaragua
1.2      Nicaragua is a low-income country with a per capita income of around US$1,780
in 2013. Its population of 6.08 million grows at about 1.5 percent per year. Nicaragua is
still one of Latin America’s least developed countries, and has the second lowest per
capita income in the Western Hemisphere. Although poverty has been declining steadily
in recent years, over half of the population still lives below the poverty line, and one out
of every five Nicaraguans lives in extreme poverty. Poverty is heavily concentrated in
rural areas and along the Atlantic Coast, with many of Nicaragua’s poor living in remote
communities with little access to basic services (INID, 2005a; 2005b).

1.3     The country’s economy, once afflicted by political turmoil, has been growing on
average with Latin America. Disciplined macroeconomic policies since 2001 helped
Nicaragua to weather the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. Since then, Nicaragua has
made significant progress toward consolidating its fiscal position and keeping inflation
under control, resulting in an average annual growth of 3.4 percent between 2001 and
2013 (World Development Indicators, 2014). Prudent policies implemented during 2012-
2013, including tax reform and progress toward the strengthening of the electricity sector
that had been a source of fiscal vulnerability, have contributed to further strengthening
macroeconomic stability (IMF, 2013).

Education in Nicaragua

1.4    During the past decade, Nicaragua has made substantial strides toward improving
education outcomes. Illiteracy rates have decreased from 18.8 percent in 2005 to 10.5
percent in 2010-2011 (INIDE/MINSA, 2013; INEC, 2006). Likewise, the average years
of schooling in the total population increased from 5.6 years in 2005 to 6.8 years in 2011-
2012. The rural-urban gap decreased during the same period, from 3.4 to 3 years of
educational attainment (PREAL, 2014),1 although substantial inequities in education
outcomes still persist, not only between urban and rural areas but also between richer and
poorer households and between regions.

1.5     The progress in education outcomes reflects the significant strides made toward
expanding coverage, with adjusted net primary enrollment rates at 92 percent or above
since 2006. From 2005 to 2013, net enrollment in preschool and secondary education also
increased significantly, from 39.5 to 56.8 percent and from 42 to 50.1 percent,
respectively. While access to primary education is in line with the regional average,
Nicaragua still lags behind other countries in the region in terms of access to pre-school

1
 Between 2005 and 2011-2012, years of schooling in urban areas went from 7.0 to 7.9 years, while in rural
areas from 3.6 to 4.9 years.
                                            2


and secondary education. Preschool net enrollment rates are similar to those of El
Salvador and Guatemala, with Nicaragua far below the 73 percent average for Latin
America. At the secondary level, Nicaragua is performing worse than other neighboring
countries in Central America, where the net enrollment rate is above 60 percent (with the
exception of Guatemala), as well as Latin American countries as a whole, which had a 72
percent net enrollment rate in 2010 (UNESCO, 2012).

1.6      In addition to the challenge of ensuring continued expansion in access, there is
still a great need to improve retention. In 2012, only 57 percent of students completed
primary education in Nicaragua, compared to 75 percent for Central America and above
80 percent for Latin America. At the secondary level, the completion rate is also low
(i.e., 54.7 percent in 2012), with the percent of youth aged 20 to 24 who manage to
complete secondary education ranking last in Central America, along with Honduras, and
among the last in Latin America (PREAL, 2014).

1.7     High poverty levels affect the demand for education. About a third of the
estimated 300,000 families with children living in extreme poverty have at least one child
aged 7-12 out of school. The 2008 World Bank Poverty Assessment shows that education
is a major determinant of poverty. It estimates that at least 11 years of education are
needed to break out of the cycle of poverty. Despite this, 72 percent of the population in
Nicaragua does not attain complete secondary education and consequently earns wages
below the poverty line (World Bank, 2008).

1.8    In terms of quality, Nicaragua ranked below the regional average on UNESCO’s
Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) in 2006. In addition, the
2009 national standardized evaluations showed that learning outcomes in grades 4 and 6
were strongly correlated with poverty levels, rural schooling, and low retention rates in
primary. While Nicaragua is still developing the instrument to apply a standardized test in
grade 11, test results from university applications provide some indication of the quality
challenge in secondary education (World Bank, 2008).

1.9     Many teachers in Nicaragua still lack adequate training. In preschool, 64.2 percent
of teachers are non-formal community volunteers with little training in early-age learning
processes. At the primary and secondary levels, 42.4 and 24.4 percent of teachers lack
teaching certification (“empíricos”), with the vast majority working in rural areas where
technical support is scarce (Guzmán, 2007).

The Autonomous School Model

1.10 The Autonomous School Model was first adopted in Nicaragua in 1993 under the
coalition government of President Violeta Chamorro, when the then-Minister of
Education Humberto Belli envisioned decentralization and greater participation of
teachers and parents at the school level. This was seen as a promising strategy to tackle
the challenges facing the educational system, which had annual dropout rates of 19
percent at the primary level and only 26 percent enrollment at the secondary level. A pilot
program was first implemented in 20 secondary schools, in which School Management
Councils (Consejos Directivos Escolares) were given legal status and assigned key
management tasks. By 1995, the Autonomous School Model, which by then included
                                              3


over 100 secondary schools, was extended to primary schools, adopting a similar
modality for urban schools and a cluster modality for rural schools (the so-called Núcleos
Educativos Rurales Autónomos). As of December 1995, there were 200 single
autonomous primary schools and 42 autonomous rural clusters consisting of two to four
schools each (King et al, 1998). In 2002, the Law of Participative Education (Law No.
413; Ley de Participación Educativa) formally adopted the governance mechanisms that
had been developed under the Autonomous School Model.

1.11 The Autonomous School Model continued to expand with support from the World
Bank. In particular, the approval of a school autonomy law was one of the conditions
established under the Completion Point for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC)
initiative with joint support from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
In addition, actions related to the continuous expansion of the Autonomous School Model
were supported under Nicaragua’s Development Credit (Loan No 4521-NI) and the
Poverty Reduction Support Credit I (IDA-3850-NI). The continuous expansion of the
Autonomous School Model was also a central component of the PASEN I operation, with
the main disbursement mechanism being capitation grants to Autonomous Schools.

1.12 The School Autonomy Model was abandoned by a new government that took
office in January 2007, which prioritized free access to education to all Nicaraguan
children and abolished the user fees adopted under the Autonomous School Program.
User fees had indeed been the most contentious and controversial component of the
program. While user fees—supposedly mandatory at the secondary level and supposedly
voluntary at the primary level—provided schools with much needed financial resources
to complement transfers from the MoE, they were widely questioned on equity grounds
and raised strong social and political opposition.

1.13 While in primary school the fees were voluntary by law, there were instances of
teachers refusing to administer exams to non-paying primary school students, and even
cases of teachers or principals refusing to admit students. Even though in these cases the
MoE delegates and the mayors “reminded” school staff that the fees were voluntary,
many argued that the user-fee policy contributed to creating a class-based social
environment within the institutions. User fees may also have exacerbated differences
among schools serving students from different socio-economic backgrounds. Schools
exhibited a broad range of fee collection strategies that was loosely based on MoE’s
guidelines. Total fee collection varied widely across schools, ranging from 0 to 160
percent of the monthly transfer from the MoE. While the ability of individual schools was
linked to their effort to collect user fees, collection levels can also be expected to reflect
students’ socio-economic conditions, thus generating the potential for inequalities among
schoolsn (Gershberg et al., 1998).

2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
Project Development Objectives
2.1    Nicaragua’s Education Project (PASEN I) was approved on September 2, 2004
and became effective on March 17, 2005. The operation’s original Project Development
Objectives (PDOs) as described in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were to:
                                                     4


         i) increase the enrollment of students for preschool, primary and secondary
         education in the Borrower's schools; ii) improve the quality and relevance of the
         learning process taking place in said schools; iii) improve the Ministry of
         Education, Culture and Sports' systems of governance and accountability and
         strengthen the community participation in the Borrower's education sector; and
         iv) harmonize donor assistance in the Borrower's education sector (DCA,
         Schedule II, p. 22, Sept. 17, 2004).

2.2     While PDO definitions in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and DCA had
minor differences in wording, the definitions were substantively equivalent (PAD, pp.
3,40; March 28, 2004). One difference pertains to PDO 2 – Quality and Relevance of
Learning. While the wording in the PAD’s main text was rather vague (i.e., “improve
attention to quality and relevance of learning”) and could be interpreted as pointing to the
development of an evaluation and monitoring system, the definition in the PAD’s Project
Result Framework and DCA unequivocally pointed to enhancing the quality and
relevance of education (i.e., “improve the quality and relevance of the learning process”).

2.3    The operation was restructured on June 30, 2008. The operation’s revised PDOs
as described in the Amended DCA were to:

         i) improve the quality of education through monitoring and disseminating student
         learning outcomes; ii) improve systems of governance and accountability,
         including measures to strengthen community participation in the education sector;
         iii) harmonize donor assistance in the borrower's education sector; and iv)
         improve institutional management capacity and information systems to improve
         service delivery (Schedule II, p. 5-6, June 30, 2008). 2

2.4    For the purpose of this PPAR, the original and revised PDOs are based on the
DCA and its subsequent amendment.3 Specifically, the original PDOs adopted for this
PPAR are: i) increase enrollment for preschool, primary and secondary education; ii)
improve quality and relevance of learning; iii) improve the system of governance and
accountability, including community participation in the education sector; and iv)
harmonize donor assistance in the sector. The revised PDOs adopted for this PPAR are: i)
improve quality and relevance of learning; ii) improve the system of governance and
accountability, including community participation in the education sector; iii) harmonize
donor assistance in the sector; and iv) improve institutional management capacity and
information systems to improve service delivery.




2
  The Project Restructuring Paper (p. 4, June 30, 2008) presents the same definition as the Amended DCA.
3
  The definitions adopted for this PPAR also coincide with the PDO definitions utilized in IEG’s ICR
review. The only exception is the PDO referring to quality and relevance of learning, which in the IEG
review was disaggregated into two separate objectives: quality and relevance. For the purpose of the PPAR,
quality and relevance of education are considered to be roughly equivalent given that the operation’s focus
is on basic education, in which a relevant basic education curriculum is one that focuses on language, math,
and some combination of social and physical sciences, such as the one in Nicaragua and most other
countries.
                                                5


Relevance of Objectives
2.5      The original and revised objectives are considered to have continuous relevance;
thus relevance of objectives is deemed Substantial for both the pre- and post-restructuring
periods. The original and revised objectives addressed key challenges of Nicaragua’s
education sector, including limited access, low student learning levels, limited capacity in
the Ministry to manage the system, and the fragmented nature of external assistance. The
operation’s objectives remained mainly unchanged during the restructuring, except that
access was eliminated, with the operation during the post-restructuring period focusing
exclusively on governance and quality outcomes. Nevertheless, ensuring and expanding
access to basic education continued to be a high priority for Nicaraguan authorities as
illustrated by the abolition of school fees and continued to receive support under several
other programs in the context of the Annual Common Work Program with multiple
sources of financing.4

2.6     The operation’s PDOs were consistent with the previous and current Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The CPS 2008-2012 that was effective at closing
date cited improved access to education services and improved education outcomes as a
Country Development Goal (p. 39). The CPS stressed four key policy areas: i) more
education to achieve full primary enrollment and expand access to pre-primary,
secondary, technical, and vocational school; ii) better quality education; iii) holistic and
integral education; and iv) decentralization of school management and community
participation (p. 14). Given that the country is dependent on aid, with over 30 percent of
its budget coming from Overseas Development Assistance, the CPS also noted the need
for donor harmonization (p. 21). The original PDOs are also relevant under the current
CPS 2013-2017, as it supports government priorities in two key areas of engagement: i)
raising welfare by improving access to quality basic services; and ii) raising incomes by
improving productivity and enhancing competitiveness.

2.7     The original and revised objectives are consisted with those under the
Government of Nicaragua’s current Education Sector Strategy (ESS) for 2011-2015,
which reflects the current administration’s policy priorities in the education sector. The
ESS aims to improve: i) the coverage and quality of preschool education, (ii) completion
of primary education; and iii) the coverage and quality of secondary education. In turn,
the ESS is aligned with the Government of Nicaragua’s medium-term economic strategy,
which aims to achieve equitable growth, financial stability, and poverty reduction as
reflected in the National Plan for Human Development (Plan Nacional de Desarrollo
Humano, Gobierno de Reconciliacion y Unidad Nacional, 2007-2011). Under this plan,
the government has set a pro-poor strategy and agenda that emphasizes the delivery of
both infrastructure and social services, including education. Finally, the revised PDOs

  The education sector’s Common Work Program received financial support from the World Bank (PASEN
I), the European Commission (Programa de Apoyo Presupuestario Sectorial para la Educación - PAPSE)
and Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands (Education Sector Support Programme - PROASE) as well as
EFA-FTI funds.
                                           6


and associated Project Outcome Indicators remained aligned to the EFA-FTI initiative
and indicative framework indicators in Nicaragua.

Project Design
2.8      The original design included four components. Component 1 supported the
institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Education (MoE) at the central and
municipal levels. Component 2 supported the development of a monitoring and
evaluation system compilation, including the analysis and dissemination of educational
statistics as well as the periodic valuation of competencies in language and math for
primary and secondary school students and testing of teacher practices. Component 3
provided support for the continuous implementation of the Autonomous School Model,
including capitation transfers to individual schools. Component 4 supported a Pilot
Program for community preschools.

2.9      The restructuring introduced a reduction in the number of components from four
to two, and in their scope, concentrating the focus of the operation on two areas: i)
institutional strengthening of administrative and management capacity, and ii) improving
the quality of primary and secondary education (see Table B.2). The revised activities
addressed the key concerns of the new administration and eliminated those that were no
longer its priorities, particularly the School Autonomous Model and the School Report
Card. The revised design included some of the original elements (i.e., strengthening of
management capacities, student learning assessments, governance mechanisms, and
harmonized donor activities) and added school inputs to improve education quality (e.g.,
learning materials, textbooks, and teacher workshops). The restructured project also
placed greater emphasis on improving the quality of service delivery in remote rural
communities.

Relevance of Design
2.10 Design under the original objectives: Modest – The relevance of design under the
original objectives is considered to be Modest. The original components and
corresponding activities were largely supportive of the original PDOs. Increased access
was to be accomplished through the incorporation of additional schools to the
Autonomous School Model, which, as mentioned earlier, had been the main component
of the Government of Nicaragua’s decentralization strategy in the education sector. In
this context, school capitation grants to autonomous schools were expected to provide
financial incentives for primary and secondary schools to actively increase enrollment.
The implementation of a pilot community preschool program, including incentives to
community teachers, was expected to increase enrollment at the preschool level.

2.11 However, the expansion strategy of the Autonomous School Model exhibited
significant weaknesses. Specifically, parents, teachers and administrators in Autonomous
Schools should have been provided training and support to ensure they had the skills
needed to fully capitalize on the potential benefits of school autonomy. In addition,
stronger auditing mechanisms should have been put in place to ensure the accurate
reporting of student enrollment by individual schools. Finally, it would have been of
critical importance to ensure the equity of the Autonomous School Model, both within
                                             7


and across individual schools, by guaranteeing the voluntary nature of parents’ financial
contributions at the primary level and providing complementary financial support to
schools serving students from more disadvantageous socio-economic backgrounds, which
were likely to have a smaller potential for fee collection. While the operation’s PDOs did
not explicitly include equity as an objective, affordability considerations were critical to
ensure retention of newly enrolled students (see among others, Birdsall et al., 2006).

2.12 Improvement in quality and relevance of learning was expected to result from the
dissemination of student performance results, as accurate and timely information on
student performance was considered a critical pillar of the ongoing decentralization
process and a vital input supporting the oversight function of both local stakeholders and
the MoE. However, although municipal-level pedagogical support was provided under
the operation, no teacher training activities were included under the original design to
ensure that teachers utilized data from student assessments to improve teaching. In
addition, School Report Cards were intended to provide comparable school-level
performance information so that communities could hold teachers and administrators
accountable for improving education quality. However, no additional inputs were
provided to teachers and administrators under the operation (e.g., training, textbooks) to
improve quality.

2.13 Improvements in governance and accountability were to be accomplished through
the professionalization of MoE staff and the MoE’s institutional restructuring, as well as
institutional strengthening at the municipal level in accordance with the decentralization
strategy that was in place at appraisal. In retrospect, given the lack of any significant
progress in this regard, it is obvious that the scope of this PDO was overly ambitious and
that the needed political commitment to carry it out successfully was lacking.

2.14 While there were no components specifically related to donor harmonization, this
objective was to be accomplished through the project implementation arrangements, such
as memoranda of understanding, donor meetings, and working groups. In this case, the
PDO appropriately capitalized upon the strong commitment exhibited by the MoE and
the donor community to achieve harmonization in the framework of the Paris
Declaration.

2.15 Design under the revised objectives: Substantial – The relevance of design under
the revised objectives is considered to be Substantial. The revised components and
corresponding activities were largely supportive of the revised PDOs and more limited in
scope. Improved quality received direct support through teacher training and the
development and provision of textbooks and other learning materials. Improved
governance and accountability was to be achieved by the periodic measurement of
student performance and the dissemination of results. Improved institutional management
capacity was to be achieved through the development of a decentralized and participative
education management model at the central, departmental and municipal levels.

2.16 While no specific activities were included in either the original or revised designs
to support donor harmonization, this objective was to be accomplished by the Bank’s
proactive role in facilitating the coordination of Development Partners operating in
Nicaragua’s education sector as part of the operation’s implementation. Original and
                                            8


revised implementation arrangements supported the harmonization of donor assistance
through bi-annual supervision missions under the umbrella framework of joint review
sessions with participation of all donors and lenders who provided support to Nicaragua’s
education sector. Leadership of the joint review missions remained the full responsibility
of the MoE, while its Annual Operation Plan and Budget continued to be used as a tool to
guide the joint implementation reviews, in a manner consistent with the Paris Declaration
to improve development effectiveness. Several new indicators were included in the
operation’s Project Result Framework.

3. Implementation
3.1     Although the operation was declared effective within six months of Board
approval, the pace of implementation was slow during the first year of implementation,
with the disbursement lag reaching almost 40 percent in February 2006. Various factors
contributed to the operation’s slow implementation start. First, there was a significant
reduction in the available funds supporting the implementation of the education sector’s
Common Work Program during 2005, as a result of a temporary decrease in external
financial resources and an increase in teacher salaries that absorbed most of the national
resources.5 This situation required the adjustment of the Annual Operating Plan for 2005,
giving priority to activities outside the operation, such as EFA-FTI activities. Second,
there were changes in leadership at the MoE. Although incoming authorities ratified the
priorities and strategies supported under PASEN I, including the reorganization of the
MoE, the school autonomy program and the development of a student assessment system,
broad changes in management and technical staff changes in early 2006 resulted in
operational delays. Third, while the incorporation of schools to the Autonomous Model
showed progress as planned, it did not go hand in hand with increases in enrollment at the
primary level. This, in turn, was an obstacle for implementation given that disbursements
based on transfers to schools were tied to enrollment. The pace of implementation
accelerated in mid-2006, as the flow of external financial resources was restored and the
original capitation formula was modified, shifting the focus from marginal enrollment to
real expenditures (i.e., teacher costs). While the new formula succeeded in addressing the
bottleneck in disbursements, it somewhat eroded the enrollment incentives as originally
envisioned. Some of the activities supported under the operation, such as the MoE
reengineering, continued to lag behind.

3.2     The change in administration that took place in 2007 and the abandonment of the
Autonomous School model was undoubtedly the most important factor affecting
implementation. The transition period was difficult, as the education policies of the new
administration constituted a drastic departure from the previous decentralization strategy
built around the Autonomous School Model and other activities, such as Report Cards,
that had been central to the Bank's portfolio in the education sector for over a decade.
Project activities were put on hold for over two years, during which there were no
disbursements.6 During this time, the MoE reshaped its strategic priorities, which
received support under the restructured operation in June 2008. At restructuring, the
closing date was also extended from the original date of June 30, 2008 to December 30,
2009 to allow for the implementation of the revised activities and the full disbursement of
the credit proceeds.

3.3     Despite the strong ownership of the restructured operation on the part of MoE’s
authorities, implementation continued to present serious challenges, including the lack of
qualified staff within the MoE. A second 12-month extension to the closing date was
granted until December 31, 2010 in response to the implementation delays. However, a
wave of dismissals and appointments at the highest level of the MoE in early 2010

5
  The reduction in external financial resources was due to the temporary suspension of disbursements from
the European Community and delays in the achievement of conditions of effectiveness of PROASE.
6
  Disbursements remained unchanged at USD7.17 million between Dec. 2007 and July 2009.
                                                  10


created new institutional challenges, and eventually resulted in a six-month extension of
the closing date until June 30, 2011. Under a new management team at the MoE, the pace
of implementation as well as disbursements accelerated during the last year of
implementation, with credit proceeds being fully disbursed by March 2011. The last year
of implementation also served to support the preparation of a follow-on operation, the
Second Education Support Project (PASEN II), which was approved in January 2012.7

4. Achievement of the Objectives
4.1    In this review, and in line with the Bank’s Harmonized Guidelines, the original
and revised PDOs are assessed over the entire project period, with the ratings weighted
according to the percentage of the credit disbursed at the time of restructuring.

Objective 1

    “To increase enrollment for preschool, primary and secondary education
                             (Original Objective)”
4.2    The operation’s contribution to increasing enrollment for pre-school, primary and
secondary education is deemed substantial. The increase in effective enrollment during
the Project’s lifetime was primarily the result of increases in enrollment, which offset an
increase in dropout rates. Net enrollment trends experienced a sustained increase during
the Project’s lifetime, particularly at the pre-school and secondary levels between 2004
and 2011.

4.3    Several actions supported under this operation can be expected to have
contributed to increased enrollment, including capitation grants provided to autonomous
schools at the primary and secondary levels, a summer school-readiness program for
children who had not attended preschool and an aggressive enrollment and retention
program focusing on children at risk, as well as incentives provided to teachers in
community pre-schools (see Table 4.1).

                      Capitation grants can be expected to have created incentives for
    Capitation grants
                      Autonomous Schools to increase enrollment, contributing to an increase in
     to Autonomous
                      effective enrollment of 17,687 in autonomous schools, from a baseline of
         Schools
                      75,425 students in 2003 to 83,8361 in 2006 equivalent to 3.5% annual
                      increase (target exceeded).
                      This indicator was no longer monitored from 2007 onward
                     An aggressive enrollment and retention campaign was implemented during
    Tuition Recovery 2005-2006, resulting in the enrollment of 42,929 children—i.e., 10,872 in
          Plan       pre-school and 32,057 in grade 1 (PREAL, 2007).
                     Backpacks with school supplies were distributed to 55,000 children.

4.4      In terms of impact, a positive trend in enrollment was observed during the
operation’s lifetime. As shown on Figure 4.2, the net enrollment rate (NER) for preschool
increased from 36.3 to 57.4 percent between 2004 and 2011, with the community pre-
schools contributing largely to the increase.9 There was also a significant increase in NER
at the secondary level, from 39.9 to 46.1 percent during the same period. At the primary
level, the increase in enrollment has been less dramatic, as shown by a slight increase in
the adjusted net enrollment rate from 89.8 to 94. 6 percent between 2004 and 2011.10

  The School Readiness Program received US$220,000 from the Project and US$58,000 from UNICEF.

  With support from the IADB and Norway, the Comprehensive Childcare Program (Programa de Atención
Integral a la Niñez) supported community pre-schools in rural and marginal urban areas.

   The Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (NERA) is the total number of students of the official school age group
who are enrolled, as a percentage of the corresponding population. The Net Enrollment Rate (NER) is the
enrollment of the age group for a given level of education as a percentage of the corresponding population.

4.5     Despite the increases in enrollment, keeping students in the system continued to
be a challenge. In the case of primary and secondary education, dropout rates experienced
an absolute increase during the Project’s lifetime, from 6.5 and 10.5 percent in 2004 to
8.3 and 13.9 percent in 2011, respectively (see Figure 2). There was a particularly sharp
increase during 2004-2006 and, although the trend was reverted from 2007 onward, the
subsequent decrease did not offset the initial hike. The same general trend was observed
in the case of preschool education, with dropout rates in 2011 being only slightly lower
than in 2004—9 and 9.5 percent, respectively.11

Figure 4.2. Dropout Rates for Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education, 2004-

  The elimination of school fees in 2007 might have contributed toward the subsequent decrease in
dropout rates, as keeping schools affordable has been identified in the literature as an effective strategy
toward increasing retention (see, for example, Birdsall et al., 2006).

4.6     In the case of Autonomous Schools, which was a central area of intervention
during the pre-restructuring period, the increase in effective enrollment12 was
significant—equivalent to an annual increase of 3.5 percent, exceeding the original target
of 3 percent per year over the three years anticipated at Appraisal.13 Specifically, there
was an increase in effective enrollment of 82,936 students in autonomous schools, from a
baseline of 755,425 students in 2003 to 838,361 students in 2006 (including 15,193
students for pre-school, 11,007 for primary, and 56,736 for secondary).

4.7     At the system level, increased enrollment also goes hand in hand with
improvements in other efficiency measures during the operation. Repetition rates at both
the primary and secondary level decreased during the project, from 10.5 and 6.7 percent
in 2004 to 7.7 and 5.5 percent in 2011, respectively (see Figure 4.3). Likewise, there was
a substantial increase in the percentage of children that completed primary education,
from 45.9 in 2004 to 58.1 in 2011. However, there was a decrease in the percentage of
students completing secondary education, from 59.6 in 2004 to 53.1 in 2011.

Objective 2

    “To improve quality and relevance of learning (Original and Revised
                                Objective)”
4.8     The operation’s contribution toward improving quality and relevance of learning
is deemed modest, as gains in terms of quality and relevance of learning cannot be
ascertained. However, several actions implemented under the operation can be expected
to have contributed to increasing quality and relevance of learning (see Table 4.2). In
addition to the School Readiness Program, other actions focusing on quality of learning
included: i) training of rural teachers; ii) design of primary and secondary textbooks with

   Increase in effective enrollment—also denominated increased total net enrollment—refers to the increase
in total enrollment for a given school year net of the dropouts from the preceding school year (PAD, p. 40).

   Data on effective enrollment was not longer monitored after the program was abolished in 2007.
                                                              14


the newly adopted competency-based curriculum with the participation of local authors;
and iii) the printing and distribution of textbooks from grades 1-3. The first set of
secondary books provided to public secondary students in Nicaragua was developed
under this operation.

Table 4.2. PASEN I’s Actions Contributing toward Increased Quality of Learning
                           Under the Autonomous School Model, School Education Councils had the
                           ability to adapt the curriculum to local conditions. After 2007, the
                           contextualization of the curriculum was still to be done at the local level
                           through a newly established mechanism—i.e., the Evaluation,
      Curriculum           Programming and Training Workshops (Talleres de Evaluación,
       changes             Programación y Capacitación Educativa). However, in practice, these
                           workshops have focused mainly on programming.
                           A competency-based curriculum developed with IADB and USAID support
                           and other DPs was adopted in 2008 after an ample consultation with key
                           actors in the education sectors and civil society at large.14
                          Local authors participated in the design and validation of textbooks for
                          primary and secondary education, ensuring they reflected national culture,
                          values and conditions (target achieved).
                          A total of 19 textbooks for grades 1-6 as well as 25 textbooks for secondary
                          education were designed. Secondary textbooks, which are currently being
                          printed, will be the first ones to ever be distributed to public secondary
                          schools in Nicaragua.
       Textbook            A total of 1,120,252 textbooks for grades 1 to 3 were printed and reportedly
     development          distributed (target exceeded).
     and provision        The textbook-to-student ratio for grades 1 to 3 of primary school was
                          improved to one textbook for every child based on the number of printed
                          textbooks (target achieved). There was no independent verification of
                          whether the textbooks have reached all schools and their students, although
                          the Bank team reported verifying their distribution on time for the 2010
                          school year (ISR May 2010).
                          A total of 34,350 teaching guides in Spanish and Mathematics for grades 3
                          and 6 were distributed in 9,000 primary schools (target partially achieved).
                          Over 1,400 rural teachers were trained in pedagogical techniques for multi-
                          grade settings (target exceeded).

4.9     It is also important to note the considerable progress made under PASEN I toward
the development of a student learning assessment system, including the administration of
national and international learning assessments and the dissemination of results (see
Table 4.3). The development of such a system is precondition toward monitoring trends
in student performance, which is an input in the design evidence-based policies and
interventions. However, it is unclear whether the progress made in this area has translated

into actual gains learning. Although the dissemination of results from student assessments
among school administrators and teachers has the potential to contribute toward
correcting learning deficiencies in the classroom, training focusing on how to improve
teaching in areas that exhibited particular weaknesses was not contemplated under the
operation. Thus, the virtuous cycle of detecting weaknesses, making educators aware of
the weaknesses, and providing them with tools to address them was left incomplete.

4.10 As mentioned earlier, currently there is no data series available to measure quality
over the period of Project implementation; thus, the operation’s impact on quality of
learning cannot be adequately assessed. The national assessment tests administered in
2009 and 2010 provide the only comparable data on learning outcomes during the
operation’s lifetime. As could be expected, the change was not considerable over just a
one-year period, showing an incipient gain in student performance in Spanish for all
grades (4, 6, 9) and in Math for grade 4, and deteriorating scores in Math in grades 6 and
9 (see Table 4.4).15 However, gains in quality and relevance of learning might become
evident as data for successive time periods becomes available.

Objective 3

      “To improve the system of governance and accountability, including
     community participation in the education sector (Original and Revised
                                  Objective)”
4.11 The operation’s contribution toward improving governance and accountability,
including community participation in the education sector, is considered modest. While
the importance of enhancing governance and accountability in Nicaragua’s education
sector was underscored in the PAD, there is no explicit definition. For the PPAR, the
assessment of progress made toward this objective uses the four enabling conditions of
governance described by Lewis et al (2009): i) the existence of standards; ii) information
on performance; iii) incentives for good performance; and iv) accountability.



15
   Although national standardized tests were applied in 2002, 2006, 2009 and 2010. They constitute two
non-comparable sets of two measurements in time (i.e., 2002-2006, and 2009-2010), as the first set of tests
focused on the previous standard-based curricula, while the second set of tests focused on a competency-
based curriculum. The first set is not being used for the purpose of this PPAR since the 2006 results do not
allow for enough time to capture the operation’s impact and they are not comparable with second set.

4.12 As shown in Table 4.5, several actions under the PASEN I operation provided
support for these enabling conditions through: i) the adoption of merit-based hiring and
promotion practices for MoE staff; ii) the implementation of non-discretionary capitation-
based fiscal transfers to Autonomous Schools; iii) the development of systems to collect
and disseminate information on educational outcomes at regular intervals; and iv) the
continuous decentralization of the education system.

4.13 Under PASEN I, there was negligible progress toward the advancement of these
enabling conditions, except for the progress made toward the development of a learning
assessment system to provide critical information on the performance of Nicaragua’s
education sector.

4.14 Standards – No substantial progress: There was no progress made toward hiring
and promotion on a competitive basis, including recruiting staff using public recruitment
process

4.15 Information on performance – Partial Achievement: With PASEN I support, the
assessment function has been successfully assimilated within the MoE and, as already
discussed under PDO 2, important steps have been taken toward the development of a
national student assessment system, mainly the design and application of national and
international student learning assessments, the participation in regional learning
assessments and the dissemination of results among teachers and administrators (see
Table 4.3). Such a system, in turn, has the potential to enhance accountability and
governance within the education sector.

4.16 During the pre-restructuring period, education statistics were regularly
disseminated on the MoE’s website together with annual reports on the state of
Nicaragua’s education sector as well as other analytical studies. However, this practice
was discontinued during the post-restructuring period, with the last “The State of
Education in Nicaragua” being published in 2006.

4.17 There were some efforts to generate information on performance at the school and
municipal level, but they were not sustained. At the school level, a pilot of the School
Report Card initiative was implemented but later abandoned. Likewise, variation in
performance among autonomous schools was assessed in 2006 and disseminated in 2007.
A study on municipal performance in education was conducted and disseminated in 2005.

4.18 Incentives – No substantial progress: As originally conceived, the operation
provided financial support for fiscal transfers to Autonomous Schools based on a non-
discretionary formula of capitation financing that provided a direct incentive to schools to
enroll more students and to retain the enrolled students. This formula was subsequently
modified in 2006, somewhat weakening the enrollment incentives.16 Transfers to schools
were eventually stopped in 2007, when the MoE regained control over the education
budget. Currently, there are no systems of incentives in place to reward schools, teachers
or administrators for increased enrollment, retention, or student performance.


16
  The modified formula continued to be non-discretionary, but focused instead on the number of teachers
required based on the reported enrollment rather than on the number of students enrolled.
                                                   19


4.19 Accountability – No substantial progress: While there was a drastic transfer of
responsibilities from the national level to school councils under the Autonomous School
Model, this transfer was reverted once the model ended. Under the current model,
decentralization seems to have resulted in improved coordination among the various line
ministries, local governments, and school levels. However, gains in terms of
accountability are not apparent.

4.20 During the pre-restructuring period, the Autonomous School Model relied heavily
on local governance and accountability mechanisms, which, in the case of Nicaragua, had
been established under the Law of Participative Education (Law No. 413; Ley de
Participación Educativa) that was approved in February 2002. This legislation
established the foundations for shared responsibility in education, under which school-
based communities were given higher levels of autonomy in the development and
implementation of education programs and school management. Elected School Directive
Councils (Consejos Directivos Escolares) with representation from school administrators,
parents, teachers and students (only at the secondary level) had strong executive powers,
including hiring and firing of personnel, budgetary decisions, classroom structure and
schedule, purchase of textbooks, and curriculum adaptation (see Table 4.6). In addition,
the legislation established Municipal Educational Councils as the entities responsible for
ensuring the adequate implementation of education programs at the municipal level.

4.21 During the post-restructuring period, the Autonomous School Model was
discontinued17 as well as the governance and accountability mechanisms that supported it
at the school level. While School Directive Councils appear to still be functioning,18 they
serve primarily to mobilize voluntary community support to schools. A new decentralized
governance structure—the so-called nuclear educational (Nuclearización Educativa)—
was conceived in 2007 with a focus on municipalities rather than individual schools.
Although this governance structure was originally envisioned as an alternative strategy
toward decentralization, in practice the national level has retaken many of the functions
that had been previously devolved to schools and municipalities (see Table 4.6).

4.22 As reported by administrators interviewed during the PPAR mission, the
Education Councils that have been established under the new governance structure have
been instrumental in coordinating support at the school level from various sector
ministries (i.e., education, health, social work) as well as departmental and municipal
governments. However, community involvement has diminished under the new
decentralization strategy, except for the Food Coordination Committees, in which parents
administer food supplies provided to individual schools. Further definition of the



17
    Ministerial Decree No. 017-2007, approved on January 11, 2007 declared the annulment of those
Ministerial Agreements, Autonomy Agreements, Manuals, Regulations and other administrative provisions
issued before the publication of Law No. 413 "Law of Participative Education.” Since this decree applied
only to agreements prior to the publication of the 2002 Law, the legal status of those schools that became
autonomous after February 2002, is unclear.
18
   This was the case in the schools visited during the PPAR mission in July 2014. Moreover, school
administrators consistently reported their critical importance in channeling community resources—i.e.,
financial resources, labor, construction materials, etc.--to ensure schools’ operation.

  Government of Nicaragua’s decentralization strategy is still pending, as the nuclear
  education strategy was largely abandoned after the change in MoE authorities in 2011.

  Objective 4

       “To harmonize donor assistance in the sector (Original and Revised
                                 Objective)”
  4.23 The operation’s contribution toward the harmonization of donor assistance in
  education is considered high. During both the pre- and post-restructuring periods, the
                                                           21


operation was critical in moving away from the project-centered approached managed by
rather independent implementation units within the MoE to a sector-wide approach
managed by the MoE. The operation was also critical in ensuring the transition from
disjointed to harmonized, coordinated support from all donors active in the education
sector. These achievements were not the result of a specific set of actions but rather the
way in which it was prepared and implemented as well as the overall leadership exhibited
by the Bank in Nicaragua’s education portfolio (see Table 4.7).

Table 4.7. PASEN I’s Actions Contributing toward Harmonized Donor Assistance
                                A Memorandum of Understanding was signed by all donors with
                                 formal acceptance of a 3-year rolling Common Work Plan, achieving
                                 the target.

4.24 During preparation, the Bank took a proactive role in supporting the MoE’s
efforts to prepare a SWAP strategy for the education sector and building close working
relationships among donors. During the pre-restructuring period, the Common Work
Program served as the instrument utilized to integrate the instruments of national
education policies and financial contributions from Development Partners to the sector.
Specifically, the Common Work Program and supporting Annual Operating Plans
(Planes Operativos Anuales) focused on policy priorities of the Government of
Nicaragua in basic and middle education—pre-school, primary, secondary and adult
education as outlined in the Education Plan 2001-2015. The Common Work Program
received financial support from the World Bank (PASEN I), the European Commission
(Programa de Apoyo Presupuestario Sectorial para la Educación - PAPSE) and Canada,
Denmark and the Netherlands (Education Sector Support Programme - PROASE) as well
as EFA-FTI funds.

4.25 As part of the SWAP strategy prepared by the Bank, a formal agreement was
subscribed with individual DPs, which established the principles guiding external
assistance to the education sector. Under these agreements, DPs expressed their
                                                 22


commitment to: i) provide support to the goals and targets identified under the
Government of Nicaragua’s Education Plan; ii) homogenize of reporting and budgeting;
iii) recognize the MoE’s leadership; iv) work jointly with the MoE and other DPs; and v)
ensure that assistance from Development Partners was in line with Nicaragua’s National
Education Plan, the EFA Plan, MoE’s educational policies, and the financing gaps
identified by the Bank in the Joint Financing Agreement. Protocols were developed to
establish the frequency, focus and framework of joint missions, as well as interactions
between the DPs’ local representatives and the MoE, which included regular meetings
with top authorities. Workshops and working groups were set up and operated regularly.
The Education Sector Roundtable (Mesa Sectorial de Educación) constituted by
representatives from the DPs, MoE, and civil society, was responsible for monitoring the
implementation of Annual Operation Plans (Planes Operativos Anuales - POAs).

4.26 In the post-restructuring period, support from Development Partners under the
Bank’s leadership focused on the 2011-2015 Education Sector Strategy (ESS) that was
published in August 2011. The new ESS provided a reference point for all activities in
the education sector, including a grant co-financed by the European Community and the
Global Partnership in Education (GPE) focusing on preschool education (US$15.0
million); a grant from the European Community (EU) in support of the Education Sector
Support Project (PROSEN) focusing on secondary education (EUR32.0 million); and the
Bank-financed PASEN II focusing on primary education (US$25.0 million). The ESS has
also served to guide the activities of other DPs, including the Spanish Aid Agency and
UNICEF. From 2007 onward, the MoE has been more stringent regarding its acceptance
of credits and donations, conditioning them on being fully aligned with its priorities as
reflected in the ESS.

4.27 The Bank supported the utilization of national systems, including financial
administration, under the SWAP harmonized approach adopted for the education sector.
In 2005, Nicaragua adopted the a new Financial Administration and Budget Regime Law,
which specifically prohibits public institutions from using resources for which no
provision is made in the General Budget of the Republic.19 Thus, from 2006 onward, all
external financing in the education sector was included in the National Budget System
and National Management Information System regardless of the type of financing (i.e.,
budget support, common fund or project). Another positive experience in the alignment
of national procedures is the use of a single financial audit for the entire annual budget,
including treasury resources and all external resources registered. This single audit,
conducted in 2006 and 2007, represented a considerable easing of the workload of the
Government of Nicaragua’s Administrative and Financial Directorate and helped reduce
transaction costs. It has also increased coordination between donors and provided all
stakeholders with better-quality information for expenditure assessment.

4.28 In addition to the Bank-financed PASEN II, the World Bank is also managing the
GPE-and EU-funded programs to reduce transaction costs and to harmonize

implementation, supervision and disbursement procedures, in line with the Paris
Declaration.

4.29 During the pre-restructuring period, Bank-led joint missions were conducted
regularly focusing on the implementation of the Common Work Program in line with the
SWAP approach. Joint missions had access to top national authorities, including the MoE
and the President. They included representatives from bilateral agencies (including
Canada, Denmark, Spain, and the United States), the European Union, IADB, and the
World Bank. There was a sustained increase in the participation of DPs in joint
missions—for example, over 30 participants representing 13 DPs participated in the
August 2006 joint mission. Joint missions, as well as meetings of the Education Sector
Roundtable, continued to be conducted during the post-restructuring period.

Objective 5

 “To improve institutional management capacity and information systems
            to improve service delivery (Revised Objective)”
4.30 The operation’s contribution toward improving the MoE’s institutional
management capacity and information systems to improve service delivery is deemed
substantial. Several outputs were delivered under the operation focusing on the MoE’s
institutional strengthening, including the partial implementation of the MoE
modernization plan; training at central, departmental, municipal and school levels; the
implementation of the National Management Information System within the MoE; and
the implementation of an Intranet and e-mail system for MoE employees (see Table 4.8).

Table 4.8. PASEN I’s Actions Contributing toward Improved Institutional
Management Capacity
                                     The first phase of the modernization plan was implemented
                                      including: i) in-depth institutional assessment; ii) conceptual
 Improved                             design of a reengineering plan; iii) design of organizational
 institutional                        systems to improve functions; and iv) institutional processes and
 management                           transactions to improve planning and management.
 capacity                            All departmental delegations and municipalities were equipped
                                      with information communication technology (target achieved).
                                     Thirty-one modules of the National Management Information
                                      System were designed and implemented (target exceeded).
                                     A total of 290 local technicians were trained in statistical analysis.
                                     The purchase of mainframe computers, servers, and networks has
                                      resulted in email accounts for all employees and an Intranet.

4.31 In line with the revised Project Result Framework, budget execution is considered
to be a proxy for the MoE’s institutional performance. As shown in Figure 4.4 and Table
4.8, budget execution of the MoE did not show meaningful improvement during the
operation’s lifetime, with the percentage of execution of the total MoE budget increasing
only slightly from 92 to 93.4 percent between 2004 and 2011 (i.e., below the 96 percent
end-project target). More specific dimensions of budget execution yield even less
                                                    24


conclusive results. Specifically, the level of execution of capital expenditures, which
arguably offers a better reflection of institutional capacity than current expenditures since
it does not include personnel expenditures, remained largely unchanged between 2004
and 2011. The execution of budget expenditures financed by external sources, which can
also be expected to be a better reflection of the MoE’s implementation capacity, show a
significant decrease, from 78.3 to 55.9 percent between 2004 and 2011.

4.32 At the same time, this needs to be weighed against MoE’s greater capacity to
manage information and use data for decision-making., MoE staff consistently reported
during the PPAR mission that these tools have contributed greatly to more efficient
communication and administration at the central, departmental, and municipal levels of
the education system, as well as individual schools. In particular, the National
Management Information System (now called the Work System for Planning,
Monitoring, Evaluation and Education Statistics) has continued to evolve, reportedly
leading to evidence-based decision-making and enhanced planning, M&E, and
procurement capacity.20 In addition, it is clear that the quality and timeliness of education
statistics has improved. The operation’s Project Result Framework, in the preparation of
the Education Sector Plan 2008-2011 and the ESS 2011-2015.

operation as originally designed, with a focus on the expansion of the School Autonomy
Model and the adoption of a sector-wide framework for the education sector, was
grounded in the economic findings presented in the World Development Report for 2003
on “Making Services Work for Poor People.” The core economic argument made at
appraisal departed from the traditional labor earnings or growth models approach.
Instead, the PAD made the case that Nicaragua’s education sector was characterized by
systemic problems of inequity and poor quality, which could only be tackled by
drastically improving governance and accountability. Although no Internal Rate of
Economic Return (IEER) was calculated, data from labor earnings and growth
regressions were presented that indicated the importance of investment in the education
sector (PAD, 2004). The operation’s contributions to the economic outcomes associated
with increased educational attainment are both direct and indirect. Direct contributions
include changes in effective enrollment (i.e., PDO 1) and quality of learning (i.e., PDO 2)
as a result of actions supported under the operation, while indirect contributions include
changes in educational attainment as a result of the enhanced effectiveness in the sector
in general under the SWAP, as well as the harmonized strategy facilitated under the
operation (i.e., PDO 5).

5.3      The operation’s IERR presented in the ICR (2011) was estimated at 13 percent,
denoting a significant return on the investment over the long term.21 The benefits were
estimated based on the upward trend observed in education attainment of the school-age
population between 2005 and 2009 and the associated increase in lifetime earnings.
Specifically, the economic analysis calculated potential changes in income for those
students that entered school at the start of the operation in 2005. Based on the changes in
education attainment registered in 2009 (i.e., a larger share of students completing
primary education and starting secondary education), it was estimated that the
educational attainment for that particular cohort would result in an additional 0.53 years
of education. In turn, the improvement in education attainment was expected to translate
into a discounted increase in income of US$500 over a lifetime (up to age 65), while the
additional cost to the education system of providing the extra education was estimated at
US$100. An IERR of 13 percent was obtained when these costs and benefits are applied
to the total number of students.

5.4     The assumptions made in 2011 are still valid. Educational attainment has
continued to increase. Between 2005 and 2011-2012, the average years of schooling in
the total population had increased by an additional 1.2 years, more than twice what was
assumed in the ICR’s economic analysis. Likewise, economic growth has continued to be
strong, at an average growth rate of 4.6 percent between 2010 and 2013, which is
expected to eventually translate into greater earnings. Thus, the estimated US$500 in
discounted life income utilized in the ICR’s analysis is considered to be reasonable. In
addition, the IERR calculated in the ICR reflects a lower-bound estimation of the
operation’s actual economic impact, as the benefits do not include the impact of increased
enrollment in pre-school and secondary education under the operation, or the incipient
gains in student performance. Moreover, the full impact of some of the operation’s
intermediate outcomes was not evident at closing. For example, textbooks and teacher

guides were printed and distributed toward the operation’s closing, too late for their
impact on quality and retention to be captured.

5.5      The project implementation was delayed which resulted in the life of the Project
being almost twice as long as originally anticipated.22 Part of this delay was due to the
discussions of how to restructure project and the associated time to approve the agreed
restricting. While this indicates that the use of Bank’s financial resources was less than
optimal, the Bank and the government were proactive in restructuring the project to
ensure that it could achieve new objectives.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     As the project was restructured, the phases of the project are separately weighted.

6.2     Original objectives: The operation is rated Moderately Satisfactory during the
pre-restructuring period to reflect its Substantial relevance of objectives; Modest
relevance of design; High efficacy for PDO 4, Substantial for PDO 1, and Modest for
PDOs 2 and 3; and Substantial efficiency (a rating of 4 on the 6-point scale).

6.3     Revised objectives: The operation is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory during the
post-restructuring period to reflect its Substantial relevance of objectives; Substantial
relevance of design; High efficacy for PDO 4, Substantial for PDO 5 and Modest for PDOs
2 and3; and Modest efficiency (a rating of 3 on the 6-point scale).

6.4     The overall outcome of Moderately Satisfactory is based on the pre- and post-
restructuring ratings, weighted by the amount of the total loan disbursed before (48
percent) and after (52 percent) restructuring (see Table 6.1).

   Originally, Project implementation was anticipated to be 39 months, from Effectiveness in March 2005
to the original Closing date in June 2008. Actual Project implementation lasted 75 months, from
Effectiveness in March 2005 to the actual Closing date in June 2011.

Risk to Development Outcome
6.5    The overall risk to the development outcomes of the restructured Project is
deemed moderate. Education is a top priority across the entire political spectrum,
including the current administration, as shown by the sustained increase in own-source
resources (“Recursos del Tesoro”) allocated to education, which increased dramatically
from US$88 to US$222 million between 2004 and 2011.

6.6      The sustainability of the operation’s achievements in terms of enrollment, quality,
institutional capacity and donor harmonization is considered to be likely. Enrollment
(PDO 1) as well as the overall efficiency of the education sector is poised for further
improvement, as a broad set of actions are being implemented under the ESS 2011-2015
aimed at increasing retention and quality of learning at all levels of education, including
the “Love for the Little Ones” program (“Amor por los más Chiquitos”) focusing on
preschool, the “Battle for the 6th Grade (“Batalla por el 6to grado”) focusing on primary,
and the “Battle for the 9th Grade” (“Batalla por el 9to grado”) focusing on secondary
education. In terms of quality of learning (PDO 2), the PAESE, PASEN II and PROESA
Programs continue to support actions to improve quality of education at the pre-school,
primary and secondary levels. While strengthening the institutional capacity of the MoE
                                                    28


(PDO 5) continues to be a challenge, it is being supported by PASEN II. Finally, while
Nicaragua’s education sector continues to be heavily dependent on external assistance,
Development Partners are committed to supporting the MoE in enhancing educational
outcomes in a harmonized, coordinated manner (PDO 4).

6.7       In the areas of governance and accountability (PDO 3), the government has
demonstrated its commitment toward the systematic assessment of student learning, as
indicated by the regular application of national assessment exams and its continuous
participation in regional examinations.23 However, now that the MoE is undergoing a
period of institutional stability and capacity issues are being addressed, it would be
important to resume the regular production, analysis and dissemination of education
statistics in general to ensure transparency, accountability as well as the effective
coordination of actions of all actors working in the education sector. In addition, as noted
earlier, the “nuclear education model” that replaced the Autonomous School Model in
2007 was not implemented according to its original design, resulting in a greater
concentration of responsibility at the national level than originally envisioned. Thus, it
would be important to revisit the current decentralization strategy and the corresponding
governance and accountability mechanisms, including community participation.

Bank Performance
QUALITY AT ENTRY: Moderately Unsatisfactory
6.8     During preparation, the Bank provided strong leadership and technical support in
the development of the SWAP strategy building upon the principles of the 2005 Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Donor coordination was built gradually by introducing
opportunities for dialogue to discuss the country's priorities and identify opportunities to
satisfy them with the resources of the international community.

6.9    The design of the PASEN was highly innovative, incorporating new lessons from
research on improving service delivery and accountability through community
involvement and creation of incentives for individual schools, along the lines of the
World Bank 2004 World Development Report “Making Services Work for Poor People.”
Other analytical work that informed project design included a comprehensive
Development Economics Vice Presidency research study of case studies in multiple
countries on the impact of decentralization in the education sector, the extensive research
on Nicaragua’s autonomous schools that had been carried out jointly by the MoE and the
Bank,24 as well as a social assessment of the needs of Indigenous Peoples.

6.10 A central component of the operation was the expansion of the Autonomous
School Model, which had been under implementation in one form or another in
Nicaragua since 1993. Providing support to the Autonomous School Model was
consistent with the strong ownership of the MoE at the time of preparation as well as its
23
  The fact that the Government of Nicaragua is now paying the TERCE participation fees out of own-source
resources is indicative of its ownership. Previously, participation fees in regional examinations were funded
by Development Partners.
24
  The impact evaluation of Nicaragua’s Autonomous Schools Model was conducted by the Development
Research Group of the World Bank. See, among others, King et al. (1998, 2001).
                                             29


full endorsement by the Bank and the Development Partners in general. Although the
Bank team built upon the extensive research that had been conducted on Nicaragua’s
Autonomous School Model since the 2000s, including a comprehensive Development
Economics research study of case studies in multiple countries regarding the impact of
decentralization in the education sector, greater attention should have been paid to
operational aspects. Weaknesses in some of these operational aspects included the
definition and operationalization of the per capita funding formula, setting in place
appropriate mechanisms for monitoring enrollment reported by schools, providing
support to autonomous schools to enable them to fully exercise their new autonomy,
ensuring that voluntary school fees did indeed remained voluntary, and addressing
potential distortions of the Autonomous School Model in terms of equity both within and
across schools. Likewise, a more in-depth analysis of the adequacy of the formula
determining capitation grants would have been merited, considering that only a year into
implementation this formula had to be modified in view of the distortions it generated.

6.11 The operation is considered to have been overly ambitious for simultaneously
tackling the large-scale expansion of the Autonomous School Model and the MoE’s
institutional strengthening. A phased approach would have been more appropriate,
focusing first on strengthening the MoE’s institutional capacity and accountability
mechanisms at the central, departmental and municipal levels, while piloting the
implementation of fiscal transfers in a limited number of Autonomous Schools. In
addition, the MoE’s capacity in terms of fiduciary and procurement issues was severely
underestimated, particularly given that the operation did not rely on a self-standing
Project Implementation Unit as did the preceding Bank projects in the education sector.
Inadequate MoE capacity resulted in chronic implementation delays. Weaknesses in the
operation’s scope, sequencing of the substantive reforms, and operational aspects of the
Autonomous School Model are deemed major shortcomings that hindered quality at
entry.

QUALITY OF SUPERVISION: Moderately Satisfactory

6.12 The Bank team conducted two or more supervision missions annually, including
joint ones with other Development Partners. These missions included appropriate
technical specialists and provided an opportunity for in-depth review of the progress
being made as well as the identification of implementation bottlenecks. The Project Task
Team exhibited a strong commitment toward the harmonization of donor assistance, and
its steadfast leadership was critical to the success attained in this area. In addition, the
Bank Team was responsible for the supervision of the two EFA-FTI grants for US$24
million, which were fully disbursed.

6.13 The difficulties encountered during the transition period illustrate the challenges
of striking a sound balance between flexibility and continuity in Bank-supported policies.
As mentioned earlier, for more than a decade the Bank had been a key partner of the
previous administrations in the development and implementation of the Autonomous
School Model, providing support through an array of investment and policy operations as
well as HIPC debt release. While the Bank continued supervision activities and dialogue
with the incoming administration, the first two years after the change in administration
were a difficult transition period. Incoming authorities perceived the Bank as rigid and
                                             30


unresponsive due to its insistence on the need to implement according to the Credit
Agreement. On the other hand, there was little the Bank Task team could do without a
major restructuring which, at that point, was not possible due to the lack of a clear policy
agenda for the education sector and mistrust of the Bank on the part of the MoE
authorities. A more clear, coordinated position on the part of the Bank country and sector
management with respect to the drastic change in policy would have been helpful for all
parties involved, including the Bank Task Team. Eventually, 18 months after the change
in administration, the operation was restructured to reflect the priorities of the new
administration. Although the restructuring exhibited some weaknesses (e.g., it would
have been prudent to revise some of the indicators that were poorly defined in the
original Project Result Framework), the restructured Project provided an initial
programmatic response to the new administration’s Implementation Sector Plan 2008-
2011. Equally important, it permitted continuation of the sector dialogue in coordination
with other Development Partners.

6.14 Supervision efforts became more intense during the post-restructuring period, and
more frequent supervision missions were carried out in order to accelerate
implementation and prevent further delays. Weekly meetings were held between the MoE
and the Bank local staff to review the Project's implementation performance. In addition,
the Bank hired consultants to monitor and supervise the procurement and distribution of
textbooks and learning materials and the professional development training activities,
which are the critical activities. Finally, the Bank team effectively capitalized on the post-
restructuring implementation period to engage the new administration in the preparation
of the ESS 2011-2015 and build a substantial education portfolio in coordination with
other DPs.

6.15 Although the Bank team repeatedly called attention to ongoing procurement
weaknesses and ongoing technical support was provided to the MoE in planning and
implementation, more focused support in the areas of procurement, financial reporting
requirements, and monitoring and evaluation would have been appropriate given the
MoE’s limited capacity.

OVERALL BANK PERFORMANCE: Moderately Satisfactory
6.16 Overall Bank performance is deemed Moderately Satisfactory given the moderately
unsatisfactory performance in ensuring quality at entry and moderately satisfactory
performance during supervision.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE: Satisfactory
6.17 Education was a top priority for both the previous and current administrations,
both of them having demonstrated high commitment toward the objectives supported by
the operation in the pre- and post-restructuring periods. While the key policy objectives
remained relevant under the incoming administration, there was a drastic departure from
the previous decentralization strategy built around the Autonomous School Model and
other activities, such as Report Cards that had been central to the Bank's portfolio in the
education sector for over a decade. The transition period was challenging, resulting in
                                                    31


freezing project disbursements and putting various activities on hold for approximately
two years. During this time, the MoE reshaped its strategic priorities, which received
support under the restructured operation. The Government handled the transition to a new
strategy well, and that the new strategy itself was appropriate.

6.18 The Ministry of Finance provided strong support on matters related to fiduciary
issues throughout the operation’s lifetime, and counterpart funds were made available as
anticipated. The Government of Nicaragua met all key loan covenants, with the exception
of one that called for the presentation of terms of reference for a management firm
specializing in the management of change.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE: Moderately Unsatisfactory
6.19 Project implementation was the responsibility of the MoE—named Ministry of
Education, Culture, and Sports (MoECS) under the previous administration and Ministry
of Education (MINED) under the current one. During appraisal, the need for
strengthening the MoE’s institutional capacity was correctly identified as a critical
weakness of Nicaragua’s education sector that needed to be explicitly addressed under
the operation. The lack of capacity did indeed prove to be an implementation bottleneck
throughout the operation’s lifetime. At times, this inherent weakness was compounded by
the frequent change in MoE authorities and key technical staff.

6.20 As mentioned earlier, during the pre-restructuring period, the performance of the
education sector was regularly monitored based on supporting M&E data and presented
in the “State of Basic and Secondary Education” annual reports. In additional, analytical
studies were regularly conducted on various aspects of education provision, such as
municipal performance, which, together with education statistics, were publicly
disseminated in the MoE’s website. The M&E function, however, has been weak during
the post-restructuring period, as currently there is a lack of official education data being
made publicly available.25

6.21 Throughout implementation, the MoE exhibited weaknesses in its internal control
systems, inadequate coordination between technical and financial management areas
within the MoE, unreliable financial information mainly due to high staff turnover, and
some delays in payments to providers. Weaknesses in procurement also hampered
project implementation. After a two-year hiatus in the operation’s implementation, the
restructuring resulted in renewed emphasis in the MoE’s implementation efforts.
However, continued staff turnover, lack of clarity about policies, lack of project
implementation experience, and lack of familiarity with World Bank procurement rules
and procedures continued to be implementation barriers. As a result, the operation’s
closing date had to be extended three times for a total of three years.


25
   Obtaining basic education statistics—e.g., enrollment, dropout, repetition, completion rates, etc.—during
the PPAR mission required a written request in the form of an email to MoE staff responsible for
coordinating external financing detailing the statistics that were been requested, and a meeting with the
head of the MoE statistics department. Some of the requested statistics were not provided (i.e., dropout
rates), for which other sources, such as PREAL reports, had to be used as sources of data.
                                             32

OVERALL BORROWER PERFORMANCE: Moderately Satisfactory

6.22 Overall Borrower performance is deemed Moderately Satisfactory given the
Government’s satisfactory performance and the implementing agency’s moderately
unsatisfactory performance.

Monitoring and Evaluation Implementation
M&E DESIGN
6.23 The original and revised Project Result Framework exhibited several weaknesses.
First, there were weaknesses in the definition of PDOs. Specifically, PDOs were not
clearly defined. Some definitions were ambiguous and included more than one dimension
(e.g., “improved attention to quality and relevance”). Moreover, in the original Project
Result Framework there were internal inconsistencies between the PDO definitions in the
PAD and those in the DCA. In both the original and revised Project Result Framework,
there were inconsistencies between the main text and the corresponding annexes in the
PAD and Project Restructuring Paper.

6.24 Second, there were weaknesses in the definition of the original and revised PDO
indicators. Specifically, some operational definitions of PDO indicators focused on
outputs rather than outcomes. For example, the indicators related to donor harmonization
did not indicate the anticipated results, such as decreased transaction costs and decreased
staff time, but focused instead on measurable outputs, such as the number of donors
providing support to the Government of Nicaragua’s Common Work Program and
participating in joint missions. Other PDO indicators lacked precision and/or had no clear
link with the actions being supported under the operation (e.g., “reduced percentage of
unqualified teachers in rural schools and disadvantaged regions”). In addition, some
PDO indicators were missing; in particular, there were none related to relevance. Finally,
some of the intermediate indicators were not adequate measures of the corresponding
PDOs. For example, percentage of reduction in centralized expenditures of the Ministry
can be sensitive to many factors and is not a gauge of improvements in governance and
accountability in the education sector.

6.25 Third, the M&E strategy was only partially defined. While the PAD specified
which departments within the Ministry were responsible for data collection, it did not
present a strategy for collecting and analyzing the data.

M&E IMPLEMENTATION
6.26 Baseline and follow-on data were collected and monitored by the MoE using its
information and monitoring system. However, data monitoring was less frequent than
required, resulting in monitoring delays throughout the operation’s lifetime. Under the
new administration, there was insufficient emphasis on ensuring the continuity of the
M&E function, both within the operation and at the ministry level. Collection of data
related to activities that were not priorities of the new government or to its policies was
interrupted.

6.27    Another important shortcoming was the lack of comparability between the
national student assessments carried out during the pre- (2002 and 2006) and post-
                                             33


restructuring periods (2009 and 2010). Although the lack of comparability reportedly
resulted from the shift from standards to competencies in the old and the new curriculum,
the exams were applied to different grades and it is not clear whether the assessments
were consistent in terms of level of content and complexity of questions or whether the
proficiency levels were lowered. The need to ensure a minimum level of comparability
by selecting some comparable items to be measured with both instruments was properly
noted by the Bank at restructuring.26 The processing of student achievement data was not
automated, which in turn caused additional delays. Some of the evaluations anticipated at
appraisal (i.e. teachers' pedagogical practices; analysis of variation in performance across
schools; surveys of school councils; and evaluation of the pilot preschool) were not
implemented.

M&E UTILIZATION
6.28 At the operational level, MoE officials consistently reported during the ICR
mission that the National Management Information System developed under the
operation (now called the Work System for Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and
Education Statistics) has led to evidence-based decision-making and enhanced planning,
M&E, and procurement capacity. One notable example is the “Early Warning System”
that reports online data on enrollment and attendance on a daily basis, allowing the MoE
to take timely actions and prevent dropouts. At the policy level, the operation’s Project
Result Framework, were important inputs in the preparation of the Education Sector Plan
2008-2011 and the ESS 2011-2015.

6.29 In terms of accountability, data from national learning assessments were provided
to schools, and workshops were held with principals and teachers. Data was also shared
with Development Partners and publicly disseminated. As mentioned earlier, explicitly
training teachers to address performance weaknesses would have been important to
increase the quality of learning.

M&E QUALITY RATING: Modest
6.30       M&E quality is deemed Modest for the reasons articulated above.

7. Lessons
7.1     Flexibility by the Bank in the face of changing government policy may be
needed to secure continued development impact. When faced with a major change in
government policy, the Bank engaged in a long and frank dialogue to understand how the
project could best be restructured to remain relevant. This required a major change in the
underlying logical framework of the project and the willingness for the Bank to accept a
new approach. Without this willingness to be flexible and to significantly adjust the
project design, the project would have likely been unsuccessful after the policy shift.

7.2   Ultimately, the sustainability of an education reform depends on information
transparency, communications, and buy-in from stakeholders. While the school
autonomy model was developed incorporating strong technical support from the World

26
     Project Restructuring Paper (p. 11)
                                             34


Bank, there appeared to be little attempt to build consensus around the model or to debate
alternatives. This led to political opposition that made it vulnerable to early cancellation.
The lack of data systems weakened the capacity of policy makers to understand what was
working. Likewise, communities had little information about the impact of the reform.
Information, including evidence on the impact of the reform, could have been used along
with community outreach programs to address community concerns. This contributed to
the lack of consensus about the new model and ultimately to its demise.

7.3     World Bank support needs to go beyond technical aspects. In developing the
project, the World Bank provided strong technical support to design the school autonomy
model. However it appears that Bank did not provide sufficient support to the logistic
elements of the reform, such as piloting an information system or building local capacity.
Likewise it appears that the government and Bank did take into account the political
economy behind the reform. While technical support is important for the design of
reforms, its implementation needs different types of support that also need to be
developed during the design phase.

7.4     Donor coordination and a SWAP can continue, and even be strengthened in
the face of adversity and significant policy change. One of the project’s objectives was
to strengthen donor coordination and reduce fragmentation in the education sector. The
changes in policy had the potential to reduce donor coordination as different donors look
for new alternatives in the education sector. The Bank was able to work with others to
strengthen coordination during the time of uncertainty. The Bank and the donor
community established protocols and agreements that played an important role in keeping
development partners together.

7.5      The use of country systems contributed to the long-term sustainability of
World Bank support to the education sector in Nicaragua. The project successfully
supported the use of country systems as one of its initiatives. This is usually justified as
reducing transaction costs for the government. However in the case of Nicaragua, it also
appeared to have contributed to the stability of the World Bank’s and the development
community’s support for the education sector. Interviews suggest that this initiative
facilitated the restructuring and the development of the Education Sector Strategy.
