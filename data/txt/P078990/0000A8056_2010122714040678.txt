                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been an acceleration in the implementation of the Project in the last six months, in part due to the fact that a new management team took the helm of the Ministry of

                         Education. but also because of a new sense of urgency to complete the remaining Project activities before the closing date of the Project on December 31, 2010. Most noticeable is
                         the progress achieved by the Project team to complete the large training program for multi-grade primary school teachers, secondary education Math and Spanish teachers and
                         pedagogic advisors. The Ministry is also finishing the last series of monthly teacher training workshops. Other activities such as the preparation of the second student learning
                         standardized testing, the finalization of the education management information system and the elaboration of various learning materials are well-advanced.
