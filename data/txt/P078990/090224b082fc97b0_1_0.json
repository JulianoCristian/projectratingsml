       Nicaragua were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: flexibility by the Bank in the face of\n            changing government policy may be needed to secure continued\n            development impact. Ultimately, the sustainability of an\n            education reform depends on information transparency,\n            communications, and buy-in from stakeholders. In developing\n            the project, the World Bank provided strong technical\n            support to design the school autonomy model. Donor\n            coordination and a sector-wide approach (SWAP) can continue,\n            and even be strengthened in the face of adversity and\n            significant policy change. The use of country systems\n            contributed to the long-term sustainability of World Bank\n            support to the education sector in Nicaragua."}, "docdt": "2015-06-12T00:28:03Z"}
