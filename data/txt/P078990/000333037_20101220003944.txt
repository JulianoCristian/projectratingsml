Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for the Nicaragua, Education Project (PASEN), Credit 3978-NI
 
will be extended
 
from December 31, 2010 until June 30, 2011.   
2. 
The Project was restructured before in June 2008 into two components (from four 
originally) namely: (i) institutional strengthening of the management capacity of the 
Ministry of Education (MINED), and (ii) quality improvement of primary and secondary 
education. The Ministry of Education has successfully completed most Project activities, 
including: (i) the establishment of a decentralized and participative education 
management model, (ii) the establishment of an Education Management Information 
System at the central and departmental level; (iii) the establishment and implementation 
of a national strategy for learning assessments; (iv) the development of learning materials 
and provision of textbooks, including classroom materials for preschools (workbooks and 
story books) and primary schools; (v) the development and implementation of 
professional development activities for multi-grade teachers in targeted rural schools and 
school pedagogic advisors; and finally (vi) the design, development, and distribution of 
study-guides for
 
fourth and fifth years of secondary education in the areas of Mathematics 
and Spanish, and the associated training for teachers in their use and classroom 
application.  
3. 
The proposed extension is necessary to complete the purchase, printing and 
distribution of goods financed by the Project.  This includes: (i) the purchase of two 
computer server units to improve the efficiency of the MINED network system; books for 
distribution to school libraries for primary; other learning materials for distribution to 
secondary non-formal education; school supplies for distribution to primary schools in 
the non-formal education system and 16 laptops for the Primary and Teacher Training 
Directorates of MINED; and (ii) the printing of learning materials (guides, brochures, 
curriculum materials, and learning aids) for distribution to primary school teachers and 
school administrators. MINED has prepared a plan of action for completion of these 
activities prior to the revised closing date. 
4. 
This will be the third extension of the project
,
bringing the total cumulative extension 
to three years.
