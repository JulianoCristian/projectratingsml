Some\n            lessons learned included: the inadequate assessment of risks\n            at the beginning of the original Project design was a major\n            factor in the discontinuity of certain activities and in the\n            need for restructuring. Support of all stakeholders matters,\n            and it is important to maintain coalitions to support\n            reforms. Project preparation should clearly identify\n            possible fragile points in the coalitions to support\n            reforms. Even though identifying the exact reasons why the\n            government decided to abandon the school autonomy program\n            goes beyond this document, there is evidence of\n            dissatisfaction with the model from parents and teachers at\n            its early stages, in most cases due to challenges in the\n            relationship with principals. The original and the\n            restructured project designs had two very different concepts\n            of decentralization embedded in them, with different\n            accountability mechanisms, in the original design,\n            decentralization was at the school level, while during the\n            restructured design, and decentralization was at the\n            departmental level. Nonetheless, under both approaches,\n            information is the key to accountability. But information\n            coming from test can be affected by curriculum changes.\n            Therefore, in order to achieve comparability through time\n            tests could focus on student competences. Another option to\n            assess evolution of the education system is to participate\n            in international tests to provide benchmarks through time.\n            These considerations have been taken into account in the\n            design of the new project."}, "docdt": "2011-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
