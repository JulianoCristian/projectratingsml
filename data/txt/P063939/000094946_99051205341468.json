To achieve the aim of safeguarding SSN, the\n            loan supports the creation of an overarching national\n            structure with three major components: a government team, a\n            joint government and civil society effort in a \"control\n            team,\" and a completely independent civil society\n            monitoring function. The joint government and civil society\n            effort will oversee the implementation of a five-fold\n            strategy for each of five key social safety net programs,\n            which include internal monitoring and operational controls,\n            independent verification of program performance and\n            monitoring reports, information campaigns to reach the\n            grassroots level, a complaint resolution mechanism that will\n            be supervised by the control team, and civil society\n            involvement at every level of monitoring. To improve program\n            design, the loan supports better geographical targeting and\n            application of international best practice, taking into\n            account field-based evaluations of on-going activities, so\n            that the poor are more effectively reached."}, "docdt": "1999-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
