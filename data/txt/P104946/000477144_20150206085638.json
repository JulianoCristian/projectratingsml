high risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately satisfactory performance\n            ratings. Two restructurings took placing during this\n            project. The first restructuring includes a revised price\n            list for the defined safe motherhood services estimated that\n            the allocated grant for service provision would be able to\n            cover the subsidies for only a fraction of beneficiaries;\n            therefore the restructuring reduced the number of target\n            beneficiaries to reflect the revised cost structure. The\n            second restructuring involved a withdrawal of Saudi General\n            Hospital (SGH), the second service provider, and revised\n            estimations of the time that would be required to reach the\n            revised end-target. The restructuring changes were: (i)\n            amendment of the revised PDO with an amended key project\n            indicator of 15,000 beneficiaries based on a single service\n            provider; (ii) extension of the project closing date by\n            eighteen months to meet the revised target of 15,000; (iii)\n            reallocation of Grant proceeds; and (iv) a cancellation of\n            unused grant funds because of withdrawal of SGH. The PDO was\n            revised twice and reflects the following: (a) provide\n            quality maternal care to about 30,000 eligible women in\n            targeted districts in Sana'a; and (b) design and\n            implement a model of maternal care which demonstrates how\n            Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be\n            effectively integrated with private health provision. There\n            were several lessons learned from this project and include\n            the following: (1) A better clarity and realism on the\n            applicability of GPOBA policies and procedures to Bank\n            projects is critical. (2) While the project design was no\n            doubt innovative for the Yemen health sector and benefitted\n            from this pilot, with hindsight it could have benefited from\n            a much more robust assessment of readiness of all parties,\n            and, given the innovative project approach and fragile\n            context, from more intensive collaboration amongst all\n            parties during preparation and implementation. (3) When\n            introducing innovations, which are no doubt needed to\n            influence desired development outcomes, smaller pilots with\n            regular reviews may be more effective. (4) There is no doubt\n            that all projects require M&E; that robust M&E is a\n            core concept for successful performance based projects; and,\n            that independent verification is required because the\n            payment of grant subsidies is based on achievement of\n            individual outputs. There is an important distinction to be\n            made between a robust system and a complex system. (5) A\n            more structured and concerted engagement with Government,\n            the Ministry of Health (required) and also the Ministry of\n            Finance (desirable), is required for any project that wishes\n            to effectively influence public policy, especially one that\n            envisions growth using government and donor mobilized\n            resources, as in this instance."}, "docdt": "2015-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
