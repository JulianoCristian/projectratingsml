F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The proposed Public and Natural Resources Management Development (PNRMD) operation is
designed to help implement the Government's economic reform program for 2008-2009 that is
based on São Tomé and Príncipe's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It supports policy
measures aimed principally at improving the accountability, effectiveness and level of public
resources and at strengthening governance in the oil sector. It will in addition support the
authorities' efforts to initiate the preparation of a new PRSP based on updated information on oil
prospects and in-depth analysis of growth diversification options.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) is a small and fragile state. An archipelago of just over 1,000
square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea, STP is one of the smallest economies in Africa with
about 160,000 inhabitants and a gross national income (GNI) per capita of US$1,140 (2009). The
country faces many development challenges due to its small size and insularity, limited
institutional capacity, and aid dependency. As in other small island states, STP cannot take
advantage of economies of scale in the provision of infrastructure, services, and economic
activities. This translates into: (i) high costs per unit of government and utility provision services;
(ii) little flexibility of the economy to adapt to shocks; and (iii) few opportunities for risk
diversification within the domestic market.

The last household survey (2001) estimated poverty incidence at 54 percent (including 15 percent
in extreme poverty). Poverty in 2001 remained largely a rural phenomenon with 65 percent of the
rural population living below the poverty line and 22 percent below the extreme poverty line.
Although a number of social indicators have improved in recent years, progress toward achieving
STP's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been slow.

STP has consolidated democratic rule since 1991 although marked by frequent government
turnover. The political system is characterized by coalition arrangements that have led to frequent
changes of government and delays in the implementation of the development agenda. Despite a
number of such changes taking place, all governments have largely implemented policies that
consolidated macroeconomic stability and alleviated poverty, although implementation of the
reform agenda slowed down during 2004-2006.

Oil was discovered in the joint waters shared with Nigeria and since 2005, the country has
received US$77.8 million in oil bonuses from oil exploration. The use of these funds has helped
close the fiscal gap, but has also raised strong expectations of social improvement. Effective oil
exploitation, previously expected to start in 2011, has been delayed given the high risks involved
in offshore drilling, and it is not expected until at least 2015 at the earliest. Fiscal sustainability
would be at stake if the proceeds from the projected oil production were not to materialize.

At the time of appraisal, commitment to structural reforms and macroeconomic stability had
allowed STP to achieve high growth and to receive debt relief. Structural reforms aimed at: (i)
pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies; (ii) improving the efficiency of public spending;
(iii) liberalizing the economy by reforming the import tariff structure, preparing for liberalization
of the telecoms sector, and privatizing a number of public enterprises; (iv) developing new
strategies in health and education; and (v) building institutional capacities, especially in the
nascent petroleum sector. These reforms had positive results. In 2007, STP reached the
Completion Point of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and received debt relief in the amount of
US$314 million. Successful implementation of these reforms and a buoyant external
environment, characterized by a booming activity in the tourism and construction sectors, and the
arrival of signature oil bonuses, led to a high economic growth that averaged 6.2 percent during
2006-08.

Yet, difficulties to control inflation led the authorities to strengthen fiscal discipline. Economic
policy loosened as a result of high budget inflows (mainly from the arrival of oil bonuses),
growing social demands, and a very volatile political environment. In a context of high
international prices of food and fuel, annual inflation was larger than 25 percent during 2006-


                                                  1
2008. Concerns about fiscal sustainability, particularly given uncertainty in the arrival of future
oil bonuses, led the Government to strengthen fiscal and monetary discipline. As a result of
prudent macroeconomic policies, the Government reduced the annual domestic primary fiscal
deficit from around 15 percent of GDP in 2004 to 7.5 percent of GDP in 2008, financed mainly
by oil signature bonuses and privatization receipts.

As it embarked on fiscal consolidation, STP's economy was hard hit by two consecutive external
shocks: (i) the sharp increase in international food and fuel prices in mid-2008; and (ii) the
international economic and financial slowdown since 2009. The food and fuel crisis had a
substantial effect on the population. The World Food Program (WFP) estimated an increase in the
number of vulnerable people that needed its support (those for whom food is inadequate or at the
limit) by 10-15 percent only one year after the onset of the crisis. Furthermore, the global
economic slowdown since 2009 also had serious repercussions for STP. Growth slowed down to
4 percent in 2009 following a sharp decline in foreign direct investment, tourism receipts, and
foreign assistance, although limited external portfolio and exposure to toxic financial assets kept
the country's financial system remained relatively unaffected.

These external shocks limited the capacity of the authorities to maintain the pace of fiscal
consolidation. The growth slowdown and oil signature bonuses that did not materialize translated
into lower Government revenues that the new corporate and personal income tax laws introduced
in 2009 (aimed at enhancing compliance), were not been able to offset. The domestic primary
deficit widened to 8.2 percent of GDP in 2009.

The PNRMD program, approved in 2008, provided critical budgetary support and financing
(US$6 million) to facilitate the continuation of the reform process, strengthen institutional
capacity for PRSP implementation and budget processes, and improve the policy framework in
the petroleum sector by setting forth best international practices of transparency and
accountability, particularly in opening up the EEZ to oil exploration. PNRMD was to be
implemented in close collaboration with donors involved in the on-going Public Finance
Management (PFM) reform (e.g., Portugal, France, EU, Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC), UNDP, and AfDB).

In 2009, the mobilization of oil signature bonuses under the PNRMD appeared to be somewhat
uncertain, and there was also uncertainty as to the degree that external foreign assistance support
might mitigate the impact of the crisis. The lower tourism receipts, tightening of credit to the
private sector, falling remittances, and reduced FDI flows were impacting negatively on growth
and poverty. The global liquidity squeeze and lower than expected economic growth were also
taking a toll on tax collection. These developments prompted the Bank to bolster the PNRMD
with a Supplemental Financing Grant. In 2009 the Bank approved a supplemental financing of
US$2 million to provide timely assistance to the Government to close the fiscal gap, maintain
macroeconomic stability, and continue its reform program.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The proposed Public and Natural Resources Management Development (PNRMD) operation is
designed to help implement the Government's economic reform program for 2008-2009 that is
based on São Tomé and Príncipe's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It supports policy
measures aimed principally at improving the accountability, effectiveness and level of public
resources and at strengthening governance in the oil sector. It will in addition support the
authorities' efforts to initiate the preparation of a new PRSP based on updated information on oil
prospects and in-depth analysis of growth diversification options.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The objectives of the operation were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

    (a) Strengthening Public Financial Management

PNRMD intended to raise the level of public spending to better deliver key services. However,
the systems of accountability and effectiveness of public resources were either non-existent or
operated at low levels of efficiency. The PFM component aimed at strengthening budget
preparation and execution using modern harmonized nomenclatures and accounting framework
and plan in order to undertake yearly budget audits, publish them promptly, and submit them to
the National Assembly. These actions were expected to raise public expenditure efficiency by
strengthening the links between budget allocations and policy priorities while improving
transparency and accountability of public resources.

The PNRMD program focused on strengthening institutions by introducing legislation and
procedures to help adapt MoPF Directorates to their new role of coordinating and supervising a
decentralized budget execution by sector ministries. A Public Accounting Directorate (AD) was
to be created and an Information Technology Directorate would assist in the preparation of the
State's public accounts. A Coordination and Assistance Procurement Supervisory Body was to be
created to centralize procurement information, assist decentralized procurement units, and ensure
uniformity and quality across units. A new Public Assets Management Directorate was to be
made responsible for carrying out a survey of all State assets and develop software to ensure their
adequate management. Updated functions of the Treasury Directorate were to focus on improving
budget controls and better SOE supervision.

The PNRMD program also envisaged an improved Integrated Financial Management Information
System (SAFE-e) that not only incorporates new budgetary codes to allow a functional
classification of operations while strengthening budget control, monitoring, and reporting, but
also would facilitate the preparation of public accounts.

Given MoPF's fairly weak institutional capacity, consultants financed by IDA's Governance
Capacity Building and Technical Assistance Project (GCBTA) were hired to assist the authorities
to implement many of the activities of the PNRMD program. The World Bank's GCBTA project
was approved in 2004 and the component on PFM focused on: (i) improving legislation, notably
the Organic Law on Public Finance Management (SAFE law) to eliminate the dual budgeting of
current and investment expenditures; complemented with new budget codes. This would permit a
more homogenous and transparent recording of financial transactions, facilitating the analysis of
outcomes in accordance with international best practice standards and the adoption of a chart of
accounts employing double-entry accounting; (ii) a new Procurement Law that would introduce
decentralized procurement and fostered competitive bidding in public purchases; and (iii)
updating public revenue legislation (General Tax and Tax Procedural Codes) and strengthening
collection enforcement, to be complemented with new Urban and Corporate and Personal Income
Tax Laws.




                                                3
    (b) Strengthening Governance in the Petroleum Sector

PNRMD sought to build an institutional and legal framework to supervise and regulate the
petroleum sector in preparation for the granting of concessions in the EEZ following an
international competitive bidding process that was expected to materialize with qualified oil
companies' participation.

Transparency in the petroleum sector was also to be emphasized with the publication of the first
Extractive Industries Initiative (EITI) report that would complement previous transparency efforts
such as the Petroleum Oversight Committee and the Public Registration and Transparency
Information Office to disseminate all public petroleum information.

    (c) Preparation of New PRSP

PNRMD supported the initiation of a new PRSP. A Committee was to be appointed in 2008 to
prepare a new Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. For this purpose, the poverty profile was to be
updated utilizing information emanating from a household survey which needed to be reviewed.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

PNRMD was a single tranche operation. The Grant was approved on June 10, 2008, became
effective on August 12, 2008, and was originally set to close on June 30, 2009. The closing date
needed to be extended twice, first to December 31, 2009 and later to June 30, 2010 to respond to
the significant exogenous shocks in the form of increasing international food and fuel prices and
subsequently the global financial crisis. A Supplemental Financing Grant was approved on
August 7, 2009, became effective on December 10, 2009, and was originally set to close on
December 31, 2009. The closing date was extended to June 30, 2010 to provide enough time to
STP's National Assembly to ratify the Supplemental Financing Grant Agreement, as PNRMD
attention was diverted to addressing the exogenous shocks. This Supplemental Financing helped
the Government address pressing social needs while ensuring macroeconomic stability in line
with PNRMD objectives.

The operation's design appeared to be simple, with 10 prior actions that were met by the time of
Board approval. However, the program included some complex technical activities, such as
developing the SAFE-e system to manage public finances, which were proven to be highly
ambitious in light of the low level of institutional capacity in STP. The Implementation Status and
Results Report (ISR) produced rated achievement of the program objectives as Moderately
Satisfactory, which was logical given delays in achieving development outcomes when PNRMD
attention was diverted to addressing the food and financial crisis that motivated the supplemental



                                                4
financing, and also because of delays in getting the supplemental financing effective and
disbursed.

The operation was largely successful overall and the PDO were broadly achieved. Six of eight
program targets were fully or partially met (three met, two mostly met, and two partially met).
The remaining program target, namely improved government management of government
accounts and assets, was not achieved although significant progress was made in this policy area.
This program target was beyond the capacity of GoSTP to deliver it in the time frame required.
Indeed, improved government management of accounts and assets had been hampered due to the
technical complexities in preparing the SAFE-e public financial management system, which had
been underestimated. This prevented GoSTP from producing the public accounts in 2009, a task
that requires the SAFE-e system to be operational for at least a year.

Quality at entry should have been more focused. Project design was too optimistic with respect to
the possibility of achieving the performance indicators on time and did not concentrate
sufficiently on the project's technical complexities and human resource and institutional capacity
constraints. Linked to this was the fact that the Bank had not been involved with a DPO in STP
for some time and was not familiar with circumstances on the ground.

The Bank overestimated GoSTP's capacity to approve legislation and underestimated its limited
capacity to undertake timely actions according to a preset schedule in the policy matrix given the
country's high vulnerability to political changes, low levels of capacity overall, and an
overstretched staff. Overall, a candid risk analysis (see further below) had been carried out at the
time of the Decision Meeting, which noted the weak institutional capacity of STP, but the
development of program targets would have benefitted from a more in-depth institutional
capacity assessment and a more careful consideration of Nigeria's commitment to move rapidly
on EITI in the JDZ. Instead, project design relied on the work of the GCBTA, which, in turn, was
also fairly optimistic in achieving results and also lacked an institutional capacity assessment that
would have shed light on the feasibility of achieving results over the time frame expected.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

    (a) External Factors

Two back-to-back external shocks had a devastating impact on STP's population, first increasing
food and fuel prices, then reducing external financing. Starting in 2007, food prices rose
sharply--the consumer price and food price indexes rose by 51 percent and 63 percent,
respectively, between January 2007 and September 2008. Rice and milk prices skyrocketed by 97
and 275 percent respectively while banana prices jumped by 52 percent. Fuel prices also
increased by 41 percent, exacerbating already existing inflationary pressures in transport and
energy. In addition, STP suffered trade disruptions affecting imports of key food products such as
salt, milk and rice. The rising cost of living led to a 10-15 percent increase in the number of
vulnerable people in 2008.

As a result of the international financial crisis that erupted in end-2008, there were lower than
expected tourism receipts, tightening of private sector credit, falling remittances, dropping FDI
and foreign aid flows. These external financing shortcomings translated into lower growth, and
falling tax collections that limited the government's human and institutional resources to
implement its reform program.

These exogenous shocks created a major distraction for the authorities to implement the reform
agenda, in a country with very limited implementation capacity.

    (b) Factors Under Government Control

In response to the emerging crisis, GoSTP adjusted its policy framework and mobilized funding
for investment. Under pressure to find additional resources, the authorities sold in November
2008 a 35 percent controlling stake in the oil import and distribution local company (ENCO), to
the Angolan-owned oil company Sonangol for US$21 million.

The government tightened recurrent expenditure while protecting already limited social safety net
allocations. It funded an investment program partially with Treasury resources obtained from the
sale of ENCO and sought to mobilize additional grants as well as other concessional financing.
The emphasis of the public investment program was shifted toward domestic agriculture
production and infrastructure in order to address low productivity issues, increased domestic food
crops and food security, improved rural income and employment, and poverty reduction. GoSTP
also intended to carry out a comprehensive review of its social safety net and social protection
strategy. However, the government was overstretched during the crisis and as a result PNRMD
implementation was delayed.

    (c) Adequacy of Government Commitment

The PNRMD program closely reflected the government priorities as set out in its government
program and the budget support it provided became a key incentive in enlisting the authorities'
support for the operation. GoSTP commitment was very strong despite three government changes
taking place and difficulties arising from a challenging governing environment resulting from the
exogenous shocks. To respond to these shocks and sustain the growth effort, GoSTP introduced a
revised macroeconomic framework and public investment program which was endorsed by a
three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the IMF, approved in March 2009. The
authorities' commitment to strengthen public governance continued as the crisis deepened. The
National Assembly approved the Petroleum Sector and Petroleum Tax Laws, and the GoSTP


                                                7
entered into discussions with its Nigerian counterparts into forming a Joint STP-Nigeria
committee for the EITI, and committed itself to supervise the petroleum operations of the JDZ.
PFM accelerated and in some areas the GoSTP even exceeded the PNRMD's objectives,
particularly regarding the payments system, single treasury account, and legislation for
transferring all revenues to the Treasury.

    (d) Soundness of Background Analysis

The PRSP was adopted in 2003 following an extensive consultative process managed by a
Steering Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, consisting of representatives of GoSTP and
civil society. Numerous workshops were organized with the participation of civil society, private
sector, political parties, and other stakeholders. The poverty strategy set an ambitious policy
agenda and laid out a strategic plan for poverty reduction based on five pillars: (i) reform of
public institutions, capacity building, and promotion of good governance; (ii) accelerated and
redistributive growth; (iii) creation of opportunities to increase and diversify income for the poor;
(iv) human resource development and access to basic social services; and (v) adoption of
mechanisms to monitor, assess, and update the strategy. However, the PRSP was not results-
oriented and did not have clear outcomes and measurable performance indicators. Limited
statistical information further hindered PRSP's monitoring and evaluation process. Therefore, its
usefulness in providing a strong action route for the government program and the Bank assistance
was limited.

Background analysis underpinning PNRMD operation was comprehensive and responded to
country priorities by providing a strong action plan. Building on the achievements and lessons of
previous Bank projects and of the Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review (PEMFAR), the PNRMD program supported STP's CAS and the GoSTP's Action Plan
in line with PRSP objectives of: (i) improving public expenditure efficiency through better budget
preparation, execution, and control; strengthening tax legislation; and assuring a stronger impact
of public expenditures on poverty; and (ii) raising the standard of oil revenue management in line
with EITI.

The social and environmental analysis was adequate. Weak governance and fragile institutions
were identified as major causes of poverty in the background work. The PNRMD program also
built on PEMFAR's findings that pro-poor expenditures have a limited impact due to sector
strategies that are not fully consistent with the annual budget allocations and the long-term
strategy set on the PRSP. Aware of these challenges the GoSTP had initiated a medium term
reform program supported by the World Bank GCBTA project to improve PFM, develop public
accounts and a modern procurement system, and create petroleum management legislation and
institutions. Furthermore, the macroeconomic framework was in line with the 2006-2008 IMF-
PRGF program and the Supplemental Financing revised macroeconomic framework was in line
with the 2009-2011 IMF ECF.

    (e) Assessment of the Operation's Design

The project development objectives were measured by a set of program targets for which the
operation could reasonably be held accountable given its duration, resources, and approach.
Program targets were clear, and important, as well as fully responsive to borrower requirements
and development priorities. Priorities were defined to address the most pressing PFM issues, as
well as governance requirements in the petroleum sector, although the program targets were
somewhat ambitious given the technical complexity of developing the SAFE-e system and the
difficulties to coordinate with Nigeria on setting up joint EITI institutions in the JDZ.


                                                 8
Project design was closely linked to GCBTA's agenda, taking advantage of economies of scale in
project preparation and supervision and in particular during project implementation by the
authorities. The analysis of individual components was consistent with their relative importance
to the objectives of the operation. Good practice principles on conditionality were applied. These
included reinforcing ownership, agreeing up front on a coordinated accountability framework,
customizing the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to STP's
circumstances, choosing actions critical for achieving results on conditions for disbursement, and
conducting transparent progress reviews.

An institutional capacity assessment was not prepared, which was somewhat unfortunate since
two of the operation's eight program targets were either very complex to be completed in the time
required, or depended on coordinating with Nigeria to address petroleum transparency in the JDZ.
Indeed, the complexity and the time required for introducing the SAFE-e system was grossly
underestimated. Notwithstanding the lack of an institutional capacity assessment, the PNRMD
program's design benefitted from the fact that GCBTA was operational and provided updated
information on country systems.

Effective consultations were held with key stakeholders and included meetings with country
officials, legislators, civil society, and the private sector. Workshops were held with government
officials to discuss the policy matrix and Grant Agreement, both of which were translated into
Portuguese and discussed in that language. Given the pressing needs to move quickly the PD was
only issued in English although its content was thoroughly discussed with the authorities. Also
PEMFAR, a key background document, had been translated into Portuguese and disseminated
widely in STP, which facilitated GoSTP's understanding of the operation.

Donor coordination did not become a critical factor in the operation's design. Donor coordination
has lacked a formal consultative group type mechanism that focuses on STP's medium term
policy reform agenda, ensures project coordination in tandem with the implementation of the
policy agenda, and acts as a conduit for the pledging of donor contributions. Nonetheless, the
Bank team developed good working arrangements with the IMF, UNDP, the African
Development Bank, the European Union, Portugal and the MCC, informing them of the work
program while in the field.

    (f) Relevance of Risk Analysis

The PD identified five main risks that could influence the operation's expected outcomes: (i)
external factors that could have a deterring impact on economic growth, reduce government
resources and affect its ability to conduct its reform program; (ii) policy reversals or slippages in
structural reforms, notably petroleum sector management, could affect the GoSTP's ability to
maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and focus expenditure on poverty reducing
priorities identified in the PRSP; (iii) weak human, institutional, and managerial capacity could
slow down the pace of implementation; (iv) fiduciary risks with regard to the use of public funds
remain as internal and external control mechanisms remain weak; and (v) reforms and the growth
momentum may not be sustainable if oil exploitation does not materialize.

The Supplemental Financing PD reviewed the risk analysis considering progress made at the
early stages of implementation and specified four major risks that could influence the operation's
expected outcomes. These risks were: (i) uncertainties surrounding the global economic downturn
and the impact on STP's external financing and the macroeconomy; (ii) political stalemate that
could slowdown the reform program; (iii) fiduciary risks associated to weak internal and external


                                                 9
financial control mechanisms; and (iv) the weak institutional capacity to implement the
domestically financed investment program.

Proposed mitigation measures as specified in the PD included: (i) close cooperation with bilateral
donors and the IMF to reduce macroeconomic risks; (ii) design the prior actions to assure early
implementation of key policies; (iii) concentrate reforms in a limited number of sectors and
heighten technical assistance to mitigate the risk of weak institutional capacity in STP; and (iv) a
support wide scope of public finance management reforms to mitigate fiduciary risks. In addition,
the PD noted the strength of the Government's ownership and commitment to implement the
proposed measures, in particular public finance management, and the active policy dialogue with
Bank and Fund staff and the extension of the Bank's Technical Assistance Capacity Building
project.

The risk analysis for both operations was fully relevant and the mitigation measures proposed
broadly adequate. Nonetheless, although the PD identified external factors as a risk, it did not
envisage an international financial sector crisis or the ensuing global recession emerging as part
of the operation's risks. But the PD should not be faulted for this omission since these were risks
that took the whole developed and developing world by surprise. Nonetheless, all such risks were
mitigated through the use of the supplemental financing made available to GoSTP. The PD also
did not envisage the complexities of setting up a joint EITI committee with Nigeria. Even though
an institutional capacity assessment would have helped in the design of the operation, it should be
noted that the STP-Nigeria JDZ is the only joint-zone evaluated by the EITI Secretariat and
therefore the degree of risk was hard to predict.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Given a weak monitoring and evaluation system in-country and a single tranche operation,
PNRMD's M&E framework was largely based on relevant and easy to monitor indicators and
program goals, which could be tracked and were aligned with objectives. These were listed as
policy interventions and results for each of the two PNRMD objectives in the PD. Nonetheless,
the results indicators could have possibly been better quantified, but that proved to be somewhat
difficult because of the paucity of the data in the country. A half-yearly review was carried out
taking into account the rather short period to have a full visible impact. The operation also
benefitted from the monitoring system in place under the IMF ECF. Development of longer term
indicators would have been desirable to better measure results over the medium-term, but again
this would have been difficult given the data constraints. Although the Bank encouraged
institutionalizing an M&E culture in the country, its impact on such a dramatic change in
oversight was limited for this operation but continue to be address in the context of the GCTA
project.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Although the authorities have made substantial progress over the past five years in the
macroeconomic and PFM areas and in improving petroleum sector governance, the economy
remains fragile and vulnerable to external shocks, poverty persists, there critical public sector and
economic governance challenges and the PFM agenda remains unfinished. Small island states
pursuing good economic management practices initially tend to reflect somewhat better
macroeconomic, fiscal, and social results than larger countries given their small economic base,
initial starting point, and small population numbers. Yet these positive results mask major
capacity constraints that hamper the development of their growth potential and strengthening their
governance requirements.


                                                 10
The country needs to consolidate its PFM reform agenda and lay out stronger foundations for
achieving sustained longer term growth and poverty reduction. For this reason, the Bank should
be prepared to remain an active participant in supporting STP's development efforts over the
longer term; otherwise the risk of reversal of hard won gains is likely to increase sharply. Because
of this, supporting Bank financial and technical assistance will most likely be required even
during the period when the potential revenues emanating from the development of its oil
resources begin to flow.

The priorities supported by the PNRMD program have largely focused on developing and
strengthening public sector financial systems and processes and petroleum governance. This aims
first to developing institutional capability, utilizing modern techniques and approaches, to raise
public sector efficiency. It also aims to increasing transparency in the petroleum sector,
developing the mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of future oil extraction will materialize
optimally within standards of good governance.

The next phase of reforms would need to consolidate the gains achieved through the PNRMD
program and the GCTA project. Within this context, the Bank should continue its focus on raising
the accountability and effectiveness of public resources by encouraging preparation of a results
oriented development strategy and helping strengthen donor coordination in support of the
strategy, increasing transparency and accountability of budget preparation. The Bank should also
support the authorities to adequately maintaining fiscal discipline, regardless of whether or not oil
production materializes in the medium term. In the medium term, a substantial amount of
technical assistance will be required in the preparation of a medium term expenditure and fiscal
framework (MTEF). Activities in this regard will include developing criteria for the most
efficient use of resources in project selection, and preparing medium term public investment
program within the context of maintaining a stable and competitive macroeconomic framework in
line with resource availability and prudent debt management practices. Another potential area of
improvement is civil service management although this is known to require substantial
background analysis and long term commitment.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PNRMD's objectives, design, and implementation were consistent with GoSTP's
development priorities and corporate goals as reflected in STP's PRSP and the Bank's CAS. The
operation remains critically important for achieving STP's and Bank objectives in light of the
adverse external shocks that impacted the country, which the supplemental financing grant
contributed to mitigate.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The PNRMD PDOs were largely achieved as evidenced by STP's performance in relation to the
targeted program indicators. The operation was also successful in providing critical resources to
implement the GoSTP reform program, address social needs during high food and fuel prices.
When key indicators such as the economy's growth rate, expected mobilization of external
assistance and foreign direct investment, tax collections, and primary surplus/deficit deteriorated
in 2008/09 due to the global economic downturn. Under these conditions, the US$2 million
supplemental financing and the extension of the closing date of the PNRMD program provided
timely assistance and allowed the Government to close its fiscal gap, maintain macroeconomic


                                                 11
stability, and the GoSTP reform program. Table 1 below provides selected macroeconomic
indicators for 2000 and for 2005 through 2009. Outcomes under the PNRMD supported program
are discussed next and detailed in Section F in the Data Sheet.

    (a) Objective 1: Strengthening Public Financial Management

Substantial progress has been achieved in increasing the transparency and accountability of public
financial resources. reflecting the priorities of GoSTP. The 2008 Budget was prepared before the
fiscal year started facilitating budget implementation. Also, quarterly budget monitoring reports
have been prepared, helping the authorities monitor budget execution. Pro-poor expenditures in
the 2009 Budget were 66 percent above the amount included in the 2008 Budget, in line with
PRSP priorities. A Decree with the proposed new functions of the Budget Directorate has been
approved, moving forward the reform toward decentralization of budget execution. Draft
legislation and procedures to prepare/monitor cash plans, including manuals for Treasury
operations are being implemented, but they have not been formally approved. In addition, no
reports on the financial position of SOEs have been prepared so far.

Transparency in procurement processes has been strengthened. New procurement legislation was
approved and training provided in the area of procurement to all ministries' procurement officers.
A Procurement Supervisory Body has been staffed and is operational. As a result of these
improvements, 93 percent of public contracts above US$60,000 now follow competitive bidding
procedures. Yet, it is worth mentioning that during program supervision it was found that
procurement problems arose because of insufficient competition and presentation of bids due to
their low value, which has not been sufficient to attract international suppliers. This problem is
common in small island countries and deserves further analysis.

There has been some progress in improving the management of government accounts and assets
but not all program targets were met. Importantly, the public accounts of the State are not
produced for STP. The non existence of public accounts means that an external audit cannot be
conducted by the court of accounts. This is an important weakness because limits public sector
accountability, implying that the STP population does not have adequate information about how
public resources are used. In addition, this lack of information inhibits direct budget support by
many other donors because these donors require the public accounts to be audited. To a large
extent the lack of public accounts of the State has resulted from the technical complexities of
developing and making operational the SAFE-e system.1 An inventory of public assets by a
consulting firm is underway and needs to be completed as it is an important step in designing a
more effective public management system by enabling the centralization of government assets
into a single database run by Directorate of Assets Management.

The mechanism for domestic revenue mobilization has been strengthened. Important legislation
has been adopted. A new corporate tax law and income tax law were adopted in 2009 with a rate
on profits of 25 percent in line with regional levels and progressive income tax rates in place
covering all sources of income, respectively. A new urban tax was also adopted with updated
property tax values to increase tax collection although lack of urban cadastre has limited its
implementation. Another important limitation is that a Tax Tribunal in line with the General Tax

 However, it is important to note that there are also several other activities that need to be carried out in
order to prepare the public accounts (i.e. opening of the accounts, selection of the accounting standards, and
building up capacity).

Code and the Tax Procedural Code approved in 2007 is not operational. This limits the capacity
of the government to resolve tax disputes and seize unpaid taxes.

With regards to the program target concerning the development of a plan to merge personnel
records database in the MoPF and the Ministry of Public Administration was not formally
adopted. Yet, a de facto action plan exists in this area, as the SAFE-e will have be a personnel
module linked to the budget that will effectively merge the two databases and provide the
necessary personnel information required. The GoSTP is taking steps toward achieving the
objective of merging the payroll and personnel databases through the SAFE-e system, which will
include a personnel module linked to the budget.

Objective 2: Strengthening Governance in the Petroleum Sector

Good progress has been achieved in enhancing petroleum related transparency. STP has
developed the required legislation and institutions to exploit its JDZ, and is finalizing a Petroleum
Environmental Law with the support of Norway. Importantly, a Handbook of the Oil
Management Law has been published and a Petroleum Sector Development Strategy adopted.
Despite government commitment to implement the EITI, it has not been possible to set up the
EITI institutions in the JDZ due to coordination difficulties with Nigeria. With reference to the
petroleum related PDO, EITI depended on a joint meeting of the STP-Nigeria Committee that


                                                 13
apparently was not an urgent priority for Nigeria. As a result STP was delisted from the EITI
although the authorities have shown their commitment to deepen transparency measures and re-
apply to the EITI as soon as the EITI institutions in the JDZ are made created.

STP efforts to improve transparency in the petroleum sector have also allowed STP to initiate in
March 2010 the license round of seven blocks in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) following
an international competitive bidding process and qualified petroleum companies have expressed
interest in the EEZ bidding.

Objective 3: Preparation of a New PRSP

The Council of Ministers created a Technical Committee in charge of preparing a new PRSP,
formed by the Directorate of Planning and the PRSP Unit (Observatorio da Pobreça) among
others. Preparation of the new PRSP is however delayed as a critical household survey that
updates the poverty profile has not been finalized yet due to limited capacity and lack of
resources. The authorities, however, has shown their commitment to preparing a new PRSP by
partially funding such a household survey with domestic resources to accelerate PRSP
preparation although additional resources will be needed.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Moderately Satisfactory.

Key indicators were largely met for a majority of outcomes as indicated above, particularly in
procurement, budget preparation and monitoring, and strengthening of the tax base. Systems
introduced have become operational. Work on the new PRSP has begun but key next steps will
need to take place for the PRSP to be completed. Despite being delisted from the EITI,
petroleum-related transparency has improved as reflected by the interest demonstrated by
qualified oil companies in participating in EEZ competitive bidding. Although these are areas that
have strongly strengthened the reform process, preparation of public accounts remains a key
priority in the reform agenda. The lack of public accounts negatively affects transparency and
accountability of public financial resources. In addition, inadequate payroll management systems
hinder effect civil service management and penalize public sector efficiency. All in all,
substantial progress has been made, with five out of the eight targets met and progress on the
remaining three that in some cases were beyond the control of the authorities. Once all these
factors considered, the overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

PNRMD is likely to have a positive impact on STP's population in terms of poverty reduction,
gender aspects, and social development. Domestic resource mobilization has been strengthened,
providing critical resources for implementing the PRSP. Improvements in PFM will serve to raise
the efficiency of public expenditure, for instance, by quantifying the amounts of and identifying
the destination of poverty and social development related expenditures. All of these
improvements have strengthened GoSTP's capacity to support social, gender related, and poverty
reduction programs through the public budget.




                                               14
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional change and strengthening impact of the reform measures supported by the
PNRMD program has been significant. The PNRMD program supported key reforms to improve
PFM framework and systems. Institutions have been created which have become operational and
have strengthened governance. Capacity has been built in identifying poverty expenditures in the
budget. The tax collection system has been strengthened. Public procurement has become more
transparent. Management of government accounts and assets is gradually being improved. The
systems for a more transparent and efficient utilization of future petroleum resources have been
put in place.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

Not applicable. There were no unintended outcomes and impacts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Negligible to Low.

Given the high level of commitment of all political parties around the reforms supported by the
project (notably PFM reforms), and the continuous support from the Bank, the assessment of the
risk to the development outcome is Negligible to Low, reflecting the likely probability that the
objectives will be achieved and sustained in the medium term.

Some factors could weaken the pace of reforms, but not the sustainability of the development
outcome. For instance, a prolonged international recession or a recurrence of rising oil and food
prices could weaken STP's economy, increase inflationary pressures, affect fiscal performance,
and reverse gains in the social areas and in reducing poverty. Other external shocks could also
affect the recently elected administration's ability to ensure rapid approval of critical legislation
required to underpin the reform process. Yet, with regards to the PNRMD objectives, the
Government of STP is committed to consolidate the reform program in PFM and the transparency
efforts in the petroleum sector, as well as to accelerate preparation of the new PRSP. This
government initiative will be complemented with efforts to continue implementation of the IMF
ECF program to ensure macroeconomic stability.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Moderately Satisfactory.

Preparation of the PNRMD program and its supplemental financing was moderately satisfactory.
The reform was guided by the parallel GCBTA project and reflected key critical areas for STP's
development. The peer reviewers' comments and guidance proved to be instrumental in focusing
the operation. Consultations with the IMF, Portugal, and MCC were useful in ensuring quality at
entry. Bank missions coincided with IMF missions and coordination was highly effective, notably
during the preparation of the supplemental financing that require timely macroeconomic
assessments. Notwithstanding overall efforts in ensuring quality at entry, limited attention was
given to preparing an institutional capacity assessment, which would have probably identified


                                                 15
critical constraints to implement the PNRMD operation (notably the SAFE-e system and
coordination with Nigeria with regards to the EITI).

(b) Quality of Supervision

Satisfactory.

Supervision of the PNRMD and its supplemental financing was moderately satisfactory. The task
team leader (TTL) for the PNRMD and its Supplemental Financing was also responsible for
supervising the GCBTA project, thus facilitating cross-fertilization between the two operations.
Project supervision included several missions as reflected in the ISR prepared. A close level of
supervision of the PNRMD implementation was instrumental to overcome technical difficulties in
communicating with counterparts in STP. Aide-memoires and program implementation matrices
were prepared and discussed with the counterpart team, stating clearly specified areas of
weaknesses and recommendations to overcome them. The TTL ensured that the reform had the
sufficient technical and financial resources for implementing the program. Other Bank units also
provided adequate support when required, particularly in the areas of public finance management,
procurement, and petroleum.

It is important to note that a close level of supervision was only possible by sharing supervision
cost between the PNRMD program and the GCBTA project. The PNRMD program proved to be
a high cost operation for a number of reasons. First, there is no country office in STP and
therefore daily supervision is not possible. Second, telecommunications in STP are very poor and
it is difficult to reach the country by phone or e-mail. Third, air transportation is limited and its
costly. Fourth, the authorities have limited experience in implementing budget support operations.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Moderately Satisfactory.

The Borrower was fully committed to the operation. The GoSTP saw the operation as providing
an opportunity to promote country-owned reforms strongly supported by the administration. The
PIU Coordinator for GCBTA was also appointed as PNRMD Coordinator. Key senior GoSTP
officials were fully on board, including the Minister of Planning and Finance and the Director of
the National Petroleum Agency. The TTL established a good working relationship with its
counterparts, which permitted the supervisory work to be undertaken under an environment of
mutual trust. Notwithstanding the GoSTP commitment to the reform program, PNRMD
implementation was delayed because the GoSTP partially had to divert its attention away from
the operation to address pressing issues arising from the increasing fuel and food prices, as well
as the impact of the global recession. As a result, the operation's closing date was extended twice.
The second extension of the closing date of the project from December 2009 to June 2010 was
granted to provide STP's National Assembly enough time to ratify the Supplemental Financing
Grant Agreement.

6. Lessons Learned

    1. Parallel investment projects can help DPLs if adequately coordinated. Fragile
       economies beset by weak institutions and persistent poverty such as STP require long
       term technical and financial external support and the Bank should ensure such an
       assistance continues. A parallel capacity building technical assistance project has
       contributed to ensure that the PNRMD objectives were achieved.


                                                 16
2. Operations in fragile states should incorporate an adequate M&E system with
   realistic outcome indicators and a reduced number of intermediate indicators. To
   develop an adequate M&E system for DPL operations in countries with fragile
   institutions and weak or non-existent PFM systems, the task team would need to identify
   critical capacity constraints (e.g. by preparing an institutional capacity assessment during
   DPL preparation). After indentifying such capacity constraints, effective use of M&E
   systems should be based on relevant, precise, quantifiable to the extent possible, and easy
   to monitor indicators and program goals that help track information from all government
   agencies/ministries. M&E should become part of a Borrower's everyday duties and
   responsibilities in the economic management area.

3. Do not underestimate technical complexities. Introducing sophisticated software in a
   low capacity country is a highly complex and time consuming activity. Therefore, Bank
   operations should take this into account when developing a policy matrix of
   conditionalities.

4. Need to provide adequate supervision funding. Adequate supervision of the PNRMD
   operation was made possible because of the availability of resources for supervising both
   PNRMD and GCBTA operations. Countries with low institutional capacity such as STP
   require additional supervision funding. If such funding is not made available, DPL
   operations may encounter serious implementation problems.

5. Strengthen donor coordination. Future DPLs on fragile states would benefit from
   having a formal donor coordination mechanism that ensures adequate program and
   project coordination and implementation. Such a donor coordination mechanism would
   also act as a conduit for the pledging of donor contributions in support of the agenda,
   reducing transaction costs for already overstretch the authorities. Stronger donor
   coordination is expected to foster exchange of information around the government
   strategy, creating guiding principles that support (rather than substitute for or duplicate
   the functions of) Government ministries and agencies. Periodic donor reviews should
   ensure that donor financed projects are implemented on a timely basis.

Overview

IDA grants in the amount of US$8 million to Sao Tomé and Príncipe were approved to help
implement the Government's economic reform program for 2008-2009 that was based on Sao
Tomé and Príncipe's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP). The Public and Natural Resource
Management Development (PNRMD) operation supported policy measures aimed principally at
improving the accountability, effectiveness and level of public resources and at strengthening
governance in the oil sector. It also supported the authorities' efforts to initiate the preparation of
a new PRSP based on in-depth analysis of growth diversification options. This operation
supported the implementation of two pillars of the PRSP: strengthening public financial
management and governance and transparency in government operations.

Context

Program implementation took place in a difficult political and economic environment. Coalition
arrangements led to frequent changes of government and delays in the implementation of the
development agenda. Also, during program implementation, São Tomé and Príncipe was struck
by two external shocks. The first one originated from a sharp rise in international oil and food
prices in mid-2008 and the second one was brought about by an international financial crisis that
emerged unexpectedly and a major world recession that ensued. Both external shocks took a
significant toll on the country, with economic growth and poverty reduction becoming hostages
from the impact of both shocks. Mobilization of external assistance and foreign direct investment
were lower than expected, which further reduced economic growth. Under these conditions, it
was extremely difficult for the Government to close its fiscal gap and maintain a viable
macroeconomic framework. In this sense, the provision of the US$2 million Supplemental
Financing to the PNRMD and the extension of the closing date of the grant were essential for
maintaining macroeconomic and political stability and the course of reforms.

Program Implementation

The preparation and implementation of the operation was consistent with the Government's
development priorities and corporate goals, and responded to the Government's request for
assistance in critical areas for São Tomé and Príncipe's development. Priorities were defined to
address the most pressing public finance management issues, as well as governance requirements
in the petroleum sector. These priorities were somewhat ambitious given a low institutional
capacity and the limited time frame required achieving them. The design was closely linked to
and supported by the Government Capacity Building Technical Assistance (GCBTA) operation's
agenda. Effective consultations were held with key stakeholders and included meetings with
country and local officials, legislators, civil society, and the private sector. Workshops were held
with government officials to discuss the policy matrix and Grant Agreement, which were
translated into Portuguese and discussed in that language.



                                                  19
We have reviewed the draft implementation Completion Report prepared by the World Bank and
we agree with the assessment made. One key constraint to program implementation continues to
be our limited existing capacity resulting from weak financial management systems in place, and
dearth of qualified staff. A key factor to overcoming these constraints and achieving most of the
program's objectives was the complementary Bank assistance through the above-mentioned
GCBTA.

Results

All ten prior actions supported by the PNRMD and its Supplemental Financing were met. To
strengthen public finance management and improve governance in the petroleum sector the
Government implemented the following actions:

    ·   Council of Ministers issued decree number 9/2008 on April 30, 2008, published in Diário
        da República number 21 on May 7, 2008 authorizing the Poverty Observatory
        (Observatorio da Pobreza) to develop a new PRSP.
     · Council of Ministers has presented the 2008 Budget to the National Assembly in
        compliance with article 23 of the Organic Law for Public Finance (SAFE Law 3/2007).
     · Council of Ministers issued decree number 10/2008 on April 30, 2008, published in
        Diário da República number 21 on May 7, 2008 that specifies all budget codes that
        correspond to PRSP priorities in social sectors.
     · Ministry of Planning and Finance used in the 2008 Budget submitted to the National
        Assembly the new budget codes approved in 2007, which allow tracking of revenues and
        expenditures by functions of the State.
     · Council of Ministers issued decree 21/2007 on May 24, 2007, published in the Diário da
        República number 43 on September 7, 2007 establishing an accounting system for public
        accounts.
     · Council of Ministers issued decree number 8/2008 on April 30, 2008 creating a Public
        Accounting Department in the Ministry of Planning and Finance with appropriate budget
        and personnel allocations and decree number 7/2008 on April 30, 2008, creating an
        Information Technology Department in the Ministry of Planning and Finance with
        appropriated budget and personnel allocations.
     · Ministry of Planning and Finance presented to the National Assembly a bill of law
        creating a new corporate tax code as a first step toward final approval.
     · Ministry of Planning and Finance presented to the National Assembly a bill of law
        creating a new personal income tax code as a first step toward final approval.
     · The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment's resolution number 11/2008 on
        April 23, 2008 adopted the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) National
        Committee's detailed roadmap for the implementation of the EITI.
     · Petroleum sector governance:
a.      Council of Ministers has issued decree 11/2008 approving the model contract for
production sharing setting forth international standards of transparency and competition.
b. Council of Ministers has submitted to the National Assembly a National Petroleum sector bill
of law setting forth international standards of transparency and competition.

Other Reforms

The program has been supportive of the Government's reform program. The Government remains
committed to the reform agenda and will continue to ensure that all of the program objectives are
achieved.


                                               20
Reporting on budget preparation and execution has improved considerably reflecting the
priorities of the Government and of its enhanced institutions. The 2008 Budget was prepared
before the fiscal year started. Quarterly budget monitoring reports are being prepared. Pro-poor
expenditures in the 2009 Budget were 66 percent above the amount included in the 2008 Budget.
A draft Decree with the proposed new functions of the Budget Directorate has been approved.
The software for the budgetary programming of investment is part of SAFE-e and will await the
operationalization of that system for its introduction.

Transparency in procurement processes has been strengthened. New procurement legislation was
approved and training provided in the area of procurement for all ministries' procurement
officers. A Procurement Supervisory Body has been staffed and is operational and has reported
that 93 percent of public contracts above US$60,000 follow competitive bidding procedures.

Transparency and accountability of public financial resources is being achieved. Draft legislation
and procedures to prepare/monitor cash plans, including manuals for Treasury operations are
being implemented, although they will need to be formally approved. A report is being produced
quarterly on budget execution. The next step in the reform agenda is to produce reports on the
financial position of SOEs that we will expect to be produced in 2011.

Delays in the preparation of the public accounts have resulted from the technical complexities of
developing and making operational the SAFE-e system, which is now operational and will
facilitate the preparation of the 2011 public accounts of the State.

An inventory of public assets by a consulting firm has been underway and is in the process of
being completed. Its adoption will enable the centralization of government assets into a single
database run by the Department of Asset Management.

Payroll management is gradually improving. A de facto action plan to merge the payroll and
personnel databases in order to reconcile, update, and merge different personnel records databases
or the headcount of government employees is in place and is being implemented. The
Government is taking steps toward achieving the objective of merging the payroll and personnel
databases through the SAFE-e system, which will include a personnel module linked to the
budget, once it is completed.

The mechanism for domestic revenue mobilization has been strengthened. New corporate tax law
and income tax law were adopted with a rate on profits of 25 percent in line with regional levels
and progressive income tax rates in place covering all sources of income, respectively. A new
urban tax was also adopted. The next step in this process envisaged by the Government is the
creation of a Tax Tribunal in line with the tax reform approved in 2007 which will require of
close collaboration with the Ministry of Justice

Petroleum related transparency is being enhanced and a Handbook of the Oil Management Law
has been published and a Petroleum Sector Development Strategy adopted. The joint STP-Nigeria
EITI Committee could not be formed, reflecting the complexity to make operational the EITI
requirements in a joint international organization that must report to two States. Nonetheless
being delisted from the EITI in February 2010, we remain committed to the initiative and will
continue our efforts to re-apply as soon as conditions are met. Also, we have initiated an open
and transparent bidding process of seven blocks in our Exclusive Economic Zone in March 2010
and qualified petroleum companies have expressed interest in EEZ bidding.



                                               21
The new PRSP document is being prepared based on a domestic-led growth strategy and is
intended to become results-oriented. Preparation of the New Development Strategy is being led
by the Planning Directorate with a Technical Committee formed by the PRSP Coordinating
Office.

Program Supervision

Bank supervision of the Bank-financed operation has been appropriate. The task team leader
responsible for supervising GCBTA was also in charge of supervising the PNRMD grant and its
supplement, which contributed to successful program supervision. The Bank team visited the
country three times and assisted the supervision unit in helping deliver the reform program. Aide-
memoires and matrices were issued and discussed in close consultation with the supervision unit.
These included clearly specified areas of weakness and attention, and made an effective use of the
supervision reports prepared for the GCBTA project. The Bank team also ensured through the
GCBTA project that the counterpart team had the sufficient technical and financial resources for
implementing the program.

Bank missions coincided with IMF missions and coordination was highly effective.
The project unit in charge of monitoring the GCBTA was also in charge of monitoring the
PNRMD.

        Avaliação do DPL (Empréstimo para Políticas de Desenvolvimento) e Comentários
       sobre o Relatório Preliminar sobre Conclusão de Implementação e Resultados (ICR)

Síntese
As doações da AID a S. Tomé e Príncipe, no montante de USD 8 milhões foram aprovadas com o
fim de ajudar a implementar o programa de reformas económicas do Governo para 2008-2009,
que tinha por base a Estratégia de Redução da Pobreza de S. Tomé e Príncipe (ENRP). A
operação de Desenvolvimento de Gestão dos Recursos Públicos e Naturais (PNRMD) apoiou
medidas políticas destinadas principalmente a melhorar a responsabilização, eficácia e nível de
recursos públicos e a reforçar a governação no sector do petróleo. Apoiou também os esforços das
autoridades no sentido de dar início à preparação de uma nova ENRP com base numa análise
aprofundada de opções de diversificação para o crescimento. Esta operação apoiava a
implementação de dois pilares da ENRP: o reforço da gestão financeira pública e da governação,
e a transparência nas operações do governo.

Contexto

A implementação do programa decorreu num clima político e económico difícil. A rotura dos
acordos de coligação establecidos resultaram em frequentes mudanças de governo e a atrasos na
implementação do programa. Acresce ainda que, durante a implementação do programa, São
Tomé e Príncipe foi atingido por dois choques exógenos. O primeiro, em meados de 2008, teve
origem numa acentuada subida dos preços internacionais do petróleo e dos alimentos e o segundo
foi provocado por uma crise financeira internacional que surgiu inesperadamente e uma recessão
mundial de grandes dimensões. Ambos estes choques externos tiveram significativo impacto no
país, tornando o crescimento económico e a redução da pobreza reféns do impacto de ambos. A
mobilização da ajuda externa e do investimento directo estrangeiro foram abaixo em relação do
esperado, o que reduziu ainda mais o crescimento económico. Nestas condições, foi
extremamente difícil ao Governo reduzir o défice fiscal e manter um quadro macroeconómico
viável. Neste aspecto, a concessão de um Suplemento ao Financiamento do PNRMD no montante
de USD 2 milhões, e o prolongamento da data de fecho da doação, foram essenciais para a
manutenção da estabilidade macroeconómica e política e a continuidade das reformas.


Implementação do Programa

A preparação e a implementação da operação estiveram em linha com as prioridades de
desenvolvimento do Governo e com os objectivos corporativos, dando resposta ao pedido de
apoio do Governo em certas áreas de importância crítica para o desenvolvimento de São Tomé e
Príncipe. Foram definidas prioridades para atender à questões mais prementes da gestão das
finanças públicas, bem como à necessidades de governação no sector do petróleo. Estas
prioridades eram algo ambiciosas, dada a reduzida capacidade institucional e o limitado
enquadramento temporal para as alcançar. A concepção foi estreitamente ligada e apoiada pelo
projecto de Assistência Técnica para o reforço da Capacidade de Governação (PATRCG). Foram
realizadas consultas aos principais intervenientes interessados, incluindo reuniões com
funcionários a nível nacional e local, legisladores, sociedade civil e o sector privado. Foram
organizados workshops com elementos do governo, para debater a matriz das políticas e o Acordo
de Doação, os quais foram traduzidos para português e analisados neste idioma.

Analisámos o Relatório de Conclusão preliminar relativo à implementação, elaborado pelo Banco
Mundial e concordamos com a avaliação apresentada. Uma das principais dificuldades para a


                                              23
implementação do programa continua a ser a nossa actual limitação de capacidade, resultante dos
débeis sistemas de gestão financeira aqui existentes, e a escassez de pessoal qualificado. Um
factor importante para ultrapassar estes constrangimentos e alcançar a maioria dos objectivos do
programa, foi o apoio complementar do Banco, através do já referido PATRCG.


Resultados

Todas as dez acções prévias apoiadas pelo PNRMD e o seu Financiamento Suplementar foram
cumpridas.Para reforçar a gestão financeira pública e melhorar a governação no sector do
petróleo, o Governo implementou as seguintes acções:

   ·   O Conselho de Ministros emitiu o decreto número 9/2008 de 30 de Abril de 2008,
       publicado no Diário da República número 21 de 7 de Maio de 2008, autorizando o
       Observatório da Pobreza a desenvolver uma nova ENRP.
   ·   O Conselho de Ministros apresentou o Orçamento para 2008 à Assembleia Nacional em
       conformidade com o artigo 23 da Lei Orgânica das Finanças Públicas (Lei SAFE
       3/2007).
   ·   O Conselho de Ministros emitiu o decreto número 10/2008 de 30 de Abril de 2008,
       publicado no Diário da República número 21 de 7 de Maio de 2008 que estabelece todos
       os códigos orçamentais que correspondem a prioridades da ENRP nos sectores sociais.
   ·   O Ministério do Plano e Finanças utilizou, no Orçamento para 2008 apresentado à
       Assembleia Nacional, os novos códigos do orçamento aprovados em 2007, que permitem
       o acompanhamento de receitas e despesas por funções do Estado.
   ·   O Conselho de Ministros emitiu o decreto número 21/2007 de 24 de Maio de 2007,
       publicado no Diário da República número 43 de 7 de Setembro de 2007, estabelecendo
       um sistema de contabilidade para as contas públicas.
   ·   O Conselho de Ministros publicou o decreto número 8/2008 em 30 de Abril de 2008,
       criando uma Direcção da Contabilidade Pública no Ministério do Plano e Finanças, com
       dotações apropriadas de orçamento e pessoal e o decreto número 7/2008 de 30 de Abril
       de 2008, criando a Direcção de Tecnologia de Informação no Ministério do Plano e
       Finanças, com dotações apropriadas de orçamento e pessoal.
   ·   O Ministério do Plano e Finanças apresentou à Assembleia Nacional uma proposta de lei
       criando um novo código de taxas corporativas, como primeiro passo no sentido de uma
       aprovação final.
   ·   O Ministério do Plano e Finanças apresentou à Assembleia Nacional uma proposta de lei
       criando um novo código de imposto sobre rendimento singular, como primeiro passo no
       sentido de uma aprovação final.

       Naturais e Ambiente adoptou o plano detalhado do Comité Nacional da Iniciativa de
       Transparência nas Indústrias Extractivas (EITI), para a implementação da EITI.




                                              24
    ·   Governação do sector do petróleo:
            a. O Conselho de Ministros publicou o decreto 11/2008 aprovando o Modelo de
            Contrato de Partilha e Produção, estabelecendo padrões internacionais de
            transparência e concorrência.
            b. O Conselho de Ministros submeteu à Assembleia Nacional uma proposta de lei
            estabelecendo padrões internacionais de transparência e concorrência.


Outras Reformas

O programa vem apoiar o programa de reformas do Governo, o qual se mantém empenhado na
sua agenda de reformas e continuará a providenciar para que sejam cumpridos todos os objectivos
do programa.

A elaboração de relatórios sobre a preparação do orçamento tem melhorado consideravelmente,
reflectindo as prioridades do Governo e das suas instituições melhoradas. O Orçamento para 2008
foi elaborado antes do início do ano fiscal. Estão a ser feitos relatórios trimestrais de
monitorização. As despesas pró-pobres no Orçamento de 2009 contemplaram uma verba 66 por
cento acima do montante do Orçamento de 2008. Foi aprovada uma proposta de Decreto com as
novas funções que se pretende atribuir à Direcção do Orçamento. O software para a programação
orçamental do investimento está incluído no SAFE-e e aguarda a operacionalização desse sistema
para ser introduzido.

A transparência nos processos de aquisições (procurement) foi reforçada. Foi aprovada nova
legislação e dada formação na área das aquisições à todos os elementos deste sector nos
Ministérios. Uma Agência para a Supervisão de Aquisições foi criada e dotada de pessoal, está já
operacional e relatou já que 93 por cento dos contratos públicos de valor superior a USD 60.000
cumprem os procedimentos de licitação competitiva.

A transparência e a responsabilização de recursos financeiros públicos estão a ser alcançadas.
Estão a ser implementados legislação e procedimentos provisórios para preparar/monitorizar
planos de tesouraria, incluindo manuais para operações do Tesouro, embora tenham ainda de ser
formalmente aprovados. Está a ser produzido um relatório trimestral sobre a execução do
orçamento. O passo seguinte, na agenda de reformas, é a elaboração de relatórios sobre a posição
financeira das Empresas Públicas, que deverão começar a ser apresentados em 2011.

Os atrasos na preparação das contas públicas têm resultado das complexidades técnicas de
desenvolver e operacionalizar o sistema SAFE-e, que irá facilitar a elaboração das contas do
Estado para 2011.

Tem estado a ser preparado, por uma empresa de consultoria, um inventário de activos públicos, o
qual está agora na fase final. A sua adopção permitirá a centralização dos activos do Estado numa
única base de dados, que será gerida pelo Direcção de Património do Estado.

A gestão de salários está gradualmente a melhorar. Foi criado um plano concreto de acção para
fazer a fusão das bases de dados dos salários e do pessoal, de forma a reconciliar, actualizar e
integrar as diferentes bases de dados de registo de pessoal e a quantificação dos funcionários do
governo, e este plano está a ser implementado. O Governo está a tomar medidas no sentido de




                                               25
concretizar o objectivo de integrar as bases de dados dos salários e do pessoal através do sistema
SAFE-e, o qual incluirá, uma vez completado, um módulo de pessoal.

O mecanismo para a mobilização da receita doméstica foi reforçado. As novas leis do imposto
sobre pessoas colectivas e imposto sobre rendimentos foram adoptadas, com uma taxa sobre os
lucros de 25 por cento, o que está em linha com os níveis regionais, e a instituição de taxas
progressivas sobre os rendimentos, abrangendo todas as fontes de rendimento. Foi também
adoptada uma nova taxa urbana. Uma outra medida deste processo que está a ser contemplada
pelo Governo, é a criação de um Tribunal Fiscal, em consonância com a reforma fiscal aprovada
em 2007, que necessitará de uma estreita colaboração com o Ministério da Justiça.

A transparência relacionada com o petróleo está a ser incrementada graças à publicação de um
Manual da Lei de Gestão do Petróleo e a adopção de uma Estratégia de Desenvolvimento do
Sector do Petróleo. O Comité conjunto da EITI STP-Nigéria não pôde ser constituído, o que
revela a complexidade de operacionalizar os requisitos EITI numa organização conjunta
internacional que tem de reportar à dois Estados. No entanto, embora retirados da lista da EITI
em Fevereiro 2010, continuamos empenhados na iniciativa e continuaremos os nossos esforços
para nos recandidatarmos assim que possamos cumprir as condições. Abrimos também um
processo aberto e transparente de licitação de sete blocos na nossa Zona Económica Exclusiva em
Março 2010 e várias empresas petrolíferas qualificadas manifestaram o seu interesse em
participar na licitação na ZEE.

O novo documento ENRP está a ser preparado com base numa estratégia de crescimento
desenvolvida internamente e pretende ser orientada pelos resultados. A preparação da Nova
Estratégia de Desenvolvimento está a ser conduzida pela Direcção do Plano, com um Comité
Técnico formado pelo Gabinete de Coordenação da ENRP

Supervisão do Programa

A supervisão pelo Banco desta operação que o Banco financiou tem sido adequada. O líder da
equipa de trabalho responsável pela supervisão do PATRCG tinha também a cargo, a supervisão
da doação do PNRMD e do seu suplemento, o que contribuiu para o sucesso da supervisão do
programa. Aide-memoires e matrizes foram distribuídas e discutidas em estreita consulta com a
unidade de supervisão. Essas consultas incluíram áreas claramente especificadas de fraqueza e
que requererem atenção e fizeram uso eficaz dos relatórios de supervisão preparados para o
projecto PATRCG. A equipa do Banco providenciou também para que, através do projecto
PATRCG, a sua congénere dispusesse de recursos técnicos e financeiros suficientes para
implementar o programa.

As missões do Banco coincidiram com missões do FMI e a coordenação foi extremamente eficaz.
A UIP encarregada de formar o PATRCG foi também responsável pela monitorização do
PNRMD.
