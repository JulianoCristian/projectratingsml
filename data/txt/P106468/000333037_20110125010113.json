Development\n            Policy Grant Project for Sao Tome and Principe were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was negligible or low, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: introducing sophisticated software in a\n            low capacity country is a highly complex and time consuming\n            activity. Therefore, Bank operations should take this into\n            account when developing a policy matrix of conditionalities.\n            Future Development Policy Loans (DPLs) on fragile states\n            would benefit from having a formal donor coordination\n            mechanism that ensures adequate program and project\n            coordination and implementation. Such a donor coordination\n            mechanism will also act as a conduit for the pledging of\n            donor contributions in support of the agenda, reducing\n            transaction costs for already overstretch the authorities.\n            Stronger donor coordination is expected to foster exchange\n            of information around the government strategy, creating\n            guiding principles that support (rather than substitute for\n            or duplicate the functions of) Government ministries and\n            agencies. Periodic donor reviews should ensure that donor\n            financed projects are implemented on a timely basis."}, "docdt": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
