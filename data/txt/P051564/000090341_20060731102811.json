Lessons learned from the project:\n            When planning a private transaction in a risky country,\n            establishing at the onset an adequate fall-back option might\n            prove critical to ensure overall continuity in approach. The\n            project design should be tailored to the specific local\n            prevailing circumstances. Project teams should be allowed\n            and encouraged to think outside of the box and support\n            innovative ways of designing and implementing projects in\n            West Bank and Gaza. Where a project restructuring is\n            justified by a change in the operating environment, the\n            restructuring should be formal. Co-financing of Bank\n            operations from other donors should be minimized when the\n            possibility of cancellation of a large portion would\n            jeopardize project outcomes."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
