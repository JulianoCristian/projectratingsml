Operation Type           Single Tranche Development Policy Loan


Main Policy Areas        Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Climate Change



Key Outcome              Reduce energy intensity by implementing energy efficiency
Indicators               (EE) measures through: (i) reduced energy consumption in
                         the supply side by increasing the share of cogeneration in
                         power supply; (ii) acceleration of supply and demand-side EE
                         measures by supporting the implementation of a smart
                         metering program; and (iii) decreased energy consumption in
                         the transport sector.

                         Limit the growth in emissions: increased use of Renewable
                         Energy (RE) in the country’s final energy consumption.

Program Development      The program development objective of the proposed operation
Objective and            is to support the Government’s program to: (i) decrease actual
Contribution to CPS      final energy consumption by 9% by 2016 and reach a 20%
                         reduction target by 2020 compared to business as usual; and
                         (ii) increase the share of renewable energy in final energy
                         consumption to 15.0% by 2020. These targets are part of
                         Poland’s commitment towards the EU in the context of the
                         latter’s energy and climate change package. Against the
                         backdrop of tight fiscal constraints and the need to maintain
                         economic growth and alleviate poverty, energy efficiency
                         measures have been identified as the highest priority and least
                         cost way to decrease airborne emissions. Because of its large
                         energy savings potential, the buildings sector will be the
                         primary focus of measures to reduce energy use. Biomass and
                         wind power are expected to be the main sources of new
                         renewable energy through 2020.

                                               i
                 The proposed DPL fits within the framework outlined in the
                 CPS, which states that the strategic partnership with Poland is
                 based on four pillars, of which Regional and Global Public
                 Goods is one. The proposed energy efficiency and renewable
                 energy DPL will be an anchor for the dialogue between the
                 Bank and the Polish authorities in this respect.
Risks and Risk   Three key types of risks to delivering the DPL Program’s
Mitigation       results are identified:

                 Economic Risks. A worsening in the external environment
                 could slow down growth in Poland, and possibly delay the
                 ambitious fiscal consolidation. The reduction of the general
                 government deficit from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.9
                 percent of GDP in 2012 in line with the latest Convergence program
                 update reflects fiscal measures undertaken by the Government,
                 as well as the cyclical improvements of the economic
                 conditions and the tax base. The main fiscal measures were
                 adopted as part of the 2011 budget, with the exception of the
                 reduction in transfers to private pension funds and the new rule
                 to limit local government borrowing.

                 Political and Institutional Risks. Approaching general
                 elections to Parliament in late 2011 may temporarily delay the
                 adoption of bold structural reforms, including those to
                 facilitate private investment in EE and RE. The program is
                 ambitious and faces some implementation risks: (i) the White
                 Certificates Scheme is relatively complex when compared to
                 schemes in other EU countries, (ii) difficulties in addressing
                 legal, regulatory, and financing barriers may arise if there is a
                 lack of inter-ministerial coordination and given limited
                 institutional capacity and resource constraints. Parties include
                 the Ministries of Economy, Environment, and Infrastructure,
                 the Energy Regulator, regional and municipal Governments,
                 and other public entities such as the National Fund for
                 Environmental Protection. The main political risk is partially
                 mitigated by the Government’s strong and broad-based
                 ownership of its EE and RE program as demonstrated by the
                 adoption of the Energy Strategy Until 2030 and the Energy
                 Efficiency Law. In addition, Poland has committed itself
                 towards the EU to meet its agreed 2020 national energy
                 efficiency and renewable energy targets and has to report to
                 the European Commission at regular intervals on progress
                 made in the implementation of its national action plans in
                 those two areas.         Mitigating measures to address the
                 institutional risks include establishing an inter-ministerial team
                 to monitor implementation of the Government’s energy policy
                 and associated specific multilateral working groups, increased
                 engagement by the Bank in policy dialogue and provision by
                                     ii
               the Bank of advisory services on best practices in other EU
               countries. The Government and the Energy Regulator have
               also designed an implementation strategy by which White
               Certificates would be gradually introduced. The Government
               has drawn on experience in other EU countries and is
               committed to closely monitor implementation of its energy
               strategy.

               Social and Environmental Risks. Social tensions and
               declining support to the Government’s Energy Efficiency
               program resulting from increases in energy prices and from
               high transaction and administrative costs for market
               participants to engage in energy efficiency investments. These
               risks would be mitigated by ongoing public outreach and
               communications campaigns to raise awareness and provide
               transparent information about existing energy efficiency
               programs.

       PROPOSED ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY DPL

                                      I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Poland faces a dilemma: how can harmful emissions be
decreased, while maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with the EU-15
and do this within a constrained fiscal environment. The World Bank (the Bank) worked
closely with the Government during 2009/10 to address this conundrum in preparing the 2011
report entitled “Transition to a Low Emissions Economy in Poland”, analyzing the carbon
abatement potential in Poland and the associated economic impact. The analysis identified
energy efficiency and selected renewable energy investments as the priority near- to medium-
term investments. Although energy efficiency options are low cost, market penetration has
been limited. This DPL supports policy actions that are designed to address market rigidities.
Poland faces a problem in achieving bold renewable energy targets as there is little
hydropower or deep geothermal potential, and solar power is expensive. Biomass
applications have recently shown promise and are, along with wind power and biogas,
expected to be the focus of attention in meeting Poland’s 2020 renewable energy target of
15.0% of final energy consumption from renewable energy sources. To support the
implementation of its renewable energy policy, the Government has established a green
certificates program that obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of renewable
energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies are available from EC funds used to help
decrease renewable energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions.

2.      Improving energy efficiency thus becomes an important component in meeting its
emissions reduction targets. Poland’s specific national targets also represent major
commitments towards the European Union (EU) in the context of the latter’s climate and
energy package (20/20/20 by 2020)1. The Government aims at achieving zero growth in
energy demand over the medium- to long-term to reduce Poland’s energy intensity to the level
of the EU-15 by 2030, while increasing the share of renewable energy. In addition to its
renewable energy target, Poland targets a 20% reduction in energy consumption compared to
business as usual by 2020. The Government has introduced a number of regulatory, market
and quasi-market measures to improve energy efficiency, such as: end-use consumer savings;
increasing power and heat generation efficiency; reducing network losses; introducing
mandatory performance certificates for buildings; improving its building standards;
introducing minimum standards for power-consuming devices; and providing targeted loans
and grants for investment in energy efficiency.




1
 The EU set a series of climate and energy targets to be met by 2020, known as the "20-20-20" targets. These
are: (i) a reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20% below 1990 levels; (ii) 20% of EU energy
consumption to come from renewable resources; and (iii) a 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with
projected levels, to be achieved by improving energy efficiency.



                                                     1
3.      The next steps in achieving improvements in Poland’s energy intensity will be
challenging as its energy intensity has already decreased by more than 50% since 1990.
During the last two decades Poland transformed the structure of its economy by scrapping or
modernizing the capital stock in the industrial sector. Energy supply from electricity and heat
generation dropped from 55 Mtoe in 1990 to 42 Mtoe in 2001 and since then has fluctuated
around this level. In contrast, final energy consumption has remained fairly constant since
1990 even though per capita energy demand, at 2.5 tons of oil equivalent in 2009, was among
the lowest in the EU: 28% below the EU average. However, significant potential for
efficiency gains still remains as Poland’s energy intensity is double that of the EU average2.

4.      The buildings sector is the primary target for energy efficiency gains going
forward, as it is the largest final energy consumption category at 26 Mtoe in 2008 (about
40% of total final demand). Average energy consumption in buildings in Poland is about
240 kWh/m2, which is roughly double that of Denmark. This issue is addressed for new
buildings where the standard is 120 kWh/m2. Building on this, Poland has initiated a study on
the feasibility of moving to “nearly zero energy buildings” with target energy consumption
levels of 30 kWh/m2 by 2020. The transition will be driven by policy reforms already
underway and will continue to evolve, including: (i) removal of market barriers through its
white and building certificates programs; (ii) improved buildings standards; (iii) low cost
financing for the residential sector; (iv) improved metering and control systems; and (v) an
active outreach program. These incentives are expected to support investments that will
improve the efficiency of building envelopes to help the Government meet its energy
efficiency targets.

5.      Addressing the energy efficiency of the existing building stock is more
challenging as the costs to achieve similar targets for such improvements are higher
than for new buildings. The cost of improving the energy efficiency of new buildings is
relatively modest, typically estimated to add roughly 5% to the capital cost as many gains are
met with good construction practices. However, the payback period for energy efficiency
investments in existing buildings can be prohibitively expensive, exceeding a homeowner’s
willingness to pay: the payback period could exceed the time a homeowner expects to stay at
that house. Willingness to pay is also a function of income as it competes with many other
needs.

6.     The transport sector has become the second largest final energy consumer with
24% of final demand. In 2008, for the first time since 1971, Poland’s transport sector, with a
demand of 16 Mtoe, exceeded that of the industrial sector. Given the very rapid annual
growth in energy consumption by the transport sector (95% of which is for road transport) and
a projected decline in energy consumption by the buildings sector, transport is set to exceed
energy demand in the residential sector by 2025.

7.      Poland is at an interesting confluence, having made significant progress already,
thus providing valuable lessons for other countries in transition, while needing to build
on lessons learned from EU-15 countries to deepen its reforms. The proposed Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy DPL is designed as a one-off single tranche operation that


2
 Poland’s energy intensity is about double that of the OECD Europe average in constant 2000 terms and about
20% above EU levels on a Purchasing Power Parity basis.

                                                    2
supports the Government’s broad-based reform program for energy efficiency and renewable
energy. This DPL supports this goal by drawing on lessons learned from EU-15 and other
OECD countries in the design of the policy reform agenda and is expected to continue to
provide important lessons for other Bank client countries.


                              II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

8.      Poland has shown remarkable resilience to the global financial crisis. In the
decade leading up to the crisis, Poland’s increasing integration with Europe had brought about
strong economic expansion and convergence to EU income levels. As the crisis broke out,
this integration made Poland vulnerable to the collapse in regional capital, trade, and labor
flows. Poland’s companies, workers, and households have, however, weathered well the
impact of the global financial crisis.

9.      In 2009, Poland was the only country in the EU to avoid a decline in economic
activity. Poland’s economy grew by 1.7 percent, while the EU declined by 4.2 percent and the
EU10 region by 3.5 percent. The good performance reflects, among other factors, a
diversified and flexible economy, fairly strong macroeconomic balances going into the crisis,
and a timely policy response of the Polish authorities during the crisis. First, Poland’s
relatively large domestic economy has limited its exposure to the decline in world trade.
Second, the flexible exchange rate regime has facilitated the economy’s adjustment to the
external shock. Third, Poland’s banking system has withstood the global financial crisis well,
in part because Poland’s credit expansion was less dramatic than in some other countries in
Eastern and Central Europe. And finally, because Poland entered the crisis with relatively
strong fundamentals, the authorities were able to implement counter-cyclical policies that
have cushioned the impact of the slowdown. They included allowing automatic stabilizers
work on the revenue side, implementing tax cuts, sharply reducing the policy interest rate and
providing facilities for exceptional liquidity support.

10.     The general government deficit doubled to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009 from 3.6
percent of GDP in 2008. About two-thirds of the increase was due to lower revenues.
Poland adopted fiscal recovery measures of about 2 percent of GDP in 2009, which was the
largest stimulus among the EU10 countries. This included the reductions in personal income
tax legislated in 2007 and entering into force in early 2009, and increases in social and
infrastructure expenditures adopted as part of the July 2009 supplementary budget and
supported through accelerated utilization of EU funds. The supplementary budget also
incorporated fiscal savings of about 1.4 percent of GDP through reductions in administrative
spending and increases in dividends from state-owned companies.

11.     Poland remained one of the fastest growing EU countries in 2010. According to
preliminary data, real GDP expanded by 3.8 percent in 2010, the fourth highest rate in the EU.
While growth in 2009 was mainly due to the positive contribution of net exports, growth in
2010 was driven by domestic factors. The GDP contribution was 2.6 percent from
consumption, -0.4 percent from fixed investment, 1.8 percent from inventories and -0.2
percent from net exports. Growing domestic demand was fuelled by rebuilding of stocks and
private consumption, and supported by the overall resilience of the labor market and reviving
                                              3
bank credit expansion to households. Private investment remained weak, reflecting low
capacity utilization, uncertainty about economic developments in the euro area and a severe
and snowy winter, followed by floods and heat waves in summer. The decline in private
investment was largely compensated by a double-digit expansion in public investment, which
constituted about 30 percent of total investment. Public investment was stimulated largely by
EU funds, including preparations for the upcoming European Soccer Championships in 2012,
in addition to the reconstruction in areas affected by the severe floods in the spring. Inflation,
although rising, remained within the limit of the National Bank of Poland’s (NBP) tolerance
ban of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent from September 2009 to January 2011.

12.     The current account deficit increased moderately in 2010 in line with stronger
domestic demand. Since May 2010, both exports and imports have been growing double-
digit. Imports grew faster than exports in the second half of 2010, as domestic consumer
confidence improved and the exchange rate appreciated. However, exports growth still
remains robust. According to preliminary data, exports expanded by 20.1 percent in 2010,
and imports by 22.6 percent. Mainly as a result of the widening trade balance, the current
account deficit increased from 2.2 percent in 2009 to close to 3.3 percent in 2010. Despite this
increase, the current account deficit remained below the pre-crisis levels of 5 percent of GDP,
and was fully financed by net FDI flows and capital transfers from the EU.

13.    In line with global trends, Polish financial markets continued their rebound in
2010. Financial sector stability improved as the banking sector strengthened its capital base
and non-performing loans of households increased from 6.0 percent in December 2009 to 7.2
percent in December 2010. The zloty exchange rate remains broadly in line with
fundamentals according to IMF assessments.

14.     Fiscal policy supported the recovery. The general government deficit is estimated to
have increased further from 7.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The
overrun in the 2010 fiscal deficit compared to the target of 6.9 percent of GDP was due to
higher local government deficits as well as weaker-than-expected tax collection, linked
mainly to low corporate income tax collection, as enterprises used loss carry-over provisions
to lower tax returns. For example, state budget execution data suggest that the
underperformance of corporate income tax and personal income tax caused an increase in the
fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP. The Government is planning to introduce a new local
government fiscal rule in 2012 to address this issue. Public debt according to ESA95
(Eurostat) methodology is estimated to have increased from 50.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to
55.1 percent of GDP in 2010.

15.     Rising government financing needs were readily absorbed by financial markets.
In spite of the temporary fluctuations related to concerns of sovereign debt issues in Europe,
the yields on government bonds remained low. The bulk of the budget borrowing needs in
2010 were met on the domestic bond market, in line with the public debt management
strategy. Also, the Government secured external financing without difficulties. In 2010 there
were five successful bond placements on international markets: three euro-denominated bond
issuances of EUR6.25 billion (in January, March and September), a Swiss franc-denominated
bond issuance of CHF0.6 billion in March (equivalent to EUR0.4 billion), which was
followed by a US$1.5 billion issuance (equivalent to EUR1.2 billion) in July. Such
borrowing, together with nonresidents’ portfolio investments in the domestic Treasury bond


                                                4
market, increased external debt from 65.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 66.6 percent of GDP in
2010, about one third of which constituted public external debt.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

16.     Growth is expected to stabilize at around 4 percent over the next few years. The
recovery is expected to be driven by improving global conditions, investments supported
through EU funds, improved corporate profitability and revived credit growth, and
consumption growth on the back of further reductions in unemployment (Table 1). These
factors are set to compensate for the impact of the legislated fiscal consolidation measures, the
end of the restocking cycle and a declining contribution from net exports. With domestic
demand gaining strength, inflation is expected to increase from 2.6 percent in 2010 to 3.5
percent in 2011 and decline to 2.8 percent in 2012. The external current account deficit is
expected to remain at a moderate level of less than 4 percent of GDP, adequately financed by
FDI inflows and EU funding. The recent increases in food and energy prices are likely to have
limited impact on Poland’s current account position, as Poland continues to rely to a
significant extent on its own resources for food (large agricultural sector) and energy (large
coal deposits). Poland's gas imports from Russia are based on long-term contracts, which limit
the impact of energy price volatility.

17.    The authorities are implementing macroeconomic policies to ensure that output
growth remains close to its potential. Fiscal, monetary and financial policies are geared
towards preventing an overheating of the economy and moderating potential economic
vulnerabilities.

18.     The Government has launched fiscal consolidation with the 2011 state budget.
The general government fiscal deficit is set to decline from 7.9 percent in 2010 to 5.6 percent
in 2011. The reduction in the fiscal deficit reflects three factors. First, fiscal policy measures
contribute close to two percent of GDP. Expenditure measures of around 0.7 percent of GDP
include the nominal freeze of the wage bill of the state budgetary sphere,3 the limit on growth
of discretionary expenditures to one percent over inflation, lower funeral benefits, and the
phasing-out of early retirement schemes. Tax measures of around 0.6 percent of GDP include
an increase in the VAT rate by 1 percentage point, selected tightening of VAT
reimbursement, selected increases in excises, and improved tax administration for lawyers and
doctors. Second, the Government reduced the contribution rate to private Open Pension Funds
from 7.3 percent to 2.3 percent of gross wages, and shifted the 5 percent of gross wages into
notional individual accounts of the state pension system starting May 2011. This measure
should reduce the fiscal deficit by about 0.6 percent of GDP in 2011. However, it leads to
higher implicit pension liabilities in the long run. Third, the cyclical rebound in the economy
will reduce social expenditures, including unemployment benefits, active labor market
programs, and improve tax collection. The Government has continued to frontload deficit
financing also on international markets. Between early January and mid-February 2011, the
Government issued successfully euro-denominated bonds over EUR1 billion and over JPY18
billion for Japanese market (equivalent to EUR0.16 billion), and over CHF0.35 billion for
Swiss market (equivalent to EUR0.27 billion).

19.     The fiscal adjustment is set to bring Poland in line with the targets of the EU
Stability and Growth Pact. The general government deficit is projected to decline from 7.9
percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012 (Table 2).4 To support fiscal
adjustment, the Government has already amended the law on public finance to limit the
growth of discretionary state budgetary spending, which includes the wage bill of the
budgetary sphere, to one percent in excess of inflation. The Government is working on
reforming the pension system of uniformed services.5 In addition, the investments in the area
of public roads, financed from the National Road Fund, are also set to be reduced by about 2.2
percent of 2010 GDP over the next three years. Finally, the Government has commenced
work on a permanent fiscal rule in the form of multi-year binding expenditure ceilings and
tightened fiscal rules for local governments. These measures are set to ensure a structural
fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the medium-term, in line with the Stability and Growth
Pact. Poland’s large fiscal adjustment helps to generate the space to step up longer-term
public investments in energy efficiency over the coming decade. Poland has already
committed EUR 600 million for energy efficiency investments co-financed through grants
from EU structural funds in the 2007-2013 financial perspective.

  The EU is set to decide in June 2011 on a more flexible approach, under the excessive deficit procedure, to
Member States which have implemented systemic pension reforms. As a result, reducing the general government
deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP would be sufficient in the future to consider the abrogation of the excessive deficit
procedure for Poland in light of Poland’s second pillar pension reforms from the late 1990s.

20.     Public debt is projected to remain at sustainable levels. The strong economic
recovery, a steady appreciation in the exchange rate, fiscal consolidation, better public sector
cash management, stepped-up privatization and strengthened public debt thresholds at the
local level are projected to be sufficient to maintain public debt below key national and EU
thresholds (Table 3). The Public Finance Act reinforces prudent fiscal policy, as it prompts
corrective action when the public debt reaches 55 percent of GDP, in addition to the
Constitutional ceiling for public debt at 60 percent of GDP. A breach of the national 55
percent public debt threshold will trigger an automatic increase in the VAT rate by 1
percentage point, in addition to other measures such as a nominal freeze in budgetary wages
and a change in pension indexation rules. A breach of the Constitutional limit implies a freeze
on any new government guarantees, a zero budget deficit target for the next year, and an
enactment of a rehabilitation program that brings down the public debt-to-GDP ratio below 60
percent. Stress tests suggest that public debt is set to remain below the EU threshold of 60

21.     External debt is set to decline gradually over the medium term. Short-term debt on
a residual maturity basis is estimated at about a third of total external debt in 2010. This share
is projected to decline to about one-quarter over the medium term. Sustainability analyses
suggest that external debt is generally robust and remain manageable under a range of
scenarios (Table 4).

22.     Other economic policies also contribute to limiting external vulnerabilities and
maintaining stable macroeconomic balances. First, on January 21, 2011, the IMF approved
a two-year arrangement for Poland under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in an amount of
around US$30 billion. This third FCL replaces the arrangement from July 2010 by extending
the duration (two years instead of one year) and increasing the amount (US$30 billion instead
of US$20 billion). Second, after keeping interest rates unchanged for more than a year-and-a-
half, the National Bank of Poland increased its main policy rate from 3.5 percent to 4.0
percent in the first four months of 2011 in response to the accelerating recovery and
improving situation on the labor market. Market expectations suggest that the tightening cycle
will continue during 2011, as CPI inflation may be expected to continue above the inflation
target of 2.5 percent due to recent strong increases of food prices, high growth in fuel prices
and the increase in the main VAT rate in early 2011. Finally, the Polish Financial
Supervision, along with the National Bank of Poland and the Ministry of Finance, continue to
monitor closely the stability of the financial sector, and to consider options to limit foreign
currency lending to households. Recent measures include bottom-up and top-down stress-tests
and the recommendations S and T, which aim at preventing rapid increases of lending to
households.6

23.     The macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the proposed
DPL. The macroeconomic policies implemented prior to and during the global crisis have
helped to ensure a continuous economic expansion in recent years and to return growth close
to its potential. The government policies are supportive of a sustained growth, keeping
external imbalances in check and narrowing fiscal deficits over the medium-term. A fast

 “Recommendation T” from December 2010 mandates that an individual cannot allocate more than half of his
monthly income for a loan repayment, “Recommendation S” from January 2011 states that in case of foreign
currency lending, the loan repayment cannot exceed 42 percent of the monthly income.

                                                               9
recovery in key trading partners and stepped-up utilization of EU funds could support a
stronger-than-expected expansion of the economy. However, downside risks could weaken
Poland’s macroeconomic performance. They include a weak recovery in the EU and
contagion from sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries in view of close banking
linkages and significant holdings of government debt and stocks by nonresidents. Poland’s
deep and liquid financial markets are attractive for investors, and make Poland vulnerable to
global or regional shocks. A worsening in the external environment could slow down growth
in Poland, and possibly delay the ambitious fiscal consolidation. Policy makers need to
remain vigilant and undertake timely and adequate measures in case of renewed volatility in
financial markets and sluggish progress on fiscal consolidation.


                       III.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

24.     Government policies continue to balance support for a broad-based, sustainable
economic recovery with medium-term fiscal stabilization. Poland has managed
successfully to shore up economic growth, strengthen financial markets and sustain social
outcomes. In 2010, as the crisis was gradually fading, the authorities adopted an
accommodative fiscal and monetary stance. From 2011 on, a more conservative fiscal policy,
required in view of Poland’s debt rules and EU commitments, should be accompanied by a
private sector led recovery. A reduction of the large fiscal imbalance is the highest priority.
Successful fiscal consolidation will require structural reforms in the labor market, education,
completion of pension reform, improvements of the business environment, administration
reform, promotion of energy efficiency, and acceleration of privatization.

25.     There is a broad agenda of structural reforms envisioned in the Government’s
strategy for 2030 which is to be transposed into several horizontal programs. This
vision, presented in autumn 2009, entails a fundamental transformation from a “welfare
society to a workfare society”. Its aim is to build a competitive, innovative and energy
efficient economy supported by a performing state for a socially and regionally cohesive
society. During 2010, the Government has been working on the long- and medium- term
development strategies, including several horizontal strategies like innovation and
competitiveness or energy security and environment. Their purpose is to transpose the long-
term vision into coherent programs with a clear implementation agenda.

Energy Policy

26.     Poland’s Energy Policy is driven by the broader agenda of sustainable economic
growth to enable convergence with the EU-15 by 2030, while respecting its fiscal
constraints and EU obligations to reduce GHG emissions. The primary challenge is the
need to delink energy consumption from economic growth, which are strongly correlated
under business-as-usual circumstances. De-linking energy use from economic growth has
been successfully done elsewhere – Germany, Sweden and California are notable examples –
but this generally happens in significantly higher income countries. Poland is drawing on the
lessons learned from policy measures undertaken in these higher income countries to help
guide its energy policies.

27.   GHG emissions reductions and energy security are key priorities in the
Government’s energy strategy. The Poland 2030 Report was prepared by the Board of
                                              10
Strategic Advisers to the Prime Minister and published in May 2009. One of its ten key
development priorities is a harmonization of climate change and energy challenges to ensure
adequate energy supplies while meeting its agreed EU 2020 targets for GHG reduction (20%),
increased energy efficiency (20%) and increased use of renewable energy (15.0%). Achieving
economic growth without additional demand for primary energy and reducing the energy
intensity of the Polish economy to the level of the EU-15 are among Poland’s objectives for
2030. The Government’s commitment to low-carbon growth was confirmed in the Energy
Policy of Poland until 2030, adopted by the Council of Ministers in November 2009. In line
with the above, the primary aims of Polish energy policy are to:

       1.   improve energy efficiency;
       2.   enhance the security of fuel and energy supplies;
       3.   diversify electricity generation by introducing nuclear energy;
       4.   develop the use of renewable energy sources, including biofuels;
       5.   develop competitive fuel and energy markets; and
       6.   reduce the environmental impact of the power industry.

28.    The Bank recently completed an analysis of the Government’s development
trajectory taking into account decreased emissions options as part of the recently
completed report on transition to a low-emissions economy. The international agreement
on climate change that would eventually supersede the Kyoto Protocol and, more
immediately, compliance with EU policies on climate change, pose significant policy
challenges for Poland. Poland has been an active participant in international negotiations on
climate change, in particular as a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol and as host to the 14th
Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC in December 2008. The sharp reduction of GHG
emissions that accompanied economic restructuring in the 1990s caused Poland to outperform
against its Kyoto commitments, and the country continues to exceed its Kyoto targets by a
large margin. Nevertheless, the EU policies on climate change mitigation create a significant
challenge for Poland, as over 90% of its power sector is coal-based.

29.     Analyses of GHG reduction options indicate that Poland can reduce emissions by
30 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 at an average cost of €10-15 per metric ton of CO2
equivalent. Prior to 2020, Poland has few options to decrease GHG emissions as many
potential low carbon investments (nuclear power, carbon capture and storage) can not make a
meaningful impact before 2020 because of the long lead time for investments and
uncertainties associated with the technologies. Most of Poland’s abatement potential prior to
2020 can be achieved through energy efficiency improvements, with renewable energy
expected to play a more limited, but important, role. In order to implement the needed low-
carbon options an additional investment of about 0.9 percent of annual GDP will be required
through 2030. Losses to real GDP peak in 2020 at near two percent and then gradually
diminish, leaving GDP slightly above the business-as-usual level by 2030. This U-shaped
pattern of the impact on GDP is driven by the need for upfront investments, with benefits
accumulating in future years, and in particular, the long lead times required by the power
sector.

30.    The technological packages with the largest abatement potential do not
necessarily impose the biggest macroeconomic cost. The switch to low carbon energy
supply provides about 40 percent of abatement through 2030 and also imposes the largest cost
on GDP (of about one percent each year). Fuel efficiency measures, on the other hand, while
                                             11
contributing 30 percent of overall abatement, begin to enhance GDP significantly by 2025 and
provide a net boost to growth overall. Prior to 2020, the economically attractive fuel
efficiency options are limited to low cost renewable energy options like onshore wind power,
small hydro power, biomass and biogas. Energy efficiency measures, however, are most
important in the early years, contributing 20 percent of mitigation in 2015, while costing over
one percent in GDP losses in 2015 but switching to growth-enhancing by 2025. Well-
designed financial options can produce positive fiscal impacts right from the start. In
contrast, carbon capture and storage (CCS) contributes only marginally to emissions
abatement while costing about one-half percent per year in lower GDP after 2020, leaving it
as an expensive option in terms of growth impacts. Nuclear power offers the biggest
abatement potential but remains a drain on growth even with a twenty-year horizon, due to its
high up-front costs.

31.    A Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curve analysis was undertaken as part of the
World Bank report “Transition to a Low-Emissions Economy in Poland. The MAC
analysis is a bottom-up engineering approach to assessing GHG abatement, with an intensive
analysis of the power sector. Using detailed sectoral data, the MAC curve model creates a
ranking by net cost of about 120 emission reduction options. Options include only available
technologies or those expected to be available before 2030 (for example, carbon capture and
storage is included but biodiesel from algae is not). Also, levers that would require significant
consumer lifestyle changes (such as switching to public transportation or lowering home
temperatures) were not considered. The abatement cost is calculated as the sum of
incremental capital expenditures and incremental operational expenditures or savings in Net
Present Value (NPV) terms.

32.     The MAC curve (see Figure 1) shows that Poland can significantly reduce
emissions but capturing the full potential will be a major challenge. The width of each
column on the curve represents the emissions reduction potential by 2030 compared to the
BAU scenario. The height of each column represents the average cost of avoiding one tCO2e
by 2030 by replacing the underlying (reference) technology with a low-carbon technology.
For example, in the power sector, a coal-fired power plant would be replaced by a gas or
nuclear power plant. Altogether, the total abatement potential represents a 31 percent
reduction from 2005 levels. However, capturing this full potential will require concerted,
targeted actions by government, business, and consumers. Significant gains will have to be
made in the energy efficiency of buildings and transportation, and the share of low-carbon
energy sources will have to rise to over 50 percent of total electricity supply by 2030 (from
just 3.5 percent in 2005). The MAC curve also identifies that the majority of Poland’s
abatement potential is associated with the switch to low-carbon energy supply (via energy
sector investments) and with energy efficiency improvements (see Figure 2). Furthermore,
the analysis indicates that energy efficiency investments are the lowest cost alternative.

33.     Energy efficiency measures contribute substantially to the aggregate low average
cost of the MAC curve options, but the idea of significant savings opportunities being
ignored by households and firms does not make economic sense. Clearly, there are other
hurdles preventing these savings-creating measures from being taken up at once. Five groups
of barriers to these measures are: high upfront investment costs, lack of easily available
subsidized credit, principal-agent problems (such as the owner, operator, occupant, and bill
payer of a building being separate entities), and lack of information (about what savings are
likely). A fifth, and potentially most difficult obstacle, is the costs of implementation across a
large number of small entities which creates high transaction costs.

34.     Although Poland has made considerable advances in energy efficiency in the past
20 years, it has not yet reached Western European standards. Per unit of GDP, Poland’s
economy is still more than twice as energy intensive as the EU-27 average. Advances in
energy efficiency, which were dramatic during 1988 to 2000, have slowed during the last
decade (see Figure 3). Consumption of energy per € of GDP has fallen by nearly half during
1990 to 2007, from 781 tons of oil equivalent required for every hundred million Euros of
output to 400. While Poland’s level of energy intensity was 3.4 times that of the EU average
in 1990, as of 2007 it was 2.4 times that of the EU.

35.     The Government has made energy efficiency the main pillar of its program to
meet Poland’s energy challenges, while supporting its broader economic growth objective
and respecting its fiscal constraint. Energy security remains an important concern in terms of
availability and price of primary energy and reliability of supply. Reliability of supply is of
particular concern for the power sector as many of its operating assets are near or beyond their
design life. The issue becomes increasingly complicated when one adds the GHG emission
reduction target (20% by 2020), as more than 90% of Poland’s electricity generation is based
on coal-fired technologies. Replacing coal-fired plants with Renewable Energy (RE) options
would be expensive, as Poland has limited hydropower and geothermal potential. Solar
options are also limited because of the country’s latitude and would be costly using current
technologies. Furthermore, RE technologies are not good substitutes for base-loaded power
unless massive energy storage investments are made as well, which is not yet economically
feasible. Nuclear power and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) options are being actively
considered, but would not be available until after 2020. Countries that pursue major end-use
energy efficiency programs have found that investment costs for energy efficiency are about
half of those required for increased power generation and transmission capacity. Utilities that
gave energy efficiency options an active role in power dispatch have found that energy
efficiency considerably decreases supply costs7. Lastly, energy efficiency programs lead to
job creation and stimulate cutting edge technologies, enhancing or safeguarding a nation’s
competitive edge. Therefore energy efficiency is the best way for the Government to:

           1.    Improve energy security by reducing the need for primary energy;
           2.    Decrease GHG and other emissions;
           3.    Help meet the RE target of 15.0% of the supply mix by 2020;
           4.    Increase growth potential and competitiveness by lowering energy sector costs;
                 and
           5.    Increase employment in future growth sectors.

36.     The primary focus of further energy efficiency improvements is on the buildings
sector. The energy efficiency gains to date came mostly from investments in the industrial
sector and structural changes in the economy. The focus of energy efficiency measures now
has switched to the buildings sector, which accounts for 40% of final energy consumption, of
which 70% is for heating. The average level of energy use in buildings in Poland is about
240 kWh/m2. The current target for new buildings is about 120 kWh/m2, though experts
estimate that the actual performance does not fall below 150 kWh/m2 on average. The
Government is addressing the energy efficiency of the housing stock through five primary
policy instruments: (i) setting tighter standards for new buildings and buildings undergoing
substantial renovation, as well as initiating research on the design of “nearly zero energy”
standards for new buildings in Poland by 20208; (ii) making energy performance of buildings
certificates for purchasers/renters of buildings mandatory; (iii) providing a limited amount of
grant financing for part of the cost of energy efficiency upgrades of buildings through the
Thermo Modernization and Renovation Fund (TMRF) for residential buildings and the
National Environment Fund and its regional funds (public sector); (iv) implementation of a

Smart Meters.

37.     The largest energy efficiency gains will come from buildings that are more than
20 years old since they were generally poorly built and have high heat losses. The incentive
for upgrading these and all other buildings will be established through the building certificates
program, which is in the early stage of implementation. Purchasers and renters must, prior to
completion of a transaction, be given such a certificate stating the level of energy usage and
efficiency of the building. This should provide an incentive for improving the quality of
buildings in order to improve their marketability. Energy efficiency measures that could be
implemented typically include upgrades to building insulation, decreases in air leakage,
installation of energy efficient windows, improved temperature controls and replacement or
upgrading of boilers. Grant funding for up to 16% of the cost of (or 20% of the loans for)
these measures is expected to come primarily from the TMRF . In its budget for 2011, the
Government has allocated PLN 200 million to the Fund. These funds would typically be
leveraged with commercial bank funds to deliver in total about PLN 1.0 billion in funding to
consumers.

38.     Renewable Energy (RE) is the second major pillar designed to help the
Government meet its energy security and emissions reductions targets. Prudent
investments in lower-cost RE technologies can also help Poland meet its economic growth
targets. The Bank’s Transition to a Low Emission Economy Report for Poland (2011)
identified some RE options, notably on-shore wind power and biomass, as important
components of energy system development. Many RE technologies, like solar photovoltaics
and offshore and micro wind power proved to be expensive compared with other low carbon
technologies. The Government has put in place a “green certificate” scheme that obliges
electricity suppliers to increase the share of RE in their portfolio. This scheme, combined
with other incentives, resulted in a considerable increase in RE supply over the past five years
and changes in operations in existing coal-fired plants: wind power and biomass use in power
plants have both increased seven-fold during 2004-2009, albeit starting from a low base. The
Government expects that biomass and wind power will remain important components of its
RE program over the next decade. It plans to improve the incentives for biomass use in
smaller cogeneration facilities, which will increase the share of biomass in final energy
consumption. The use of solar collectors for hot water supply and, to a lesser extent, for
heating have increased 17-fold from 2001-9. The push for such sales came primarily from
equipment suppliers, focusing on the end-user. In the latter half of 2010, the Government
launched financial support for such schemes through the National Fund for Environmental
Protection and Water Management.

39.     Government support for renewable energy primarily focuses on “Green
Certificates” which establish an obligation for all sellers of electricity to purchase a
prescribed quantity of renewable energy. The sellers of electricity receive green
certificates from suppliers of renewable energy. These certificates are tradable and can be
purchased through the Polish Power Exchange: sellers that have an excess of green
certificates can sell them to companies that have not met their renewable energy targets. If an
electricity seller has not met its target it also has an obligation to pay a “substitution fee”: a
penalty for not meeting this target. In practice, green certificates typically sell at a modest
discount to the substitution fee. This process has helped the Government more than double
the use of renewable energy from 2006-9, from 4.2 TWH to 8.7 TWh.
                                               16
40.     The above programs will help enable Poland to fulfill its binding national
commitments to the EU’s climate and energy package referred to as “the 20-20-20
targets”. In turn, the EU package and the associated regular monitoring of actual
performance against national targets by the European Commission will help drive Poland’s
programs. This package requires comprehensive action by all EU members on overall
emissions reductions across all sectors of the economy. With the EU aiming to lead the global
action against climate change, it has set ambitious targets for 2020 for itself: a 20 percent
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels (a 14 percent reduction
compared to 2005); a 20 percent renewable energy target as a percent of gross final energy
consumption9, including a 10 percent share of biofuels in the transport fuel market; and a 20
percent reduction in primary energy use compared to projected levels under a business-as-
usual scenario, to be achieved through energy efficiency improvements. Poland’s targets for
GHG reduction and energy efficiency are the same as for the EU as a whole, while its binding
target for renewable energy (15%) is lower, in recognition of the fact that it started from a
lower base than most EU member states and has to make a major effort to get to that level.

            IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

41.     The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Poland’s convergence towards EU
living standards. The recently completed DPL program of EUR3 billion has been central to
the Bank’s engagement in Poland, as emphasized in the 2009-13 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) presented to the Board on June 30, 2009. The CPS aims to situate the Bank’s
engagement in Poland firmly in the context of the activities of other external partners and
focuses on specific areas of engagement where the Bank can add value.

42.     The Bank’s strategic partnership with Poland is based on four pillars: (i) Growth and
Competitiveness; (ii) Public Sector Reform; (iii) Social and Spatial Inclusion; and (iv)
Regional and Global Public Goods. The proposed Energy Efficiency DPL will be an
anchor for the strategic dialogue between the Bank and the Polish authorities, in
particular in the area of regional and global public goods. Public financial management
reform, private sector reform, labor market efficiency and social sector reform, supported by
the recent DPL series, have been key elements of the first three pillars. With the new Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy DPL, the Bank will focus on supporting energy sector
reforms related to the EU’s energy and climate policies. The operation is informed by the
World Bank report (2011) entitled “Transition to a Low-Emissions Economy in Poland”.
Going forward, the Bank will follow-up on the low emissions agenda through a selection of
instruments including possible follow-up DPLs, Program for Results loans, advisory services
or Fee Based Services.




9
 The 20 percent target for renewable energy is for the EU as a whole. Given that Poland has limited hydropower
and geothermal potential, its target has been set at 15%.

                                                     17
COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

43.     The Bank collaborated closely with the IMF and the European Commission on
this program. The staffs of the Bank and the Fund are working closely together on Poland,
with frequent exchanges on macroeconomic, fiscal and structural reforms. The measures
under the proposed DPL program were discussed with both the IMF and the EC to ensure that
they reinforce and complement their support to Poland.

44.     The Bank’s coordination with other donors in energy was initiated early on
through cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 1990 when it invited
the latter to cofinance the Energy Resource Development Project. In 1991 the Bank assisted
the then newly created EBRD to make its first loan by enabling it to cofinance a
subcomponent of the Bank’s Heat Supply Restructuring and Conservation Project.
Subsequent to that the Bank cooperated with EBRD in order to enable the Krakow District
Heating Company to borrow without a sovereign counter guarantee. Other than these specific
instances, collaboration with major IFIs in Poland has been limited as the Bank withdrew
from financing major investments in the Polish energy sector. The last project involving
collaboration with other donors in the energy sector was the Bank/GEF Podhale Geothermal
Project in 2000, in which the EU, USAID and the Government of Denmark provided
cofinancing. All subsequent collaboration with IFIs and donors has been at the macro level
and through international fora or bilaterally organized meetings.

45.     Energy efficiency lending by the EIB and the EBRD has, during the past decade,
mostly focused on lending to local governments and small and medium sized enterprises,
in EBRD’s case mostly via financial intermediaries. During the 1990s the EBRD, in addition
to engaging in district heating lending, pioneered the energy services company (ESCO) model
of energy efficiency investing in Poland. More recently, EBRD supported the development of
renewable energy projects through co-financing with commercial banks and other IFIs. The
proposed DPL’s focus on supporting Government policy measures that would encourage
energy efficiency investments in areas such as demand-side measures, cogeneration, smart
grids, and renewable energy is fully complementary with, and supportive of, the investment
lending programs of EIB, EBRD and other institutions engaged in project lending in Poland.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

46.     The Bank was extensively involved in the Polish energy sector with an intensive
policy dialogue accompanied by major loans during 1990-1995. Under the Energy
Resource Development Project (Loan 3215-POL, 1990) the Bank supported gas pricing
reform, domestic production of gas and increased private sector participation in developing
petroleum resources. Under the SAL (Loan 3247-POL, 1990) coal prices were decontrolled
and the first steps were taken towards elimination of energy-related subsidies and cross-
subsidization of household energy consumers. Under the Heat Supply Restructuring and
Conservation Project (Loans 3377/83-POL, 1991), and in particular under the SECAL of that
project, and under the Katowice Heat Supply and Conservation Project (Loan 3809-POL,
1994), the Bank broadened and deepened its support for comprehensive energy sector
restructuring. Under the Power Transmission Project (Loan 3959-POL, 1995) the Bank
supported the newly independent grid owner and operator, the Polish Power Grid Company,
both by providing institutional support as well as by financing grid rehabilitation and
reinforcement, interconnections with Western Europe, and transmission loss reduction.
                                            18
47.    While the District Heating projects focused primarily on energy efficiency
improvements on the supply side, with major benefits in terms of cost control and service
improvement, borrowers were from the start encouraged to start thinking in terms of helping
customers improve end-use energy efficiency as well. This message was particularly taken to
heart by the Krakow District Heating Company, which borrowed a second loan for the
Krakow Energy Efficiency project (Loan 20969-POL, 2001) consisting of both an investment
component and an energy services company (ESCO) component, the latter to help identify
and finance investments in end-use energy efficiency. And the GEF Coal-to-Gas Conversion
Project (Grant 13054-POL, 1995) financed, inter alia, the installation of a small gas-fired
cogeneration unit - a first in Poland and important because of the power and heat off-take
agreements that had to be designed.

48.     The Bank’s energy program in the post-2000 period increasingly focused on
interventions designed to reduce GHG emissions. The World Bank/GEF Podhale
Geothermal District Heating and Environment Project (Loan 7015–POL; 2000), funded
provision of district heating with renewable energy (geothermal heat) in the environmentally
sensitive Tatra mountain region. The Poland Puck Wind Farm Project (Carbon Financed
POL-PE74546; 2002) promotes the mitigation of GHG and contributes to substituting clean
power generation for polluted generation by providing funding for a wind power plant
complex in northeast Poland. The Poland GEF Energy Efficiency Project (Grant 27006-POL,
2004) was designed to increase public and private sector investment in energy efficiency in
buildings. The latter project is ongoing and, as part of its restructuring, its technical
assistance component is being used to finance studies which support the design of the
proposed DPL. The Poland Green Investment Scheme (GIS) project, which is currently under
preparation, would support reduction of CO2 emissions and air pollutant by focusing on
improving energy efficiency in the public buildings sector and is fully aligned with the policy
agenda supported by the proposed DPL.

49.      Through the proposed DPL the Bank resumed a major policy dialogue on energy
efficiency and renewable energy with the Government, after not having had a meaningful
energy policy dialogue for about 15 years. Resumption of this dialogue, although difficult
because of the Bank’s long absence on the national policy scene, was to some extent
facilitated by the preceding work on the Bank’s report on Poland’s transition towards a low-
emissions economy and the ability of Bank staff to reconnect with some of the main players
in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy. Nevertheless, it would be important
not to let the current effort come to naught. A subsequent programmatic DPL would be
highly desirable but, if that is not feasible, a results-based investment operation or targeted
AAA work would be needed in order to sustain the current dialogue and to enable the Bank to
play a constructive role in assisting the Government in shaping Poland’s energy efficiency
and renewable energy programs.

LESSONS LEARNED

50.     While preparing this operation, lessons learned from the Bank’s work on energy
efficiency and renewable energy issues in Poland were incorporated, ranging from the
district heating projects in the early 1990s through to the more recent GEF projects.
The lessons learned in energy efficiency programs in other EU Accession countries were also
drawn on. However, since the primary focus and driver of the current program is Poland’s
                                              19
commitment to the 2020 climate and energy package of the EU, its own national targets in
that regard as well as its ambitious convergence strategy with the EU-15 by 2030, as well as
lessons learned from successful energy efficiency programs in EU-15 countries have formed
important inputs for the design of this program.

51.     Lesson 1: For progress to be made in this critical sector Poland must take more
proactive and targeted steps than it has taken in the past and the Government is turning
its attention to lessons learned from EU-15 countries in planning its next steps. Poland’s
energy intensity improved considerably during the 1990s as a result of economic contraction
and structural reforms, like many other EU-12 countries. Economic growth resumed around
2000 with an initial delinking of growth in energy consumption, as the structural reforms
continued to take hold. Much of the energy efficiency gains have taken place in the industrial
and commercial sectors, with the building sector’s energy efficiency improvements lagging
behind EU-15 norms.

52.     Lesson 2: Three neighboring EU-15 countries stand out for their improvements in
energy efficiency during 1990-2007, and Poland should follow their examples in selected
areas. Germany’s lessons learned during re-unification as well as the changes to its incentive
system through legal and regulatory changes have been used to help guide Poland’s reform
agenda. Sweden’s approach to good governance and institutional reforms can help Poland
design, implement and monitor its energy efficiency program. Denmark’s achievements in
establishing high-efficiency building standards and energy performance of buildings
certificate programs have also been used to help define the new standards for Poland in this
regard.

53.     Lesson 3: White certificates programs can be successful as the centerpiece of an
energy efficiency program, but should be kept as simple as possible during the initial
stage. Added layers of complexity, such as trading of certificates, can be introduced as
experience is gained. Poland plans to base implementation of much of its energy efficiency
program on its proposed “White Certificates’ program: a market-based instrument that
supports the implementation associated with its energy efficiency targets. The successes of
White Certificates programs in the UK, France and Italy have helped guide the design of
Poland’s proposed program. All of these programs exceeded their initial multi-year energy
savings targets and at cost savings in the order of 0.5-2.0 €¢/kWh, including direct and
indirect costs. However, in contrast to, e.g., the UK, Poland’s program is quite complex and
includes certificates trading from the start. Starting off with a white certificates scheme
without the trading component and just having energy savings obligations for energy
suppliers and distributors would be a preferred option.


ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

54.    The proposed DPL has been designed based on the recent Low-Carbon Country
Economic Memorandum for Poland, the Government’s Energy Policy Until 2030 and
associated documents, analytical work undertaken by the International Energy Agency
(IEA) and the European Commission, as well as relevant EU Directives on energy
services, energy performance of buildings, and cogeneration. The key documents used in
preparing this operation are:


                                             20
   Transition to a Low Emissions Economy in Poland (World Bank, 2011): The
    Poland report provided the primary analytical underpinnings upon which this
    loan was based as it identified energy efficiency and some renewable energy
    options as key components of Poland’s energy program that would reduce
    emissions over the next decade. Specifically, the study highlights the role of
    energy efficiency as the option that would best address address Poland’s carbon
    abatement targets and associated economic impact over a long time horizon.
   Poland’s Energy Strategy Until 2030 (Government of Poland, November 2009).
    The Government’s Energy Strategy clearly establishes energy efficiency as its
    primary focal point in meeting many of its broad-based policy objectives. The
    Strategy outlines the policy objectives and secondary objectives, along with the
    principal measures through which increased energy efficiency and use of
    renewable energy are to be achieved. In this context two additional documents
    are very important, as they confirm the Government’s commitments towards the
    EU and detail the specific measures proposed to achieve the agreed targets:
    o     The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (Government of Poland, June
          2009). The NEEAP details implementation of the Government’s energy
          efficiency strategy in support of the Energy Strategy, and sets intermediate
          energy savings targets. It is to be updated every three years in light of the
          results achieved and feedback obtained from the EC.
    o     The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (Government of Poland,
          December 2010).          The NREAP details implementation of the
          Government’s renewable energy strategy in support of the Energy Strategy
          and sets intermediate renewable energy targets. It is to be updated every
          three years in light of the results achieved and feedback obtained from the
          EC.
   Two reports prepared by consultants at the request of the Bank team. First, the
    Review of Cogeneration Issues in Poland (Dr. Zygmunt Parczewski, January
    2011). This review analyzes the current status of cogeneration in Poland and the
    various incentive schemes in operation or proposed to promote fuel-specific
    forms of cogeneration. It highlights in particular the need for the Government to
    make a decision soon on the post-2012 incentive scheme. Second, the Energy
    Performance of Buildings in Poland report (Dr. Krzysztof Zmijewski, January,
    2011). This report provides detailed and critical insights in the evolution of the
    current energy efficiency policy with regard to the buildings sector and discusses
    the current status. It offers specific policy recommendations on how the
    Government should proceed in order to make significant progress in this critical
    area during the next ten years.
   Review of White Certificates Programs (EC, 2006) and the proceedings of
    recent international conferences on these programs. Poland’s White Certificates
    program is intended to be the cornerstone of its energy efficiency program, by
    creating energy efficiency obligations on energy suppliers and distributors.
    Three EU countries – France, Italy and the UK – have positive experiences that
    will help guide implementation of Poland’s program, in particular the need to
    start off with a relatively simple program and build on it as experience is gained
    with implementation.




                                     21
55.    In addition to the above, the Bank team has provided the following analytical support
and advisory services during program preparation:

            Analytical support to the Government through studies of the energy efficiency
             policy lessons learned in Germany (completed), Sweden (near completion)
             and Ireland (in progress) and their applicability to Poland.
            Advisory services on the behavioral and marketing aspects associated with
             developing home/business area networks (Smart Meters) that would be used
             by households and small and medium enterprises to enable them to benefit from
             Smart Grids (funding provided by the Poland GEF project).
            Analytical work funded by a multi-donor Trust Fund on the nexus between
             other energy efficiency policies supported in this operation and poverty and
             social issues.

V.     THE PROPOSED ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY DPL

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

56.     The proposed DPL is designed to support the Government’s objective to decrease
emissions through accelerating energy efficiency and targeted renewable energy
interventions. Meeting this objective is challenging: respecting the additional objective of
sustained economic growth while operating in a fiscally constrained environment makes this
task particularly difficult. Macroeconomic modeling undertaken as part of the World Bank
report on Poland’s transition towards a low-emissions economy indicated that energy
efficiency and low cost renewable energy interventions would have positive impacts on
economic growth in the long-term. A similar analysis in Hungary indicates a positive
sustained impact on job creation as well, since most energy efficiency programs are labor
intensive and associated with cutting edge technology, thus promising ample potential for
growth.

57.     The DPL provides support to address barriers to both demand-side and supply-
side energy efficiency investments, the cornerstone of which is the Energy Efficiency
Law. The Energy Efficiency Law creates the enabling environment for the Government’s
White Certificates program, building on their positive experience with other certificates
programs. Experience in other countries shows that establishing obligations for energy
suppliers to promote energy efficiency investments successfully addresses some of the
barriers to entry (see para. 53). Energy supply companies get actively involved in providing
targeted information to their customers to decrease energy consumption, helping address the
information barrier. Coupling the obligation associated with the White Certificates with the
Building Certificates programs addresses the principal-agent problem. Purchasers and renters
of buildings will have the information about building energy efficiency from the Buildings
Certificates and energy suppliers have the incentive to make Buildings Certificates
operational.

58.    The Energy Efficiency Law requires that the Government play an exemplary role
in undertaking demand-side energy efficiency actions. An important component of the
energy efficiency program is the need to support behavior changes, making energy savings an
important consideration in everyday life. Within the EU, public sector entities are expected to

                                              22
play an important leadership role in implementing such changes and making them visible.
The Energy Efficiency Law explicitly lists five energy efficiency intervention options of
which public sector entities are mandated to select at least two (see para. 68). The
Government will continue its outreach program to facilitate behavior changes within civil
society.

59.     The Government’s TMRF will help address the financing barrier for energy
efficiency investments. Availability of financing has been identified as one of the primary
barriers to energy efficiency. In 1998, the Government established a TMRF to address this
issue. The TMRF uses grant funding from the Government to leverage commercial financing
from banks for building retrofits. The structure and processing approach of the TMRF has
evolved over time, making it more effective and decreasing the grant component as energy
efficiency investments become increasingly affordable.

60.     Smart Grids programs are expected to address the link between supply-side and
demand-side interventions and provide a conduit for improved information exchange.
The Smart Grids program has started with piloting Smart Meters at households. Smart Meters
will provide an opportunity for two-way communications between supply and demand-side,
enabling better system-wide controls for demand management. Pilots in other countries have
been able to decrease peak demand by more than 10% by integrating building temperature
controls with supply-side considerations. Following the introduction of Smart Meters, the
Government plans to introduce Home Area Networks, facilitating improved energy efficiency
at the household level. Smart Grids are also expected to facilitate increased use of renewable
energy by improving system stability.

61.     The Government has assigned a high priority to increased use of cogeneration to
decrease energy use on the supply-side. The Government’s target is to double the amount
of electric power supplied by cogeneration between 2006 and 2020, from about 16% to 26%
of power production. One of the principal tools used by the Government to encourage the
use of cogeneration is expansion of the existing “rainbow scheme” of guarantee of origin
certificates favoring various modes of CHP production based on fuel: red for coal-fired
cogeneration plant, yellow for gas-fired plant and brown for biogas (from agricultural
biomass)-fired plant. A change in bulk heat pricing favoring CHP producers is expected to
result in increased construction of new small-medium sized cogeneration capacity. The
Government is currently preparing a Program for the Development of Cogeneration post-
2012. This program would give prospective investors long-term certainty about the
cogeneration incentive regime.

62.     The Government’s National Energy Efficiency Action Program (NEEAP) is
designed to meet its agreed national targets within the context of the EU’s climate and
energy package to continue its success in decreasing Poland’s energy intensity by about 50%
from 1990-2007. Poland has committed itself towards the EU to reduce its energy use by
20% by 2020 compared to a business as usual scenario, while the NEEAP sets a binding
interim target of 9% real energy savings by 2016 compared to the 2002-2005 average. Much
of Poland’s success to date comes from efficiency improvements in the industrial sector and
structural changes in the economy, the economic contraction that took place during the 1990s,
and the slowdown in economic growth in 2008/9. In contrast, the design of the NEEAP
broadens and deepens the approach and is designed to proactively help delink future
economic growth and energy use. The large number of specific steps proposed in the NEEAP
                                             23
has been reviewed by the EC and will be tested against the results. The NEEAP (NEEAP-1)
is currently being reviewed and a new NEEAP (NEEAP-2) is due to be submitted to the EC
by mid-2012 and progress made will be critically reviewed and reported on by the EC.

63.     The Government has adopted a National Renewable Energy Action Plan
(NREAP) that sets a detailed roadmap to demonstrate how it plans to meet its binding
national target of 15.0% renewable energy as a share of final consumption by 2020
within the context of the EU’s climate and energy package. This NREAP was submitted
to the EC in December 2010 and will be reviewed by it. The Government’s current renewable
energy program is based primarily on a “Green Certificates Program” and other incentives to
increase the share of renewable energy, such as incentives for using biomass and biogas in
high-efficiency cogeneration plants, feed-in tariffs, subsidized credit, etc. Positive results
have been achieved in increasing the share of renewable energy in the country’s final energy
consumption from 6.7% in 2008 to 8.6% in 2010. The Government is committed to accelerate
the implementation of its program to meet the target of 15.0% by 2020. The NREAP sets out
the sectoral targets, the technology mix they expect to use, the trajectory they will follow and
the measures and reforms they will undertake to overcome the barriers to developing
renewable energy. The NREAP will also be revised and updated at regular intervals and
progress made will be critically reviewed and reported on by the EC.

POLICY AREAS

64.      The operation is intended to support a set of policy measures designed to achieve
a significant reduction in the energy intensity of the Polish economy through energy
efficiency, while at the same time increasing the share of renewable energy. These
measures will have the additional major benefits of reducing GHG emissions and enhancing
energy security. The policy matrix agreed with the Government has been organized around
the following main areas, in addition to the general requirement to sustain macroeconomic
stability:

Policy Area I – Energy Efficiency Strategy: Developing the Supporting Legal Framework

65.     The Government’s Energy Strategy to 2030 was adopted by the Council of
Ministers in November 2009 and states that energy efficiency is the cornerstone for
implementing that strategy. A National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) was
prepared in compliance with the requirements of the EU’s Energy Services Directive and its
implementation is in the process of being reviewed. The NEEAP supports the national
objective of decreasing actual energy use by 9% over 2008-2016, and decreasing energy use
by 20% compared to a business-as-usual scenario by 2020.

66.     At this stage, Poland’s energy efficiency targets would not likely be met without
making changes to the legal and regulatory framework. Poland has had an Energy
Efficiency Law under preparation for four years and went through 16 drafts. Enactment of
this law is the cornerstone of the Government’s energy efficiency program supported by this
DPL as it would establish the framework to enable an acceleration of energy efficiency,
particularly through its White Certificates program. The Energy Law was passed on April 15,
2011 and will be submitted to the President of the Republic by April 27. The President signed
the law on April 29, 2011. The Energy Efficiency Law provides a comprehensive legal


                                              24
framework for the Government’s energy efficiency programs, the cornerstone of which is the
proposed White Certificates program.

67.     The White Certificates program is critical in helping Poland meet its EU targets
on energy efficiency and would support meeting energy efficiency targets in a quasi
market-based manner. Poland’s White Certificates program (see Box 1 for a description of
White Certificates) is based on annual energy efficiency targets that would be set by the ERO,
obligating energy suppliers to decrease energy use to meet this goal. Suppliers failing to meet
their targets would have to pay to the ERO a “substitution fee” (penalty) that would be
significantly higher than the expected cost of energy efficiency investments. Initially, the
program would focus on obligations only, much like programs that are successful in
Denmark, Sweden and some states in the US. By 2014, tradable White Certificates would be
made available on the Warsaw stock exchange to enable cost minimization through a market
mechanism. Once these tradable White Certificates are available, energy suppliers could
purchase a corresponding number of certificates from other suppliers having a surplus or from
other energy efficiency service providers. The Government expects that, drawing on lessons
learned from others, the White Certificates program would enable them to meet its 2016 of a
9% reduction in energy use of 53 TWh, a target of energy efficiency savings which exceeds
the total energy consumption of Latvia.

68.     In countries that have achieved low energy intensities, the Government plays an
important role in setting a good example. Coupling this with an outreach program helps
change the mindset of civil society and cultural norms associated with saving energy. The
Energy Efficiency Law makes provisions for such changes, stipulating that Government
agencies will commit to completing any two of the following five actions: (i) enter into an
agreement with a third party on investments in energy efficiency; (ii) purchase new
appliances, equipment or vehicles which are highly energy efficient and would reduce
operating costs; (iii) exchange new appliances, equipment or vehicles which are highly energy
efficient and would reduce operating costs; (iv) purchase or rent new buildings of high energy
efficiency or renovate existing buildings to improve their thermal properties; or (v) undertake
an energy audit. The Ministry of Finance is reluctant to commit to energy efficiency targets
for Central Government buildings because of the fiscal constraints it currently faces. Over the
next year, this problem is expected to be addressed in an effort to determine an approach that
would have a positive impact on the fiscal deficit by using a combination of grants and ESCO
balance sheet financing. Combining these investments and good governance will help shift
attitudes, with a spin-off effect in the private sector and households. However, a change in
attitudes is a process that tends to be gradual until a tipping point is reached.

                                       Box 1. White Certificates
   What are White Certificates? White Certificates are a relatively new policy instrument, implemented
   in the UK, Italy, France and more recently Australia. The concept is that specific time-bound energy
   saving targets are established for energy suppliers or distributors who must meet those targets by
   implementing energy efficiency measures among their clients. White certificates are given for each
   MWh or GJ saved. Energy suppliers or distributors, who exceed their targets, can sell their unused
   white certificates to suppliers/distributors that fall short of their target. Alternatively they can buy
   white certificates against a substitute or penalty fee from the Regulator. There are other countries (e.g.,
   Denmark) that have implemented similar schemes although without the certificate trading component
   and merely having energy savings obligations to energy suppliers or distributors.

   Who are the primary participants?
   The Energy Regulatory Authority plays the principal role in distributing the obligations for each of the
   participants and issuing the white certificates;
   Suppliers and distributors of gas, electricity and district heating have the obligation to save a certain
   amount of energy within a specified period. To achieve this they must promote energy efficiency
   projects with end users. Suppliers and distributors receive White Certificates and can trade them on the
   market in order to comply with the obligation or buy them at a higher price from the regulatory
   authority if they cannot obtain enough on the market;
   Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) can offer to make investments to reduce a client’s energy use,
   often by taking a share of such reduced costs as repayment for installing the energy efficiency measure
   and financing it. They do not receive an obligation, but they are allowed to claim and sell white
   certificates after achieving energy savings.
   “Other participants” are entities that do not receive an obligation but can purchase and sell white
   certificates, providing the necessary liquidity in the market. Examples of such entities are brokers and
   financing institutions. The eligibility and the role of these entities vary among the existing white
   certificate schemes.

   What are the design characteristics of White Certificates schemes?
   White Certificates schemes consist of the following elements: (a) energy savings target setting (size
   and timing); (b) obligated parties: (c) what projects are eligible and verification requirements, if any;
   (d) compliance, transaction and administrative costs; (e) eligible technologies; (f) institutional setup;
   (g) enforcement; (h) trading rules; and (i) links to other policy instruments.


69.     The following prior action is supported by the DPL:
Prior Action 1: The Act on Energy Efficiency was approved by the Parliament on April
15, 2011, and promulgated by the President on April 29, 2011, thereby establishing the
Borrower’s White Certificates Program as a mechanism to meet its energy efficiency
targets. The law includes notably: (i) the introduction of a White Certificates program that
would oblige energy suppliers to meet annual energy consumption reduction targets; and (ii)
eligible options for Government agencies to fulfill the EU requirement of an exemplary role
of Government in energy efficiency.

70.    Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of submission of
NEEAP-2 to the EC; completion of the annual review of the Energy Policy by the Council of
Ministers; analyzing EU best practices on governance (by mid-2012) to deepen the
governance responsibilities; and implementation of the ultimately agreed proposal by end-
2013.




                                                      26
Policy Area II – Decrease Supply-Side Energy Use

71.     Increased use of cogeneration for the production of electric power and heat is of
critical importance in increasing energy efficiency on the supply side. Although Poland
already has a significant number of large cogeneration plants, much can be done to further
increase total capacity and use of cogeneration, particularly in the small-medium size plant
ranges. The Government’s target is to double the amount of electric power supplied by
cogeneration between 2006 and 2020, i.e., from about 24 TWh/year to 48 TWh/year, or from
about 16% to 26% of power production. One of the principal tools used by the Government
to encourage the use of cogeneration is expansion of the existing “rainbow scheme” of
guarantee of origin certificates favoring various modes of CHP production based on fuel: red
for coal-fired cogeneration plant, yellow for gas-fired plant and brown for biogas (from
agricultural biomass) fired plant. As a part of the DPL program, a potentially very important
new tool was introduced, namely, a change in bulk heat pricing favoring CHP producers.

72.    The following prior action is supported by this DPL:
Prior Action 2: The Borrower has provided incentives to increase the share of
cogeneration by allowing cogenerators to price their bulk heat up to the average price of
heat produced by heat-only boilers. This was achieved through the issuance of the
Ordinance on Heat Tariffs of September 17, 2010 (Journal of Laws of the Republic of Poland
No. 194/2010, item 1291).

73.     One of the major effects of this ordinance is expected to be increased construction
of new small-medium sized cogeneration capacity since CHP producers will be allowed
to price their heat at the level of average heat prices of local heat-only boilers. Since
cogeneration plants are typically much more efficient than heat-only boilers this implies a
significant profit potential for CHP producers. Any resulting heat price increases would be
phased in over 2-3 years to avoid abrupt heat price increases to final consumers.

74.    Since the red and yellow certificate support schemes are set to expire at the end
of 2012 the Government is currently preparing a Program for the Development of
Cogeneration post 2012. This program would give prospective investors long-term certainty
about the cogeneration incentive regime. A draft of the program will be submitted for public
consultation by mid-June, 2011.

75.     Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of an ordinance
on the methodology for calculating the data to be provided when applying for guarantee of
origin certificates, their redemption, payment of any substitution fees, and confirmation of
data concerning the quantity of power generated through high efficiency cogeneration. One
of the important provisions of the ordinance would be to give preferential treatment to CHP
producers that use biogas from agricultural waste (the so-called “brown” certificates) or from
biogas produced from biomass as well as methane from coalmines (“purple” certificates).
Issuance of this ordinance has been somewhat delayed due to issues raised during the
consultative process related to the definition of the terms “high efficiency” and “forest
biomass” and, as far as the latter is concerned, the share of forest biomass allowed for energy
production since the wood industry uses the same stock. It is expected that this ordinance will
be introduced by mid- 2011.



                                              27
Policy Area III – Improvements in Demand-Side Energy Efficiency

76.     The Government has identified the deployment of Smart Grids (see Box 2 for a
description of Smart Grids) as a crucial instrument to enhance energy efficiency,
accelerate demand-side management, and support increased use of renewable energy
resources. Poland has earmarked PLN 550 million (US$187 million) for investment in the
country’s energy infrastructure from 2011 to 2018 in an effort to develop a nationwide Smart
Grid. The changes to the design of the network are expected to give the Polish energy sector
and the national power grid in particular, a boost similar to the impact of mobile phones and
the internet. The Smart Grid program is a process that involves feasibility studies, pilot
projects and investments that would boost energy efficiency and accommodate accelerated
use of renewable energy and distributed generation options. About 65% of the funding is to
be spent on smart grid infrastructure, while the remaining 35% will be invested directly in
renewable sources of energy or low-energy lighting.

77.     Governance of this process was formalized by the establishment of a Smart Grids
Working Group on December 17, 2010. The Working Group would identify, among others,
the necessary legislative and regulatory changes that would enable the accelerated deployment
of the smart metering program. Parliamentary support has already been established as they
have made Smart Grids a Parliamentary initiative by their Energy Sub-Committee. In support
of this initiative, the Parliament Sub-Committee for Energy plans to present a law on Smart
Grids as a parliamentary initiative by end-2011.

78.     The first component of the Smart Grids program will focus on the
implementation of Smart Meters as they are the interface point between suppliers and
customers thus enabling two-way communications. The expected benefits of Smart Meters
would accrue both to distribution companies (by decreasing the cost of meter reading and
improving access to market information) as well as to customers (by enabling them to reduce
costs by using appliances during the time of day when the cost of supply is low). A
comprehensive study of Smart Meters and related systems was completed in 2010. The
Energy Regulatory Office, followed this by drafting a Regulatory Statement on Smart Meters
for public consultation. Energa, a Government-owned vertically integrated power company,
has initiated the implementation of Smart Meters with their industrial customers and has
followed-up with procurement of Smart Meters, starting in November 2010. Full deployment
of Smart Meters is expected to take place by 2020.

79.    The Government has agreed with the Bank on Terms of Reference for a study to
undertake the next step in the process: the implementation of “Home Area Networks”
by customers. The study will address the communications protocols and legal and regulatory
framework needs to facilitate effective communications to residential customers and Small
and Medium Enterprises to foster the investment in energy savings devices. The study will
explore the need for open access to accommodate energy services expected and those that
may evolve. Customer privacy and system integrity issues will also be addressed.

80.    The following prior action is supported by the DPL:
Prior Action 3: The Borrower, through its Energy Regulatory Office, has issued a draft
Regulatory Statement which covers all the key areas of implementation of Smart
Meters, and, through the State-owned enterprise Energa, has initiated said
implementation.
                                             28
81.     Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of submitting a
Smart Grids Law to Parliament and issuing an ordinance defining the portion of smart meter
costs that can be included in the rate base. Enactment of the Smart Grid Law is expected to
take place in 2013.

                                       Box 2. Smart Grids

Why Smart Grids? The energy systems in place in many ECA countries need to be upgraded because
they are aging and outdated in many respects. Hence this is an opportune time to introduce Smart
Grids, a quantum leap forward to the best available current technology. The benefits of a Smart Grid
are substantial, focusing on the following five key value areas:
     Improves Reliability, by improving the quality of supply and reducing the likelihood and
        consequences of blackouts;
     Increases Efficiency, by reducing the cost to produce, deliver and consume electricity;
     Supports Economic Growth, by keeping downward pressure on energy prices; the economy
        becomes more productive/competitive improving prospects for jobs growth
     Decreases Environmental Impact, by reducing emissions through efficiency and by enabling a
        increased use of renewables and distributed generation; and
     Upgrades Security, by enabling grids to isolate and self-heal problems

What do Smart Grids do? Smart Grids:
   Enable active participation by consumers to evolving supply conditions. Increased consumer
      interaction with the grid bring benefits to the consumer, supplier and the environment;
   Accommodate varied generation and storage options. A broader diversity of resources can be
      dispatched, including new and cleaner power production, distributed generation and energy
      efficiency options. At the same time, the open-access configuration of the grid would reveal
      any inefficiencies that may exist;
   Provide quality power for the digital economy. Supply reliability can be tailored to the
      customer’s needs, particularly digital-grade power quality for those who need it;
   Optimize asset utilization and operates efficiently. Fuller utilization of assets enables supply
      costs to be reduced. Targeted maintenance programs result in fewer equipment failures;
   Anticipate and respond to system disturbances (self-healing). Continuous self-assessments
      will detect, analyze, respond to, and as needed, restore grid components or network sections;
   Operate resiliently against attack and natural disaster. The grid deters or withstands physical
      or cyber attack and improves public safety

What constitutes a Smart Grid? The following components are generally considered to be part of a
smart grid:
    Smart Meters are typically the starting point to enable supply/demand interoperability
    Customer Systems to enable the customer to reduce costs
    Demand Response Systems to enable improved system security
    Distribution Management System/Distribution Automation
    Transmission Enhancement Applications to improve reliability and decrease supply costs
    Asset/System Optimization enables suppliers to decrease their cost of doing business
    Distributed Energy Resources can be accommodated, reducing network costs
    Information and Communications Integration facilitates the delivery of related services

82.     The residential and services buildings sector in Poland accounts for about 40% of
final energy demand. Due to the country’s relatively cold climate and below-average
thermal insulation of buildings, a large share of this is used for heating (70%). Thus it is
clear that major energy savings can be obtained by focusing on improved thermal insulation
of buildings. This policy area is under the purview of the Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI).

                                                29
The Government has made grant funding for up to 16% of project costs available since 1999
through the Thermo-Modernization Fund, which is resourced from the State budget. Funding
was interrupted during fiscal 2010 as a result of pressures on the State budget. Poland has
energy efficiency standards for building components, but not a single energy standard for
entire buildings. It also introduced an energy performance of buildings certificate system.
Both the standards and the certificate system need tightening and better enforcement. The
Government is planning to do both in the context of transposing the EU’s recently recast
Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) of June 2010 and expects to complete
this process by mid-2012, as mandated by the Directive.

83.    The following prior action is supported by this DPL:
Prior Action 4: The Borrower has allocated PLN 200 million for financing the Thermo-
Modernization and Renovation Fund in fiscal year 2011. This was achieved through the
enactment of the Budget Law for 2011 of February 19, 2011 (Journal of Laws of the Republic
of Poland No. 29/2011, item 150).

84.     One of the major effects of the policy action is to enable the TMRFto resume
grant financing of eligible investments primarily for residential dwellings, especially
multi-apartment buildings where the needs are greatest. The Government is considering
allowing the TMRF to accept funding from sources other than just the State budget in order to
increase and stabilize its funding. Other funds, such as the National Environment Fund and
its regional funds, focus exclusively on buildings belonging to the regional and local levels of
government. Limited funds - mostly from the Green Investment Scheme (GIS) - are available
for energy efficiency investments in buildings belonging to the Central Government. In order
to expand funding for the latter category of buildings the Government is also considering
using grant financing from EU Operational Funds in addition to GIS funds, as well as balance
sheet financing by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs).

85.     Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of continuing to
provide adequate State budget allocations to the TMRF in each subsequent fiscal year. The
MoI is preparing an Act on the Energy Characteristics of Buildings, which would transpose
the recast EPBD into Polish law. Tighter energy performance of building standards and a
central registry for energy performance of buildings certificates and energy auditors would
form part of this Law (expected in mid 2012). Enactment of the Law is expected by
December 2013. In addition, MoI has started a study on the feasibility of implementing
“nearly zero energy” building standards in Poland by end-2020, as mandated by the EPBD. It
is considering a phased transition from the current average energy standard of buildings of
120 kWh/m2 to 30 kWh/m2 starting in 2021, which is believed to be the “nearly zero” energy
level for buildings in Poland. Finally, MoI plans to issue a brochure providing guidance to
consumers on how to easily obtain funding for a limited number of standardized energy
efficiency investments.

86.     The transport sector10 is currently responsible for 24% of final energy
consumption in Poland, i.e., the second largest energy consumer after the buildings
sector, and growing fast at an annual rate of 9 percent. The sector accounts for 12-13% of
Poland’s GHG emissions, 95% of which are caused by road transport. Their level is expected


10
     This sector is also under the purview of MoI.

                                                     30
to increase significantly without active policy measures on charging for road usage. The
current direct road user charging system is based on vignettes for heavy vehicles, i.e., time-
based charges that actually encourage maximum usage during the validity period of the
vignette and that do not sufficiently distinguish between heavily polluting and less polluting
vehicles. Hence, the system provides no incentive to reduce emissions and improve transport
efficiency. It also does not provide sufficient information on the level and structure of traffic
and hampers the development of tools to influence them.

87.     The following prior actions are supported by this DPL:
Prior Actions 5: The Borrower has implemented Electronic Tolling System (ETS)
charges for heavy vehicles on major national roads sections. This was achieved through
the issuance of the “Ordinance on National Roads or Sections on Which the Fee will be
Collected Electronically and the Rates of the Electronic Toll” of April 12, 2011 (Gazette
Number 77, item 417) and the “Ordinance on the Calculation of the Maximum Rate of
Electronic Toll” of April 15, 2011 (Gazette Number 80, item 433).

88.     Introduction of the ETS effective July 1, 2011 is expected to become an important
policy tool in managing heavy vehicle (trucks and buses) road transport demand.
Implementation will start on about 1,600 km of the national road network. The EU deals with
energy efficiency improvements for road transport by setting increasingly strict limits for
emissions, as opposed to setting average fuel efficiency standards. The proposed ETS is fully
compliant with current EU transport policies and related directives promoting “user pays” and
“polluter pays” principles and will include all direct costs related to road infrastructure. After
the first few years of operation of the system much more should be known about the ETS’
impact in terms of kind of vehicles that are using the roads, their frequency and the estimated
energy efficiency gains made as a result.

89.     Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of expansion of
the ETS network to about 2,900 km by 2014. Data generated by the ETS will enable
calculation of the energy efficiency benefits of the system.

Policy Area IV - Renewable Energy Action Plan

90.    In addition to decreasing GHG emissions through its EEP, the Government plans
to further decrease GHG emissions by channeling investments into renewable energy
resources11. Poland is limited in its opportunities for renewable energy as there are few
hydropower options, solar photovoltaic options are expensive given the sunlight availability
and intensity and windpower, although abundant in potential, still faces transmission
constraints. Its renewable energy program will focus on wind power, biogas and biomass.
Poland has initiated its support for its renewable energy program using market-based
instruments: green certificates for RE and brown certificates for cogeneration using biogas
from agricultural biomass. Introduction of purple certificates, to support cogeneration, using
biogas from forest biomass and coalmine methane, is under consideration.


11
   The Government has also active plans for decreasing emissions from its coal-fired power plants by using
circulating fluidized bed boilers (in operation) and Carbon Capture and Storage solutions (a pilot is proposed at
the large Belchatow lignite fired power plant) and through inter-fuel substitution, e.g., the proposed LNG
terminal in the North of the country.

                                                      31
91.     The renewable energy program started slowly, but has accelerated considerably
in the recent past. Biomass and wind power applications have increased their energy
delivery seven-fold in the past five years, albeit from a low base. The current share of RE in
final energy consumption is 7.2% (2009), while Poland’s EU target is 15.0% by 2020. As the
legal and regulatory framework continues to evolve to support further growth, it is expected
that Poland’s 2020 target, although challenging, is achievable.

92.     The National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) is designed to guide
investments that would enable Poland to meet its agreed EU target of 15.0% of final
energy consumption from RE sources by 2020. It outlines the specific measures to be taken
in different sectors – electricity, heating, cooling and transport, and foresees financial support
for renewable energy. The NREAP identifies 32 policy actions that are designed to support
implementation of renewable energy projects, all but one of which is in place. The NREAP
sets out annual targets for renewable energy production up to 2020 when its 15.0% target is
meant to be achieved. The existing green certificates program, established in 2005, is
designed to facilitate the implementation of renewable energy options by obligating energy
suppliers to meet annual renewable energy targets or pay a sizeable penalty (the “substitution
fee”) currently set at about €65/MWh. As Poland has limited hydropower and geothermal
potential, wind power, biogas and biomass are expected to be the primary sources of new
renewable energy. Limited solar applications for water and space heating are also expected to
grow.

93.    The following policy action is supported by this DPL:
Prior Action 6: The Borrower has submitted its National Renewable Energy Action Plan
to the European Commission, thereby detailing its commitment of at least 15.0% of
renewable energy use by 2020. This was achieved by Decision of its Council of Ministers
dated December 7, 2010.

94.    Additional supporting actions over the medium term would consist of approval of a
draft Renewable Energy Law by the Council of Ministers and submission to Parliament by
mid-2012. Enactment of the RE Law is expected to take place by December 2013.

                        VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

95.     Through its support to the strengthening and implementation of the energy
efficiency policies, regulations, and measures, this DPL-and the four policy areas that
comprise the program are expected to have overall positive poverty and social impacts
on consumers and the population at large. The programs and the policies that they support
are expected to help: (i) improve the efficiency of the energy sector, which is likely to reduce
the real cost of the provision of energy services, and thus have a positive effect on
affordability; (ii) enable significant energy efficiency and renewable energy investments that
would increase demand for local “green jobs” and thus stimulate economic development; and
(iii) reduce air pollution, thereby mitigating its impacts on human health. The program
strengthens the framework for long-term sustainable growth across the economy and in the
energy sector in particular. Some reforms, however, may have an unintended detrimental
effect on certain social groups in the short-term.

                                               32
96.     One of the potential negative short-term social impacts is related to the
implementation of the White Certificate Program. According to GoP, the cost resulting
from implementation the program will lead to an increase of energy prices in the order of 1.5
to 2 percent. Analytical work carried out by Ministry of Economy indicates that these short-
term costs are expected to be compensated by the energy savings arising from energy
efficiency investments within 1 to 3 years12. Although the expected increase in energy prices
is modest, it is likely to have a relatively greater impact on the poor.

97.     The estimated increase of 2 percent in energy prices would have a minimal
impact on household welfare, even for more vulnerable households. A quantitative
analysis of the distributional impact of the estimated increase in energy prices found that the
impact of such increases on household welfare, approximated by the consumer surplus
change, is estimated to be equivalent to 0.3 percent of household disposable income. 13 The
distributional impact of such an increase would be rather uniform across quintiles, even
though, as far as electricity expenditures are concerned, those in the bottom quintile would
suffer proportionally more than those in the top quintile. Relatively higher losses would also
be recorded for elderly households (defined as households where all members are over 65).
The poverty rate would rise by at most 0.6 percentage points in the short run.14 The estimated
increase would be highest in two regions (Lubelskie and Podlaskie, where the increase in the
poverty rate would be of 1.2 and 1.5 percentage points respectively) where poverty is already
high.

98.    The modest impact on the most vulnerable groups would be offset by a new
support mechanism, and the impact on household welfare overall is expected to be
short-term. The Government recently adopted a social assistance program for electricity
consumers, consisting of a 30 percent discount on energy tariffs for households which qualify
for means tested social assistance. This new support mechanism will help cushion the impact
of the short term rise in tariffs on the poor. Further, when the energy savings benefits of
energy investments begin to materialize, household energy expenditures can be expected to be
reduced, thus resulting in a positive impact on household incomes within 3 years.

99.    Ongoing monitoring of the impact of the program will be supported by additional
analytic work on energy efficiency and poverty and social impact by the Bank. A study
has been initiated to explore both costs and potential lost opportunities from EE investments,
focusing on the poor, and to make recommendations on how they could be addressed.
Specifically, the study will: (i) capture perceptions of poor residents on affordability of
energy efficiency investments; (ii) assess perceived benefits and disadvantages of the TMRF

   The quantitative analysis in this section adopts a consumption based poverty measure of 5 USD a day, based on
the Household Budget Survey for 2009, which is the latest household survey available. Compared to an
incidence of 25 percent for the overall ECA region according to the ECAPOV measurement, Poland’s poverty
incidence is moderate (average of 12.5 percent). Poverty incidence is much higher in rural areas (18 percent)
than urban ones (9 percent). Poverty is concentrated mainly in 3 regions, where the incidence is higher than 17
percent (Lubelskie, Podlaskie and Swietokrzyskie). Alternative assumptions on the price elasticities were

as a financing mechanism; (iii) identify coping strategies of the poor in the face of high
energy costs as percent of their income; (iv) analyze the policies and institutions that currently
provide support with energy affordability; (v) assess the conditions under which lower-
income consumers would be more willing to invest in EE measures; and (vi) review the
institutional and policy channels that can potentially support EE for low-income groups.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

100.     The program to be supported by Poland Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Energy DPL is not expected to result in negative environmental impacts. To the contrary,
the program is likely to have positive effects on the environment and natural resources. By
supporting the Government’s Energy Policy to 2030, the proposed DPL supports Poland’s
efforts to develop Energy Efficiency Strategy and update legal framework to enable the
strategy to be implemented, strengthens institutional setting for: (a) decreasing the supply-side
energy use through increased use of cogeneration (Government intends to double the share of
cogeneration in power supply by 2020 as compared to 2006), (b) improvements in demand-
side energy efficiency through enabling acceleration of demand-side management, loss
reduction through implementation of the smart grid and eliminating barriers to higher energy
savings in buildings, transport sector reforms to support energy efficiency improvements, and
(d) increasing the use of renewable energy.

101. The proposed DPL is expected to accelerate energy efficiency and renewable
energy interventions with a number of environmental benefits: decreasing GHG
emissions will address the climate change agenda; decreasing SOx, NOx and particulates
will address human health risks and local and regional air quality issues; decreased need
for cooling water from thermal power plants will decrease environmental impacts on
water systems. Possible negative impacts from new construction are limited as much of the
energy efficiency improvements are expected to be caused by improving the effectiveness of
building envelopes. Modernization and construction of high efficiency energy generation
facilities and reducing energy losses in electricity and heat distribution networks under 2007
to 2013 Infrastructure and Environment Operations Program and Regional Operations
Program of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan will be made in accordance with
Poland Environmental Standards (comprehensive environmental impact assessment), which
follow EU principles and are thus expected to be acceptable.

102. Regulatory environment and institutional capacity in Poland is considered
adequate to minimize and mitigate possible negative environmental impacts that could
arise from scaling up wind power and the use of biomass energy. Construction and
operation of wind farms and biomass energy units are subject to the Polish Environmental
Protection Law (EPL, April 2001), according to which, wind farms and biomass energy units
are subjected to an Environmental Impact Assessment. The environmental suitability of the
location of wind farms is governed by the EPL as well as the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC),
the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC), the Nature Conservation Act (NCA, April 2004) which are
expected to mitigate the environmental risks. Potential threats to forests sustainability due to
expanded use of biomass from forests is expected to be mitigated by sustainable forestry
practices, stipulated by Polish forestry legislation. The Polish Forestry Act adopted in 1991
and amended in 1997 extends forest management beyond the individual stand to the entire
ecosystem. Improvements in the legal system are designed to accelerate and intensify efforts
to adjust environmental protection laws to EU standards, to have a legal basis for co-operation
                                               34
with other sectors of the economy, and to provide a legal and financial basis for supporting
costs of conserving biodiversity. Also, the State Forestry Policy of Poland, which was
approved by the Council of Ministers in 1997, covers the period to 2030 and is fully
consistent with the EU Forestry Strategy. Finally, the NATURA 2000 Program will impose
limitations on availability of biomass for energy units.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

103. The Bank team’s studies of Best Practices in the EU consistently point to the need
for good governance, starting from the highest levels so that words can be followed with
actions and oversight. In these countries, energy efficiency has become part of the social
fabric with most of civil society involved in improving energy use. The proposed DPL is
designed to start this process, knowing that it takes years, if not decades, to mold cultural
norms. An Inter-Ministerial Team consisting of government departments playing leading
roles in the implementation of the energy policy (including energy efficiency) has been
established by Ordinance of the Prime Minister in June 2010. This is the correct first step as
the effort has to start at the top. The Ministry of Economy has received a clear mandate and
authority to implement energy efficiency policies and programs and to constitute specialized
working groups within the Inter-Ministerial Team. The main ministries and agencies involved
in the implementation of EE policies and measures mainly: Ministry of Economy, Ministry of
Infrastructure and regional and local governments (transport and buildings sectors), Ministry
of the Environment (climate policy), Polish National Energy Conservation Agency (KAPE),
and the Ministry of Finance, the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water
Management and regional funds (financial support). The establishment of the Inter-Ministerial
Team has helped to improve coordination both within and across levels of Government by
avoiding duplication. The coordination Team is also expected to help fill the existing gap in
respect to tracking implementation progress and identifying actions to fine-tune
implementation processes and incorporate the lessons learnt into future policies and programs.
In addition, a working group within the Inter-Ministerial Team addressing heat cost allocation
issues within multi-dwelling buildings was recently created by ordinance of the Minister of
Economy.

104. EU countries that have successfully addressed their energy efficiency and
renewable energy targets have focused on good governance including: (i) setting targets,
both long-term and interim; (ii) analyzing impediments to meeting these targets and providing
incentive to overcome them; (iii) monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the
program; and (iv) adjusting policies, as necessary to ensure that targets are met. The
Government has successfully addressed (i), made important progress in (ii) and (iv) but has as
yet limited capacity to accomplish (iii). The Ministry of Economy outsources much of the
monitoring and evaluation responsibilities for the energy efficiency program to KAPE. Given
the current fiscal constraints, adequate oversight of the implementation of the energy
efficiency program will remain a challenge and efforts should be made to ensure adequate
outside funding of KAPE based on best practice examples from other EU-15 countries.

105. Monitoring and evaluation of program implementation progress and of the
performance indicators included in the DPL matrix is complicated by the fact that many
of the actions supported by this DPL will only show tangible results after a number of
years. For this reason it has been decided to show both short-term monitoring indicators
(May 2012; program closure) to the extent feasible as well as more meaningful medium term
                                             35
indicators (May 2014). It is anticipated that supervision missions will monitor actions and
review progress in the implementation of the DPL until the program’s closure. These
supervision missions, and the update of the Country Partnership Strategy, will also allow the
Bank to continue providing policy advice and technical support to the Government
departments and institutions involved in the implementation of the sector’s reform program.
Further support for the implementation of the Government’s medium and longer term EE and
RE agenda, either in the form of a second DPL, Results-Based Operation or Technical
Assistance, is yet to be decided.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

106. The fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland’s public financial
management system and use of budget resources is low. As part of its accession process to
the EU, Poland has achieved significant progress in reforming its public financial
management system (PFM).15 It has upgraded its legislative framework, in line with the EU
acquis, introduced an internal audit function, and prepared for the EU accreditation process of
fund-managing agencies. Poland has also made significant improvements related to the public
availability and coverage of fiscal information, particularly the adequacy of accounting and
reporting standards (according to the ESA 95 format), and regularity of reconciliations of
bank accounts.

107. The PFM reform agenda based on the new 2009 law on public finance with an
additional amendment in 2010 enhanced budget transparency, predictability and
performance-orientation over the medium term. It introduced performance-oriented four
year rolling budget planning with binding annual budget, integration of most of the extra
budgetary funds within the State Budget, and strengthened internal control over public
expenditures and debt via new regulations on corrective actions triggered by debt thresholds.
These reforms are currently being implemented, including the phased introduction of
performance based budgeting (PBB). PBB involves technical challenges like changes in the
financial control framework including accountability, updated and compatible budget
classification, accounting and reporting systems, and an integrated financial management
information system. MOF is currently implementing EU supported multiyear 2008-2015
performance budgeting program to develop and implement monitoring and evaluation system
with well defined performance indicators, the harmonization of accounting and reporting
practices, the IT system integrating existing systems. Both the 2009 state budget expenditures
and planned state budget expenditures for 2011 in PBB format were publicly available in
2010.

108. Other areas of ongoing reform include cash management. The 2010 amendment of
the law on public finance introduced further consolidation of the cash management by
compulsory or voluntary depositing of the temporary free cash resources of public sector
entities to the MOF accounts. This aims at more efficient cash liquidity management and
limiting public debt. The current computerized system of the state budget TREZOR linked
with the National Bank of Poland’s accounting system encompasses all tier state budget
holders allowing for direct coordination of pending payment orders and cash availability.


15
 The status of the PFM was derived from the World Bank’s ongoing monitoring of PFM reform and diagnostic
works conducted by the Bank and external organizations including IMF.

                                                  36
MOF plans to integrate TREZOR with the newly planned central IT system which will
support reporting in PBB format.

109. In the area of external audit, Poland is advanced in terms of the availability of
the audit reports to the public, independence of the Supreme Audit Office (NIK) from
the executive, and control of the NIK budget, providing a well functioning public
financial accountability and assurance mechanism for the legislature and the public. The
law on Supreme Audit Office amended in December 2010 introduces further enhancement in
the documenting results of the audits, functional organization, rotation and recruitment of
directors, requirement of external audit covering the execution of the NIK’s budget and its
financial management. The 2009 law on public finance also introduced the requirement that
the annual financial statements prepared by large local governments be audited by
independent statutory auditors.

110. Overall assessment of PFM is satisfactory taking into account ongoing
implementation of the reforms in PBB, internal control, internal and external audit,
integration of the IT systems and cash management. Further areas to be focused on in
reforming of PFM should include transparency of financial and fiscal reporting including
further integration of the remaining extra budgetary funds within the budget, accrual based
budgets, and phased introduction of consolidated balance sheet of the state budget and public
sector based on IPSAS.

111. The National Bank of Poland is part of the European System of Central Banks.
NBP accounting and reporting policies are defined by the Monetary Council Policy, and shall
be in line the guidelines of the European Central Bank. Its financial management and
operations are transparently disclosed and presented on its website. An independent auditor
selected by the Monetary Policy Council regularly audits the NBP’s annual financial
statements. The most recently available audit reports (for 2004-2009) have unqualified audit
opinions and were approved by the Monetary Policy Council. In 2010 the Monetary Council
Policy introduced changes into NBP’s accounting policy related to valuation of foreign
currency transactions, debt securities’ discounts and premiums, and reserves to cover the
fluctuation risk of polish zloty against foreign currencies. No significant issues emerged from
the review of the IMF latest limited scope safeguards report of 2009.

112. Overall, the fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland’s public financial
management system and use of budget resources and its foreign exchange environment
as controlled by the Central Bank is low.


PROCUREMENT ASPECTS

113. The Polish public procurement system was first introduced in 1995, when the Act
on Public Procurement of June 1994 went into force. The Bank prepared in 2000, the Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for Poland that provided an action plan to improve
the public procurement system by increasing transparency and competitiveness. This
accelerated the Government’s efforts in public procurement reform and resulted several
changes among which enactment of new public procurement law, establishment of
independent Public Procurement Office, establishment of independent complaint handling
authority etc. Even though the CPAR is now outdated, it was the starting point for the
                                              37
continuing dialogue with the Government in the area of public procurement. Since then, the
Bank maintained a close dialogue with Poland by reviewing and commenting on several
versions of the Public Procurement Law.

114. Although the legislation on public procurement generally met the international
standards regarding public procurement practices, it was necessary to draft a new
legislation fully compatible with the EU Directives given the Poland’s prospects for
accession to the EU. On June 2001, a new Act on Public Procurement was enacted, which
took into consideration most of the CPAR recommendations. Since one of the weaknesses of
the Polish public procurement system is the lack of standard bidding documents as underlined
in the CPAR, the Government of Poland requested an IDF grant for the preparation of these
standard bidding documents and forms of contracts. An IDF Grant of $150,000 was provided
in December 2001 for this purpose. Until the closing date of May 2005; the Grant succeeded
in assisting the Government in drafting its national standard bidding documents, standard
forms of contracts, guidance material including training of significant number of procuring
entities on the implementation of relevant legislation. However, due to frequent changes in the
public procurement legislation, these documents are now outdated and not used. To fully align
the Polish public procurement system with EU requirements, the legislation the Public
Procurement Law (PPL) was enacted on January 2004 and amended substantially five times
until January 2010 (in 2006, 2007, 2008 and twice in 2009) based on experiences gained with
the implementation of the Law.

DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

115. Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one single tranche to the foreign currency
national budget account at the National Bank of Poland (Central Bank). This account
forms part of the foreign currency reserves of the country. Disbursement will be made upon
declaration of loan effectiveness and submission of a withdrawal application to IBRD. At the
request of the MOF, IBRD will deposit the proceeds of the loan into the foreign currency
national budget account indicated by the Government that forms part of the budget
management system of the country. The proposed loan will follow the Bank’s disbursement
procedures for development policy lending. Disbursements will not be linked to specific
purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The Government shall
maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit of loan proceeds in the NBP. If the
loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the loan agreement, IBRD will
require the borrower to refund the amount directly to IBRD.

116. No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not require
an audit of the Deposit account but will require the Government to provide confirmation to
the Bank in the form of an official letter from the Ministry of Finance on the amounts
deposited in the foreign currency account within 30 days of receiving the funds.

RISKS AD RISK MITIGATION

117. The matrix below sets out a set of key risks, and their mitigating measures that
may be anticipated as part of the program supported by the proposed Poland Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy DPL. The matrix focuses on economic, fiscal,
regulatory, institutional, environmental, and social risks that reflect both the breath of the
policy initiatives as well as the depth of the sectoral reforms. One of the primary risk
                                              38
mitigation factors is that Poland’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy targets are
binding EU commitments and must be met by 2020. The National Energy Efficiency Action
Plan and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, mentioned in Section V of this report,
are EU reporting requirements and management tools and must be revised and updated at
regular intervals based on actual results achieved. Progress made, or lack thereof, will be
critically reviewed and reported on by the EC to the European Parliament and Council. In
case of shortfalls in meeting its interim targets, Poland will be asked by the EC to take
corrective action to ensure that its national targets, and the EU’s targets as a whole, are being
met.

118. The matrix outlines not only the risks of immediate concern covering the on-year
timeframe of the DPL, but also addresses the risks pertaining to the medium and long-
term sustainability of the Government’s reform agenda.

Economic and Fiscal Risks                            Mitigation Measure

A worsening in the external environment could The reduction of the fiscal deficit from 7.9 percent

                                               bases. The main fiscal measures were adopted as
                                               part of the 2011 budget, with the exception of the
                                               reduction in transfers to private pension funds and
                                               the new rule to limit local government borrowing.

The following is the Chairman’s statement from the January 21, 2011 consideration of the
FCL by the Board of the IMF:

Poland’s macroeconomic performance was strong in the decade leading up to the global
crisis, supported by sound economic policies. Inflation was brought down to low single digits,
the commitment to the EU Stability and Growth Pact helped lower the fiscal deficit relative to
GDP and limit government debt, and strong financial oversight bolstered the resilience of the
financial system.

Strong policy frameworks allowed the authorities to undertake countercyclical monetary and
fiscal policies in response to the global crisis, while preserving financial sector stability. At
the same time, the FCL arrangement supported investor confidence. As a result, Poland was
the only EU economy to avoid a recession in 2009, and the government maintained access to
international capital markets on favorable terms.

The economy gathered momentum in 2010, underpinned by low interest rates, a neutral fiscal
stance, improving external demand, and rising confidence in the wake of the second FCL
arrangement. Looking forward, economic growth is projected to remain solid and balanced.
The authorities are committed to keep implementing economic policies that preserve
macroeconomic stability.

However, sizeable downside risks remain, particularly from the possibility of further
spillovers of financial turbulence in other parts of Europe. Against this background, the
Executive Board today approved the authorities’ request for a new arrangement under the
FCL facility as a successor to the previous arrangement approved in July 2010. The
authorities intend to continue to treat the FCL arrangement as precautionary.

The augmented duration and size of this successor FCL—new features made possible by the
recent reform of IMF facilities—will allow the FCL to play an even stronger role in insuring
Poland against external risks while continuing to support the authorities’ overall
macroeconomic strategy.
