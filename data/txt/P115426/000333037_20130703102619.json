    Poland were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: a programmatic DPL with several\n            installments will likely have enabled further progress on\n            the policy agenda. While the Government appears to be\n            meeting its energy efficiency and renewable energy targets,\n            the pace of energy efficiency reforms has slowed down\n            somewhat after the DPL was approved. As this DPL\n            demonstrates, it is possible to deliver reforms even under\n            circumstances where achieving political consensus is at\n            times challenging; a programmatic DPL could have been\n            helpful in ensuring the sustainability of the reforms and\n            supporting further actions. The breadth and depth of the DPL\n            objectives stretched the capacity of the Government to\n            deliver. A DPL series could have helped alleviate this\n            constraint. For a single, one-off DPL it will have been\n            preferable if the agenda centered on only few of the most\n            important policies. Furthermore, it will have been also\n            helpful if some of the specific energy efficiency analytical\n            work currently under way would have been carried out already\n            prior to the preparation of the DPL."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
