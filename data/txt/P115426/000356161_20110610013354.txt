    Republic of Poland: Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Development Policy Loan
                                             (DPL)

                                 SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

                               Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                           June 7, 2011


        The Executive Directors approved the loan in the amount of EUR 750 million (US$ 1.11
billion equivalent) for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Development Policy Loan
(DPL) to the Republic of Poland on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s
Memorandum (R2011-0123).

       Directors expressed support for the DPL and its overarching objective of significantly
reducing energy intensity while simultaneously increasing the share of renewable energy. They
recognized Poland’s considerable progress in energy efficiency, but noted that the original
momentum has not been fully sustained, and significant untapped potential, especially in the
housing sector, remains. The importance of mitigating implementation risks and designing a
program that would assist the poor in coping with the negative social impacts of increased
energy prices was also emphasized.
