1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Aral Sea Disaster: Once the world’s fourth largest lake, the Aral Sea has
been steadily shrinking since the 1960s after the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya Rivers were
channeled and dammed to provide irrigation to agriculture. Today the Aral Sea is ten per
cent of its original size. Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions in Uzbekistan, due to their
proximity to the Aral Sea and their location at the tail-end of major command areas, were
hit hardest both in terms of agricultural yields and health. The receding sea left huge
plains covered with salt and toxic dust – the results of pesticides and fertilizer used in
cotton production – which were picked up and carried by the wind causing health
problems for the population, as well as reducing agricultural productivity due to land and
water salinization. The people in these regions suffered from high levels of anemia,
together with rising levels of tuberculosis, liver, kidney and respiratory diseases, and
cancer. In Karakalpakstan the fishing industry that once employed tens of thousands of
people was gone, and agricultural land was no longer productive, leading to a rapid loss
of employment opportunities for local people.

2.      The Drainage, Irrigation and Wetlands Improvement Phase I Project
(DIWIP) was part of the Aral Sea Basin Program (ASBP) approved by the heads of
five Central Asian States in 1994 that recognized the urgency of the Aral Sea crisis and
sought assistance from international donors. As part of ASBP, the International Fund for
the Aral Sea (IFAS) was established as an apex organization for coordinating ASBP
implementation, attracting international attention to this environmental disaster, and
mobilizing financing to address the problems, in particular surrounding the Sea. In the
context of interstate cooperation in the Amu Darya basin, an important feature of the
project was that it would help Uzbekistan to comply with an agreement it signed with
Turkmenistan regarding the joint and rational use of Amu Darya water resources. The
agreement required that both countries would stop discharging drainage water from both
banks of the Amu Darya starting from 1999. With the project, Uzbekistan was expected
to close the Beruniy station, which pumped saline drainage effluent into the Amu Darya,
and instead dispose this saline effluent by gravity towards the Aral Sea.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

3.     Background: At appraisal Uzbekistan was an upper low income, doubly-
landlocked country strategically located in the heart of Central Asia. During the 1990s the
country enjoyed the best performance of all former Soviet republics, but after the re-
imposition of foreign exchange control in 1996, reforms slowed, and since 2000
Uzbekistan lagged behind other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) in terms of economic growth rates1. The country’s economic record was subject to
controversy over the reliability of official statistics, and whether its development path
was sustainable. Strong remnants of the Soviet system for controlling information flows
severely restricted public access to information. The overall lack of limited statistical data

 Pomfret, Richard (2007), “Distortions to Agricultural Incentives in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan”

                                                    1
available in Uzbekistan was a serious constraint to analyzing the country’s
macroeconomic and structural reform performance. Based on official statistics, the
country had seen steady growth of around 5 percent annually since the mid-1990s and
recorded relative macroeconomic stability. The Bank analysis, however, suggested that
job opportunities remained limited and the poverty rate was high2.

4.      “Strategic Crops” as Constraints to Rural Incomes: Agriculture was, and still
remains, the backbone of the Uzbek economy. At project appraisal stage, it accounted for
35% of GDP, 60% of foreign exchange receipts, and 45% of employment 3 . Yet
agricultural productivity growth and incomes were constrained by significant state
intervention. The Government, in pursuit of its objectives of stabilizing cotton export
revenues and achieving wheat self-sufficiency, maintained state controls over “strategic
crops” – cotton and wheat – which accounted for 80 percent of cultivated land4. The state
also intervened through pricing, exchange rate and procurement policies. While the
implicit taxation of agriculture had been reduced, primarily by narrowing in the gap
between the prices paid for state procurement and international prices, it still remained
significant. Taxation took place mainly through exchange rate policies. A sizeable
amount of tax revenues were returned to the agricultural sector in the form of subsidies,
the most substantial of which were irrigation subsidies and periodic debt write-offs.
However, agricultural enterprises, especially involved in cotton, regularly incurred losses.
Price distortions combined with mandatory cropping patterns led to inefficient output mix
and land use5.

5.      From Kolkhozes to Shirkats and Dehkan Farms: By 2000, approximately half
of the kolkhozes or Soviet era collective farms were transformed into shirkats or
cooperatives. In spite of the replacement of collective farms by shirkats, these rural
enterprises were still subject to many of the same centrally planned mechanisms (output
targets, state supplied inputs, mandated planting times, etc.) and strongly resembled the
farm enterprise they replaced. The period since 2000, and especially 2001, had also seen
the liquidation of unprofitable shirkats and their conversion into private farms. By March
2003, there were more than 80,000 private farms covering about 1 million hectares (or
25%) of arable land. This period of farm restructuring had led to the loss of jobs in the
enterprise sector from the transformation of the collective farms into shirkats
(approximately 150,000 workers), and the liquidation of shirkats (approximately 250,000
workers) 6 . Despite rural enterprise restructuring, a number of avenues of increasing
productivity, crop diversity, and rural incomes were blocked off because of poor
incentives within the collective farms.

6.    Shallow Groundwater Levels (GWL), Drainage, and Soil Salinization as
Hurdles to Irrigated Agriculture: Agriculture in Uzbekistan is highly dependent on

irrigation. The deteriorated status of irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems, shallow
GWL and soil salinization in the country posed additional challenges for agricultural
growth and productivity. About one-third of all irrigated land in Uzbekistan had a
shallow GWL. Further, one-third of irrigated land in the country was estimated to be
already saline, with resulting decreases in crop yields of about 30%. The area with
“highly saline” soils had increased by 27% over the 1993-2003. The soils in the region
had already inherent saline characteristics but the problem was exacerbated by irrigation
induced salinity and the movement of salts in the soil from capillary rise. One of the
major problems was that the drainage systems were inadequate. Most of the irrigation
systems developed during the Soviet era in the 1960s and 1970s were constructed in haste
and generally lacked adequate field drainage. As a consequence large amounts of water
for “leaching” were used to keep the soil salinity below the root zone. A large part of this
water was used to flush the salts from the soil surface and a substantial portion (often
about 40% of the total amount diverted) disappeared into the surface drainage system. In
this process, the high water table was perpetuated, the process of soil salinization
continued, and the leaching process had to be repeated each season.

7.       Low Water Use Efficiency: The water use efficiency in the irrigation sector was
extremely low at around 30% with some estimates as low as 25%. The main reasons for
low water use efficiency were thought to be: (a) a lack of incentives for farmers; (b)
inadequate drainage, resulting in waterlogging and soil salinity requiring large water
applications for leaching and ever higher land salinization. This was compounded by (a)
deteriorated I&D infrastructure; (b) poor irrigation practices due to poorly graded fields,
long furrows, reliance on shallow groundwater levels for meeting crop water
requirements between the long irrigation application intervals; and (c) inadequate
institutional capacity for proper management, operation and maintenance (O&M) and a
lack of O&M charges or cost recovery.

8.      DIWIP – a Prioritized Project by the Government and Bank: Comprehensive
strategies and massive plans to tackle the country’s severe salinity and drainage problems
were prepared in the second half of the 80s. However, few of these plans were
implemented because funding for the proposed works dried up with the break-up of the
Soviet Union. The Bank had assisted the Government in evaluating and prioritizing the
various proposals for providing drainage in irrigated areas on the right bank of the Amu
Darya in Kashkadarya, Bukhara and Karakalpakstan. This project was the first phase of a
program of investments that included selective interventions to improve drainage in
South Karakalpakstan in the lower Amu Darya. The overall series of investments
(including the new South Karakalpakstan Water Resources Management Improvement
project that is currently under preparation) were expected to improve water use
efficiency, reduce the amount of drainage water generated, provide safe disposal of the
drainage effluent, and hence over time improve the Amu Darya water quality in its lower
reaches. The project also intended to improve institutional aspects of O&M by
establishing Water User Associations (WUAs) to be responsible for O&M within former
kolkhozes. These critical improvements in the management of I&D systems were
believed to contribute to increasing crop production, reducing poverty and improving
living standards. The project was fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy

                                             3
(CAS) of FY2002-04, and supported one of the four key objectives, i.e. to assist
Uzbekistan in maintaining and improving the efficiency of the country’s extensive
irrigation and drainage infrastructure.

9.      Karakalpakstan: Before the Project - Prior to the project, Karakalpakstan was
listed among three poorest regions in Uzbekistan with the poverty rate of 32 percent
higher than the national average7. The desiccation of the Aral Sea and the damage to the
river deltas continued to result in serious economic, social, human and animal health, and
environmental consequences. In addition, conditions for agricultural production in the
region had deteriorated due to waterlogging and salinity caused by inadequately designed
drainage disposal systems and a declining irrigation infrastructure. At project preparation
in Khorezm and Karakalpakstan, in the Amu Darya delta, more than 80 percent of the
irrigated area was affected by shallow ground water level (GWL). In the lower reaches of
the Amu Darya, potable drinking water was also in short supply. The situation had
declined further in the aftermath of two consecutive years of drought in 2001-02 in
Karakalpakstan resulting in two years of crop failure that had undermined the local
economy which was dependent on agriculture. Ultimately, all above challenges faced by
the region required immediate attention and intervention to avert environmental and
human disasters.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

10.    The project development objective was three pronged and formulated as: (1) To
increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture, employment and incomes in
Karakalpakstan, one of the poorest regions in Central Asia; (2) To improve water quality
of the Amu Darya river by safe disposal of the drainage effluent, and enhance quality of
wetlands in the Amu Darya delta; and (3) To develop the institutions for improving water
management, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation and drainage systems,
and for promoting sustainable irrigated agriculture through participatory irrigation
management.

11.     The progress towards achieving the development objective was measured through
the following key performance indicators of the water management services, quality of
land resources and agriculture production:
     Agriculture Production: Agriculture production increases for main crops.
     Drainage and Soil Salinity: Reduction in area with shallow groundwater level
        and soil salinity.
     Reliability: Ratio between actual amounts of water supplied to the project area
        and the demand planned water supply for the project area on a weekly, monthly
        and annual basis.

      Efficiency: Increased canal conveyance efficiency to the former sovkhozes and
       kolkhozes (FSKs) and increased efficiency within the FSKs, and reduced
       discharges of drainage water.
      Sustainability: Number of Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) established in the
       project area. O&M budget for irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems rehabilitated.

    and reasons/justification

The PDO was never revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The project beneficiaries were the residents of the tumans of Beruniy, Ellikala and
Turtkul in Karakalpakstan covered by the works to be completed under the project. Land
owners and farmers, WUAs (later re-named to Water Consumer Associations/WCAs),
and local water management authorities were the primary beneficiaries of the project.
However benefits also accrued to the region from preservation of cultural sites near the
historic town of Khiva as well as the Badai Tugai protected area. Benefits further accrue
to the populations along the Amu Darya as the reduced salinity in the water helps also
with drinking water along the river. The slow flow and percolation of drainage effluents
of the Akchadarya Main Drain (AMD) through the wetlands along the Jana Darya was
expected to ultimately improve water quality in the Aral Sea and for the residents close
by.

1.5 Original Components

Component A: South Karakalpakstan Drainage Disposal System (Cost US$51.8
million).

13.     The drainage effluent from South Karakalpakstan (SK) was disposed of to the
Aral Sea by connecting the existing collector drains in the area to the formerly partially
constructed South Karakalpakstan Main Collector (SKMC), which took this effluent to
the AMD, which was partly constructed but required completion. The major drain thus
formed, namely the South Karakalpakstan Main Drain (SKMD), was the backbone of the
drainage system in SK, starting near the Amu Darya in the east and running along the
northern boundary of the project area and then conveying the drainage effluent to the
Aral Sea. The existing collectors connecting to the SKMD were cleaned and rehabilitated
in order for the whole drainage system to work effectively. The overview of the project
area is provided in Annex 9.

14.    South Karakalpakstan Main Collector (SKMC). Works for the about 100 km
long SKMC included: (a) remodeling the Beruniy collector drain (CD) [2 1.8 km], which
used to drain into the Amu Darya, by reversing its flow towards the Akchadarya, thus
eliminating the need for the Beruniy pumping station; (b) linking the Beruniy CD with
the Ayazkala CD, mostly through the existing EK-2 and Kyzylkum CDs (in total 35.4

                                            5
km), which for that purpose was enlarged; thus eliminating the need for the Kyzylkum
pumping station; (c) enlarging the Ayazkala CD (43.5 km) up to its outfall in the
Akchadarya. The design capacity of the SKMC was set at 25m3/s at its junction with the
AMD. The SKMC flow passed through the two existing Kurgashinkala wetlands, which
combined to develop a larger wetland. Additional works for regulating the flows to, and
water levels in these wetlands were carried out to enhance the environmental,
biodiversity and social worth of these wetlands.

15.     Akchadarya Main Drain (AMD). The AMD connected the SKMC with the Jana
Darya, an old (dry) river bed of the Syr Darya which runs to the Aral Sea. The AMD
mainly followed the Akchadarya channel (an old Amu Darya river bed) over a length of
about 200 km. Its construction had been partially completed over a stretch of about 40
km, starting from its junction with the SKMC; construction was mostly completed for the
next stretch of about 80 km, while construction on the remaining 80 km up to the Jana
Darya were completed by the project. Works to be carried out for the SKMC and the
AMD included channel excavation, channel protection works to prevent breaches that
could damage the actively grazed rangeland or important archaeological sites; providing
crossings for livestock; wetland control structures, and; the provision of hydrometric
gauging stations.

16.    Improvements to Collector Drains (CDs). Selective improvements were made to
the main and secondary CDs in South Karakalpakstan (in the Beruniy, Ellikala and
Turtkul Tumans). The works consisted of general CD cleaning, deepening where
required, removal of constrictions, hydraulic and protection works at the junctions with
the SKMC, and selective rehabilitation of other related canal structures.

Component B: Irrigation Improvements and Command Area Development (Cost
US$15.0 million).

17.     The main objective of the I&D component was to promote sustainable irrigated
agriculture in SK through rehabilitation and improvements in the I&D infrastructure and
technical assistance (TA) to improve reliability and efficiency of irrigation and drainage
systems. The component consisted of the development of participatory irrigation
management, rehabilitation of key irrigation infrastructure; I&D improvements within the
areas managed by the WUAs, improving O&M and water management, and the
promotion of improved irrigation and agricultural practices. Technical assistance was
provided to achieve these objectives.

18.     Development of Water Users Associations. WUAs were established in the
Beruniy, Turtkul and Tumans districts, following the same concepts as developed and
agreed for the Ellikala Tuman under the Rural Enterprise Support Project (RESP)8. Main
features included, the development of a two-tiered system of organizations, Water Users’


8
  The RESP was a Bank-funded project implemented by the Government of Uzbekistan in 2001-2008 with
the aim to increase the profitability and sustainability of agriculture through the privatization and
restructuring of farming and associated agribusiness activities into privately operated units.

                                                 6
Group (WUGs) covering a hydrological unit, and WUAs consisting of several WUGs for
I&D management on the territories of the former sovkozes and kolkhozes (FSKs), on
areas of about 1,500 to 3,000 ha. The WUAs participated in irrigation management, in
particular in water distribution, O&M of the system and collection of O&M charges.
They also were involved in identifying and prioritizing the rehabilitation works and were
to participate in monitoring of works implementation.

19.     TA and Training for Improving I&D and Agricultural Practices. The
development of WUAs, the technical assistance and training under this component aimed
at increasing agricultural production in the project area through three main activities (a)
Farmers’ Participatory Training, involving training of specific target groups in various
ago-technical fields and farm management; (b) demonstration of improved and modem
technologies to increase production, improve water use efficiencies and reduce
environmental degradation. For this purpose demonstration plots were established in the
Beruniy and Turtkul Tumans. Equipment and services for laser land leveling was to be
provided, as well as limited agricultural extension services; and (c) the establishment of a
Farmers Information Services Desk in the project area to provide relevant information to
farmers through different means (pamphlets, videos, radio, TV, weekly papers, etc.).

20.      I&D Improvements within the areas managed by the WUAs. Generally these
areas formed one hydrological unit (possibly two in some cases) and were served with
water by the district level irrigation organization (raiselvodkhoz). Critical infrastructure
was improved as prioritized by the WUAs and WUGs. The average investment costs
were to be limited to $130 per ha. This was considered sufficient to remove the most
critical bottlenecks in the I&D systems controlled by the WUAs. These works could
include land leveling and or the construction of additional field drains.

21.     Main and secondary irrigation system improvements. Selective improvements
were made to the main and secondary irrigation canals (ICs) in SK covering the Beruniy,
Turtkul and Ellikala Tumans. The improvements concentrated on rehabilitation of water
control structures (especially the rehabilitation of control gates and provisions for flow
measurement up to and including the intake gates for the WUAs), removing constrictions
if any, canal cleaning, etc.

22.     Environmental Management Plan (EMP) Works. This involved mitigation
works as identified in the environmental management plan, including protection works
for the Badai Tugai (Forest) Reserve; installation of monitoring wells for archaeological
sites; other monitoring equipment; measures, for Lake Ayazkala; livestock passages
across the AMD; costs for buffer zones along the SKMC and AMD, etc. To the extent
possible EMP works were to be included in the drainage and irrigation component
contracts.

Component C: Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project Impact and
Environmental Management Plan (Cost (US$1.3 million).




                                             7
23.      The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities were to provide continuous
feedback to the MAWR, the Karakalpakstan Project Coordination Committee (KPCC),
the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and other implementation agencies, so that
corrective actions could be undertaken in a timely manner. Particularly, the
implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) was to be monitored
carefully. The M&E activities included: (i) environmental impact of construction
activities in the project area in particular of the SKMC and AMD on archaeological sites,
including the handling of any “chance-finds” of archaeologically important objects,
affected wetlands, population and livestock, as well as (ii) the impact of the I&D
improvements in the command area on ground water levels and quality, and soil salinity;
irrigation water supply and drainage flows; on-farm water use; water use efficiency at
various levels; cropping patterns and yields; and livestock population, health and
production; and (iii) the impact on the level of unemployment and household incomes in
the project area; estimation of the project’s overall benefits and economic rate of return,
etc.

Component D: Project Management, Institutional Development and Training
(US$4.8 million).

24.     This component supported Government in implementing the project and
preparing a follow-on project. It included: (a) support for the operation of the PIU, and
financing of overall project management, as well as technical assistance in such areas as
detailed design, contract administration and construction supervision, procurement,
financial management, and agricultural development; (b) a modest institutional
strengthening program composed of: (i) the introduction of modern tools for irrigation
scheduling in the project area, at the project level and at the tuman and raiselvodkhoz
level; (ii) assistance with budgeting and accounting for project O&M; and (iii) training
and study tours; (c) a study for improving water management in Uzbekistan, the
operation of key hydraulic infrastructure on the river, in particular operation of
Tuyamuyun reservoir and Takhiatash barrage during extreme flood and drought periods,
passing controlled floods for maintaining channel conveyance capacity and managed
flooding of lands next to the river where it is desirable such as for the Badai Tugai forest;
and (d) project preparation (feasibility studies and preparation of bidding documents) for
a Phase II project possibly including development of drainage and disposal systems in the
Karshi and Bukhara area. This involved the financing of consulting services, equipment
and software.

1.6 Revised Components

25.    The components financing rehabilitation and construction works were
substantially implemented as designed and most outputs were delivered.

26.     Component A - major savings were realized on the large contract for the SKMD
and AMD where the lowest bid received was 30 percent below estimates. This freed up
some resources to reallocate to works to clean up some lower sections of secondary
collector thus reducing the length of drainage flows and contributing further to lowering

                                             8
the ground water table and improve drainage reliability. The contract for replanting of
trees along the main drainage collectors and canals was cancelled mainly because of the
difficulty they represent for subsequent maintenance/cleaning works.

27.     Under component B - works focused on smaller on-farm works that were
substantially executed to plan albeit with some delays. The deep ripping and laser land
leveling that were part of this component however presented a considerable logistical
challenge. The original intent was to procure equipment, however the team was
confronted with issues of ownership and O&M responsibilities. It was then decided to
contract deep ripping and laser leveling of demonstration plots with a local contractor
(under the contract MS/1) who also was responsible for on-farm irrigation/drainage
rehabilitation works. The contractor had no experience with such work and was unable to
mobilize the proper equipment or machine operators. Consequently, that contract was
cancelled and the decision went back to purchase a number of tractors, laser levels and
deep rippers to perform this task. Finally, the equipment was procured and provided to
the local government owned machine stations contracted to deliver this service under the
project. The machine station continues to perform these services with farmers paying a
reduced fee. Arriving to this solution involved a number of contract cancelations,
repackaging and re-bidding processes before finally arriving at a workable solution.

28.     Component C - was substantially implemented as foreseen at appraisal however
with significant delays with the M&E contractor only mobilized in 2006 with a contract
up to the foreseen project end in 2010. A new bidding process was launched and a new
consulting firm was hired in 2011 for M&E for the duration of the project extension.

29.    Component D – This component included the establishment of a field office and
was otherwise delivered as designed albeit with higher than the originally intended
expenses in part due to the establishment of the field office. The only significant change
was the cancellation of the design work for the rehabilitation of Amu Bukhara I&D
system, as well as for the Kuyu-Mazar Dam.

1.7 Other significant changes

30.   Overall, DIWP underwent two restructuring processes for reallocating resources
between components and closing date extensions due to delays with works.

31.     The first restructuring in December 2009 involved a project closing date
extension of three years and the reallocation of loan proceeds in light of significant
savings that resulted from the main drainage works contract and the realization that a
number of works contracts could not be completed within the initial closing date of June
30, 2010. The need for restructuring stemmed from the recognition at the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) stage in November 2007 that substantial savings had accumulated and
resources would need to be reallocated to other activities to use the full credit and loan
amounts. There was a nearly 2 year delay with the Government sending the request for
reallocation of the project which meant that while the process was initiated already in
January of 2008, it was finally completed in December 2009. Given that major contracts

                                            9
had accumulated significant delays the reallocation was processed along with a project
closing date extension to June 30, 2013. A subsequent and final restructuring in March
2013 involved the cancellation of some US$5 million from the loan proceeds that were
not contracted by that date and could not be completed by June 30, 2013. This last
restructuring although processed, was never countersigned by the client and the resources
were eventually cancelled as part of project closure.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

32.      The project preparation benefitted from a number of studies and work that had
been developed as part of the Aral Sea Fund and related donor activities aiming at
mitigating the environmental disaster that was in the Aral Sea Basin. The works
supported under the project had been to a large extent already conceptually developed
and substantially designed, in some cases works had already been undertaken but never
completed due to lack of funding after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The original
discussions involved a design that would have combined both, the drainage works
undertaken under this project, and extensive works on irrigation simultaneously. The
proposal was rejected as it would require too large of a financial envelope and presented
significant implementation risks that would be involved with such a large operation.
Consequently, the project concept was split into two projects, this one addressing mainly
the drainage issues that plagued the region, while a follow up project would be prepared
at a later date that would address primarily the irrigation related issues. As this was the
first in a series of planned investments in Uzbekistan’s extensive I&D system of which
sustainability was complicated by the distorted agricultural production and marketing
environment, risks to the development objective at appraisal were rated substantial.

33.     Overall the project was on sound technical footing and many of the potential risks
and challenges where identified appropriately. However the project development
objective (PDO) was overly complex and ambitious. It consisted of three parts with the
second and third parts of the PDO adequately linked to project activities, but its first part
appeared to be ambitious in its aspiration to assess increased incomes and employment
given these are influenced by many factors beyond the project interventions. Moreover, it
was overly ambitious with respect to the pace at which WUAs and WUGs would develop
and take over management of the irrigation systems, given the institutional/governance
environment of Uzbekistan and that this could be completed during the project period.
Experience in other countries suggests that WUA development can take 10 or more years.
The project performed very well against its key ambitions to address (i) the inefficiency
of the irrigation systems, resulting in considerable water losses and waste; (ii) the
problem of soil salinization and waterlogging due to inadequate drainage; and (iii) the
deteriorating I&D infrastructure as captured well in the second part of the PDO. Adhering
to the objectives that better captured major project activities, for which the bulk of
investments was allocated, the project would have been in a better position to
demonstrate its strong and solid results.



                                             10
2.2 Implementation

   (i) Project’s Unpredictable Factors

34.     In general, the project progressed fairly well throughout its implementation,
though it faced some chronic constraints and challenges, solutions of which were largely
beyond the control of this project, and Bank as a whole. As already mentioned, most of
essential risks were well identified by the team at appraisal, however the circumstances
that followed and accompanied implementation were not easy to predict. Moreover, they
prevented the project from the achievement of a few outcomes (eg. increased income and
employment, and adequate O&M by WUAs) in an envisaged and desired manner.

35.     Bank Engagement: The operational environment for the Bank in Uzbekistan was
difficult during the project implementation period. The CAS of FY2002-04 attempted to
establish a framework for policy dialogue and set policy triggers for various scenarios.
However, this approach proved to be ineffective due to the authorities’ gradualist state-
led development strategy. Triggers were often perceived as imposed external
conditionalities, and there was thus little ownership for the reforms proposed by the Bank.
A CAS was prepared in 2005 for discussion at the Board, but was eventually converted to
an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) approved in July 2006, given the disagreements between
the Bank and Government over the role of the state, including in agriculture. Despite the
Bank’s efforts, both at the project and portfolio level, agricultural reform moved at a slow
pace, ultimately negatively affecting the project’s achievement of key outcome indicators
and their sustainability.

36.     “Strategic Crops:” The Government continued to exercise extensive control in
agriculture, particularly in cotton and wheat production, which were still referred to as
“strategic” crops. Although the area for cotton production was reduced (from 1.83 million
ha in 1990 to 1.28 million ha in 2013), it still remained significant. The cotton and wheat
supply chains in Uzbekistan remain dominated by the government, with farmers acting
like “contract farmers.” The state provides subsidized inputs to cotton and wheat farmers,
occasional debt write-offs, and support to cover I&D investments and O&M costs. The
state cotton procurement price for the new season is announced near harvest time, based
on a cost-plus method plus an allowance for a nominal profit. This eliminates price risks
for farmers, but fixes the price well below world market prices. With respect to this
project specifically, there is an assumption that while farmers may have benefited from
the Government’s support such as subsidized inputs, including irrigation, and occasional
debt write-offs, depressed prices set for cotton affected the project’s ability to generate
greater impact on beneficiaries’ incomes and employment.

37.    Access to Data: The CAS of 2008 stated that general access to data had improved
over time, but unpredictability and ad hoc data provision continued, and it required a
special effort from the Bank to ensure smooth data exchange with the government.
However, until project closure the situation with data did not improve as access to
information on government policies and their outcomes, as well as data on living
standards of the population posed a challenge. The limited access and poor quality of key

                                            11
economic, financial, and social data impeded a detailed, realistic assessment of the
project’s selective baseline benchmarks and final targets.

38.      WUAs/WCAs: At the project’s design stage, WUA were an established part of
the institutional landscape, at least on paper. In reality, there were a few that functioned
adequately. The WUAs were originally based on the boundaries of the large kolkhozes
and sovkhozes that existed prior to independence, except where these were restructured
to form “shirkats” and “dehkan” farms. The effective establishment and functioning of
the WUAs was, and still is, hampered by inadequate legal environment and budgetary
limitations. While there are yearly agreements signed between Pakhta-Arna Nayman
Irrigation System Administration (PAN-ISA), local agriculture departments and WUAs,
these agreements do not spell out the final decision authority on water allocations.
Consequently, local administrations responsible for the state quota of cotton and wheat
interfere with water distribution activities which should be the distinct responsibility of
WUAs. It is also a known fact that following delivery of the harvest, the farmer's account
is charged by the state in the first place for such inputs as seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
machinery services after which the farmer is left with insufficient funds to cover WUA
fees. Further, their status as NGOs did not allow them to perform profit-oriented
activities (eg. provision of agronomical technical assistance to farmers for a fee). Lack of
funding remains the biggest challenge for WUAs in Uzbekistan which ultimately leads to
(i) inadequate O&M of the on-farm I&D network by WUAs; and (ii) high turnover of
staff because of low salaries, which in turn reduced the effectiveness of WUA training
conducted under the Project.

Project’s Operational Issues

39.     On the ground, the project encountered another set of operational issues and
delays that obstructed smooth implementation of project activities as described below.

40.     The project was approved by the Bank’s Board on May 08, 2003 and the Loan
and Credit Agreements were signed only on February 5, 2004 some 9 months later while
project effectiveness was achieved only 2 weeks later on February 20, 2004. Given that
the project had benefitted from project preparation pre-financing, the PIU in Tashkent
had already been established by then. The field office, however took nearly a year to be
established and start functioning. Once in place though, it considerably improved
communications and coordination between the project area and headquarters in Tashkent.

41.     This was one of the first larger works projects from the Bank in Uzbekistan which
meant that a steep learning curve was ahead of counterparts in managing procurement
and contracts in accordance with internationally accepted practices. In the first two years
of project implementation, the issue of counterpart funding was raised at each supervision
visit. While the issue never flared to the point of recorded contract stoppages, it appears
to have played a role in the scheduling of contracts in the first few years of the project.

42.   The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) included a tentative procurement plan for
works goods and services. In discussions between the PIU and the supervision team the

                                            12
plan was modified and a number of the larger contracts were cancelled to accommodate
smaller contracts that would allow local contractors to have a chance at bidding on their
own rather than as junior partners part of large foreign joint ventures. They would thus
gain experience of working on internationally-funded projects as well as having a
significant quantum of work in their order book. Simultaneously, it would provide a
stronger stimuli for the local economy as financial resources would be spent on salaries
and equipment locally. The management of the smaller contracts in the end created a
heavier contract management burden for the PIU and some of the contractors selected
had major difficulties in getting the proper equipment and mechanization mobilized. The
issue of cash flow available to these contractors was also raised on several occasions and
played a role in the delays with contract completion.

43.     The successful tender for the SKMD contract was, at US$ 36 million, two-thirds
of the budgeted US$ 50.80 million. After making due provision for contingency, this
allowed additional works to be funded that had not been envisaged originally. The
financial windfall from these savings was largely disbursed on additional canal and
drainage works, on- and off-farm, within the irrigated zone. Implementation of a number
of contracts proceeded considerably slower than envisaged at signing. That was partly
due to a cautious approach applied by the project to ensure that funds are available to
effectively complete all envisaged construction activities; a practice applied by irrigation
projects generally in anticipation of rising costs during project implementation. The
Project was restructured and funds were reallocated after the mid-term review which
provided a clear assessment of works progress relative to plan and more certainty
prevailed as to the available funds for additional works. The availability of these
additional funds was an important factor in motivating the counterparts to request an
extension of the project implementation period.

44.      Delays in works were also encountered as in some places the geology was
different than expected. Excavations works struggled with hard bedrock on some
stretches while other stretches with mostly sandy soils “running sands” were backfilling
the newly completed excavations requiring significant volumes of rework. Along the
AMD some unexpected but sometimes sizeable water bodies were encountered that
needed draining before works could proceed. Seasonal changes in drainage water flows
in collectors also affected progress where at time excavation had to take place with water
still in the collector thus impeding visibility and creating difficulties with geometric
leveling instruments to ensure proper slope of excavations. This meant frequent
rescheduling and work plan changes to move equipment where excavation could take
place in dry sections.

45.     Chronic shortages of fuel (and sometimes poor quality fuel) caused problems and
delays at different times throughout implementation. These problems were particularly
severe from April 2010 onwards. The best efforts of the PIU to assist the contractors
access the limited supplies of fuel typically had little result. The quality of the fuel was
also often raised as an issue for the relatively high rate of breakdown of what sometimes
was quite old equipment.



                                            13
46.    Another persistent issue was the poorly performing concrete plant suffering from
frequent break down that delayed production and delivery of precast concrete elements
required for the various bridges and auxiliary structures along canals and collectors.

47.     Delays were also caused by an elaborate system of clearances in the country after
import contracts were signed. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investments
and Trade (MFERIT) presented particular challenges in this light. While not directly a
party in the legal agreements and project negotiations, this Ministry that emerged from
being a Department under the Cabinet of Ministers at appraisal, played a significant role
in delays with contract approvals. The Ministry’s practice of lengthy (three months or
more) price verifications, comparisons and negotiations after contracts are signed greatly
affected implementation. The same issues had also affected other Bank-financed, and
other internationally-financed projects in the country. These issues were resolved by
signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank and the Government to
allow for Bank procurement guidelines to be followed, but not until the end of project
implementation, thus affecting timely completion of project activities.

48.     Most of the institutional support activities were delivered, including support to
farmers with information desks, demonstrations and assistance with building capacities of
WUAs. Design studies for the Bukhara dam and I&D system rehabilitation were dropped
in favor of preparing feasibility of Phase 1 for the Ferghana Valley Water Resources
Management Project. Staff was trained at the Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (MAWR) as well as government offices in the project Tumans. Overall from
discussion with consultants and stakeholders, there appears to be appreciation for the
softer investments in WUAs and optimizing irrigation management at the local level,
though at the higher level administration there was substantial push back on institutional
development TA.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

49.     The project’s results framework comprehensively captured major parts of the
project activities, particularly the engineering part. However, it appears that projected
outcomes were also based on agronomic and social indicators (such as increased
agricultural productivity, employment and income), accuracy of which was highly
uncertain given the restricted access to data, and distortions still present in the
agricultural sector. In addition, the project baseline was established only in January 2007,
over two years into implementation. This was caused by a two year delay (after the
project became effective) in contracting an independent M&E consultant. While the
M&E Consultant established an accurate picture of the project’s engineering indicators in
the baseline report (the timing of the M&E baseline work coincided with the start of
project construction works), it was less successful in presenting the reality of what was
measurable with regard to the questionable agronomic and social indicators. Since the
methodology for measurement of these indicators was not defined and the respective
baseline values were not clearly identified at the onset of the project, no necessary
adjustments to the PDO and Results Framework were made during implementation

                                            14
period. Lastly, when the original M&E contract then ended in late 2009, it took a year
before a new firm was contracted and mobilized.

50.     Overall, the PIU and M&E consultants regularly monitored the set of indicators
agreed with the Bank and timely submitted the M&E progress reports. Key indicators
specified in the PAD were monitored throughout project implementation with an
exception of employment and income indicators that were left to be assessed at the end of
the project. In spite of the contractual difficulties, together with the information collected
by the supervision firm, the M&E reporting from the client side has been quite consistent
and comprehensive.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

51.     Environmental and Social Safeguards: The project prepared an EMP with clear
requirements and activities to ensure that wetlands and the Badai-Tugai nature park and
the desiccation of the Ayskala Lake would not be negatively impacted. The planned
works therefore included a number of measures in including a canal to supply Badai-
Tugai when water supply outstrips irrigation demand in early summer when snow melts
in the upstream mountains are at their peak, measures to contain dust in the dry bed of
Ayskala Lake as well as reconstitution of wet lands for the loss of the lake. These works
were largely completed, however due to slower than envisaged evaporation of the lake,
the dust control measures were not implemented. The lake area shows plant regeneration,
and hence, dust control measures are deemed unnecessary. The social assessment
identified the needs of herders who live in the area who will be constrained in the
movement of the livestock with the new Northern collector. The mitigation involved the
building of several bridges across the collector to allow herders to move East and West
without hindrance.

52.     Financial Management and Procurement: While there were a few issues related
to audits of the project with mostly clean “unqualified” auditor’s reports, the project
experienced difficulties with procurement where bid evaluation reports often took an
excessive amount of time and contract awards were delayed. As referred to previously,
contract and payment clearances by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,
Investments and Trade offered a particular challenge. The documents would sometimes
be scrutinized for several months by the Ministry before being cleared. Another issue that
came to fore was the excessively high tax rate that was applied to imported goods with
the effect of reducing competition. In addition, there was a significant learning curve with
contract management, especially as it relates to effectively abiding by contract clauses.
This was perhaps aggravated by the aim of giving a chance to local firms to bid on some
of the works under the project. In some cases, contractors suffered from cash flow
problems which posed a challenge whenever equipment broke or unforeseen events
emerged.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase




                                             15
53.     This project was designed as the first phase of a series of projects. The primary
objective was to improve the drainage and water quality situation in the project area first
but also in Karakalpakstan area more generally. However, investments were also made
for the formation of water users associations and participatory irrigation including on
farm and inter farm irrigation canal rehabilitation. The primary works related to
improving drainage and eliminating the discharge of the highly salty drainage water back
to the Amu Darya by rerouting it to the dry bed of the Jana Darya. The reversal of the
drainage flow has been completed which lead to the decommissioning of two large
pumping stations resulting in significantly lowering operation costs of the system and
value of energy savings estimated as US$1.2 million. The water table has dropped
substantially and overall salinization, which was reduced by 0.13 g/l (average of 2005-07
to 2009-12), is less of a problem throughout the region since the works have been
completed. The project also developed the Amudarya Basin Water Management studies
for improving water management in Uzbekistan. It is expected that the studies will serve
as a tool for the effective operation of key hydraulic infrastructure on the river, in
particular operation of Tuyamuyun reservoir and Takhiatash barrage during extreme
flood and drought periods.

54.     To strengthen this achievement, the follow-up South Karakalpakstan Water
Resources Management Improvement Project intends to focus on irrigation aspects to
maximize the opportunities offered by less saline lands for (i) introducing better crop
rotations and variety, (ii) improving crop intensity. With improved water management the
project is also expected to substantially reduce the volumes of water abstracted from the
river and render the entire water management system in the region more efficient and
indeed environmentally sustainable. Water abstraction by over 20 floating pumping
stations will be replaced by a gravity off-take from Tuyamuyun reservoir. The follow up
SKWRMIP project would also continue strengthening the capacity of WUAs, and push
for reforms that would permit WUAs to operate more independently from the Pakhta-
Arna Nayman Irrigation System Authority (PANISA) and improve their capacity for
developing irrigation schedules and work closer with farmers to play a more participatory
role in water management at the local level.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

55.     Uzbekistan remains a substantially agrarian society with agriculture as one of the
main employers that provides significant food security and hard currency earnings from
cotton and horticulture. Agriculture in Uzbekistan is highly dependent on irrigation.
Seventy nine percent of land under wheat production is irrigated, and similarly high
figures apply for cotton. However conditions for crop production deteriorated,
particularly in Karakalpakstan, due to waterlogging and salinity caused by inadequate
drainage disposal systems and a deteriorating irrigation infrastructure. Improving
drainage conditions, and making critical improvements in the irrigation and drainage
systems, as well as improving the operation and maintenance of the systems under the
                                            16
DIWIP was expected to reduce waterlogging and soil salinity, and provide reliable and
efficient irrigation, in the region thereby reducing the risks of drought, increasing crop
production, allowing diversification to less salt-tolerant crops, reducing poverty and
improving living standards.

56.     These goals are especially important for Karakalpakstan since it is one of the
poorest regions in the country with a significant percentage of the population living
below the absolute poverty level. Further, following the desiccation of the Aral Sea, the
region has faced devastating degradation of livelihoods. They include growing
salinization of land and water resources, lack of food security, exposure to dust storms,
poor quality of drinking water, and the declining health status of the local population that
forces many to relocate or endure severe living conditions at home.

57.     The Government’s current vision for the country is to become an industrialized,
high middle-income country by mid-century. The approach toward achieving this goal,
among other elements, includes increasing the efficiency of infrastructure, especially of
energy, transport, and irrigation. The project is also fully consistent with the Bank’s
current Country Partnership Strategy, FY2012-15, which identifies water management as
one of the key challenges facing the country and optimizing water use and reduce water
waste remain a top priority.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.     The following six PDO indicators measured the achievement of PDO in terms of
three distinct aspects: (i) increasing the productivity of irrigated agriculture, employment
and incomes in Karakalpakstan, one of the poorest regions in Central Asia; (ii) improving
water quality of the Amu Darya river by safe disposal of the drainage effluent, and
enhance quality of wetlands in the Amu Darya delta; and (iii) developing the institutions
for improving water management, operation and maintenance of the irrigation and
drainage systems, and for promoting sustainable irrigated agriculture through
participatory irrigation management. Below is the detailed description of achievements of
all PDO indicators.

59.    Notwithstanding the challenges posed by a centralized manner of the Government
to manage the agricultural sector and the delays in implementation, the Project appears to
have largely achieved its project development objectives for the following reasons:

60.    The first part of the objective was stated to increase the productivity of irrigated
agriculture, employment and incomes in Karakalpakstan.

      Yr7 and, in conjunction with
      the RESP, provision for main
      system I&D improvements in
      Ellikala Tuman for another
      34,000 ha, resulting in similar
      yield increases.

61.     Productivity was to be measured by a 10% to 20% increase in yields over the
command area by year 7. The increased crop production was planned to be reached
primarily through construction of a better functioning drainage system consisting of the
SKMC and AMD, and the rehabilitation of the main collector drains in the project area.
Undoubtedly lower water tables and lower soil salinity, combined with reliable water
supply contributed to the increased productivity, but there could be other inputs as well
that played a key role in the yield increases. Measured against the objective to increase
the productivity of irrigated agriculture, the project has delivered, with significantly
increased yields across nearly all crops cultivated in the project areas. While areas
cropped have gone up from 75,000 ha to 85,000 ha which is short of the target envisaged
at project appraisal of 115,000ha. However, this target was imprecise as it included some
10% of double cropped area that was erroneously included and some area that has never
been put in use. The final design of the project determined the command area at 103,000
ha.

62.     As it stands today the increased cropped area amounts to some 9%, while yields
of the primary crops, wheat and cotton in 2012 where 110% and 31% higher
respectively relative to 2006 (based on official data). Orchard crops, as well fodder and
horticultural crops showed similar and higher increases. The trend for the period
starting in 2005 but especially for the years of 2009-12 is clearly upwards across the
basket of crops. It is specifically worth noting that the project contributed to
diversification to less salt-tolerant crops in the project area. The project allowed for
expanding the area planted to horticultural crops and fodder, as well as for increasing
yields of these crops due to reduced soil salinity (see Annex 10). For example in average
for the three project districts over the period of 2005-2012, fruits and berries’ yields
increased by 56%, vegetables’ yields increased by 25%, and fodder yields increased by
18%.

63.     As it relates to incomes, although farmer yields and output increased, given the
extensive involvement of government in the supply chains for cotton and wheat, this
likely affected the magnitude of the increase in incomes for farmers. Further, project
impacts on employment and income were more difficult to assess at appraisal as public
data on socio-economic indicators were either unreliable or restricted. The project
attempted to measure this indicator through a final household survey, but it was
confronted with the difficulty of obtaining income information from farmers where the
State controls much of the supply chains for the main crops and a general fear of tax
authorities. Based on the final household survey, the M&E Consultant states that the level
of income of the population increased over the past five years with rising incomes
observed more in rural areas than in cities. The main criterion for adequacy of income
used by the M&E Consultant was the adequacy of basic foodstuffs, particularly

                                           18
consumption of meat, bread, cooking oil, flour, etc. While it may be difficult to quantify
actual income increases, there is no reason to say that farmers have not improved their
incomes. The income increase could be possible due to increased crop production and
increased cropping intensity (as described in detail in Annex 3: Economic Analysis) and
active use of household plots in the past 5 years, which would not have been possible
with deteriorating I&D system. In addition, cotton and wheat prices have shown a modest
but steady increase over time (while still significantly below world market prices), and
therefore farmers have been able to capture at least some of the benefits of the yield
increases. One more positive impact, i.e. the revival of the production of fish, muskrat
skin, and reeds from wetlands as a result of the project activities have contributed to a
substantial increase in income for the residents in the project area.

64.     As it relates to employment, it was not possible to directly measure the project’s
employment impact. However, the increase in agriculture output, would lead to an
increase in employment for handling, transport and processing (cotton ginning and wheat
milling). The higher volume of crops harvested also clearly implies more secondary
employment for field preparation, sowing, and harvesting. Indeed, the agriculture output
in the region steadily increased from UZS 99.0 billion in 2006 to UZS 278.5 billion in
2012. Lastly, as stated in the economic analysis (see Annex 3), the project generated
additional and remunerative employment, such as opportunities in the project
construction works and related non-agricultural activities. In light of the above, the
achievement of this objective is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

65.     The second objective defined as to improve water quality of the Amu Darya
river by safe disposal of the drainage effluent, and enhance quality of wetlands in the
Amu Darya delta.

                                                             of October 10, 2012)

66.     This part of the PDO was to be measured through regular monitoring of the
ground water level and soil salinity in the project areas and water salinity in the Amu
Darya. The project was instrumental in achieving this part of the PDO. Water salinity in
the project area has dropped using a 3 year average comparing the period (2005-2007)
and the period (2010-2012) by some 130mg/l (0.13g/l) as compared to a target group of
0.05g/l estimated at appraisal. The values vary significantly during the course of the year
and between years depending on the volume of water, snow melts upstream, local
precipitations, and other factors, but show consistently lower than before works were
completed. This is further confirmed by data reflecting significant lowering of salinity of
drinking water downstream from the project area. In parallel, ground water levels have
dropped throughout the area and most importantly the lands under the various salinity
classifications have changed with an increase of about a 35% of the total area in non and
lightly saline lands and a reduction of 55% of highly saline lands. Households near towns
report improvements to their livelihood due to the possibility of planting gardens which
was impossible only a few years ago due to salinization. The lower water table also
reduces water intrusion and “flowering” on walls and moisture in houses has made living
conditions substantially more comfortable especially during the cool parts of the year. By
this measure the outcome towards this indicator is highly satisfactory.

67.     Further, about 2,250 ha of sustainable wetlands have been developed at SKMC
and Ahchadarya Main Drain (AMD). Newly appeared wetlands were developed in the
bed of Janadarya River close to the former banks of the Aral Sea with a size of more than
30,000 ha. The wetlands compensate the drying-up of Lake Ayazkala, which is still partly
moist and covered by halophytic vegetation. According to the Uzbek State Committee for
Environmental Protection there is no danger to salt transfer or erosion to other areas, and
therefore specific measures of stabilizing the lake’s bed are currently not required. Badai
Tugai reserve is supplied with sufficient amount of water for genetic regeneration mainly
through the reconstructed Kokdarya River directly from Amudarya. Anecdotal evidence
from visits on site, and reports from the Committee indicate that the riverine forest in the
area are stable, while the wetlands present adequate living conditions for fauna and flora
and adequate substitution for the drained Eastern part of the Lake Ayaskala. With the
construction of the Bustan canal under the follow up project the supply of water to the
reserve will be further augmented as another supply route will be added improving the
distribution within the forest. The combination of the two variables of this objective
argues for a Satisfactory outcome rating.

management, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation and drainage
systems, and for promoting sustainable irrigated agriculture through participatory
irrigation management.

69.      Important progress was made towards achieving this part of the PDO. In total, 27
WUAs were established (13 WUAs in Beruniy district with 33,115 ha of irrigated land
and 14 WUAs in Turtkul district with 33,593 ha). Staff of the Irrigation Management
System and the KK Hydro-Geo Amelioration Expedition (KHE) responsible for the
drainage system, staff of the KK Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources as well as
the PIU for Water Infrastructure and the Lower Amudarya Water Basin Management
Organization (LAWMO) were trained. Significant capacity has been built at the level of
the MAWR and local administration to form and train WUAs including providing advice
on irrigation water management and water scheduling, holding elections and
responsibilities of the various organs of WUAs. More positively, and in line with new
institutions that attempt to represent their members, WUAs worked together with the PIU

  An average of 3 years from the time before the construction (2005-2007) and the latest period with
available data at the end of project (2010-2012) was chosen to level the large influence on the GWL of the
annually varying available volumes of irrigation water. The calculation is based on annual averages of
interpolated GWL-areas based on monthly average GWL.

and implementation consultant in supporting the local water authority in prioritizing
works of the limited irrigation rehabilitation under the project.

70.     The project modestly attempted to establish new WUAs in the project area and
strengthen their technical capacity, as well as to bring their function in line with
international standards. In this sense the project achieved this part of the objective.
However, as mentioned earlier, there are currently a number of factors, which are beyond
the project control, that affect their daily work and further sustainability. The project
WUAs are still weak which is partly due to the fact that on average only 40 per cent of
their O&M budget can be collected from their members. In addition, the legal standing of
WUAs is not sufficiently regulated, creating conflicts with local authorities over the
management of water resources, and thus reducing their responsibility for the
management of sparse water resources. In turn, farmers encounter other disincentives for
enlarging their production: state quotas for 70 percent of their crops, a discouraging
accounting system for credits and machinery (services) and disparity of product and input
prices, both set by state institutions. It is expected that the upcoming SKWRMIP will
reinforce the institutional development of WUAs in addition to the improvement of the
current legislative and executive government environment to enable adequate water
management, O&M of the I&D systems.

71.     It is worth noting other output indicators that were added in the ISR to track
promotion of sustainable irrigated agriculture, albeit the project only kept track of
demonstration plots and individuals trained. The M&E report states that in total 15
demonstration plots were established (7 in Beruniy and 8 in Turtkul districts) and
successfully demonstrated the possibility of obtaining improved yields (more than 3.5
t/ha for cotton and more than 4t/ha for wheat). Besides, Farmer Field Schools (FFS) were
established in Beruniy and Turtkul districts. In total, 14,000 booklets, 860 bulletins and
100 posters issued and distributed. 691 farmers trained and 200 farmers participated in
various seminars. However, the sustainability of FFS is a concern due to limited financial
resources to maintain staff, office and transport facilities. Overall, an impressive number
of farmers were trained and publications were issued and distributed, but no attempt was
made at measuring the actual adoption of the activities and technologies introduced under
the demonstrations.

72.     In addition, this part of the PDO was measured against (i) reliability: ratio of
actual water supplied to demand planned for delivery on weekly, monthly and annual
basis; (ii) increased irrigation efficiencies (conveyance up to the area of WUA by 10%,
and within the WUA area by 15%); and (iii) amount of drainage water reduced to not
more than 3,000 m3/ha.

73.     The indicator defining reliability of water supply is important and is dependent on
good systems management (i.e. functioning institutions). However, this is also
significantly affected by the seasonality of the weather (e.g. occurrence of “dry” vs “wet”
years) which in turn can significantly affect the water available for delivery to farmers.
Such weather variability affected water deliveries in the project area in several years. For
example, due to the water scarcity in the Amudarya River in 2011 vegetation period, the

                                            23
water volume received dropped to 553.1 million m3 or 61.9% and WUAs received less
than 40% of requested volume. In three project areas during 2011-2012 hydrological year
(from October 1, 2011 to October 1, 2012):

      (i) Leaching period: 298.2 million m3 allocated; actually received 284.5 million m3
              of water (95.4%);
      (ii) Vegetation period allocated: 987.9 million m3; actually received 876.4 million m3
              of water (88.7%).

74.      Irrigation efficiency was defined as conveyance measurements up to and within
WUA command, and measuring drainage water volumes. Unfortunately, there were no
baseline data available. Based on the PAN-ISA data, the current efficiency of irrigation
system is 0.56 (main canals: 0.9; inter farm canals: 0.4; intra farm network: 0.74). The
local water authority reports an efficiency of some 56% which would be extraordinarily
high given the type of infrastructure, the nature of the soil in the area and the status of the
infrastructure. In a more recent study in preparation for the follow up project the current
irrigation system conveyance efficiency is estimated at 32% which is a significant
improvement from the estimated 25% - 30% reported at appraisal.

75.     Volumes of drainage water from 2010/2011 season was at 3,560m3/ha while in
2011/2012 it was at some 4,800m3/ha and thus remains above project design thresholds
of 3,000m3/ha for both years. However when these drainage figures are taken over the
entire area drained (316,000 ha) by the system, the quantities per ha are about a third of
the figures above. This would also explain the 25% increase in 2012 when the area
reportedly had higher than usual precipitation.          Nonetheless, discussions with
stakeholders, the design and supervision contractor and the M&E consultant confirm that
there remains a significant potential to further increase efficiency by better irrigation
management, lower leaching quantities and improved timing and organization to reduce
drainage volumes. As such the achievement towards this objective is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency10

76.     It is anticipated that the main project benefits would come from the increased
agricultural production in the project area. Other quantified benefits, which are were
included in the economic evaluation, were deriving from the decreased salinity in Amu
Darya River, resulting in the increased agricultural production in the downstream areas.
Among other benefits that were taken into consideration were the direct benefits coming
from wetlands that would come from the increased fish production, muskrat skin
production and reeds production. Savings from elimination of drainage and irrigation
pumping were also considered as project benefits and included in the analysis.

77.     A detailed project economic analysis was prepared and provided in Annex 3. The
period of analysis is 25 years to account for the long-term impact of the project
interventions. The scenario presented in the economic analysis is conservative. The
analysis presents the balance of costs and benefits of the project and it is based on the
actual data and results of the project. The analysis identified the quantifiable benefits that
directly relate to the activities undertaken following the implementation of the project, or
that can be attributed to the project’s implementation. The incremental quantifiable
benefit stream comprises of four main elements: (i) incremental agricultural production,
(ii) benefits from wetlands, (iii) downstream agricultural impact and (iv) savings from
elimination of drainage and irrigation pumping.

78.     In total nine financial crop budgets and five economic cost-benefit models were
prepared for calculation of the overall benefit streams, on the basis of economic prices.
All local costs were converted into their approximate economic values. A Shadow Wage
Rate of 0.6 was also introduced into the analysis to identify the opportunity cost of labor
in the project’s civil work costs. All values are given in constant 2013 prices. Given the
above mentioned benefit and cost streams, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the
project is estimated at 21.8%. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the Project’s net benefit
stream, discounted at 12%, is positive - USD 36.4 million.

80.     Sensitivity Analysis. Actual economic returns were tested against several
hypothetic scenarios of changes in benefits that can happen in the future. The analysis
shows moderate sensitivity to the changes in benefits and these changes will not have a
significant impact on economic return. For example, the economic viability will be only
marginally affected by a 20% decline in benefits and a fall in total project benefits by
30% can reduce the base ERR only up to 15.4%. In a hypothetic scenario if only
agricultural benefits would be taken into account, the project ERR would drop to 18.8%.

In another scenario with agricultural benefit decreased by 30%, the project economic
return would be at 15.4%. The summary results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     The overall project outcomes are rated as Moderately Satisfactory because the
project effectively achieved or exceeded the indicators for reduced ground water levels,
soil salinization and improved water quality in the Amu Darya while its impacts were
more modest on achieving agronomic performance, income and employment indicators.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

82.     Water scarcity is one of the key risks the country faces that can only be
effectively addressed by reducing water losses in irrigation from improved infrastructure
and improved system management. As the first in an expected series of projects that
need to address the deficiencies of the irrigation systems in the Amu Darya basin, this
project contributes to the environmental sustainability of irrigation in this area.

83.     (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development - As previously
mentioned irrigation in this part of the world is essential for life and any type of sedentary
agriculture. Agriculture in the region is the main economic activity and at peak season
employs much of the local population. Improved irrigation systems with more reliable
water combined with a lower water table and reduced salinization stimulates a whole host
of auxiliary activities. During its visit to the project area, the ICR mission visited a dairy
farmer that recently purchased some 50 Holstein cows for milk production, another small
farmer over the past 3 years had specialized in the production of seedlings for a variety of
vegetables as improved irrigation stimulates the demand by households to plant their own
vegetable gardens. These activities generated significant seasonal employment, especially
younger women, and the overall impression from informal discussions with residents in
the settlements was overwhelmingly positive as many household gardens that previously
had been so saline as to be uncultivable, have become again suitable for production of
vegetables. As of 2012, the year when all works have been completed, yields of both
cotton and wheat are up 31% and 110% respectively relative to 2006 while other garden
crops and orchards show even a greater increase.

84.   Another positive impact – recovered production of fish, muskrat skin, and reeds
from wetlands would be a substantial income for some population in the project area.

                                                  26
Since 2006, the area of lake surface leased by fish farmers increased from 2,312 to 4,149
ha. The total catch of fish in the project area was 12.4 t in 2010; 31.7 t in 2011; and 123.8
t in 2012. At the same time an increase in pastures was noted as well as the development
of desert vegetation along the drainage collectors, in a strip of 5 km on both side of it.
While no further research was done on muskrat skin and reed production from wetlands,
it was observed that in the past three years the number of karakul sheep increased.

85.     (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening – 27 WUAs established by the project
provide a good basis for participatory irrigation. The institutions that have been
responsible at primary and secondary PAN level have not changed and have not yet
developed trust in WUAs and often interfere with their activities. To make WUAs
function better, the responsibilities of each body will need to be harmonized so that roles,
responsibilities and rights are clearly defined for each party. At present this change is
somewhat impeded by the heavy hand of the state in determining quota areas for the
principal crops in the region, thus often forcing local administrations to interfere in the
prioritization of irrigation water access. The follow up project focusing more on
optimizing irrigation, will help in developing clearer mandates for each body involved
and with a more effective engagement of farmers also provide WUAs with a stronger
voice for advocating its priorities and assuming their responsibilities.

86.     (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) – It is
noteworthy to mention the project’s positive environmental impacts. On the routes and
collectors SKMC and Ahchadarya stable wetlands were formed with a total area of
2250.8 ha; wetlands also appeared in the old channel Janadarya. They provide habitats
for birds and other wildlife. In addition, it is expected that reduced water logging will
decrease long term damages to buildings, roads and other facilities in the project area; (ii)
better drainage in the area will also reduce risks of human and animal diseases. There is
also reduced risk of deterioration of cultural properties and archaeological sites in the
project area. The project lowered salinity of drinking water downstream. In parallel,
ground water levels dropped throughout the area, which in turn led to reduced water
intrusion and “flowering” on walls and moisture in houses, and made living conditions
substantially more comfortable especially during the cool parts of the year. Finally, the
project generated a considerable fiscal benefit, i.e. the savings from elimination of the
drainage and irrigation pumping that is estimated as USD1.2 mln and USD 145,000 per
year respectively. It is expected that energy savings would also produce positive impact
on the country’s climate change mitigation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

87.     A household survey was undertaken by the M&E consultant at the end of the
project. The survey provided an overwhelmingly positive picture. A summary of the
results of the survey is reflected in Annex 5.


4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate


                                             27
88.      The overall investment comes with lower operating costs due to reduced pumping
for drainage as well as for irrigation thus presents a fairly low risk investment. The
drainage systems that were in place before the project was not only suboptimal in design
and in terms of coverage design, but also expensive to operate due to dependency on
lifting from pumps. Given the priority for irrigation and power shortfalls, drainage pumps
often only ran when electricity was unavailable. The current gravity driven system offers
a much better perspective for future sustainability. While it too will require some O&M
to keep the collectors clean, operations will less directly depend on electricity or spare
parts to ensure continuity in operation. The weakest part of the project has been
institutional and the fact that still sizeable areas in the system suffer from poor water
supply reliability due to both suboptimal management but also constrained by the poor
state of the irrigation infrastructure. The follow up project under preparation will address
these two main constraints and thus minimize the sustainability risk of this current
investment.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

89.     Project preparation was led by a seasoned team of engineers and water resources
specialists. The project design was based on studies developed as part of the multilateral
Aral Sea basin support program. Noteworthy were the early (pre-effectiveness)
arrangements and inputs for timely preparation of detail designs and tender
documentation for the projects main infrastructure works and the extensive efforts to
ensure adequate M&E arrangements also for the environmental safeguards. Although the
team was well aware of the complexities with the engineering part of the system, it
appears that the PDO was set at a high level. While the engineering indicators were for
the most part easily met, the agronomic and social indicators were at times insufficiently
closely linked to the project investments and lacked adequately defined mechanisms that
would ensure that data would be effectively collected.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.    The Bank team was in constant contact with the client/PMU and its
design/supervision consultants to expedite the design/implementation progress and to
address emerging design/technical issues. Overall, the Bank team responded proactively
with timely approval of justified contract variation orders. The Bank country
management, in its turn, was diligent and persistent in following-up with the MFERIT
regarding delayed import contracts, which expedited the process of obtaining required
procurement clearances. Finally, the Bank follow-up undertook an in depth Mid-Term
Review in 2007 that was used to reorient some of the priorities to improve performance.
In addition, the Bank’s procurement team kept a close watch to ensure that the client
maintain transparent and efficient tendering and contract-management procedures. The

                                            28
Bank closely reviewed the M&E reports produced by the independent consultants under
the project and questioned aspects that appeared inconsistent or were in conflict with the
regular status reports provided by the supervision consulting firm. This overall positive
assessment is weakened by the fact that while it was aware of the challenges in collecting
some of the data and meeting some of the more socially oriented indicators, it failed to
address these aspects with a level 1 restructuring that would have helped in better
aligning outcomes with investments keeping in mind the socio political environment in
the region.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

91.    This was a complex project in a difficult environment prepared by an experienced
team. The teams at preparation and supervision were responsive and managed this project
smoothly throughout entire implementation period. More care at design with the
formulation of the PDO and indicators or subsequent restructuring would have made the
Bank input Moderately Satisfactory. The above rating reflects the combined fact of good
technical assessment and decisions with the failure of ensuring stronger links between
investments and outcomes, and from the combining of the two previous separate ratings
in accordance with the ICR report guidelines.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

92.      The Government of Uzbekistan saw these project objectives and investments as
key policy priorities. The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) as well
as the Ministry of Finance both readily met with the Bank implementation team and for
the most part readily accepted Bank advice and recommendations. The practices in
procurement and project, financial and contracts management presented a significant
learning curve for both the Government as well as for contractors. The commonly
accepted international standards and guidelines including concepts of competitiveness,
transparency and a focus on development outcomes were at times conflicted with
practices of local authorities and government. The overall socio economic reforms in the
sector identified at appraisal were only partially implemented and farmers still reap very
little benefit from their production. This affects farmer willingness and ability to invest
and improve production and make the entire irrigation system sustainable. While the
MAWR was overall responsive and keen to support the PIU with project implementation,
MFERIT on occasion posed serious difficulties with requirements that were in direct
conflict with Bank rules. Also, it took the Government nearly a year to established the
field office and set functioning. In the first 2 years of project implementation, the issue of
counterpart funding was raised at each supervision visit. While the issue never flared to
the point of recorded contract stoppages, it appears to have played a role in the
scheduling of contracts in the first few years of the project.



                                             29
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     The Project PIU had a steep learning curve and often had to contend with
stakeholders that were not familiar with International rules regulating procurement and
contract management. In spite of these challenges the PIU always managed to ensure that
communication between all stakeholders and overall policy affecting the project
remained on course.         Procurement and Financial Management have remained
satisfactory throughout the project period. While contracting initially was slow and the
time elapsed between bid and signing of contracts took longer than necessary overall
contract management was considered satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.    Overall the borrower remained committed to the project objectives and the
outputs defined at design. While the learning curve for adopting internationally accepted
commercial practices was steep the principles were generally respected and when the
Bank team raised commensurate action was taken. The rating for overall Borrower’s
performance is Moderately Unsatisfactory based on the combination of the two previous
separate ratings in accordance with the ICR report guidelines


6. Lessons Learned

95.    Lesson 1 - The creation of WUAs and increasing user participation in irrigation
management is always a challenging task that demands time and may be rendered
considerably more difficult in an environment where the state used to fully provide these
services previously. User participation is a new model that represents both on the one
hand a new threat and an opportunity for both farmers and the local water authority. It is
important that both parties know clearly their responsibilities and that there is an
understanding of mutual dependence that needs to be adequately regulated in the laws
governing both the WUAs and the local/regional water authority.

96.     Lesson 2 - Distortions in production systems where the supply chain is largely
controlled by the State and benefits are extracted from the region will undermine the
production growth potential even after base agronomic conditions may have significantly
improved.

97.     Lesson 3 - There is a need for better awareness of the administrative clearance
process in country which can severely delay contract signature and procurement. This
could possibly be avoided if the governmental bodies providing such clearances would be
clearly named in the legal agreements along with responsiveness standards defined
already at negotiations.

98.    Lesson 5 - While it is understandable that governments would like to see local
contractors participate in bids as much as possible to build up the local contracting
                                           30
capacity, this usually entails increased supervision requirements and results in
implementation delays as these contractors often lack adequate equipment to perform the
required tasks.

99.    Lesson 6 – A good results framework and strong M&E system are critical to
measuring project impacts. The Project indicators should be a set of Specific,
Measurable, Attributable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) indicators and closely
related to project activities It also requires strong attention by the task team to
undertaking a baseline and final impact surveys.

 1.1.2 DIWIP/SKMD/1: South Karakalpakstan Main Drain
(1)    Original scope

The contract covered:
        Construction of the new drainage disposal system (SKMD)
        Certain works to mitigate potential adverse environmental impacts, known as
          the “Environmental Management Plan works”.

The South Karakalpakstan Main Drain (SKMD) comprises two sections:
       The South Karakalpakstan Main Collector (SKMC), which receives collector
          drainage water (CDW) from drains located in the irrigated area, and
       Akchadarya Main Drain (AMD) which conveys the CDW to the old
          Janadarya river bed along which the CDW will be taken towards the Aral Sea
          by gravity.

The SKMC is about 104 km long and runs between the now decommissioned Beruniy
pump station and the junction with VST-2 collector (end of the Wetland II). The AMD is
about 188.8 km long, from VST-2 collector to the Janadarya.
The formation of the SKMD comprised:
        Reversal of the Beruniy Collector, construction of a connection to the
           Ayazkala Collector and connecting it to Akchadarya Collector, while
           deepening and widening the bed to provide gravity disposal of CDW.
        Construction of the AMD, predominantly in the old channel of a former river
           (the Akchadarya).

                                                       33
In addition to channel earthworks, the        Box 3.1       SKMD structures
contract    involved    replacement    and       Main structure types provided / upgraded:
reconstruction of existing structures and  Road and foot (on AMD) crossings
provision of new structures (Box 3.1).      Junction structures (on inflowing collectors)
                                            Water control structure at the outlet of Wetland II
Supplementing this were minor works  Service pipe crossings (drinking water line, gas line)
including channel protection works to  Power and communication line crossings
prevent ingress of wind-blown sand.         Aqueducts (flume and box)
The Environmental Management Plan  Water measurement structures
works were focused on sustaining water supplies to the Baday Tugai reserve and the
hydrology of Lake Ayazkala.

The Baday Tugai works involved:
       Remodelling of water supply canals of capacity 5 m3/s and above from
          Nayman-Beshtam pump station to the reserve, including the Budeniy canal
       Formation of a distribution channel (New Distributor Canal) within the Baday
          Tugai forest reserve
       Channel remodelling, bank raising and construction and replacement of
          hydraulic structures, all to permit flow along the Kok Darya from the Amu
          Darya.

At Lake Ayazkala, the planned works included:
       Provision of an outlet structure from the lake into the SKMC
       Construction of low earth dam to prevent future inflows into the western lobe
          of Lake Ayazkala
       Provisionally, measures to control windblown salts at the western lobe of
          Lake Ayazkala, including planting vegetation
       Provision of spare parts to Kyzylkum pump station and the maintenance
          necessary to enable it to deliver water into the eastern lobe of Lake Ayazkala.

Significant scope changes
Following a decision to cease pumping into Lake Ayazkala, the planned engineering
works at the lake and pump station were removed from the scope of work. Because Lake
Ayazkala is still partly moist and covered by halophytic vegetation, the Uzbek State
Committee for Environmental Protection concluded that there is no danger to salt transfer
or erosion to other areas, and therefore specific measures of stabilizing the lake’s bed are
currently not required. Hence the measures to manage windblown salt were dropped.
Under the contract some 24 million m3 of earthworks were undertaken and 9 800 m3 of
concrete placed, as summarised in table 2 below.

1.1.3 DIWIP/MS/1: Inter-Farm Irrigation and Drainage Improvements

Original scope

During project design the option was initially left open on whether to undertake canal and
drainage system works under a single or two contracts. It was subsequently concluded
that combining the works in a single contract gave advantageous flexibility, allowing the
works to be tailored to the specific needs identified by the local stakeholders.

The main works of Contract DIWIP/MS/1 comprised:
Inter-farm irrigation and drainage system infrastructure
          Rehabilitation of around 250 km of existing collector drains including
           deepening and remodelling works
          Rehabilitation of 12 existing canal structures
          Construction of 13 new canal structures.
On-farm agricultural operations:
          4 000 ha of land levelling and smoothing, to form fields suitably graded for
              furrow or border strip irrigation [Subsequently reduced to 1500 ha]
          4 000 ha of deep ripping to remove plough pan [Increased to 4526 ha]]
          Mole drainage, over 250 ha, to demonstrate the applicability of the
              technique [Cancelled]
          Provisions for WUA training and the establishment of Demonstration Plots
              and Farmer Field Schools.

Significant scope changes

There were no fundamental changes in scope aside from introducing some additional
works in the AMD and Janadarya. There was continued interaction with the stakeholders
(khokimyats, PAN and the KKP Hydromelieorative Expedition) during which they put
forward proposals for works which were then tested against the overall scope.
Implementation was consequently focused on raising water levels in the canals. Drain
works were aimed at remodelling drains where the required improvements could not
reasonably be incorporated into routine drain cleaning.

The pilot mole drainage was cancelled as it was, on examination, considered unfeasible
in the prevailing ground and soil conditions. For pragmatic reasons, land levelling was
reduced from 4 000 ha to 1 500 ha; however, deep ripping was increased from 4 000 ha
to 4 526 ha.

Additional works were instigated to allow the high discharges entering the AMD to be
accommodated after work on the DIWIP/SKMD Contract had been concluded.
Embankments were strengthened and some channel excavation undertaken.

                                              35
Achievements

Under the contract some 2.5 million m3 of earthworks were undertaken and 4 900 m3 of
concrete placed. In addition as noted above, land levelling and deep ripping was

1.1.4 DIWIP/CAR/1: Command Area Rehabilitation in Turtkul and Beruniy
Districts
Original scope

The Command Area Rehabilitation works were aimed at improving water management
and removing bottlenecks in the irrigation and drainage systems so that the greatest
benefits arising from improvements to the inter farm system completed under other
contracts could be reaped by the farmers. These works were not a complete rehabilitation,
but focused on the rehabilitation, replacement or new construction of key items of
infrastructure. These works were integrated into the existing infrastructure, much of
which remained unchanged.
The works were to be prioritised within an overall, average budget of 130 USD/ha.
The works were suggested by the Water User Associations (WUAs) and were undertaken
on a strictly limited budget. There were, at the time the works were executed, nine WUAs
in Beruniy tuman, and 12 WUAs in Turtkul. The total area of irrigated land on which the
works were undertaken was approximately 60 000 ha.

The main works of Contract DIWIP/CAR/1 included:
Inter Farm Infrastructure
           Cleaning and remodelling of inter farm collectors
           Replacement of culverts on inter farm collectors
           Installation of new structures on inter farm canals
           Rehabilitation of existing structures on inter farm canals
           Improvements to the on-farm infrastructure
Installation of new structures on on-farm canals
           Rehabilitation of existing structures on on-farm canals
           Cleaning and re-profiling of on-farm canals
           Replacement of pumps
           Supply of portable metal check structures

                                             36
            Cleaning and remodelling of on-farm collectors
            Replacement of culverts and aqueducts on on-farm collectors.

The WUAs were involved at all stages, commencing with a thorough briefing on the
scope and limitations. Work commenced with the two most institutionally advanced
WUAs, using these to pilot the process and to demonstrate to other WUAs the
implementation modality. The Pilot Area survey and design work were used to establish
standard procedures and designs, and to provide a guide to the cost of comprehensive
CAR works and what could be realistically be achieved within the financial constraints of
the project.

Significant scope changes
The earthworks in the bill of quantities were completed by the end of 2009, with concrete
works due to be finished after a further month’s work. However, more works were
required to finish all the works originally agreed with the WUAs. Fortunately these works
could be done within the Contract budget, as savings had been made. The Tender
Commission of MAWR approved the additional works and World Bank’s no–objection
to the additional quantities was received before the end of March 2010.

Additional Agreement No 1
By mutual agreement, the contract period was extended for one year, to 12 June 2010, as
the most pragmatic way of completing the Works.

Additional Agreement No 2
Additional Agreement No.2 covered part of works from the DIWIP/DI/1 Contract (see
below). With the plans for water supply to the Baday Tugai reserve having had to be
changed, work was needed to modify the Kok Darya inlet works, and to improve check
structures on the Kok Darya.

Additional Agreement No 3
Additional Agreement No.3 was an extension to Additional Agreement No.2, covering
very similar activity. It enabled the use of available funds to be maximised partly by
extending the implementation period.

Achievements
Some 3.9 million m3 of earthworks were undertaken and 16 000 m3 of concrete placed

 1.1.5 IWIP/DI/2: Drainage and Irrigation Rehabilitation Works
Original scope
The original scope (for the then proposed contract DIWIP/DI/1) was developed based on
projections of potential savings on other ongoing contracts and the overall budget
allocated to DIWIP.

The main elements identified were:
Command Area                     An additional 207 farm outlets complete with provision for
Rehabilitation                    flow measurement.
Inter-farm I&D                   Rehabilitation and construction of hydraulic structures
Infrastructure                   Repair and installation of gates and hoists
Improvements                     64 flow measurement stations.
Additional                       Installation of new and rehabilitation of existing monitoring
Groundwater                       wells.
Monitoring Wells
Inter-farm Collector             Re-routing and reshaping of drains in Beruniy district, to
Drains                            maximise drainage benefit following the closing of Beruniy
                                  pump station
                                 Cleaning of additional drains
                                 Construction of structures at the junction of on-farm and inter-
                                  farm drains
                                 12 new siphons under irrigation canals to replace existing
                                  structures, but with lower cill levels.

The lowest evaluated bid for the DIWIP/DI/1 works was higher than the budget and there
were other technical issues with the bid that were of concern; this tender was therefore
cancelled.
Instead, about half of the DI/1 works was included in the existing DIWIP/CAR/1 contract
through an amendment (Additional Agreement No 2) and bidding documents for the
remaining works were prepared for issue as DIWIP/DI/2.

Significant scope changes
There were no significant scope changes during execution of DIWIP/DI/2 except for the
addition of certain works in the AMD to prevent damage occurring as a result of high
drain flows.

                                                38
Achievements
The primary achievement of this contract was to address some of the remaining
infrastructure constraints to effective water management in the secondary and on-farm
systems in Beruniy and Turtkul together with extending the area of drain remodelling.
The latter in particular allows the benefit of the new drainage disposal system to be
experienced more widely.

1.2     Supply contracts
The only supply activity, other than minor items for the PIU office and its refurbishment,
was for land levelling and deep ripping equipment. In the PAD it had been envisaged that
land levelling and deep ripping equipment would be procured for use in the project area,
commencing with the Demonstration Plots. However, once implementation of the project
had started, it became clear that the mechanisms for a government organisation to take
the equipment onto its balance sheet and be responsible for operating and maintaining it
did not then exist.

Thus, after discussion, plans for providing equipment though Contract Nr DIWIP/Gen/2
were dropped. Instead a small area of land levelling was included in DIWIP/MS/1 as a
works contract12. This, it was thought, would as a minimum demonstrate the benefits of
land levelling.

This component of DIWIP/MS/1 took time to implement well. However, during this
period, and not least due to use of land levelling on the demonstration plots, interest in
land levelling grew. It was subsequently decided, taking advantage of the extended
duration of the project, that the institutional situation had changed and supplying tractors,
certain land levelling equipment and deep ripper frames was justified, provided that these
became the responsibility of the appropriate Machine and Tractor Park.

There was considerable debate on the specification of the equipment: in the end, the laser
levelling equipment selected was of a type (essentially a laser-controlled blade with no
carry-capacity) which had limited capacity for reforming the land profile. Rather it is a
finishing tool. It appears that nevertheless the equipment is being used to reprofile some
fields – which suggests that should a suitable opportunity arise, the existing equipment

     Initially, Contract DIWIP/CAR/1/LL was tendered. But this was not successful.


                                                          39
should be complemented with equipment capable of efficiently reprofiling the land ahead
of finishing using the equipment purchased under DIWIP/LL and DIWIP/LL/2.

1.3    Capacity building and institutional support

This was provided under the DIWIP/Con/1 service contract (see below) and comprised:
        Supporting development of Water Users Associations (WUA) together with
           technical assistance and training for improving irrigation, drainage and
           agricultural practices
        Amu Darya basin water management studies
        Introducing modern tools for irrigation scheduling in South Karakalpakstan
           and providing training in modern irrigation management techniques for
           operators of the South Karakalpakstan irrigation supply network

The outputs were captured in a series of working papers. The following text is a very
short summary of the contents of the Working Papers listed below, to which reference
should be made for more detail.
    Working Paper AS3: AS3 Water Management (March 2010)
    Working Paper AS4.1: WUAs (April 2010)
    Working Paper AS4.2: Agriculture (March 2010)
    Working Paper AS6: Amu Darya Basin Water Management Studies (March 2010)
    Working Paper AS7: Tools for Irrigation Scheduling and Training in O&M
    Techniques (April 2010).

1.3.1 Canal water management
A two day training programme was developed and delivered to irrigation service
authority (ISA) personnel, by an external specialist trainer. This made reference to
technical papers prepared on the methodology for measuring water flow in canals, and on
the organization of water measurement.

Implementing the approaches covered by the training was constrained by the lack of
measuring gauges and other equipment on structures and pressures to maintain historic
water allocations and gate settings at individual structures. These issues are to be
addressed in the proposed follow on project (SKWRMIP).

1.3.2 Water Users Association support
Four sub-components were addressed:
     WUAs and WUG establishment support
     Demonstration plots (DPs)\
     Farmer Field Schools (FFS)
     Farmer Information Support Desk (FISD) / Farmer Information Support Centre
       (FISC).




                                          40
     Twenty seven WUAs, thirteen in Beruniy and fourteen in Turtkul were set up in the early months of the project.
     All WUAs are registered with the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Karakalpakstan. They are non- profit and
     non-governmental organizations with significant tax exemptions.
     During the period of project implementation WUAs and their functions have become reasonably well known by
     many people, but it is not yet possible to say that they take an important place in the community.
     The effective establishment of the WUAs as an integral component of water management has been hampered by
     budgetary limitations.
     In general Irrigation Service Fee (ISF) collection rates are poor, and so WUAs cannot implement the maintenance
     components of their annual budget. WUAs have no effective sanctions against members who do not pay ISF. If
     the WUA tries to refuse water to such a member, the khokimiyat usually overrides the decision in order to
     maximise crop production. This obviously has a negative effect on ISF collection discipline.
     ISF is always paid by transfer from the bank accounts of farmers out of the government seasonal loan. Even when
     all formalities are completed, banks usually do not / cannot pay the total money allocated for WUAs. The banks
     first make payments for other items, like fertilizers, seeds and chemicals. All the money transferred into WUA
     accounts is spent on staff salaries or taxes. Even so, many WUAs have to pay staff salaries late; some reached 12
     months in arrears.
     Source: The M&E Final Project Completion Report

The DIWIP teams have provided guidance and suggestions to support the development of
WUAs, including:
     Water User Groups: Experience in the first two years of the project demonstrated
      that it would be beneficial to organize Water User Groups (WUG) in the WUAs
      with their relatively large areas and where these have more than 100 members.
         Each WUG covers an area of about 200 ha and has a leader.
         The group leaders form the general assembly of the WUA.
         A manual was prepared for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of WUA
             irrigation and drainage systems. After approval by PAN ISA, the South
             Karakalpakstan Main Collector (SKMC) system authority, raiselvodkhoses,
             district khokimiyats and MAWR, the manual was issued to WUAs.
         Training and Extension: Training programmes, concentrated in the first
             two years of the project (2005-2006), were implemented successfully.
             Subsequently, refresher training and support was given as needed, and
             guidance provided on WUA operation. All training programmes were
             agreed, through the PIU, with the khokimiyats which were given every
             opportunity to observe and participate although there was no structured
             institutional involvement.
         Fourteen pamphlets were developed from the training materials, and were
             distributed to WUAs and local authorities to act as a source of reference in
             the future.
1.3.3 Soil and water management practice improvement
The project supported demonstrations of good agricultural practice and the dissemination
of good soil and water management techniques:
        Through the use of demonstration plots DIWIP was able to demonstrate clearly
         that substantial increases in yields of cotton and wheat are possible in lower
         potential soils.


                                                         41
      Farmer Field Schools (based on tried and tested international techniques) proved
       an effective and popular way of distributing widely the methods of improved soil
       and water management and agricultural practices used in the demonstration plots.
       Substantial expertise in agricultural extension has been gained by South
       Karakalpakstan specialists that should be made full use of in the future.
      The consultant’s Farmer Information Support Desk, which became an
       independent Farmer Information Support Centre before the end of the project,
       established the basis for continuing provision of agricultural extension services.
       Farmers realise that they need extension services and wish the FISC to continue
       its activities.
      It also became clear that the physical improvements made under the project,
       particularly collector and drain remodelling and deep ripping to remove plough
       pan and improve soil permeability, were having very positive impacts on yields,
       even in areas where improved agricultural practices were not being used.
These are very positive outcomes. It is of course important that appropriate institutional
support is provided to ensure that the benefits are built upon in the future. In part, this
may be achieved through the proposed follow-on project SKWRMIP.
Demonstration Plots: DPs were used to show farmers “best practice” with respect to a
multiplicity of activities directed towards the improvement of soil properties and full
satisfaction of plant requirements for nutrient elements and water.

During the first three years of the project a total of seven DPs were established in Beruniy
(six for cotton / wheat / secondary crops and one for vegetables), and eight in Turtkul
(seven and one). The vegetable demonstration plots were added to the DP programme, to
ensure that the majority of households in the project area directly benefited from the
agricultural components of the project. This was to compensate for the fact that only a
relatively few have leasehold farms, which were the original main focus for the DP
programme. This is instrumental in the increase in vegetable production and productivity
in the project area. A manual, for the future use of any interested parties, on the
development and works to be done in DPs was issued (informally) in the English,
Russian, and Uzbek languages.

Farmer Field Schools: A Curriculum Development Workshop was followed by training
of trainers - the three Field Team members from each district. Between the beginning of
2006 and the end of 2009 a total of 691 farmers took part in 55 FFSs. The emphasis was
on practical training sessions. During the course of the work, an implementation manual
for FFSs was developed.

A Farmer Information Support Desk (FISD) was set up to provide current information
about agricultural production costs and prices, the tax system, and relevant laws and
governmental resolutions, and to act as an agricultural extension services tofarmers and
local authorities in the project area. FISD activities were also directed towards raising
farmers' awareness of DIWIP.




                                            42
Booklets on 20 subjects and bulletins on 19 subjects were prepared; more than 14 000
booklets and 860 bulletins were distributed. For training and display purposes more than
100 posters were prepared. This extension service closed on 1 July 2008, when the
Farmer Information Support Centre (FISC) was officially established in its own offices in
Beruniy and Turtkul.

Farmer Information Support Centre: The function of the FISC is to provide similar
services to the FISD, but with the addition of publications for the visual and written
media in order to widen the impact of the extension activities. The intention was that the
FISC would become financially self-supporting, by charging fees to users of the services
provided. The FICS was registered in 2009, in Turtkul, as an NGO by its manager. After
project support was withdrawn, the FISC’s continued existence faced uncertainty.
However, the khokimyat has since provided support and as of early 2013 the FISC was
functioning with 3 technical staff.

1.3.4 Amu Darya basin water management studies

There are two major risks to the success identified related to DIWIP with respect to water
management in the Amu Darya Basin:
    Reliability of irrigation water supply; and
    Impact of flooding on the irrigation and drainage infrastructure and the irrigated
       land in South Karakalpakstan.

Water allocation study
The water balance of the Amu Darya and the allocation of water in drought years were
reviewed, and the mechanisms used for allocation of water in such drought years
investigated. The current practice for managing floods was also studied. A tool for flood
routing from Tuyamuyun reservoir was developed. The recommendations made and the
tools provided will, if used, reduce the likelihood of flood damage to the irrigated land in
South Karakalpakstan.
A simple tool was developed to demonstrate the potential for incremental improvement
of the existing method of allocating water. This tool is based on the reporting / planning
format already used by the BVO, but has additional functionality. This then links with the
water user database and irrigation scheduling programme developed under DIWIP.

Flood management study
A preliminary evaluation of Tuyamuyun reservoir was undertaken (with a more detailed
assessment undertaken in the first phase of the follow on SKWRMIP study). This
highlighted the effectiveness of current operations, but also that refinements would be
beneficial for managing potential risk.
DIWIP investigated the risk of flooding to the South Karakalpakstan irrigation and
drainage infrastructure arising from flood discharges entering the canal network when
required to protect Tuyamuyun reservoir and the riverine areas downstream.
Such releases are accommodated through a combination of:
      Spare conveyance and storage capacity in certain canals with river intakes

                                            43
      Many of the structures installed under DIWIP have overflows; existing structures
       do not have these.
      The wetlands at the end of SKMC provide some buffer storage to large flows
       entering AMD, as do the wetlands along the AMD.

Baday Tugai
It appears feasible to provide controlled inundations of the Baday Tugai reserve. If these
could be done early in the summer before peak floods occur, to achieve the target
ecological benefit, such flooding could be achieved at relatively modest discharges. A
detailed assessment of the concomitant flood risk to other areas of the riverine strip needs

1.3.5 Irrigation scheduling and O&M

Tools for irrigation scheduling

A pilot area was delineated: part of the command area of the Nayman-Beshtam pump
station, covering about 22 000 ha. Following extensive discussion, a program was
developed based on the existing planning and management system as two mutually
interactive modules:
     Water Use Planning in WUAs and
     Water Use Planning in Pakhta’arna-Nayman ISA.

Input forms were developed for canals, farms, fields, and WUA, district and Irrigation
System Administration (ISA) data. Databases for the districts, WUAs and ISA were
constructed. Water management options for different supply and flow conditions were
investigated. The software was installed on the computers of the PAN ISA district offices
in Bustan, Beruniy and Turtkul, and training provided to a few selected individuals. A
Users’ Manual was also provided.

A key concern for the system operators was the considerably larger data collection,
verification and appraisal work required to make use of the scheduling software. In
particular the tool was developed on the premise that the user was the anchor for data
referencing. However, the higher turnover in irrigators at any individual outlet is a
complication which may subsequently be best resolved through geo-referencing.
Given the considerable advances in mobile phone and field-device technology, including
GPS functionality, it would appear feasible that in a relatively short period it should be
possible to collect the data relatively quickly and thus circumvent the valid concerns
currently held.

1.4    Service contracts
Three primary service contracts were let:
     DIWIP/Con/1            Project Implementation Consulting Services
     DIWIP/Con/2            Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision of EMP
       Consulting Services


                                            44
      DIWIP/Con/3           Follow-up Monitoring and Evaluation Consultancy
       Services.

This report is prepared under DIWIP/Con/1.
DIWIP/Con/3 followed on from DIWIP/Con/2 to cover the extended project
implementation programme. There was a gap of about a year between the two contracts
as the procurement arrangements were completed for the follow on work.

The DIWIP/Con/1 services included:
    Preparation of designs, procurement documentation and contract administration
    Capacity building, particularly focusing on farmers and WUAs
    General support to the PIU.

Co-location of the DIWIP/Con/1 team with the PIU in Beruniy allowed good
communications and enabled the PIU management to be confident they understood
progress and issues. It also meant the PIU were alerted to and able to support addressing
problems which arose.
Working across an extended site with multiple contracts, and with the underperformances
noted above, put considerable pressure on the supervision team. In this context, the
national target for capping contract supervision and administration costs (ie the
“engineering”) at 5% of the contract price is not necessarily beneficial. As contracts
become more complex (whether through interaction with other contracts or through the
amount of detail in design and execution) overall savings can potentially be achieved by
providing value engineering. This can be in the form of overall cost reductions through
rigorous design optimisation to save both capital and operating costs.

The two monitoring and evaluation contracts (DIWIP/Con/2 and DIWIP/Con/3) yielded
useful information on implementation and the impact of the project. There were several
occasions when information provided under these contracts was critical to decision
making.

Typical monitoring and evaluation activities were:
    Collection of baseline data
    General monitoring activities
    Review of contractors’ Site Environmental Management Plans and Environmental
       Auditing at construction sites
    Adjusting datasheets for socio-economic data
    Development, filling and testing of monitoring databank Seminars for local
       stakeholders and discussions with relevant stakeholders on Lake Ayazkala, Lake
       Akchakul, wetlands and Baday Tugai, including mitigation of salt blown by wind
       and erosion of spoil banks
    Enquiries for additional observation wells and hydro posts,
    Delivery of ArcGIS, ArcView 9.2 (Russian version) for the Hydromeliorative
       Expedition
    Impact monitoring
    Completion                       of                annual                reviews

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     The project’s ex-ante economic analysis was prepared during the project
preparation and included in PAD. Therefore the current ex-post economic analysis
compares the actual project results and performance under the baseline situation applying
the same analytical approaches and methods that were used at project appraisal. ERR:
21.8% and NPV: USD 36.4 million.

2.      Primary data and information were collected from the project implementation
reports and from other similar WB projects. A conservative approach was applied to the
presented analysis.

3.      Project benefits: The main project benefits will come from the increased
agricultural production in the project area. Other quantified benefits, which are also
included in the economic evaluation, are deriving from the decreased salinity in Amu
Darya river, resulting in the increased agricultural production in the downstream areas.
Among other benefits that were taken into consideration are the direct benefits coming
from wetlands that will come from the increased fish production, muskrat skin production
and reeds production. Savings from elimination of drainage and irrigation pumping were
also considered as project benefits and included in the analysis.

4.      Agricultural Benefits. Agricultural benefits result from two main activities of the
project, (i) construction of better functioning drains consisting of SKMD and AMD and
the rehabilitation of the main collector drains in the project area; and (ii) the development
of WUAs for better irrigation management through users participation, and command
area improvements, including rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems, and
introduction of land levelling in WUA areas, demonstration of improved irrigation
practices, and farmers’ information services.

5.       The drainage improvements resulted in increased cropped area and reduction in
soil salinity levels, which in turn resulted in increased overall yields, crop production and
farm income in the project area. At project appraisal it was expected that crop yields in
the project area would increase from 5% to 15%. However, the actual yield growth was
different depending on the crops. For instance, for cotton it was only 12%, while for
wheat and potato it was much higher - 96% and 69% respectively. Relatively low yield
growth was recorded for fodder, while yield of oil seeds dropped by 30%.

6.      It is estimated, that due to increase in crop productivity in Beruniy district, the
incremental net benefits for cotton will be about UZS 2.2 billion, for wheat UZS - 3.7
billion (for both commercial and dekhan farms), for tomato - UZS 229 mln and for
maize for silage - UZS 98 mln. In total, benefit stream of increased crops productivity
will amount yearly to about USD4.3 mln for Beruniy, USD 3.7 mln for Ellikkala and
USD 4.1 mln for Turtkul districts of the project area. However, in the presented analysis
only 75% of these benefit streams is conservatively considered as attributable to the
project, while the remaining 25% is assumed to be generated by activities and
improvements that are not directly associated with the project.

7.     Project cultivated agricultural area is increased by 12.4% in total. This increase
was mainly contributed by significant expansion of cultivated area under fodder crops
(maize and lucerne), vegetables and melon and increased cropping intensity. It is
estimated that the incremental benefit stream deriving from expanded cultivated area will
be about USD 5.3 mln per year.

8.      Downstream Agricultural Impact. As a result of the project, the saline drainage
water will no longer be pumped from the Beruniy collector to the Amu Darya with a
positive impact on the quality of the river water and on crop production in the
downstream areas of North Karakalpakstan. The average salinity of the drainage water is
4.8 g/l, and by diverting this water from the Amu Darya, the salinity of the river
downstream will be reduced from 1.01 g/l to 0.96 g/l. The high level of salinity in spring
time will affect growing of cotton, wheat and other crops. It is estimated that this will
result in the following increases: 0.7% for cotton, 1.0% for wheat, 1.3% for fodder, and
2.3% for vegetables and orchards.

9.      The total value of these increases for about 257,000 ha of downstream agricultural
area is cautiously estimated at US$ 885 thousand per year.



15
     WOP was estimated as an average area for 2005-2007 while WP – as an average area for 2010-2012.


                                                                 48
10.     Benefits from Wetlands. The direct benefits from wetlands will come from three
sources: fish production, muskrat skin production and reeds production. It is estimated
that the value of fish production from about 93 ha of lakes in project wetlands would be
about US$9,300 per ha. The production of muskrat is estimated at about US$4,000 per
1000 ha of wetland. Reeds are used for fodder, as construction material and it is also used
as a fuel for cooking and heating. With average yield estimated at 15 ton/ha, total
production of reeds will be 135 tons per 1000 ha of a wetland. The net benefits are
estimated at about USS3,400 per 1000 ha of wetlands.

11.     In overall, the total benefits coming from these sources of about 15,000 ha of
wetland in the project area are estimated at about USD972,000 per year. Other general
environmental benefits such as biodiversity, reductions of pesticides and other chemicals
in the drainage water and reduction in degradation of nutrients are not quantified.

12.    Cost savings. A considerable economic benefit of the project is the savings from
elimination of the drainage and irrigation pumping that is estimated as USD1.2 mln and
USD 145,000 per year respectively.

13.    Other benefits. The project would inevitably generate additional economic effects
which are not fully captured in the analysis of primary benefits. The project is expected to
increase general economic activities that can give rise to a multiplier effect of both capital
and recurrent expenditures and to increased activities in the agricultural sector. Other
secondary benefits include generation of additional and remunerative employment, such
as opportunities in the project construction work and related non-agricultural activities,
and generation of additional tax revenues. These benefits are not included in the
economic analysis.

14.     With proper drainage and reduction in soil salinity, the quality of vegetation on
uncultivated land is expected to improve. The long term damage to buildings, roads, other
structures, and utility lines throughout the project area including the urban areas would be
reduced, significantly decreasing the maintenance cost of these facilities. Proper drainage
would reduce ponds, the standing water bodies in the area which provide breeding
grounds for malarial and other mosquitoes and vectors, and pollution from domestic and
industrial effluents, reducing risks of human and animal diseases, hence improving the
general public health and environmental conditions.

Project and O&M costs

15.     The actual cost of the project used in the analysis is USD66.0 million including
the cost of implementation, design and construction supervision, project preparation cost,
technical assistance and training. The O&M cost for drainage pumping stations was
estimated at US$1.2 million per year which is expected to fall to USS0.83 million under
WOP case due to reduced pumping because of deteriorating condition of irrigated
agriculture and irrigation and drainage infrastructure. These costs are eliminated in the
WP scenario and the net increase in O&M cost with project is therefore, US$370,000.

Project Economic Analysis

16.     The period of analysis is 25 years to account for the long-term impact of the
project interventions. The scenario presented in the economic analysis is conservative.
The analysis presents the balance of costs and benefits of the project and it is based on
the actual data and results of the project.

17.      The analysis identified the quantifiable benefits that directly relate to the activities
undertaken following the implementation of the project, or that can be attributed to the
project’s implementation. The incremental quantifiable benefit stream comprises of four
main elements: (i) incremental agricultural production, (ii) benefits from wetlands, (iii)
downstream agricultural impact and (iv) savings from elimination of drainage and
irrigation pumping.

18.     In total nine financial crop budgets and five economic cost-benefit models were
prepared for calculation of the overall benefit streams, on the basis of economic prices.
All local costs were converted into their approximate economic values. A Shadow Wage
Rate of 0.6 was also introduced into the analysis to identify the opportunity cost of labour
in the project’s civil work costs. All values are given in constant 2013 prices.

19.     Given the above mentioned benefit and cost streams, the Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 21.8%. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the
Project’s net benefit stream, discounted at 12%, is positive - USD 36.4 million.

21.    Sensitivity Analysis. Actual economic returns were tested against several
hypothetic scenarios of changes in benefits that can happen in the future. The analysis
shows moderate sensitivity to the changes in benefits and these changes will not have a

                                                                   50
significant impact on economic return. For example, the economic viability will not be
threatened by a 20% decline in benefits and a fall in total project benefits by 30% can
reduce the base ERR only up to 15.4%.

22.    In a hypothetic scenario if only agricultural benefits would be taken into account,
the project ERR would drop to 18.8%. In another scenario with agricultural benefit
decreased by 30%, the project economic return would be at 15.4%.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The socio-economic assessment included:
Designing an evaluation methodology to assess the development of the population of the
project area, which includes:
     formulation of evaluation questions for the indicators provided in the TOR of
        DIWIP-1 and the selection of appropriate research tools for the description
     negative and positive impacts on the people living around construction projects,
        as well as around and Ahchadarya collector;
     migration or emigration of the population and its relationship with the impact of
        DIWIP-1;
     together with an expert on health care, any changes in health status and determine
        whether it is the influence of DIWIP-1;
     impact on special populations like the shepherds and fishermen, specific ethnic
        minority groups, etc.;
     any other negative effects on the lives of people in connection with DIWIP-1.
     assessment by collecting secondary data, primary data from administrations and
        through questionnaires from the public;
     data analysis and recommendations, together with stakeholders.

In the framework of the objectives of the Terms of Reference for the Consultant, the
implementation of social impact assessment was carried out through the following phases
of the study:
     Expert interviews - 15 interviews;
     A survey of households (HH) - A survey of 500 HHs;

Status of demography and migration on project areas: The results of the expert
interviews allowed describing the situation in the project areas. The population of the
project area is experiencing significant demographic changes that are characterized by an
actual decline in population in the districts. Despite the fact that official statistics reflect
the dynamics of positive natural population growth, provided a negative migration
balance, according to participants conducted expert interviews, the number of children
and fertility in the project area are reduced. One of the examples showing population
decline is the fact that some rural schools are not able to open the first class due to
insufficient number of children.

There are high levels of migration both within the areas from "desert" areas to the
"cultural" areas and out of the country as a whole. As a consequence, the population
increases in the villages and district towns, where the rate of irrigation is higher than in
those from where the population leaves. This is due to insufficient irrigation,
employment, income, and poor quality of infrastructure services (gas, electricity, etc.) in
remote areas.

The project areas are characterized by high population migration out of the country,
especially young men (aged 16-45 years) and the proportion of women to work. The
main directions of migration are Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. The main

                                              54
consequence of such a high migration is a gradual increase in the proportion of women,
children and elderly in the population and the decline in the proportion of men in the
labor market, especially skilled workers, machine operators, technicians.

Republic of Karakalpakstan has an out migration rate of 0.85% of the official inhabitants
(2007-2011, min. 0.6%, max. 1%). In the Project Districts the Net Out Migration was in
average 0.38 % between the years 2007 to 2011. Specifically, in Beruniy on average I tis
higher at 0.62 %, while in Turtkul at 0.28% and in Ellikkala at 0.24% it is below average.
There is a slight tendency of decline of the out migration. A relation to water availability
for irrigation could not be seen. The higher share of inhabitants leaving the region for
RK and Beruniy district might be related to the larger share of people living in cities
(Nukus and Beruniy). But to identify reasons for leaving would be pure speculation (less
jobs in cities, higher educated people leaving, less income from subsistence agriculture
possible). The trend would though fit with findings of the HH that income growth in
villages was higher than in cities. But this interpretation should be judged carefully as it
is based only on data from 4 years and could be check in an ex post evaluation in 2018
(10 years after redirecting the drainage flow to SKMD).

Current problems and their solutions: According to participants in the survey of HH a
major problem of the project areas are the poor quality of land (soil salinity) named by
one third of respondents and the lack of water for irrigation. Based on the current
problems of infrastructure and the environment in the project areas, the majority of
respondents noted that for more efficient operation of their farms, the following
improvements are needed:

 Respondents per Districts -                           % Beruniy %Turtkul % Ellikkala

Interviewed private farms (PF) ambiguously estimate optimization of land area after
acquisition of land from minor PF (10-20 ha) in 2011 and transfer them to a larger PF (50
hectares or more). PF consider this an optimal size for efficient management of land and
larger (100 ha and above) cannot be used effectively. The number of such large PF is
growing. However, some PF believe that the reduction of yield in some of the larger
farms is due to the fact that small PF are more carefully cultivating their land. In general,
over the last five years, the volume of production of primary products from the area of
land in the PF areas have increased, but the volume of production figures are still lower
than before the restructuring of the land.

Frequency of water supply to the irrigation canals: The main share of households
(60.0%) reported periodic delays in the supply of water in the irrigation system. The
largest number of farms, marking the periodic delays in the supply of water in the
irrigation system, is Turtkul district (70.5% of the surveyed households) and Ellikkala
district (67.9%). In Beruniy district periodic delays are marked by almost every second
household. Long delays in the supply of water in Ellikkala and Beruniy districts and
marked in every fifth household, in Turtkul - one in four. The major share of farms
marking long delays in the supply of water is located at the end of the irrigation system.
In general, households located near water sources are better supplied with water.

Potential yield losses through lack of irrigation water supply” Changes in the frequency
of water supply, lack of water for irrigation, low water and dry periods, the climatic
characteristics of the region lead to the fact that farms are losing crops. The estimated
potential losses are as follows:
 Losses in districts of                     % Beruniy         % Turtkul      % Ellikala
 From 10% to 20%                               0.0               0.53           1.43

 From 50% to 80%                              68.24             63.16          59.29
 Up to 100%                                   17.65             28.42          13.57
Source: Results of the HHs Survey

The majority of respondents say they are losing from 50% to 80% of the crop in case of
lack of water for irrigation in farming area. The largest number of farms with crop losses
of up to 80% is concentrated in Beruniy and Turtkul districts - 68.24% and 63.16%,
respectively. In Ellikkala district to 80% of the crop is losing more than half of the
respondents - 59.29%.

Changes to the irrigation and drainage system in the last five years: Over the past five
years, the greatest improvement in the condition and operation of the irrigation system
are marked by Ellikkala farms – 71.4% of the respondents. Significant improvement has
been almost one in five farm of the district against one in five surveyed farms, marking
the absence of changes in the state of the district irrigation system.

In Turtkul district the situation of the irrigation system, according to the majority of
respondents did not change over the past five years - 44.2%. 42.6% of the respondents


                                             56
noted that there was improvement, of which only 4.7% of the respondents indicate
significant improvement and operation of the irrigation system in the district.

In Beruniy 45.9% of respondents note a deterioration of the irrigation system in the
district against 41.2% of those surveyed households that speak of the absence of changes
in the system over the past five years. Beruniy district has the smallest proportion of
respondents who noted improvements in the irrigation system in the area over the past
five years - 12.35% of the respondents.

In general, the three project areas 40.4% of respondents noted improvements in the
irrigation system versus 36.6% of respondents who say that the situation in the last five in
the system has not changed. One in four respondents said that the situation with the work
of the irrigation system in the last five years has worsened.

The drainage system: Some 47.2% of all households surveyed noted improvements in
the drainage system, of which 14.6% reported significant improvement.

Improvement of the status and functioning of the drainage system is found in Ellikkala
district- 76.4% of the respondents, of which 37.9% marked significant improvements in
the system. One in six respondents indicates that there is no change in the operation of
drainage system in the last five years. Deterioration is marked only by 3.6% of the
respondents. Improvements in the drainage system are marked in Turtkul district - 50.0%
of respondents. At the same time 36.8% of the respondents said that over the past five
years, there is no change in the system. Deterioration is marked only one in twelve of the
respondents.

The activities of the WUA: From the point of view of the participants of interviews
WUA is a key institution for the project. WUA operate the management, maintenance,
rehabilitation, repair, and improvement of irrigation systems in the project areas.

Expert interviews reflect the following difficulties faced by the WUA in its activities:


                                             57
      The contributions of the PFs do not allow WUA to purchase vehicles and
       equipment for the operational management of water, for the maintenance of
       irrigation and drainage systems (IDS) and pumping stations (PS);
      Low income of PF does not allow to increase the capacity of WUA;
      The existing legislative environment is not adequately designed concerning the
       level and needs of WUA. A non-governmental non-profit organization does not
       allow the WUA and farmers to develop commercial relations between them. Due
       to the uncertainty and the institutional weaknesses of some WUA, experts believe
       that the WUA must be commercial organizations, and others – be state owned;

Management of water in the WUA: Based on the results of interviews and weak
institutions WUA environment for its operations due to the following causes and
consequences, namely:
     Lack of and instability in the supply of water for the PF and DH, which are
         located at the end of the irrigation system, or on elevated areas of land;
     The absence or lack of water limits (normal delivery) for the "second" crop;
     Wearing down and destruction of aqueducts within the irrigation system, siltation,
         collapses channels laid in the ground, and the collapse of the concrete lined
         channels;
     Loss of water, water table rise and overflow of the drainage system due to the
         reasons set out in paragraph 3;
     Lack of equipment for cleaning inter-farm irrigation and drainage systems, and
         labor - cleaning of irrigation and drainage systems within the lands PF and DH;
     The need for pumps and power charge for lifting or delivery of water and the lack
         of the possibility to offset these costs through product prices, which is bought in
         these farms for the same price as in the farms with gravity irrigation;
     Lack of participation in the design of PF and execution of works in the irrigation
         and drainage systems;
     Lack of authority of WUA and, accordingly, the lack of incentives for water
     Conservation and imposing of penalties for excessive water consumption.

The need to improve the institutional role of the WUA: According to its farms and
interviewed experts in an environment where the state plays a key role in the planning
and procurement, strengthening of the institutional role of the WUA must be entrusted to
public bodies. Experts believe that the farmers are not ready to engage in the
development and strengthening of WUA own. Members of expert interviews among the
proposals to enhance the effectiveness and usefulness of WUA from the following:
     WUA should have a sufficient number of vehicles and equipment for the
        maintenance of irrigation and drainage systems (IDS) and pumping stations (PS);
     It is necessary to increase the participation of WUA to inform water users about
        the forecasts and plans for distribution of water. This will optimize and improve
        the system of irrigation water saving;
     There should be an honest and fair distribution of water;
     Increase efficiency and transparency in the measurement of irrigation water
        supply water;

                                            58
      Consolidate disparate group of PF in a single network service IDS;
      Increase the right of PF for the available products and give PF guarantees for
       stability of tenure;
      Provide irrigation water on the principle "Aylanma" - from the end of the
       irrigation system, where this is possible.

Experts believe that the achievement of these goals is impossible without investment to
the WUA, and especially without the provision of loans and leases based on mutual
responsibility of water users. In case of doubt about the return of loans, such loans and
leasing services should be given to groups of WUAs, united solidarity and a single
irrigation and drainage system. This kind of loans / leases will allow more effective use
of technology; will provide the basis for consolidation and cooperation of PFs around the
WUAs regarding water relations.

Most experts believe that the prospects of the WUA are unquestionable, but if the WUA
will not be supported in their institutional development, the WUA will turn into a quasi-
governmental subdivision or district ISM departments or District Departments of
Agriculture and Water Resources (DDAWR).

Participants of expert interviews in Beruniy district have come to decision that without
effective water management between users and enhancement of the capacity and role of
the WUA, the effect of the project will be below the potential. For this reason, they
recommended the following:
     In the first place - save water and to introduce a progressive scale of sanctions for
        not sparing use and incentives for saving water.
     Allow farmers to guarantee a steady supply of water and / or crop insurance
     Increase farmers' rights in matters of placement and crop rotation.
     Increase the rights of WUA and relationships with farmers, strengthen the legal,
        financial, technical and qualifying capacity of WUA and their employees.

Participants of the expert interviews in Turtkul district proposed the following:
     To effectively use of canal requires action and investment of the water users in
        water saving facilities and technologies. Hydro-structures to be built in the intra
        farm canals of the project areas. This will better manage the distribution and use
        of water resources and their economies.
     Population and farmers need to be trained to manage the water and how to be
        involved in this operation. The inefficiency of water management leads to such
        effects as increased groundwater levels and soil salinity, which generally reduces
        the effectiveness of the implemented project in the districts.
     Management of water between users should be centralized in the WUA, while
        now each farmer control water abstraction from the irrigation system by means of
        pumps, which to a small extent will also remain in future.

The capacity of WUA should be strengthened by such measures as:
    Mandatory monthly fees for services rendered by WUA;


                                            59
      Monitoring the contractual relationship between WUA and farmers by the
       Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources;
      Monitoring of contractual relations and compulsory payments and contributions
       of farmers from the Tax Authority.
      Farmers should have accessible services of organizations that have excavators and
       equipment to level the fields and parcels. The participants gave examples of such
       organizations.

Conclusions and recommendations of the socio-economic assessment: According to the
results of the survey the DIWIP is relevant and in demand. Improvement of irrigation and
drainage system in the project area leads to land reclamation. The project is supported by
all stakeholders: Government, government and non-government organizations and
institutions, professionals, large and small agricultural producers are feeling the effects of
land degradation, as well as private households whose income for the overwhelming
majority is directly or indirectly dependent on the position of the agricultural sector. The
same is true also for owners of housing, industrial facilities and the social infrastructure.

The self-assessment of participant of the survey found that about half of the interviewed
noticed an increase of their well fare during the last five years while the other half did not
notice a change. A group of 19.4 % was found with little welfare and being socially
vulnerable or suffering from poverty. In general a rising income level was observed more
in villages than in cities, due to increased activities in vegetable and fruit production.
Although the logic model of increased production returns through improved drainage,
agricultural land and slightly improved irrigation water supply is still unquestioned, the
M&E Consultant could at this time of the M&E not find direct representative evidence
from the HH survey that this is directly related to the improvement of drainage and
irrigation.

Positive employment effects could not be observed. While the biological growth of the
population was positive, a migration from remote desert areas to farming areas and cities
was observed and further a working migration to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan
overruled this effect. Seemingly the income alternatives through migration were more
attractive than additional income achievable as a result from improvements achieved by
DIWIP.

According to the survey the availability of irrigation water and quality of land is specified
as main constraints to agriculture also other additional improvements were wished by
farmers as the freedom to choose one’s individual production pattern, improved
availability of inputs as fertilizer and fuels and land ownership rights and a reduction in
tax burdens. In general the report on constraints in agriculture compiled by the
predecessor M&E Consultant (in his Annex 12.1 to the 2009 Annual Report) holds still
true.

There are many risks associated with insufficient capacities and abilities of farmers and
WUA to sustain the system of irrigation and drainage. Most WUAs are still not in a
position to protect the interests of farmers, because they themselves are in dire need of

                                             60
improving their resources, human capacities and institutional development. These risks
need to be addressed through technical and financial support to the WUA, as well as
through the elimination of the then prevailing situation where there are objects that are
not listed on the balance sheet of any organizations, as well as a series of overlapping
responsibilities among organizations such as PAN, KHE, BM PSPG, WUA.

For the project realization there it is also required that the government will continue to
support the infrastructure of irrigation and after the project activities end to ensure the
sustainability of the positive change. A definite conclusion of the social survey is the
inability of agricultural producers to improve, maintain and support the irrigation and
drainage systems in good condition relying only on own funds.

Regarding the SK WRMI Project: In general, the experts interviewed within the frames
of the project, noted that the project will have the positive socio-economic outcomes,
such as:
Improvement of irrigation and drainage will not only put enough water to irrigated
lands, but also to restore abandoned and saline lands;
Increase the volume of water and improve the regularity of its filing will help
minimize the number and the level of conflict between the PF and the surrounding areas
within the district;
Rise of the volume and timeliness of delivery of water will increase the equity in the
distribution of water, and hence the productivity and well-being of the population as a
whole;
Reduce loss of farms in the production of agricultural products, increasing its
profitability and a corresponding increase in standard of living

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

         Comments to the Draft Report on Completion and Results of the
            “Drainage, Irrigation and Wetland Improvement Project”
      Received from the Ministry of Economy of Uzbekistan on April 23, 2014

The Completion Report for the Drainage, Irrigation and Wetland Improvement Project
(WHO DIWIP) generally provides a good foundation, summarizing the project needs and
creating a context for the project preparation period. However, in our opinion, the
criticism of the objectives expressed due to low calculations of the project, does not truly
reflect the opinion present during the project preparation. So, to some extent, the prices
of the year 2014 are being applied to the year 2004 situation. Moreover, the technical
success and the material environmental improvements have not been highlighted as
positively as they should.
With this in mind, we provide the following comments and remarks to the report:

1.      In paragraph 2 on page 1, delete the words “As part of ASBP, “because IFAS is
not part of ASBP, as indicated on page 1. On the contrary, the ASBP was approved by
IFAS.
2.      Paragraph 3 on page 1 should be excluded;
3.      In paragraph 4 on page 2, the words “Taxation took place mainly through
exchange rate policies.” should be deleted;
4.      In paragraph 10 on page 4, the words “one of the poorest regions in Central
Asia “should be deleted.
5.      In paragraph 31 on page 9, the sentence “ The restructuring had been first
initiated already in January of 2008 but was only finally processed some 2 years later
to be approved in December 2009 “ should be replaced with “The final restructuring
was processed in December 2009.”
6.      Eliminate par. 38 on page 11 and the footnote to the source www.uznews.net
because the text is not supported by reliable data.
7.      Eliminate par. 48 on page 13.
8.      In paragraph 57, the words “one of the poorest regions in the country with a
significant percentage of the population living below the absolute poverty level “
should be replaced with “a region in Central Asia most affected by the desiccation of
the Aral Sea.”
9.      In paragraph 62, on page 18, the sentences “ On another note, the employment
situation could be affected by high population migration out of the country, especially
young men aged 16-45 years. The main consequence of such high migration is the
decline in the proportion of men in the labor market, especially skilled workers,
machine operators, technicians.” should be deleted.
10.     Through the document, such geographical names as Turtkul, Beruniy,
Akchadarya, and Ayazkala should be corrected.
11.     Paragraph 27 states that: “It was then decided to contract deep ripping and
laser leveling of demonstration plots with a local contractor who also was responsible
for on-farm irrigation/drainage rehabilitation works. The contractor had no
experience with such work and was unable to mobilize the proper equipment or
machine operators. Consequently, that contract was cancelled and the decision went
                                            63
back to purchase a number of tractors, laser levels and deep rippers to perform this
task.” It would be better to put it that “the work associated with deep ripping and laser
leveling were performed under the contract MS/1.”
12.      Paragraph 31 states that: “Given that major contracts had accumulated
significant delays, the reallocation was processed along with a project closing date
extension to June 30, 2013.” In our opinion, within the scope of DIWIP there was only
one main contract SKMD/1, which has been extended by only 90 days, and stating a
strong delay would be unfair. The reason for the relatively lengthy renewals for some
other smaller contracts is that only two years after the mid-term review, the application
for restructuring was submitted to the World Bank. Moreover, it should also be noted
that during this additional time mainly those works were performed that had been made
possible due to the savings of the contract DIWIP/SKMD/1 but not the work provided
for in the initial scope of the project.
13.      Paragraph 37 states that: “The limited access and poor quality of key economic,
financial, and social data impeded a detailed, realistic assessment of the project’s
selective baseline benchmarks and final targets.” Although it is recognized that 15-20
years ago there were problems in data collection, with the introduction of computer
technology the situation in data processing has been increasingly improving with every
day.
14.      Paragraph 39 states that: “There are no effective agreements signed between
Pakhta-Arna Nayman Irrigation System Administration (PAN-ISA), local agriculture
departments and WUAs on the division of power for water distribution.“ Since the
distribution of water is carried out on the basis of contracts signed between PAN-ISA
and the WUA; and between WUA and farmers, making such a statement is not correct.
15.      Further, paragraph 39 states that: “Lack of funding was the biggest challenge
for WUAs in Uzbekistan which ultimately led to (i) inadequate O&M of the I&D
network by WUAs; and (ii) high turnover of staff because of low salaries, which in
turn reduced the effectiveness of WUA training conducted by the Project.” It should
be noted that the WUAs are responsible for the maintenance of on-farm irrigation
network, and government agencies are responsible for the rest of the system. Especially,
after the Land Reclamation Fund was established in 2007 under the Ministry of Finance,
a well-organized program has been implemented for the rehabilitation and/or
construction of irrigation and drainage network.
16.      Paragraph 45 states that: “Seasonal changes in drainage water flows in
collectors also affected progress where at time excavation had to take place with water
still in the collector thus impeding visibility and creating difficulties with geometric
leveling instruments to ensure proper slope of excavations.” Although the performance
of work during periods of high water levels in the reservoirs is not a big problem in
general, it should be noted that a sufficient scope of work was implemented in some
other sections allowing almost continuous performance of work under normal
conditions.
17.      Paragraph 49: the project should be named as Ferghana Valley Water Resources
Management Project.
18.      Paragraph 49 states that: “Overall from discussion with consultants and
stakeholders, there appears to be appreciation for the softer investments in WUAs and
optimizing irrigation management at the local level, though at the higher level

                                           64
administration there was substantial push back on institutional development TA.”
Given the level of support and interest on the part of local government bodies of
Karakalpakstan during the project, it would not be correct to mention a strong
disagreement with the technical assistance in institutional development by the higher
level administration.
19.     Paragraph 50 states the following: “However, it appears that projected
outcomes were also based on agronomic and social variables which were highly
uncertain given the restricted access to data, political economy and distortions still
present in the agricultural sector. In addition, the project did not include surveys to
measure baseline values of these respective PDO and intermediate indicators, which
would have been appropriate given the issues with official statistical data. This was
probably caused by a two year delay (after the project became effective) in contracting
an independent M&E consultant.” The balseline values for PDOs and intermediate
indicators were provided in the Baseline Research and the Annual Report prepared by
M&E consultants and presented to the Bank. It should be noted that the contract
DIWIP/SKMD/1 only began in the last quarter of 2005 with the physical works starting
in early 2006 before the M&E consultants began their contract in the first quarter of
2006.
20.     Paragraph 51 states that: “Key indicators specified in the PAD were
continuously monitored throughout project implementation with an exception of
employment and income indicators that were left to be assessed at the end of the
project.” There was no such agreement.
21.     Paragraph 53 states that: “While there were a few issues related to audits of the
project with mostly unqualified auditor’s reports, the project experienced difficulties
with procurement where bid evaluation reports often took an excessive amount of
time and contract awards were delayed.” It should be noted that accounting firms were
selected through a tender based on their qualifications as a criterion. In addition, we are
of the opinion that the tender evaluation reports were prepared in a reasonable time and,
therefore, had no impact on the delays in awarding the contracts.
22.     Paragraph 53 states that: “Another issue that came to fore was the excessively
high tax rate that was applied to imported goods with the effect of reducing
competition such as in the case of project car purchases and equipment that took often
several months.” This has never been the case with DIWIP.
23.     Paragraph 53 states that: “In some cases, contractors suffered from cash flow
problems which posed a challenge whenever equipment broke or unforeseen events
emerged.” In accordance with the terms of the contracts, the contractors must submit
their cash flow forecast, and organize their work program accordingly to complete the
work in time. Those who were not able to perform this task, were fined in accordance
with the terms of the contracts.
24.     Paragraph 55 states that: “The follow up SKWRMIP project would also
continue strengthening the capacity of WUAs, and push for reforms that would
permit WUAs to operate more independently from the Pakhta-Arna Nayman
Irrigation System Authority (PAN-ISA) and improve their capacity for developing
irrigation schedules and work closer with farmers to play a more participatory role in
water management at the local level.” Although SKWRMIP seeks to strengthen WUAs



                                            65
and other relevant organizations, one should recognize that there are some limitations to
the reforms efforts that must be achieved by the project.
25.     Paragraph 60 states that: “However, this target was imprecise as it included
some 10% of double cropped area that was erroneously included and some area that
has never been put in use. The final design of the project determined the command
area at 103 000 ha. As it stands today the increased cropped area amounts to some
9%, while yields of the primary crops, cotton and wheat in 2012 where 20% and 13%
higher respectively relative to 2006.”. At the same time, in paragraph 79, the figures
showing an increase in productivity are stated the other way around.
26.     Paragraph 61 states that: “Further, project impacts on employment and income
were more difficult to assess at appraisal as public data on socio-economic indicators
were either unreliable or restricted. The project attempted to measure this indicator
through a final household survey, but it was confronted with the difficulty of
obtaining income information from farmers where the State controls much of the
supply chains for the main crops and a general fear of tax authorities.” As legal
entities, farmers pay taxes according to the relevant legislation, and we believe it is
incorrect to mention any concerns about the tax authorities.
27.     Paragraph 62 states that: “As it relates to employment, statistical information
does not point to an increase in the agricultural sector directly.” As the economy in
South Karakalpakstan almost exclusively dependent on agriculture and agricultural
industry, it would not be correct to argue that statistical information does not point
directly to an increase in the agricultural sector itself.
28.     Paragraph 65 states that: “More positively, and in line with new institutions that
attempt to represent their members, WUAs have played a key role in supporting the
local water authority in prioritizing works of the limited irrigation rehabilitation
under the project.” It should be noted that the priority was determined by PIU and
implementation consultants.
29.     Paragraph 66 states that: “In addition, the legal standing of WUAs is not
sufficiently regulated, creating conflicts with local authorities over the management
of water resources, and thus reducing their responsibility for the management of
sparse water resources.” It should be noted that the WUA, and other relevant
organizations operate in cooperation under the same legal framework.
30.     Paragraph 67 states that: “Overall, an impressive number of farmers were
trained and publications were issued and distributed, but no attempt was made at
measuring the actual adoption of the activities and technologies introduced under the
demonstrations.” As mentioned in other parts of the report, the farmers required land
leveling and deep ripping of their fields.
31.     Paragraph 69 states that: “For example, during water scarcity in the Amudarya
River in 2011 vegetation period, the water volume received dropped to 553.1 million
m3 or 61.9% and WUAs received less than 40% of requested volume.” It is not clear
what the 61. 9% refers to.
32.     Paragraph 70 states that: “Unfortunately, there were no baseline data
available.” Although it should be accepted that an exhaustive analysis is not provided in
the baseline research and the annual report prepared by the M & E consultants, the data
on the total volume of irrigation water withdrawn and discharged drainage water were
provided that can be used for a meaningful evaluation.

                                           66
33.     Paragraph 73 states that: “The incremental quantifiable benefit stream
comprises of four main elements: (i) incremental agricultural production, (ii) benefits
from wetlands, (iii) downstream agricultural impact and (iv) savings from elimination
of drainage and irrigation pumping.” While it is true that some of the pumps serving
the irrigation system were eliminated by building gateway regulators on the channels, it
should be noted that after the implementation of the SKWRMIP, the dependence on
pumping irrigation will be eliminated for more than 80% of the area.
34.     Paragraph 76 states that: “For example, the economic viability will not be
threatened by a 20% decline in benefits and a fall in total project benefits by 30% can
reduce the base ERR only up to 15.4%. In a hypothetic scenario if only agricultural
benefits would be taken into account, the project ERR would drop to 18.8%. In
another scenario with agricultural benefit decreased by 30%, the project economic
return would be at 15.4%.” There are discrepancies between the figures presented in
the table and the text that need to be corrected.
35.     Paragraph 81 states that: “The institutions that have been responsible at
primary and secondary PAN level have not changed and have not yet developed trust
in WUAs and often interfere with their activities. To make WUAs function better, the
responsibilities of each body will need to be harmonized so that roles, responsibilities
and rights are clearly defined for each party. At present this change is somewhat
impeded by the heavy hand of the state in determining quota areas for the principal
crops in the region, thus often forcing local administrations to interfere in the
prioritization of irrigation water access. The follow up project focusing more on
optimizing irrigation, will help in developing clearer mandates for each body involved
and with a more effective engagement of farmers also provide WUAs with a stronger
voice for advocating their priorities and assuming their responsibilities.” Within the
scope of SKWRMIP, SCADA system will be installed to reduce the issues.
36.     Paragraph 84 states that: “The overall investment comes with lower operating
costs due to reduced pumping for drainage as well as for irrigation thus presents a
fairly low risk investment. The drainage systems that were in place before the project
was not only suboptimal in design and in terms of coverage design, but also expensive
to operate due to dependency on lifting from pumps. Given the priority for irrigation
and power shortfalls, drainage pumps often only ran when electricity was
unavailable.” It is unclear what is meant by the coverage. The drainage pumps can
function when electricity is available.
37.     Paragraph 84 states that: “The weakest part of the project has been institutional
and the fact that still sizeable areas in the system suffer from poor water supply
reliability due to both suboptimal management but also constrained by the poor state
of the irrigation infrastructure. The follow up project under preparation will address
these two main constraints and thus minimize the sustainability risk of this current
investment.” The main purpose of SKWRMIP is to improve water management not
only by the physical implementation but also through institutional capacity
strengthening, so that the results achieved under DIWIP are sustainable.
38.     Paragraph 85 states that: “While the team was well aware of the complexities
with the engineering part of the system, it appears that outcomes were too much based
on agronomic and social variables which were highly uncertain given the restricted



                                           67
access to data, political economy and distortions still present in the agricultural
sector.”
39.     Paragraph 88 states that: “The commonly accepted international standards and
guidelines including concepts of competitiveness, transparency and a focus on
development outcomes were at times conflicted with practices of local authorities and
government.. . . . Also, it took the Government nearly a year to establish the field
office and set it functioning.” It should be noted that the Government of Uzbekistan
also seeks to increase the competitiveness and transparency in the use of scarce
financial resources.
40.     Paragraph 91 states that: “Obtaining adequately precise data on income and
expenditures from farmers is particularly challenging in a socio economic
environment as found in Uzbekistan due to restricted public data and fear from
authorities and taxation.” Farmers, as legal persons, pay taxes in accordance with the
relevant legislation, and we believe it is incorrect to mention any fear of the tax
authorities.
41.     Paragraph 92 states that: “Distortions in production systems where the supply
chain is largely controlled by the State and benefits are extracted from the region will
undermine the production growth potential even after base agronomic conditions may
have significantly improved.”
42.     Item 94: What are the lessons learnt with regard to restructuring?
43.     Item 95: It should be noted that as a result of the opportunities, such as leasing,
created for development contractors, obtaining proper equipment is no longer a
problem.
44.     Item 96: As indicated above, it should be noted that WUA, and other relevant
organizations operate in cooperation under one and the same legal framework.
45.     We propose to present some of the results contained in Section 1.3.3 of Annex 2,
in Section “Lessons learned”.
46.     Contracts      DIWIP/SKWRMIP/CON/1              and    DIWIP/SKWRMIP/CON/2
DIWIP/FWRMP/CON/1 should be added to Section 1.4 of Annex 2.
47.     It is necessary to edit the following statement in Annex 3: “However, in the
presented analysis only 75% of these benefit streams is conservatively considered as
attributable to the project, while the remaining 25% is assumed to be generated by
activities and improvements that are not directly associated with the project.“ – since
almost all of the factors affecting the benefits were considered in the project.
