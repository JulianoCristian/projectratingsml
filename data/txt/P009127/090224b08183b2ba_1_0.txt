                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making good progress. Most project activities have been completed satisfactorily. Construction under the SKMD/1, MS/1 and CAR/1 contracts have been handed over,
                         delays in construction under the CAR/2 and CAR/3 contracts have been cleared, and all major works have been completed under the D1/2 contract. Disbursements are satisfactory,
                         with close to 95% disbursed. Considering a request for cancellation that is being processed by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), disbursement is close to 100%.
