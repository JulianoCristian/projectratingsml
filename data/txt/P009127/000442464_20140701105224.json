Some lessons\n            learned included: user participation is a new model that\n            represents a new threat and an opportunity for both farmers\n            and the local water authority. It is important that both\n            parties know clearly the responsibilities and that there is\n            an understanding of mutual dependence that needs to be\n            adequately regulated in the laws governing both the water\n            users' associations (WUAs) and the local and regional\n            water authority. Distortions in production systems where the\n            supply chain is largely controlled by the state and benefits\n            are extracted from the region will undermine the production\n            growth potential even after base agronomic conditions may\n            have significantly improved. There is a need for better\n            awareness of the administrative clearance process in country\n            which can severely delay contract signature and procurement.\n            While it is understandable that governments will like to see\n            local contractors participate in bids as much as possible to\n            build up the local contracting capacity, this usually\n            entails increased supervision requirements and results in\n            implementation delays as contractors often lack adequate\n            equipment to perform the required tasks.
