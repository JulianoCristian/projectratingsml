                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.       The Drainage, Irrigation and Wetlands Improvement Project (DIWIP) is making progress in the implementation of inter-farm and on-farm I&D rehabilitation works, despite
                         delays that were mostly incurred in the past (harsh winter conditions, fuel shortages). Submission and certification of as-built drawings and O&M manuals for all works contracts still
                         need to be completed. Despite completion of staff training as planned, Water Users Associations (WUAs) continue to be weak and local authorities have so far not been able to take
                         full advantage of the project's investments to improve the quality of water management. Continued efforts need to be undertaken to ensure full understanding by local authorities of
                         the benefits of rational water management.

                         2. A Feasibility Study (FS) for a proposed South Karakalpakstan Water Resources Management Improvement Project (SKWRMIP) is almost completed. The project is included in the
                         Government's investment plans and in the current and future World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The design of SKWRMIP needs to incorporate important lessons learned
                         from DIWIP, including the need to ensure full involvement of local authorities and water resources staff in the design of the project, and the need to allocate adequate resources to
                         training. An environmental and social impact assessment of the proposed investments has been launched.

                         3. In consultation with World Bank Country Management, analytical work will be conducted into the impact of I&D rehabilitation on economic performance in Uzbekistan, and how this
                         could be amplified. The assessment will adopt a strategic and holistic river basin perspective on irrigation. The results of this analytical work will be used to guide preparation of
                         SKWRMIP.
