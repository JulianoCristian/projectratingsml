2.      The project has been rated satisfactory for progress towards development
objectives and moderately satisfactory for implementation progress for the last 22
months. All components have been implemented satisfactorily, and Component B, rated
moderately satisfactory, is making good progress in the implementation of inter-farm and
on-farm I&D rehabilitation works, despite delays that were mostly incurred in the past
due to harsh winter conditions and fuel shortages. On-going contracts include additional
works under MS/1, CAR/1 and D1/2, with scheduled completion dates of April 2011,
July 2011 and June 2012, respectively. Further, demonstration plots were established on a
number of irrigation and agronomic issues, as well as a Farmer Information Support Desk
(FISD) with preliminary encouraging results. Training of Water Users’ Associations
(WUAs) and water resources staff was completed in 2009 as per the project design, and
all funds have been spent. Regional water management staff and close to 700 farmers
have been trained, and training materials have been prepared. Compliance with the Bank
safeguard policies is satisfactory, as is procurement and financial management. There are
no outstanding audits.

3.    The proposed reallocation is necessary to cover a deficit in the category “South
Karakalpakstan Collector Drain” in the amount of US$218,000, which was created due to
exchange rate (UZS/USD) fluctuations. The required amount will be re-allocated from
the                              category                               “Unallocated.”
