                         Implementation Status Overview
                          The project reached its development objectives and most of PDO indicators were met.

                         PDO (1): To increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture, employment and incomes in Karakalpakstan, one of the poorest regions in Central Asia.

                         The project was successful in increasing the productivity of irrigated agriculture and incomes in the project area. Yield increases are met or exceeded as compared to the target value
                         of 10-20%, with cotton and wheat registering a 13% and 21% increase, respectively. Based on preliminary results of the household survey carried out by the independent M&E
                         Consultant, the level of income of the population in the project area has increased over the last 5 years, with an increased income levels observed mostly in rural areas. No data is
                         available on employment yet.

                         PDO (2): To improve water quality of the Amu Darya river by safe disposal of the drainage effluent, and enhance quality of wetlands in the Amu Darya delta.
                         The project was also successful in improving quality of the Amu Darya river by safe disposal of the drainage effluent, and enhancing quality of wetlands in the Amu Darya delta.
                         Diversion of drainage water of Beruni collector in AMD and, ultimately, to flood plains of Jandarya, significantly affected the quality water in the Amu Darya. Salinity reduction targets
                         are exceeded by far. In March and November 2012, the salinity reduction at Takhiatash barrage was 0.22 g/l and 0.20 g/l, respectively, as compared to a target reduction of 0.05 g/l.
                         Further, soil salinity has decreased in comparison with 2006 - non saline area has increased from 27,450 ha to 33,835 ha (+33.5%) and the area of low-saline land has increased
                         from 25,413 ha to 34,409 ha (+35.4%). In addition, following project interventions, the area with ground water level (GWL) was decreased by 5,535 ha; this has good impact for most
                         archeological monuments. The impact on environment has been positive as stable wetlands of total area of 2,250 ha have been formed along the SKMC and Ahchadarya collectors.
                         In addition, it was observed that the newly formed wetlands along the South Karakalpakstan Main Drain (SKMD) and Khachadarya are stable, provide adequate living conditions for
                         animals and plants, and form a corridor for migration of fish, birds and wildlife. These wetlands are expected to provide an adequate replacement for draining the eastern part of
                         Ayazkala lake. Finally, an increase of pasture area and the development of desert vegetation along the drainage collectors have been observed.

                         PDO (3): To develop the institutions for improving water management, operation and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation and drainage systems, and for promoting sustainable
                         irrigated agriculture through participatory irrigation management.

                         The project activities supported the establishment of 27 WUAs in Beruni and Turtkul districts. Total command area covered by the WUAs has reached 66,708 ha against the targeted
                         command area of 60,000 ha. The staff of these WUAs have been trained in management of irrigation systems of "Pakhta-Arna Nayman" (PAN) and Karakalpak Hydro-Geo
                         Melioration Expedition (KHE), as well as operation and maintenance of hydro-technical structures. Training was also provided for farmers, who received advice on improved
                         production technologies along with hands-on training on 15 demonstration plots. This contributed to the improvement of water resources management, operation and maintenance of
                         I&D systems, agricultural production and economic development in project areas.

                         Other project achievements include the following:

                         - Gross farm production of the project area has increased from 99 billion UZS in 2006 to 116 billion UZS in 2012 (+17%) – *roughly corrected (real) figures*;
                         - 617 various hydraulic structures were constructed on the irrigation network including 500 water outlets with water meters which resulted in the improvement of management of water

                         resources promoting rational and effective use of water;
                         - 97 water intakes of farmers were transferred from pump irrigation to gravity flow which reduced the cost of agricultural production (exploitation of these pumping stations used to
                         cost about US$ 1 million annually);
                         - The quality of drinking water was improved.

                         The PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This is mainly due to the increase in cropped area of 85,500 ha (average for 2008-12) as compared to the target value of 115,000 ha,
                         which is 26% below the target. In addition, the PDO indicator with respect to employment is not available. The MS rating is also due to the fact that, despite developing a water
                         abstraction point for Baday-Tugai forest, water supply continues to be unreliable at times of peak irrigation demand. This issue will be addressed by the SKWRMIP.
