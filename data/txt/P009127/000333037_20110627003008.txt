Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective is to improve the livelihoods of poor rural households (marginalized farmers
and women) in the Turtkul, Ellikkala, Beruni and Khujakli districts of Karakalpakstan through increased
income generating opportunities from sericulture and silk production by establishing and sustaining
community-based silk micro-enterprises while addressing the environmental degradation of the areas
caused by the decline of the Aral Sea.

2.      A significant undisbursed balance is available in the Category “Sub-grants”.
Delays in disbursement are related to (i) slow disbursements during the initial years of the
project due to inexperience of the Project Implementing Entity; (ii) difficult working
conditions in the project area, in particular in terms of communication; (iii) lack of
implementation capacities of one of the service agencies recruited under the project
working in Khujali and Turtkul districts and the cancellation of its contract; (iv)
appointment of a new head of the Project Implementing Entity; and (v) the fact that
micro-loans made available under the project were too small in size to help accelerate
disbursements.

3.      Despite these delays, project implementation has significantly improved recently
and the project was rated moderately satisfactory for progress towards development
objectives and moderately satisfactory for implementation progress in the most recent
grant progress report. Under component A, Group formation and training, the
implementing agency intends to train an additional 100 beneficiaries and 393 trainers, in
addition to the 1,060 beneficiaries and 207 trainers that already have received training.
Under Component B, Growing of mulberry, the Government has committed to providing

                                             4
close to 75,000 mulberry trees and 226.7 hectares of land to the poorer section of the
farming communities, and will make UZS 112.2m available for follow-up. Under
Component , Processing and production, and Component D, Quality silk
material/finished silk goods, the project intends to raise the credit limit from US $300 to
US $600 to private entities and US $1,500 to US $3,000 to legal entities so that
disbursements are expected to increase significantly. Under Component E, Project
implementation and management, the project intends to recruit staff, including an M&E
specialist and a lawyer.

4.      The proposed reallocation from the Category “Sub-grants” (USD 448,000) and
Category “Consulting services, including audits” (USD 11,064), to Categories “Training”
(USD 218,330), “Goods” (USD 170,220), “Civil Works” (USD 13,564) and “Incremental
Operating Costs” (USD 56,950), is necessary following less than expected demand for
sub-grants, as a result of which it is unlikely that funds in this category will fully disburse
by the project’s Closing Date. Reallocated funds will be used for further targeted support
to assist the development of the emerging silk production industry in Karakalpakstan and
to strengthen the sustainability of project outcomes by procurement of critical goods and
recruitment of key consultants’ services.

5.     The Project was approved in August 2006 and became effective on December 11,
2006. The Grant amount was USD 1,984,728.00. As of to-date, USD 901,802.19 has
been disbursed. The Closing Date is December 11, 2011. All interim financial reports
have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfactory. Audit reports were
unqualified, and there are no outstanding audit reports.
