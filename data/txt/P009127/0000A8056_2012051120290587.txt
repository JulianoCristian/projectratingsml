                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is making good progress in the implementation of inter-farm and on-farm I&D rehabilitation works, despite delays that were mostly incurred in the past (harsh winter
                         conditions, fuel shortages). On-going contracts include works under MS/1, CAR/1 and D1/2 some of which are additional works. As-built drawings and O&M manuals for these
                         contracts need to be completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following agreements were reached:
                         •        Thorough supervision is required to continue ensuring satisfactory quality and timely completion of outstanding works.
                         •        An environmental specialist (ES) has been hired by the M&E Consultants. The contract should be valid until the project closure.
                         •        Water supply to Baday Tugay forest needs to be ensured through improved water management, and this needs to be reflected in the design of the South Karakalpakstan
                         Water Resources Improvement Project (SKWRMIP).
                         •        Regarding lake Ayazkala, it was agreed that the State Committee on Nature Preservation (SCNP) will confirm the current status of the lake. It was agreed not to include any
                         works to stabilize soils, as the cost may not offset the incremental benefits.
