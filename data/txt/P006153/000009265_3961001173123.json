The\n            project finances three main components:  (a) the operations\n            of the BEF, including its enterprise investment program,\n            which initially is expected to consist of five joint\n            ventures and subsidiaries; (b) the employment of a\n            management firm to provide four experts for the BEF; and (c)\n            the provision by the BEF of technical assistance for\n            carrying out market research and feasibility studies for\n            identifying new investment opportunities for export of\n            additional agricultural products from Bolivia."}, "docdt": "1991-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
