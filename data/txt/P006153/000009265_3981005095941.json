Some of the lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) the principal lesson that can be\n            drawn from project implementation is that top\n            entrepreneurial management is necessary to invest and\n            monitor the use of such a large portfolio. A business\n            operation managed by people with a public service or\n            development aid profile is likely to under perform; 2) the\n            combination of local business relations, understanding of\n            the local business realities and private money could have\n            been obtained by including from the beginning a local\n            private financial institution as partner in Bolivian Export\n            Foundation (BEF); and 3) in a legal framework where\n            contracts can not be enforced through courts, official\n            business is hard to carry out. Companies in Bolivia are\n            mainly family businesses which can enforce contracts using\n            multiple contract compliance strategies. An organization\n            such as BEF does not have this type of business\n            relationships and has difficulty working in such environment."}, "docdt": "1998-08-03T00:00:00Z"}
