satisfactory outcome with\n            moderate risk to development outcome, and moderately\n            satisfactory performance by both, the Bank and the borrower.\n            The lessons learned were: (1) Project design. For a\n            decentralized project like DRDP, in a country with\n            considerable capacity constraints, institutional\n            strengthening, streamlining of procedures and capacity\n            building of staff on a regular basis have to be an integral\n            part of the project design. It calls for a proper capacity\n            appraisal of implementing/executing agencies. The assessment\n            should include institutional strength, skill and knowledge,\n            past experience in designing and implementation of similar\n            projects, financial management and procurement system\n            capacity, etc. (2) Implementation. While the Bank staff\n            would be available for support, getting hands-on help and\n            support from the experienced colleagues is a valuable source\n            to be utilized fully. Community ownership is critical for\n            the sustainability of project infrastructure. (3)\n            Monitoring. It is important to create an effective\n            monitoring and reporting system supported by a dedicated\n            tracking system and baseline information. (4) Fiduciary.\n            Capacity building of fiduciary staff and their familiarity\n            with the Bank\u2019s fiduciary requirements at the initial phases\n            of project implementation is important. (5) Sector-specific.\n            DRDP experience shows that for community managed small-scale\n            interventions, it would be beneficial to include a third\n            party monitoring of project interventions on a regular\n            basis. (6) Important factors for the success of a project is\n            continuity of project staff, led by an experienced project\n            director, capacity building and training, community\n            ownership and proactive participation in project design and\n            implementation are important both for the Bank and the borrower."}, "docdt": "2015-06-23T10:10:03Z"}
