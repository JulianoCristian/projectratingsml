H. Restructuring (if any)

The project underwent the following five restructurings:
   (a)First amendment of the Credit was in the definition of the Incremental Operating
      Costs; (b) Second restructuring was to extend the Closing Date of the project by
      15 months to December 31, 2010 to complete road contracts which required
      between 2-15 months for completion after the September 30, 2009 closing date;
      (c) Third Restructuring took place to extend the closing date by three months (up
      to March 31, 2011) to provide sufficient time for review and internal processing
      of a new FPCR TF Grant; (d) Fourth restructuring was to provide additional
      financing of US$5 million through the FPCR TF Grant, including a further
      extension of project closing date to December 30, 2013. Changes were also made
      to the project component as indicated above, and introduced a new set of
      performance indicators to measure Outcomes; and (e) Fifth restructuring extended
      project closing date by 12 months (up to December 31, 2014) to utilize the
      savings resulting from depreciation of the local currency versus US dollar.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal. The 2000 Poverty Assessment had found that absence of
roads was a major contributing factor to poverty in Bhutan. The Transport Sector Note
called accessibility “the defining development issue in Bhutan, be it access to opportunity,
enterprise, markets, or services”. Many Bhutanese communities lacked access to road
network, and depended on animal and head-load transport. One third of Geogs (blocks-
lowest level of government) had effectively no motorized access, and only 40 percent of
Bhutan’s population lived within one hour’s walking distance from a road. Access to
education and health services was limited. The efforts to diversify into cash crops had a
limited impact as in most cases agriculture markets were beyond the reach of farmers.
Besides contributing one third of GDP, the agriculture sector provided income,
employment and food security to most Bhutanese, especially the poor. The path to
Bhutan’s vision of Gross National Happiness, therefore, required concerted efforts by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MoAF) to focus on strengthening crop and livestock
production, forestry, farm roads and natural resource management. The Renewable
Natural Resources (RNR) Strategy under the 2002 9th Five Year Plan (FYP) aimed at
reducing rural poverty by achieving higher rural incomes and employment, improved
food security and sustainable natural resource management.
The path to Bhutan’s vision of Gross National Happiness, therefore, requires concerted
effort by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) in the Renewable Natural Resources (RNR)
sector, which comprises crop and livestock production, forestry, farm roads and natural
resource management.
Rationale for Bank involvement. The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) had
prepared development plans for 201 Geogs that ably reflected the expectations of rural
people in the 20 Dzongkhags (ddistricts) and had launched central programs to support
realization of the Geog Plans. As RGOB financial resources and donor provided funds
were inadequate to fully support these plans, RGOB sought the World Bank support for
financing the resource gap. The Bank had the ability to mobilize adequate financial
resources to meet priority needs for the 9th FYP and complement the RGOB and donor
programs. As a knowledge based organization, the Bank was able to bring in the global
knowledge, experience and best practice in the domains of rural infrastructure, fiscal
decentralization and community-driven development.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The objective of the Decentralized Rural Development Project (DRDP) was to improve
market access and increase agricultural output for rural communities in selected areas of
Bhutan.
Key indicators:
    • Average time taken to walk to motorable road (reduced from 3 hours to 1.5 hours
       on average);
    • Increase in food crop production (by 27% with 2004 as baseline); and
    • Increase in cash crop production (by 37% with 2004 as baseline).




                                             1
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
While PDO remained unchanged, key PDO indicators (and a number of intermediate
outcome indicators) were revised with the provision of Additional Financing of US$5
million through a Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) TF Grant in March 2011:

   •    Average time taken to walk to motorable road (reduced from 3 hours to 1.5 hours
       on average);
   •   Increase in food crop production (by 15% with 2009 as baseline); and
   •   Increase in cash crop production (by 15% with 2009 as baseline).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
At the time of project preparation, expected beneficiaries of the project included:
    • Farmers who would benefit from improved rural access to markets as well as
        from new or rehabilitated irrigation facilities;
    • Government Staff of Geogs and Dzongkhags who would benefit from training
        programs; and
    • Geogs, Dzongkhags, and MoAF would be strengthened through the institutional
        strengthening activities.

At project completion, the total number of beneficiaries was about 415,600 comprising
41,360 direct beneficiaries and 374,240 indirect beneficiaries. The female beneficiaries
were 202,445 out of which about 91,640 (45.25%) were direct beneficiaries and
remaining about 110,800 (54.73%) were indirect beneficiaries.

Besides the farmers, government officials also benefited from the project primarily
through the capacity building activities. The operation strengthened existing technologies
and facilities of the implementation partners such as National Seed Centre (NSC),
National Plant Protection Centre (NPPC), National Post Harvest Centre (NHPC) and
Renewable Natural Resources Research and Development Centers (RNR-RDCs).

1.5 Original Components

The project comprised the following three components:

Component 1: Rural Infrastructure (USD 5.10 + US$0.80 million)

(a) Rural access: This subcomponent was to focus mainly on farm roads and upgrading
of mule tracks to permit passage of power tillers. A target of 89 kilometers (km) of farm
roads, and upgrading mule tracks to 114 km of power tiller roads were to be screened and
implemented in accordance with the MoAF’s Farm Road Guidelines, and the
“Environment Friendly Road Construction” (EFRC) rules. Six small suspension bridges,
with the capability for power tillers and motorcycles and one motorable bridge to connect
a farm road, were to be constructed.




                                            2
(b) Irrigation: A total of 45 km of new irrigation channels and 231 km of rehabilitated
channels were proposed.

Component 2: Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) Centers (USD 0.75 million)

(a) RNR Center Construction: The subcomponent was to finance at least six RNR
Centres for which prototype designs already existed. In addition to this, the Geogs
requested an addition of offices for the “Gup” (Geog Head) and clerk.

(b) RNR Capacity Building: Provision of training and carrying out of demonstrations of
high value crops, livestock-raising practices and new agricultural technologies, and
farmer-to-farmer field visits in select Geogs.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (USD 0.35 million)

Institutional strengthening included capacity building of finance and procurement
officials of Geogs, Dzongkhags and the Administration and Finance Division (AFD) of
MoAF. Capacity building was to include Budget and Accounting System (BAS),
planning, administration, community mobilization and progress reporting. Another key
area was capacity building in social/environmental screening and assessment of sub-
projects, especially farm roads, irrigation works and RNR centers.

1.6 Revised Components

Following changes were made to the project components through Additional Financing in
March 2011, and FPCR TF Grant (US$2.42 million, 1.92 million and 0.66 million for
Component 1, 2 and 3 respectively). Subsequent restructuring in December 2013
allocated the project savings, due to exchange rate gains, to those components which had
the capacity to utilize additional funds.

Component 1: Rural Infrastructure
  (a) Rural access: Additional Financing (AF) increased the target for farm road
      construction from 89 km to 95 km, and added a target of rehabilitation of 15 km
      (increased further to 53 km in December 2013) of farm roads.
  (b) Irrigation: AF raised the target for the rehabilitation of irrigation channels from
      231 km to 393 km. It was further increased to 448 km in December 2013.

Component 2: Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) Centers and Support for
Improved Technologies for Marketing of Rice and Maize
   (a) RNR Construction: This sub-component remained unchanged.
   (b) RNR Capacity Building: It comprised provision of training for research and
       extension staff and farmers, and carrying out of demonstrations of high value
       crops and food crops (potato, maize, rice), livestock-raising practices and support
       for new agricultural technologies including seeds and post-harvest technologies in
       select Geogs.




                                            3
Component 3: Institutional Strengthening

This component remained unchanged.

1.7 Other significant changes

The project experienced the following key changes during implementation: (a) First
amendment of the Credit in the definition of the Incremental Operating Costs; (b) Second
Restructuring to extend the project closing date by 15 months to December 31, 2010 to complete
roads contracts which required between 12-15 months for completion after the then closing date
of September 30, 2009; (c) Third Restructuring to extend the closing date by 3 months (up to
March 31, 2011) to provide adequate time for review and internal processing of a new FPCR TF
Grant; (d) Fourth restructuring to provide additional financing of US$5 million through the FPCR
TF Grant, including a further extension of project closing date to December 30, 2013. Changes
were also made in the project component as indicated above, and introduced a new set of
performance indicators to measure Outcomes; (e) Fifth restructuring in December 2013 extended
the closing date of FPCR TF Grant by 12 months to utilize the savings resulting from
depreciation of the Bhutanese Ngultrum versus the US dollar.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Quality at Entry. The project’s quality at entry was moderately satisfactory.
• The project design was simple, straight forward, realistic and well structured. The
  design addressed Bhutan’s highest priority for improving rural access by building
  rural infrastructure and strengthening investment planning and implementation
  capacity at the district and local levels. It was based on a Bank instrument that was a
  winning combination of programmatic and Sector Investment Loan (SIL) operations
  and used the national systems effectively for implementation.The project was
  focused and proposed investments in six districts, since other districts were already
  getting support from the government and other donor resources.
• In view of the fact that Bhutanese economy was predominantly agrarian and major
  source of income and employment for a majority of rural population, and that several
  studies had clearly indicated lack of access as a fundamental constraint to increasing
  agricultural production, the project judiciously focused on infrastructure and
  agriculture-related investments. The project appropriately endorsed concrete roads
  with higher upfront costs with almost no maintenance costs over the first 10 years of
  the infrastructure creation.
• It relied on the decentralized rural development model that had already been tried and
  tested in a number of projects including the UNCDF pilots which had shown
  substantial impacts.
• Because of the constraints experienced in terms of remoteness of locations and
  availability of local population for limited time periods, the project opted to utilize the
  services of the private contractors for infrastructure activities.
• The results framework was robust and the causal links were solid and clearly
  articulated.


                                               4
On the other hand, the design had some drawbacks as given below:
• While risks were suitably identified, the mitigation measures were not well defined
    in the project document.
• Economic and financial analysis was not very rigorous. For example, cost-effective
    analysis was limited to roads infrastructure, and irrigation investments were not
    included. Furthermore the analysis lacked projected FRR of the benefits of the
    increased agricultural production; relying on broad studies to show benefits by
    comparing villages with access and without access, was not a very robust ERR/FRR
    approach.
• The PDO indicated only increase in agricultural production rather than yield increase
    (as a critical indicator of efficient water use).
• As mentioned in Section 2.3, M&E design had shortcomings such as absence of
    baseline data and weak M&E capacity at Geog level.

Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, sector background
was studied, key sectoral issues were analyzed in depth, and the government strategies to
deal with the issues were duly considered. For instance, investment priorities had already
identified through a major participatory exercise for all 200 Geogs wherein the rural
population had accorded high priority to rural roads, irrigation and other infrastructure.

Lessons of earlier operations taken into account. The following key lessons were taken
into consideration: (i) Decentralization is a long-term process that requires commitment,
predictable flow of funds, institutional strengthening and capacity building on regular
basis, (ii) simple and effective systems and procedures so that funds and subprojects can
be managed adequately at Dzongkhag and Geog level; and (iii) Dzongkhag officials are
“on-board” by incorporating project responsibilities into their regular mandate, as
opposed to being seen as additional burden. The project design was based on the ongoing
decentralization process in Bhutan and it devolved most resources and decision-making
powers at the Dzongkhag and Geog levels.

Risk Mitigation Measures. Although the risks were correctly identified, corresponding
mitigation measures were not well defined in the project document. For example, the risk
related to non-adoption of demonstrated technologies should have been mitigated by
recommending technologies that were successfully demonstrated in other parts of
Bhutan. There was little in the PAD about how this was to be achieved. The risk that
farmers would be unable to find markets was assumed to be mitigated by reduced
transport costs and improved access to motorable road. This was unlikely to be the case
for many remote locations where improved access alone would not have mitigated this
risk. Similarly, the risk related to rural population not utilizing infrastructure could have
been mitigated through awareness raising, but these measures were not included in the
project.

Another risk was associated with the fact that there was no separate PMU proposed for
DRDP. The project was housed in MOAF along with its other routine operational
responsibilities and this could have easily resulted in less than the required focus on
expediting implementation. A second key risk that was not identified related to


                                             5
procurement – given that the locations were really remote and may have ended up facing
getting the bids or timely completion of contracts.

Adequacy of Government Commitment. At the time of project preparation, RGOB
demonstrated a high level of commitment to the project objectives. For example, the
government was committed to decentralization by empowering local governments,
strengthening fiscal management at the local level, and undertaking capacity building of
government officials accordingly.

2.2 Implementation

The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in May 2008, to assess the project
performance, identify any implementation issues and recommend actions to ensure a
successful completion of the project. The MTR endorsed the MoAF revised target of
107.66 km length for eleven power tiller tracks (PTTs) against the original plan of 114
km of PPTs.

MTDF on Food Crisis Response provided a grant for US$5 million as additional
financing (AF), effective March 21, 2011, to mitigate the impact of rising food prices in
Bhutan due to low productivity, crop disease and global food price trends. The project
decided to focus on rehabilitation of irrigation canals and enhanced production of rice,
potato and maize. It resulted into an increase in the number of: (i) project Dzogkhags
from six to eleven, (b) targets for irrigation rehabilitation increased from 231 km to 393
km; and (c) additional indicators for specific crops.

Factors affecting implementation. The following factors had affected project
implementation:

(i) A lack of familiarity with the Bank’s procurement procedures and absence of a
dedicated procurement specialist led to delays, especially in the initial years of project
implementation. For example, a number of contracts had to be re-tendered due to this
reason.

(ii) In the early stages of DRDP, there were delays in the execution of farm roads and
irrigation schemes. It was primarily due to remote and inaccessible areas, non-availability
of building materials, unavailability of skilled labor, and limited technical capacity of
Dzongkhags’ engineers, especially in design, estimate preparation and supervision of
construction of farm roads.

(iii) Delays were experienced in funds release and timely reporting of expenditure
statements in the early stages of implementation, as Dzongkhag accounts staff were not
familiar with the project’s financial system and disbursement arrangements. Initially, the
project funds were not released and utilized on time, which led to the funds being carried
forward at the end of fiscal year. It led to problems in reconciling the funds, especially
when the project finance team could not provide adequate and timely oversight. The fact
that Dzongkhag officials were inadequately trained and experienced in project’s
procedures proved to be a bottleneck for project management.


                                            6
(iv) Construction work on four roads (Etonyesa-Simnorbu, Rakshidrangra-Chanutre PTT,
Pakshikha Zomgang, and Jangbee) was delayed due to a lack of response from the
bidders, exceptionally high bid rates or non-responsive bids leading to re-tendering.

(v) A high turnover of the Bank’s task team leaders (TTLs) made it challenging for the
government to maintain sustained communication with the Bank. As there was no TTL
for a protracted period of time the project, it lead to implementation delays.

(vii) On the positive side, despite several constraints and inaccessible project areas, an
increasing number of project Dzongkhags were proactive and efficient in implementing
the project activities. Judicious use of funds and efficient implementation made it
possible for the Dzongkhags to exceed their respective targets. It was made possible by
the effective leadership provided by the dzongdas (district administrators) and the district
agriculture officers (DAOs).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. Outcome Indicators and Results Indicators were developed to monitor the
project performance. The indicators included: (i) Average time taken to walk to
motorable road, (ii) Increase in food crop production, and (iii) Increase in cash crop
production. Although MoAF had a system in place to annually collect, compile and
publicize agricultural statistics for Geog and Dzongkhag level, initially the project was
missing baseline data. The project relied on the government system for data collection
and no separate arrangements were made to regularly gather and compare
productivity/yield data for project supported irrigation-schemes.

M&E Implementation. While focal persons (Agriculture Extension Officers) from
Dzongkhag engineering section, collected the necessary data for each intervention (cost,
beneficiaries, acreage, Cheogs, Geogs, start and completion dates etc.), its consolidation
at the central level into a comprehensive database remained weak. Consequently, there
were limitations to carry out any detailed analytic work during implementation or at
project completion. Nevertheless, ‘Commodity Coordinators’ made good efforts for
collection and reporting of data on rice, maize and potato.

M&E Utilization. Data collected from Geog was regularly analyzed and used for
informed decision-making. For example, data collected by the respective “Commodity
Coordinators” for rice, maize and potato were used to assess the seed replacement rate
and the progress made with farmers’ training and capacity building measures.
Considering the shortcomings such as lack of project-specific M&E system, relying
completely on the government system of data collection and reporting, weak institutional
arrangement for M&E, and lack of regular reporting, performance of M&E system is
rated as moderately satisfactory.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance.

Environmental Safeguards. DRDP has resulted in net environmental benefits to the
project communities. Amongst the key achievements are: (i) improved access to market
through the construction of farm roads, PPTs and bridges, (ii) ensuring dependable
irrigation supplies by constructing irrigation channels, (iii) judicious use of limited
available water for irrigation, (iv) improved on-farm irrigation efficiencies, (v) substantial
increases in crop yield per unit of water, (vi) low carbon foot print due to the reduction in
time to access market, and (vii) decrease in post-harvest losses.

The project supported community driven small-scale interventions such as farm roads,
PTT, irrigation schemes, and agricultural production enhancement through improved
seed supply, training, exposure visits, etc. While no significant adverse environmental
impacts were expected during implementation, the project developed an environmental
management framework, and each activity was screened to avoid and/or mitigate any
specific environmental concerns. The screening did not indicate any significant
environmental issues. No farm roads, irrigation schemes and other infrastructure
supported by DRDP are located in protected areas or in a known critical natural habitat.
None of the irrigation schemes’ source stream was known as important fish habitat or
migration route for protected/endangered/rare aquatic life/fishes. Minor and site specific
environmental issues encountered for some interventions (particularly farm road, PTT
and irrigation channel) were related to landslides and erosion, management of
spoil/debris, water management/ drain-outlet, felling of trees/ vegetation and workers
health and safety. These were locally managed.

Amongst the good environmental practices adopted by the project were: (i) obtaining No
Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Forest Office for works in the forest area, (ii)
disposal of spoil/debris in safe places, (iii) slope retaining and water management
structures, and (iv) bio-engineering/plantation for controlling/improving existing
landslides/erosions. Release of any new crop varieties was coordinated with the National
Biodiversity Center (NBC) which ensures conservation of local crop variety. The project
did not support any purchases of chemical pesticides and fertilizer. Instead, green manure,
such as use of sesbania (Dhaincha) as bio-fertilizer plant, was promoted.

Regular monitoring of environmental mitigation measures of small-scale interventions
spread over dispersed and difficult to access locations was challenging as the District
Environmental Officers responsible for environmental monitoring were overworked. In
the absence of adequate training and third party monitoring, documentation and reporting
remained sub-optimal. Requirements for the implementation of Environmental
Management Framework were not included in the project legal agreements. The overall
rating is satisfactory.

Social Safeguards. The project triggered OP4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) to address
potential social risks associated with acquiring additional land for project interventions.



                                              8
In order to assess social impacts and necessary mitigation measures for managing any
adverse social impacts, the project developed a Social Impact Management Framework
(SIMF) including resettlement framework.

The primary instrument that the project used to ensure due diligence in safeguards
compliance was the social screening for new infrastructure planning. Social screening
was carried out for new farm roads and irrigation schemes. In the case of additional
financing, since all construction activities were confined to the renovation of small
community-managed irrigation channels and improvement of farm roads, it did not
require any social screening. The procedure employed for voluntary land donation i.e.
MoU were viewed by the community members as satisfactory and working well. No
major negative impacts were reported or complaints lodged by the beneficiaries on loss
of large parcels of land or assets, loss of livelihoods or relocation of households due to
project interventions. In some cases (15%), land was donated on voluntary basis.

The overall environmental and social safeguards rating is rated as satisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management. The FM performance of the project was unsatisfactory during the
initial years of implementation due to various issues such as quality and timeliness of the
FMRs, funds flow related issues, cash management and disbursement of funds, limited
capacity and understanding of the finance staff about the Bank’s fiduciary requirements,
Although some good progress was noted during the mid-term mission, even at that time,
the issues of disruption in contractor payment schedule were noted due to: (i) delays in
the release of funds to Dzongkhag/Geog, (ii) “outages” in Designated Account, and (iii)
reconciliation issues in FMR. The efforts jointly made by the MOAF and the Bank
including continuous handholding and training of staff, streamlining of cash flow issues,
regulated payments to the contractors the FM performance improved considerably in the
later years of project implementation. It have had a positive impact on the
implementation speed and project outcomes.

Procurement: The project in general complied with the fiduciary covenants during
implementation. Initially, there were serious capacity issue as the officers at the
Dzongkhag level did not have any experience in handling procurements funded by the
World Bank. Although internal control arrangements were in place, and adequate system
for financial management, procurement records, and disbursement monitoring were
maintained and improved considerably over time, an absence of any in-house or hired
(consultants) procurement expertise led to considerable procurement delays during the
early years of implementation. In several cases, it resulted in rebidding. Nevertheless, the
Bank’s post-reviews did not identify any noticeable procedural violations, collusion or
F&C issues. In fact appropriate recordkeeping was identified as an area requiring
significant improvements.

Combining all relevant factors, fiduciary compliance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a) Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for continuing future operations
appear to be adequate, as demonstrated by the following measures adopted by MoAF.

Institutional: Project activities and processes (M&E, social and environment safeguards
practices etc.) are already well integrated within the RGOB’s institutional framework.
Enhanced staff capacity resulting from the project, are well streamlines and internalized,
especially at the Ministry, Dzongkhag and Geog level. Furthermore, Institutional capacity
of implementing partners have been strengthened. For example, research units have better
facilities for research by having irrigation, necessary field equipment, training and
exposure to staff, improved inputs, and with land terracing. The facilities for seed
production have considerably improved with the installation of seed separators, fencing
of seed production areas, construction of irrigation system, installation of processing
units and aeroponics facility. The e-pest surveillance system is ready to capture all pest
organisms and establish a database for necessary pest control and prevention, to minimize
crop losses. The national database on irrigation is now available for use for development
and improved O&M of the irrigation infrastructure in the 11th Five Year Plan (2013-
2018).

Technical: Activities implemented by the project have been incorporated into the
government’s 11th FYP. Some of the programs outlined in the 11th FYP that would ensure
continuity of the project activities include the following:

•   Rural Infrastructures: (i) construction of new irrigation schemes for rice- based
    farming system, (ii) improving existing irrigation infrastructures, (iii) promoting and
    strengthening of effective functioning of water user associations (WUAs), (iv)
    developing irrigation water allocation system in the country, (v) pilot implementation
    of lift/pump irrigation including water harvesting, and (vi) construction and
    improvement of farm roads.
•   RNR and Extension Activities: (i) promoting the use of high yielding varieties
    (HYV), (ii) introducing, evaluating, assessing and producing high yielding varieties
    including biotic and abiotic stress tolerant varieties and characterization of local
    germplasm, (iii) promoting and demonstrating integrated plant nutrient management
    and soil fertility management including green manuring, integrated pest management
    technology including disease diagnosis and surveillance, (iv) promoting
    mechanization services through hiring services, mobile clinics, supply of machineries
    including privatization, and (v) enhancing the capacity of farmers and extension
    agents on operation and maintenance of farm machineries.
•   MoAF is working out institutional arrangements and budgetary allocation for
    sustainable use of the DRDP-supported roads. Road User Groups (RUGs) have been
    formed for regular maintenance works including minor repairs. However, some roads,
    especially those stretching over a long distance, would require higher level of inputs
    for maintenance than what RUGs can voluntarily contribute in the form of labor.
    Major repairs requiring machinery and skilled labor will be beyond their capacity,
    and it would require financial and technical support from Dzongkhag and Geog. The


                                            10
    PMT is preparing a plan for putting in place suitable institutional arrangements to
    finance the maintenance work for each farm road in consultation with the users, as
    well as the Dzongkhag and Geog authorities.
•   As per the government guidelines, no MoUs or agreements are to be signed with any
    communities which are benefiting from the project. Instead, handing over a document
    is signed for O&M after the completion of work. As stipulated in the farm road
    guidelines and national irrigation policy, communities are responsible for routine and
    minor maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure.

Budgeting: In the annual budget, the RGOB has allocated funds for operation,
maintenance, renovation and rehabilitation of DRDP supported interventions including
road maintenance, and for institutions such as National Seeds Center to sustain their
activities. Further, Geog administration and communities are committed to maintain and
sustain the project interventions. Nevertheless, should a natural calamity hit a Geog, govt.
allocated budget may not be sufficient to meet all the emergency needs for rehabilitation
and reconstruction.

Staffing: Capacity and technical knowledge of MoAF, Dzongkhag and Geog officials
have been considerably strengthened through several training programs, study tours and
international exposure visits organized by the project. For example, extension agents now
have better knowledge on paddy, maize and potato production and farmers’ group
formation. Similarly, many engineers now have improved knowledge on irrigation
survey, design, cost estimation, construction technology, water management and O&M
that guided implementation effectively.

(b) Follow-on project. While an IDA funded follow-on project is not under preparation
as such, Bhutan has been awarded grant funds from the Global Agricultural and Food
Security Program (GAFSP). Accordingly, MoAF and the Bank are preparing a Food
Security and Accelerated Poverty Reduction Project which, to the extent feasible, will
build up on the lessons and success of DRDP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objective. The project objective remains highly relevant to Bhutan's
current development priorities. DRDP activities are in line with the government policy to
enhance self sufficiency in food crops that was challenged by the remoteness of villages
without road connectivity and irrigations facilities. For example, access roads and
irrigation for agriculture production with a focus on extension, seed production and post-
harvest technology are exceedingly relevant for Bhutan. While several donors are
engaged in this sector, there are opportunities for the Bank to continue supporting this
sector.

Relevance of design and implementation: Although the core design and implementation
arrangements remain extremely relevant, valuable lessons learned from the project should


                                            11
be taken into account while designing future projects. Likewise, while project
implementation process turned out to be relevant, efficient and effective for achieving the
project objective, additional capacity building measures on quality management, local
institution building, fiduciary and M&E are recommended. The implementation model
has considerable relevance, especially due to decentralized implementation at Dzongkhag
and Geog level, participatory identification of investment priorities, O&M of assets with
the help of user associations, Geog financing for O&M maintenance, and districts
supporting O&M in emergency situations.

Rating: Considering these factors, the relevance of objectives, design, and
implementation is rated substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

 As per the 9th Fifth Year Plan, over 800 km of existing schemes were to be rehabilitated
and over 300 km of new irrigation channels were to be constructed4 in Bhutan. DRDP
contributed 65% and 14% to the national targets by supporting construction of 42.5 km of
new channels and rehabilitation of another 522 km.

Satisfactory. The project was successful in achieving its objective. The following
achievements demonstrate the direct correlation between the project outputs and the
resultant outcomes. For example: (i) access to the nearest road point has greatly improved
as now it is within ½ an hour reach for 78.2% HHs, (ii) with the construction of farm
roads and PPTs, farmers are able to transport cash crops and produce, such as cardamom,
oranges, rice, maize, potatoes, vegetables directly to agriculture markets, and are earning
more by improving their net margins, and (iii) following the construction of farm roads,
several service facilities such as basic health units, construction of new buildings for
primary schools, RNR centers, and community centers are now available at closer
distance within the Geogs.

The project has made valuable contribution in enhancing the productivity of major crops
such as rice, maize, potato through double cropping, provision of quality seeds, improved
farm management practices, improved extension services, rehabilitation of irrigation
schemes and post-harvest support. Overall, the project has made a tremendous social and
economic impact on livelihoods of the beneficiaries. The details of the project’s major
outcomes and achievements are as follows:
(i) Improving market access for rural communities
 • In terms of walking distance to the nearest road point, an evaluation in 2011 found
      that only 50.6% HHs were within walking distance of 1 hour to the road point. The
      project has greatly improved the accessibility of rural households to the nearest road

                                             12
     as 78.2% HHs are within a walking distance of ½ an hour, 14.5% HHs are between
     ½ to 1 hour of walking distance, 4.4% HHs are between 1-3 hours, and only 2.9%
     HHs are between 4-6 hours of walking distance.
•    Prior to the construction of farm roads, farmers were spending significant amounts
     of money for the transportation of cardamom, oranges and other cash crops to the
     market. The project-built farm roads have enabled the farmers to transport these
     crops directly to the agriculture markets. As a result, their net margins have
     increased and household incomes have gone up. An increasing number of farmers
     are now planting cash crops including cardamom and oranges.
•    Following the building of farm roads, several services and facilities are now
     available at closer distance within Geogs. For example, basic health unit,
     construction of new buildings for primary schools, RNR centers and community
     centers have opened up across the project areas. People are able to access extension
     services at closer distance, and extension workers are able to reach the rural
     communities with relative ease, unlike in the past when the workers had to walk
     long distances on one hand and farmers had to leave their farms and gather at a
     common point on the other hand.
•    Introduction of public transport service, purchase of private vehicles by local
     residents and improvement of existing houses and construction of new housing
     units have provided significant economic stimulus at the local level and have
     created new economic opportunities at the local level.
•    As a multiplier effect, formation of agricultural groups (mainly for vegetables) and
     establishment of livestock farms have picked up. This created significant impacts
     on income and cash at hand to women as most of the vegetable group members are
     women.
•    Access to credit has also improved with road construction. Mobile banking facilities
     and commercial banks have opened up branches in several Geogs. About 21% of
     the households availed loans primarily for the following purposes: (i) purchase of
     seedlings such as cardamom and orange, (ii) acquisition of improved cattle, (iii)
     house construction, (iv) buying of power tillers, power chain, equipment to
     minimize post-harvest losses, (v) establishment of agricultural farms (mainly
     livestock related), and (vi) commercial enterprises. By and large, all Geogs and
     Dzongkhags connected with farm roads and PTTs, have experienced increased
     economic activities in the form of new shops, enterprises and increased access to
     essential edibles and other items. Local vendors are regularly collecting vegetables
     and dairy products from the farmers and selling them in Thimphu and other towns.
     Farmers’ transportation costs for taking oranges, ginger and vegetables to
     agriculture markets have been reduced significantly.

There is enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that the benefits enjoyed by the project
communities include:
 • reduction in post-harvest losses as the yield reaches the market relatively quickly,
     and at less cost;
 • increased access to the regional and international markets;




                                          13
•    middlemen/buyers are able to reach the farmers easily and buy produces at farm
     gate;
•    new business and job opportunities for local people such as transport and allied
     businesses including tyre repair, auto workshops, oil and filter change, auto
     mechanics, repair of agricultural implements, agri inputs supply, sale of auto parts,
     grocery stores, food and teas stalls.

(ii) Increasing agricultural output for rural communities

The project has contributed significantly in enhancing productivity of major crops such as
rice, maize, potato through double cropping, provision of quality seeds, extension
services, rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and post-harvest support.
The achievement of PDO indicator 2, “15% increase in food crop production (rice and
maize) from baseline (2009) for targeted Geogs” and PDO indicator 3, “15% increase in
cash crops production (potato and mandarin) from baseline (2009) for targeted Geogs”
has to be assessed by considering the following factors:

•   Due to the lack of DRDP-specific baseline to assess any increase or decrease in production
    or yield, it was agreed to use the national Agriculture Statistics Data 2009 as baseline.

•   Crop production output was dependent on a variety of external influences beyond the
    project’s control, in particular the loss of agricultural land to other non-agricultural
    uses, increased rate of agricultural land being left fallow due to labor shortage and
    exposure to wildlife damage. Thus, any productivity enhancement in terms of
    increased yields could be offset by the loss of land and could potentially not result in
    an increase of production per Geog or Dzongkhag.
•   Since DRDP did not work on all the irrigation schemes in a Geog, production gains in
    project-schemes could be offset by the production losses in non-project schemes
    within the same Geog. This begs the question whether the result indicator
    “production per Geog” was appropriate, or if measurement of productivity in terms of
    “yield per acre per project irrigation scheme” would have been a better choice. This,
    for example in the case of paddy, is supported by case-studies of very successful
    “project-farmers” in selected schemes of Thedtsho (Wangdue) and Sampheling
    (Chukha).
•   A comparison of agricultural production from one year to another generally runs the
    risk of being influenced by annual fluctuations due to extreme weather conditions or
    occurrences of pest and disease attacks. Accordingly, the results can change
    dramatically by choosing different reference years. In order to assess general
    production or productivity trends it is more useful to compare the averages based on
    2-3 years. The below graphs exemplify the variability between years for the paddy
    production in Bhutan.




                                             14
   A comparison of project Geogs or Dzongkhags to non-project Geogs or Dzongkhags
   is challenging as DRDP benefitted non-project areas as well. An example is the
   distribution of GLS-resistant maize varieties to GLS affected project and non-project
   Geogs and Dzongkhags (e.g. 3 non-project districts Luenthse, Trashiyangtse, and
   Pemagatshel received 4,460 kg of seed covering 297acres), or distribution of 9.7 mt
   of potato seed in Haa and Mongar districts. The use of “control-Geog” or “control-
   Dzongkhag”, therefore is of limited use, but nevertheless may serve as an orientation.
   Geog level data were only available for up to 2012, whereas Dzongkhag level data
   was available up to 2013. Therefore, the production or productivity increase in 2013
   or in 2014 could not be reflected in the ICR. It is especially relevant for potato, as the
   aeroponic seed production unit set up by the project at Paro research station will only
   release its first batch of 3G potatoes in 2016 for further multiplication by farmers and
   from there on for commercial production in 2017. Hence, the impact of the adoption
   of improved potato seeds cannot be measured at this point in time.
In consideration of the above, the ICR mission decided to use Dzongkhag data to report
on increase or decrease of production area, production volume and yield for rice, maize
and potato. “Total project” includes Chukha, Dagana, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Tsirang and
Wangdue from DRDP Phase 1, and Punakha, Sarpang, Mongar Trashigang and Samtse
from DRDP Phase 2. “Total control” includes 2-4 non project districts.

despite heavy land losses of 23.7%. Furthermore, the DRDP distribution of GLS resistant
maize varieties to three non-project districts (Pemagatshel, Lhuntse and Trashiyangtse)
in 2011- 2013 resulted in impressive production and yield increases of +69.1% and

DRDP fully achieved the potato target by increasing production by 10.7%, in comparison
with 1.2% production increase in the control districts. Nevertheless, an important
contributing factor to this growth could be the increase in acreage, as in several cases
farmers were confronted with deteriorating seed quality. It is reflected in an average yield
decrease of 6.7% during the last years when comparing averaged yield data from the
period 2011-2013 with yield data from the period 2009. DRDP implemented
counteracting measures by: (1) replacing seed potatoes by moving seed potatoes from
higher altitude farmers to lower altitude farmers, and (2) producing disease free improved
potato seeds through aeroponic culture. It is important to note that the full project impact
is expected in 2017 when the first improved potato seed produced through the aeroponic
unit will be released to the farmers.
A more detailed analysis shows considerable success in increased production in 4 of 11
project Dzongkhags, namely Chuka (+72.1%), Trongsa (+99.6%), Mongar (+36.7%) and
Trashigang (+73.6%). In these districts DRDP fully achieved its target of at least 15%
increase in production.
In summary, the overall achievement is as follows:

3.3 Efficiency
Pre-Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
No overall rates of return were provided in the financial and economic analysis annex of
the February 2005 PAD and no discussion was presented of irrigation investment benefits.
However, calculations were presented as to expected improvements in travel times due to
investment in road access in the six Dzonkhags (districts) covered by the project under
Component 1. Secondary data was also provided on the experience of changes in
agricultural production following road construction, the variance in household incomes


                                            17
between those with and without road access, and educational enrolment rates with and
without road access. No estimates of the impact of irrigation infrastructure provision
(also under Component1) were given. Under Component 2 (RNR Centres) and
Component 3 (Institutional Strengthening) information was given only on construction
targets (6 new RNR Centres) and training (5 course types), respectively.

Post-Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
No estimates of direct benefits to road construction under Component 1 have been made
as there is insufficient data available. The principal impact of the irrigation investment
(also in Component 1) was to permit the expansion of wetland paddy production, and this
was critical for rice production. The benefits arising from the investment in irrigation are
thus subsumed within the crop income calculations. However, the beneficiary survey
undertaken by the borrower shows that improved road and power tiller track access has
important benefits beyond the key crops of paddy, maize and potatoes. Nearly half of all
households benefitting from improved access reported increases in vegetable production,
while smaller percentages increased dairy and citrus output. Commercial activity (trading,
processing etc.) also increased. These benefits are not captured by improved productivity
of the target crops.
For Component 2, the completion survey determined that 12-18 percent of potential
households in the 11 project Dzongkhags were beneficiaries of support to rice, maize and
potatoes. The survey also identified percentage output increases for each crop. As there is
no breakdown in investment costs for individual crops, it is not possible to calculate
returns for each crop.
No attempt was made to quantify return to institutional strengthening activities
(Component 3).
Whole Project Analysis
In all, the project provided benefits across 7,609 hectares and may have affected as many
as 35,000 households. This latter figure must be treated with care, however, as some
households may be active in more than one of the crops, leading to double counting. In
total, the crop-related benefits associated with the project reach over USD 1 million per
annum, although there is no longitudinal information to determine the year in which such
benefits were first generated. This constraint has been addressed by making conservative
assumptions as to the build-up of benefits over time. No crop benefits at all are assumed
for the first three years of the project and full returns are only achieved at Year 6 of
implementation.
Financial returns to crop productivity improvements under the project were not only
strongly positive, but robust. Even when including all irrigation investment costs, returns
from crop productivity improvements reach almost 30 percent and remain above 20
percent even when the results were tested against a 20 percent decline in crop benefits.
A whole project analysis based entirely upon crop-related benefits yields negative
financial and economic rates of return as approximately 60 percent of total project
expenditures were directed at road and power tiller track improvements and construction.
In order to assess the financial returns to total project investment therefore, and on the



                                            18
basis of results from comparable projects in Bhutan and elsewhere in Asia, calculations
were undertaken based on assumed increases in incomes for the estimated 6,000
households directly benefitting from new and improved farm roads and power tiller
tracks. The results are shown in the table below. It can be seen that even under the
assumption that access to rural roads or power tiller tracks increases beneficiary
household income by only 10 percent (considerably lower than results from comparable
projects), a FIRR of over 15 percent is achieved, while if household incomes increase by
15 or 20 percent, the return to the project increases to approximately 20 and 25 percent.




Two main factors were considered for the economic analysis; labour costs and exchange
rates. Although labour costs are significantly higher in Bhutan than in other regional
countries, so is productivity and a 2010 World Bank study considered labour rates to be
competitive. No adjustments were therefore made in this factor. A 2014 IMF review
stated that there was a significant over-valuation of the Ngultrum (estimated at 16
percent), but as imported items comprise such a small portion of crop production costs,
the adjustment is minor. EIRRs for the scenarios considered increased only marginally, to
15.5, 20.5 and 25.1 percent.

On the basis of this analysis, therefore, and even in the absence of considerable key
performance data, the project it is considered likely to have been highly satisfactory in
both financial and economic terms if the above assumptions of moderate increases in
beneficiary household incomes is accepted. It is worth noting that over 35 percent of
respondents interviewed in the beneficiary survey noted that they had increased vegetable
production as a result of road access, while 72 percent stated that market access had
improved.

In addition, other important non-quantified benefits for which little data is available
include expanded dairy production (rendered feasible by improved road access), small
enterprise development and improved access to educational, health and employment
opportunities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Relevance: As explained in Section 3.1, the relevance of objectives, design, and
implementation is rated as substantial.




                                              19
Achievement of PDOs: As explained in Section 3.2, the project has many satisfactory
achievements to its credit. Thus, based on the extent of outcome of the project, the
achievement of PDOs is rated as satisfactory.


Efficiency. Various examples shown in Section 3.3 and Annex 3 have demonstrated that
there were operational and administrative efficiencies which came as a result of design
choices and the actual implementation approaches brought under the project.

Based on the above factors and the discussion in sections 3.1–3.3, the overall outcome is
rated as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts:

(i) Availability of access roads, irrigation channels, improved knowledge and skills and
increased income from agricultural products have helped villagers to purchase household
assets including television, rice cookers, refrigerators, furniture, livestock. Many
households reported to have purchased vehicles (cars, pick-ups and trucks) including
power tiller following the construction of road and PTT. For example, people from
Barshong Geog (Tsirang) reported that 80% of the households have repaired their houses
or constructed a new unit as the road enabled them to get construction materials quickly
at lower rates. Another multiplier effect is the economic transformation at the local level
by increased mobility to and from the project villages, increased access to jobs and
employment, and opening of new small businesses in the villages, on road junctions and
in the nearby towns. The project provided assets to the project partners such as
aeroponics unit, field equipment and more importantly, e-pest surveillance system.

(ii) DRDP had a substantial impact on enhancing livelihood of rural people and in
reducing poverty, especially in remote and far flung communities. For example, as per
the borrower’s Impact Assessment and Project Completion report, in 2014 the annual
income per HHs was above Nu. 30,000 for 43.5% HHs, which is an increase by 354.3%
as compared to HHs with this level of income in the past six years.

(iii) With the availability of road/transport and ease in marketing, intensification of
vegetables, with new varieties including potato and maize, and increases in paddy
production, it has been reported that there is improvement in nutrition at households.

Gender aspects:

(i) Women comprised 45% of the direct beneficiaries of the project. Due to increased
mobility, several producer groups (mainly women vegetable groups) have established




                                            20
their own farms and marketing systems. It has caused significant positive impacts on
women’s social and economic status including increased income and cash in hand.

(ii) Reduction in travel time has significantly reduced multitasking burden of women as
well as the opportunity cost of their time and dependence on men. It increased their
productivity and income, enhanced their mobility, and improved their access to health
and education services. With improved transportation facilities resulting from new roads,
women are able to travel to nearby towns, sell their produce, and earn higher incomes.
Women’s increased incomes have reduced their vulnerability. Many women are reported
to have savings and have opened bank accounts. As new schools and hostels for students
have been constructed in the project areas, more girls are now attending schools.

(iii) Agricultural mechanization has helped to reduce workload for women. For example,
construction of power tiller tracks have helped to reduce their workload and working
hours. Females are using power tillers not only to plough fields but also for several non-
farm purposes. Women do not have to carry loads of essential items themselves as in the
past; now they use power tillers in groups to bring in essential food items, agricultural
inputs, fish, vegetables, medicinal plants and dairy products.

Social development

(i) The project has made significant impact in improving social harmony, community
networks and overall social cohesion amongst rural population. The farm roads and
bridges in critical locations have improved the access and linkages between and amongst:
remote villages, rural townships, state service delivery, and marketing of local produce
and commodities. Better transportation facilities have improved communication amongst
rural communities and enabled them to mingle with each other more frequently. In
addition, improved social interactions have resulted in uplifting the confidence level of
people living in remote areas. It has been reported that ambulance services are now
accessible to remote locations, making it easier for emergency medical treatment at the
nearest basic health unit and hospital.

(ii) A greater sense of community ownership has evolved due to the fact that,
communities were directly responsible for identification and implementation of
infrastructure such as irrigation channel rehabilitation, PTT and farm road. Local
institutions such as water user groups and farmer producer and marketing groups also
enhanced the trust and confidence (social capital) among farm producers and women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

(i) Capacity of farmers have been strengthened through focused training programs, skills
enhancement and exposure visits related to crop production, demonstrations and trails on
improved variety of seeds, seed production and selection, integrated pest management
and demonstration on farm machinery, amongst others. The project provided valuable
training on hill irrigation and various orientations on environmental and social safeguards.




                                            21
(ii) DRDP’s capacity building efforts have had good impacts on project staff and rural
population. MoAF staff, and extension agents now have adequate knowledge,
understanding and skills for farmer group formation, paddy, maize and potato production,
improved farm management, pest control, livestock management, etc.

(iii) Government engineers have acquired greater knowledge and are better skilled for
irrigation survey, design, construction technology, water management, operation and
management which guided and facilitated effective project implementation. Significant
contribution has been made in the form of capacity building on aeroponics for potato seed
production. Officials and farmers have better understanding and skills in the areas of
post-harvest and value addition. Another significant impact is the development of e-pest
surveillance system for scaling up.

(iv) Dzongkhag officials have acquired a deeper experiences and understanding of
environmental and social issues and are well trained in undertaking social and
environmental screening and ensuring compliance.

(v) MoAF and government departments at Dzongkhag and Geog have greater technical,
financial management, procurement, implementation and O&M capacity to adequately
design, budget, implement, operate and manage government programs, annual plans and
funds.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
•   The use of pipes for irrigation has not only minimized losses through infiltration, but
    also, provided useful exposure to the engineering staff. The engineers now have
    adequate knowledge and experience in irrigation survey, design and water
    management. It helped to introduce lift irrigation and water harvesting interventions.
•   DRDP enabled the National Potato Program (NPP) and the National Seed Centre
    (NSC) to produce potato seed tubers using aeroponic facility at the NSC complex
    since April 2012. It is the first of its kind in the country for seed potato production.
    The facility was built using one of the greenhouses that already existed at the NSC.
•   The project was instrumental in the promotion and spread of biotic and abiotic stress
    tolerant crop varieties (drought tolerant rice varieties and disease resistant maize
    varieties). The positive selection process to raise awareness about the importance of
    quality seed to produce quality seeds and to impart knowledge on safe storage of seed
    for next season were important innovations of the project. The farmers were imparted
    with the knowledge of quality household seed production to sustain easy seed access
    within the community. Farmers were trained in site selection, variety selection,
    rouging at different crop stages in the standing crop, processing, labeling, packing
    and storage, etc.
•   The e-pest surveillance system is another important innovation of the project that is
    designed to capture information of all pest organisms (insect pests, disease organisms,
    weeds) that causes or have the potential to cause damage and loss to crops over time
    and space.y

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Highlights of the borrower commissioned Impact Assessment and Project Completion
Report are as follows:
•   The project has made good achievements in successfully implementing activities as
    planned: (i) 101% achievement for new farm roads construction, (ii) 102% for farm
    road improvement, (iii) 100% for power tiller track construction, (iv) 100% for
    construction of new irrigation channels, (v) 99.48% for rehabilitation of irrigation
    channels, (vi) 100% for construction of RNR/Geog Centers, (vii) 83% for
    construction of bridges, and (viii) 276% for farmers’ trainings/demonstrations and
    trails.
•   Productivity (yield) of paddy increased by 36.4% and production by 6.4% in 2012 as
    compared to 2006 and for potato there was 31% increase in production in 2013 as
    compared to 2006. In case of maize, there was 30% increase in yield and 11.5%
    increase in production in 2013 as compared to 2000.
•   Some of other key outcomes are: 19% higher yield than local variety for Bajo Maap 2
    and Khangma Maap (paddy), 49% higher yield than local variety for IR-64 (paddy),
    17345 minitubers of potato harvested in 2013 from aeroponics, and an increase from
    earlier 5 tons production to 60 tons potato seed from Phobjikha National Seed Centre
    (NSC) in 2012.
•    18.5%, 18.1% and 12.2% of respondents respectively experienced increased paddy
    maize and potato production. 12.7% households witnessed increased cash income,
    12.6% benefitted from improved marketing, 12.5% households’ walking distance was
    reduced significantly. Other benefits included availability of transportation vehicles,
    saving labor for agriculture and service facilities being available at closer distance.
    The marketing of agricultural products have improved in the past six years for 71.9%
    of respondents, and for 2.78% it remained the same as before.
•   In terms of walking distance to the nearest road point, it is within ½ an hour for
    78.2% HHs, between ½ to 1 hour for 14.5% HHs, between 1-3 hours for 4.4% HHs,
    and between 4-6 hours for 2.9% HHs. It shows a substantial improvement in access to
    market, as in 2007 the nearest road was within 1 hour walking distance for 45.7%
    HHs, which improved to 50.6% in 2011 and now to 78.2% HHs having nearest road
    within ½ an hour walking distance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The ICR team considers that the risk to development outcome would be moderate in light
of the following factors:
• RGOB has adopted and incorporated the DRDP approach, learning and best practice
   into the 11th FYP covering five year period of 2013–2018. It shows that to the extent
   feasible, DRDP experience and best practice has been mainstreamed at the appropriate
   levels in the MOAF, Dzongkhags and Geogs.



                                            23
• In the annual budget, the RGOB has allocated funds for operation, maintenance,
  renovation and rehabilitation of infrastructure include DRDP interventions. Besides
  coordinating with the farmers’ user groups for O&M, the government’s financial and
  human resources are available in the event of natural calamity/emergency such as
  landslides, floods, torrential rains and any major damages to infrastructure.
• Dzongkhags and Geogs have the ownership of the DRDP delivered interventions and
  are responsible for O&M. For this, they have dedicated: (i) expertise and staff, (ii)
  equipment and machinery, and (iii) budgetary allocation of NU 2.0 million annually is
  available to each Geog for O&M, are good indications of post-project sustainability.
  Likewise, Geogs are committed to maintain and sustain the project interventions. For
  example, Geog Yargey Tshogdus (GYT- Block Development Committees) have been
  mobilizing community labor to maintain the assets. Communities are also proactively
  interested and involved in O&M.
• As mentioned in Section 2.5 for infrastructure investments, Road User Groups (RUGs)
  have been formed for regular maintenance works including minor repairs. As per the
  government regulations MoUs are not required to be signed with any benefiting
  communities, instead a handing over document is signed for O&M after the
  completion of works.
• As stipulated in the farm road guidelines and national irrigation policy, beneficiary
  communities are responsible for minor O&M activities (drain cleaning, spot filling,
  small debris removal from form roads and PTT, vegetation clearing, blockage
  removal, intake and outlet structures maintenance for irrigation channels, checking
  pins and joints for bridges etc.)
• Enhanced staff capacity resulting from the project has been well internalized,
  especially at the ministry, Dzongkhag and Geog level. For instance, procedures and
  processes such as M&E, gender, social and environment safeguards practices etc. are
  already well integrated within the RGOB’s institutional framework.
• In some cases, DRDP initiatives need further strengthening of technical know-how
  and up-scaling for sustenance. For example, NSC which has taken over the aeroponics
  for seed production would require continued support for technology improvement and
  up-scaling. DRDP initiated system for poly-crops and e-pest surveillance needs to be
  scaled up and would require capacity building of users on a regular basis. Similarly,
  adequate research funds are required to further improve the seed farms, quality of
  seeds and for promotion and replication of improved varieties of seeds. The
  government is fully aware of this situation and is committed to meet the capacity
  building and funding needs to these important project interventions.

5 Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) of the project was carried out by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) in July 2005, and it received a satisfactory rating. It comprised
highly satisfactory rating for strategic relevance and approach, satisfactory rating for risk


                                             24
assessment, fiduciary, environmental, policy and institutional aspects, and moderately
satisfactory for poverty, gender and social development, and implementation
arrangements. QAG remarked that:
    • Focus of the project is on the binding constraint to Bhutan’s development (viz.
        rural access) and its relevance is, therefore, self-evident;
    •   The   project is realistic in scope, time frame, complexity, and within the
        implementing institution's capacity;
    • The DOs are simple, clear and realistic;
    • The combination of SIL and a programmatic approach, the selection of the areas
        of focus, the decisions on which areas to exclude from the project were all
        appropriate and high-quality;
    • The project was kept simple by excluding all but the essential elements for
        increasing rural access. Most experiences and lessons learnt from previous and
        similar operations were captured in the project approach;
    • Though much AAA had not been done by the Bank on agriculture and
        decentralization, the team diligently sought out experience of other donors,
        studied conditions on ground, and applied lessons learnt;
    • The economic rationale was well presented and the analysis was kept simple and
        sensible: Conditionality was well focused and kept simple, mainly on fiduciary
        aspects. The financing plan was adequate and well constructed;
    • The early adoption of country systems and simplified interim financial reports is
        commendable;
    • The PAD is an exemplary document, clear, candid, simple project design,
        practical results framework, and well balanced in its coverage of different
        elements. The task team deserves to be applauded for this.

During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of project
design and all major relevant aspects including technical, financial, economic and
institutional, including procurement and financial management. Several alternatives were
considered for the project design. In addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from
the earlier projects in the rural development sector were incorporated into the project
design.

Nevertheless, as mentioned in Section 2.1, the project design had some drawbacks. The
overall quality at entry is, therefore, rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory.
The Bank's performance during project implementation was overall satisfactory. During
the initial phase, high turnover of TTLs and lack of a designated TTL for some period,
affected project implementation. Subsequently and especially in the last few years, the
Bank task team has provided high quality implementation support to the government.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and
intensively supervised. The task team prepared Aide-Memoires regularly and alerted the
government and PMT to any issues and challenges the project was facing and facilitated
remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with the Bank procedures.


                                            25
The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the
project both in terms of achievement of development objectives and project
implementation. The task team also monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliances. The
Bank conducted a MTR in May 2008, and assessed progress on all project components,
implementation issues and the actions to be taken to ensure a successful completion of
the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

ith a moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry and a satisfactory rating for quality
of supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory in
accordance with the IEG’s harmonized rating criteria.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
As mentioned in Section 2.1, RGOB had shown commitment to the objective of the
project from conception to completion. The Minister, Secretary, and Project Director of
MoAF consistently maintained their commitment throughout the implementation period.
The government officials worked closely with the Bank’s task team on a regular basis,
and cooperated fully with the Bank staff.

Appropriate levels of review and approval were usually in place. Financial accountability
and follow-up was observed, and expenditures were duly authorized before they were
incurred, and documentation was maintained properly for periodic review. The project
did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems, as RGOB took timely corrective
measures and made appropriate budget provisions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The MoAF and the Project Management Team (PMT), in particular, were fully
committed to the project. PMT was led by the same Project Director throughout the life
of the project, which helped to ensure consistency in project leadership and institutional
memory. The project was an integral part of the RGOB’s annual program and budget. As
a result, the project enjoyed a high level of ownership both amongst the government
officials and communities. The project director and other government officials regularly
visited project communities and were able to streamline and strengthen the
implementation arrangements. The field staff spent significant amounts of time with the
communities to provide the much needed guidance and support for identification, design,
and implementation of project interventions. The local political leaders, especially Geog
administration heads were fully engaged in project implementation.

Financial Management. Overall the FM performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
For details see Section 2.4



                                              26
Procurement: The procurement performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. For
details see Section 2.4

M&E: As mentioned in Section 2.3, Dzongkhags and other collaborating partners
collected information from Geogs on needs basis. Geog officials regularly collected and
submitted data to Dzongkhag. The data collected from Geog was analyzed and used for
informed decision-making. Nevertheless, a dedicated project specific data collection and
analysis system was not established. Consequently, in-depth analysis and reporting of
project implementation progress remained weak. The performance of M&E system is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
With a satisfactory rating for government performance and a moderately satisfactory
rating for implementing agency’s performance, overall borrower performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory in accordance with the IEG’s harmonized rating criteria.

6. Lessons Learned
The lessons emerging from the DRDP are as follows:

Project Design:
    • For a decentralized project like DRDP, in a country with considerable capacity
       constraints, institutional strengthening, streamlining of procedures and capacity
       building of staff on a regular basis have to be an integral part of the project design.
       It calls for a proper capacity appraisal of implementing/executing agencies. The
       assessment should include institutional strength, skill and knowledge, past
       experience in designing and implementation of similar projects, financial
       management and procurement system capacity, etc. In line with the capacity
       needs assessment; a comprehensive capacity building component needs to be
       made a part of the overall project design.
   • For a small-sized country like Bhutan, it is pertinent to have an integrated and
       simple project combining various sectors such as infrastructure and agriculture for
       sustainable impacts on ground, and greater ownership of the project from the
       government and rural communities.

Implementation:
   • When an umbrella Ministry is the same, projects could benefit from sharing
      learning and experience of staff engaged in various past and present Bank-funded
      projects. While the Bank staff would be available for support, getting hands-on
      help and support from the experienced colleagues is a valuable source to be
      utilized fully.

   •   Community ownership is critical for the sustainability of project infrastructure.
       DRDP successfully revamped the exiting informal mechanisms of water channel
       maintenance by forming Water Users Associations (WUAs) and Road Users
       Associations (RUAs) for roads. It helped to ensure ownership and long term


                                             27
    sustainability of project interventions. WUAs and RUAs have worked well for
    operation and maintenance of irrigation channels and roads. The formal
    registration envisaged by the project and even by law (land act) did not prove to
    be successful, as WUAs/RUAs largely preferred to work informally.
    Future projects should continue forming such associations with a greater focus on
    orientation and training about O&M and raising funds for O&M, rehabilitation
    and replacement. Registration under relevant law/act; MOU with Geog
    administration; and compliance of maintenance plan (as given, for instance, in
    “Farm Road Guidelines by MOAF”) would be important for long terms
    sustainability of the project.
•   RGOB’s prevalent institutional arrangements largely worked well. Contrary to
    creating a separate project implementation unit with dedicated project staff,
    DRDP relied on the existing government system and staff. This cost effective
    implementation arrangement helped strengthen the devolved service delivery
    mechanism, ensured bottom-up grassroots participation, as all interventions were
    identified, planned and budgeted at the Geog level and approved at the
    Dzongkhag/central level, and created project ownership at all levels of
    government and communities.
Monitoring:
• DRDP has fully achieved or exceeded all project targets. The project did not
  develop a dedicated monitoring and reporting system; instead, need-based
  reporting took place. Data collection and reporting remained weak. For future
  projects, it is important to create an effective monitoring and reporting system
  supported by a dedicated tracking system and baseline information.
•   Integration of DRDP approach and interventions into regular government
    programs can be seen as best practice, and could benefit considerably by
    improved M&E either through dedicated project M&E staff or by strengthening
    the M&E capacity of MoAF, Dzongkhag and Geog.
Fiduciary:

• The use of country fiduciary system has worked well. As the country’s Public
  Financial Management system is being strengthened (either through the Bank’s
  support or otherwise), the FM capacity at the project level is also improving.
  Capacity building of fiduciary staff and their familiarity with the Bank’s
  fiduciary requirements at the initial phases of project implementation is important.

Sector-specific:
• DRDP experience shows that for community managed small-scale interventions,
   it would be beneficial to include a third party monitoring of project interventions
   on a regular basis.
• Orientation and capacity building of project staff and community members in
   ESMF implementation and compliance should be built into the project design. It
   should include handling and management of construction spoils, plantation/bio-



                                       28
        engineering works, health & safety at construction, preparation of screening, site-
        EMP, and hill irrigation.
    • In several developing countries including Bhutan, rural access is the binding
        constraint to poverty reduction and needs to be addressed upfront. DRDP is
        exemplary in this regard. Yet, once this constraint abates, the resultant growth
        may not respond to meet the expectations of rural population unless an early start
        is made to identify both traditional and new sources of growth in rural areas.
     • Future projects will need to pay greater attention to agriculture value chains, agri-
        business, seed production and storage and marketing facilities.
      • There is a need to be careful in agriculture diversification. The Bhutanese
        experience during the Indian ban on food grains from 2007-2009, led RGOB to
        prioritize food self-sufficiency and introduce carefully planned proportional
        diversification. Arguably, cash crop is important but it should not be at the cost of
        food crops.
    • Project interventions in infrastructure development (irrigation schemes, farm
        roads, market places, etc.) should be aligned with the capacity building needs in
        the same Geog/beneficiary groups, such as formation or strengthening of producer
        groups, marketing groups, improved production technologies, improved seeds,
        appropriate extension services, etc.
    • In order to increase food security/self-sufficiency, promotion of key commodities
        through infrastructure and capacity building should be aligned to possible
        economic clusters to fully exploit the available agro-ecological potential.
    • Restriction on project intervention areas (only certain Geogs/Dzongkhags) may
        restrict the impact if a project works on select commodities (area approach versus
        value chain approach). In fact, DRDP had to work outside the designated project
        Dzongkhags in order to effectively address the Grey Leaf Spot disease in maize,
        or to enhance seed potato production in climatically favorable Dzongkhags such
        as Haa, which was not part of DRDP.
Important factors for the success of a project:
 • Continuity of project staff, led by an experienced project director, capacity building
   and training, community ownership and proactive participation in project design and
   implementation are important both for the Bank and the Borrower.

                                    Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component-1: Rural Infrastructure

Farm Roads
The project overachieved the target by 162% and 144% respectively by constructing
138.27 km of new roads exceeding the target of 89 km at appraisal and 95.5 km at
DRDP-AF. Against an output target of
maintaining 53 km of road, the project
maintained 69.35 km of road, which
shows an impressive achievements of
131% against the DRDF-AF target.
While appreciating this achievement, the
Impact      Assessment      and     Project
Completion report 5 noted that the farm
road improvements were done in certain
places and not for the entire length of the
road. Based on the field observations and
witnessing the pliability of sampled
improved roads, the ICR mission is in agreement with the finding of the Completion
Report. Figure1 illustrates the achievement of outputs for new roads construction against
the target.
Power Tiller Tracks: Power tiller track is the first level of improvement to the existing
pedestrian way/mule track to permit passage of power tillers while leveling, grading and
widening (up to 3 meter) of earthen path. The project exceeded the target by 113% and
constructed 129 km of PTT against the target of 114 km at appraisal.
Irrigation Channel: The project achieved 96% of the target and constructed 42.5 km of
new irrigation channels against a target of 44.3 km at appraisal/DRDP-AF. The output
with regards to improvement/rehabilitation of irrigation channels was 521.98 km,
exceeded the target of 448 km set at DRDP-AF.
Bridges: The project constructed 6 bridges as per the target at appraisal. Two bridges
were washed away during the 2012 cyclone that caused huge losses in Bhutan. The
project rebuilt one of the destroyed bridges with the additional support of JICA. The
overall output achievement level was 83% and 5 bridges were constructed against the
target of 6.
Summary Achievements (%)
Of the 6 infrastructure subtypes, 4 types exceeded the PAD/DRDP AF targets; while the
remaining two fell slightly short of the target values as explained above. Fig: 2 reflects
these % achievements by infrastructure type.

Geographical Outreach and Beneficiaries
Farm Roads: New and rehabilitated farm roads were implemented in 6 Dzongkhags as
planned at appraisal. Twenty three new road schemes - with a total length of 138 km -
benefited 2,520 households with an average of 110 HHs per scheme and 18 HHs per km.
Similarly, 16 rehabilitated farm roads - with a total length of 69 km - benefited 1,575
HHs with an average of 98 HHs per scheme and 23 HHs per km.

Achievements of Outcome
To assess progress against the project development objective of “Improved market
access” one simple indicator was suggested at appraisal: “Average time taken to walk to
motorable road decreased by one half (from 3 hours to 1.5 hours) for targeted Geogs”.
The PAD suggested to use the Ministry of Agriculture’s 10 percent sample survey of all
households, as published in “Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) statistics for
measuring the outcome indicator of reduced walk time. The published RNR statistics
somehow did not consistently reflect such information. A field survey conducted for the
project completion report in October-November 2014, covering 731 respondents of
targeted Geogs, showed promising results towards the achievements of outcomes.
The survey showed that walking time to the nearest road point is within ½ an hour for
78.2% (572) HHs, between ½ to 1 hour for 14.5% (106) HHs, between 1-3 hours for
4.4 % (32) HHs and between 4-6 hours for merely 2.9% (21) HHs: These results show
that the walking time to motorable road is within 1 hour (against a target of 1.5 hr at
appraisal) for nearly 93% of surveyed Geogs/households.
 While the Project Result
Framework suggests one
indicator (as noted above)
for improved access to
market,       the     impact
assessment survey also
captured access time to
other     facilities.   Fig:3
illustrates the percent of
households         benefitting
various      services     and
facilities within a walking
distance of less than 1 hour.


The data extracted from the Annual Agriculture statistics for various years show an
upward trend for the households having improved access to motorable roads in terms of
walking time. For instance, DRDP PAD referred to agriculture statistics of year 2000,
with 43% of HHs within one hour of walking time to motorable road. Whereas in year
2011, 69% and in year 2013 more than 71% of HHs were living within 1 hour walking
time to motorable road. Further analysis of data reveals that with improved connectively
through farm roads, PPT and bridges, the walking time has reduced to 1.3 hours in year
2013 from 3 hours in year 2000. Such analysis provides sufficient evidence that the
project has successfully achieved its outcome objectives with regards to road
infrastructure. Table:1 below shows proportion of households by walking time against
various time intervals with an average estimated time to reach motorable road.

Project Contribution in overall Irrigation Development: As per the 9th Fifth Year
Plan, over 800 km of existing schemes were to be rehabilitated and over 300 km of new
irrigation channels were to be constructed 6 in all twenty Dzongkhags in Bhutan. By
supporting construction of 42.5 km of new channels and rehabilitation of another 522 km,
DRDP contributed about 14% and an impressive 65% respectively for new and
rehabilitation targets set for the overall irrigation development in 9th FYP.

Key Findings

Quality of Implemented Infrastructure: In view of the remote and inaccessible
locations and limited capacity, ensuring quality of infrastructure was challenging. Not
surprisingly, implementation largely focused on achieving the annual/project targets. For
instance, in case of farm roads, the MoAF provided guidelines/specifications for base
course thickness, appropriateness of gravel-earth mix, required compactions were not
always followed. Consequently, ruts and pot-holes were witnessed by the ICR mission at
places.
In case of irrigation channels, in some cases, the inlet structures were found
missing/washed away due to design flaws or poor Implementation quality. At certain

locations, irrigation pipes were sagging, reflecting use of lower quality pipes. Some of the
contributing factors are as follows:
    • Inadequate monitoring by engineers,
    • Engineers’ limited knowledge and experience (especially during the initial years).
        It improved considerably through the project provided quality training to the
        engineers,
    • Capacity constraints at Dzongkhag level – limited no. of engineers, inadequate
        logistics, excessive workload,
    • Challenging tterrain and remoteness of project sites, and
    • Lower bid/award costs by contractors than the engineering estimates.
Sustainability: Despite the shortcomings, the promising aspect is the sustained
continuity of benefits generated by the DRDP supported infrastructure. An in-place,
constrained, yet satisfactory and institutionalized O&M mechanism explains the
likelihood of infrastructures sustainability. The key characteristics include the following;
     • Water/Road User Associations have been formed, which are active and
        performing routine maintenance. During initial 2-3 years of project
        implementation these associations were formally registered with department but
        later preferred to work informally. For achieving, lasting sustainability of
        infrastructure subprojects, it would be useful to strengthen these associations
        through O&M training and awareness raising. This would help sensitizing them
        towards the importance of timely maintenance and would contribute to fully
        complying with the MoAF guidelines that require registration under Cooperative
        Act, proper composition7, signing of formal MoUs8 with Geog Administration
        and fully compliance of maintenance plan9 as embedded in the guidelines.
     • Beneficiary community is responsible for minor O&M activities (drain cleaning,
        spot filling, small debris removal for form roads and PTT, vegetation clearing,
        blockage removal, intake and outlet structures maintenance for irrigation
        channels, checking pins and joints for bridges, etc.)
     • Dzongkhags are responsible for financing and provision of machinery for major
        O&M in case of floods and land sliding. As per the letter signed between RUAs
        and Geogs, the representative of RUAs would inform the administration in case
        of any major repair required.

    • NU 2.0 m annually is available at each Geog for possible utilizing and prioritizing
      for O&M,
    • Additional Funds are made available to each Geog in case of emergency needs.
Impact: The infrastructure interventions have provided significant economic and social
benefits to the project communities. The road projects (farm roads, PPT and bridges)
yielded huge benefits. Approaching remote villages via newly/rehabilitated farm roads
and interacting with the beneficiary communities, the ICR mission came across some
impressive success stories. For instance, the farmers of Geog Rakshay-Rangthangling,
Tsirang Dzongkhag used to sell oranges at Nu10,000 per acre. With the DRDP built PTT,
the earnings rose to Nu 30,000 per acre. The PTT was upgraded to a farm road and the
income increased to Nu 150,000 per acre. Of the 30 households in the Geogs (2 more
Geogs with 60 HHs are also beneficiaries), 10 households have bought new cars, 3
households purchased mini trucks to start transport business. More than 50% HHs have
renovated (cemented from traditional wood construction) their houses. Furthermore, the
beneficiaries of irrigation channels (Tsirnag, Bajo), are growing a second crop with
significant financial gains. The reported benefit streams generally include the following;
•   Reduced walking time to motor-able roads,
•   Reduced Transportation Cost,
•   Improved access to resources/services (health, education, market, and farm inputs
    etc.),
•   Improved income of farmers, particularly for cash crops/fruit,
•   Increased irrigated area,
•   Improved and reliable availability of irrigation water,
•   Improved crop yields,
•   Second Crop cultivation,
•   Improved access to Power Tillers,
•   Transformation from traditional means to farm mechanization,
•   Reduced travel time between interconnecting communities (Geogs/cheogs) through
    bridge construction, and
•   More social cohesion among communities/cheogs/Geogs,


Component 2: Renewable Natural Resources Centers (RNR)
Component 2 comprised two subcomponents, namely (a) RNR construction and (b) RNR
Capacity Building.
1. RNR Construction
    The subcomponent financed six RNR centers. The project used existing prototype designs.
    Typically a RNR-Centre would comprise an office building housing three MOAF Extension


                                             37
   Agents (EA), one each for agriculture, livestock and forestry, as well as a multipurpose
   meeting hall, residential quarters for the three EAs, and the Geogs Office for the “Gup”
   (Geogs Head) and the Geogs clerk. Sometimes fencing and landscaping, water supply and
   drainage were added on needs basis. RNR Centers attracted additional funds from other
   donors, such as Geogs Community Centers (GCC) which offered telephone, fax or email
   services.
   Key outputs of RNR Construction
   Results-Framework Indicator: “6 new RNR Centers constructed”
   Status: fully achieved

   DRDP achieved the target of constructing 6 RNR centers in the following Geogs
   (Dzongkhags):
   • Drakten (Trongsa): RNR Office, staff quarter, multi-purpose hall, drainage and water
      supply;
   • Gosaling (Tsirang): RNR Office, staff quarter, multi-purpose hall, fencing and
      landscaping;
   • Ngangla (Zhemgang): RNR Office, staff quarter, multi-purpose hall, Gup Office;
   • Phangyul (Wangdue): RNR Office, staff quarter, multi-purpose hall, Gup Office, fencing,
      water supply;
   • Drala (Chukha): RNR Office, additional staff quarter, multi-purpose hall, fencing;
   • Goshi (Dagana): RNR Office, staff quarter, fencing.
2. RNR Capacity Building
   With the aim of increasing production of food and cash crops, the subcomponent focused on:
   (i) capacity building of farmers and extension staff, (ii) dissemination and adoption of
   appropriate technologies, (iii) improved seed varieties, and (iv) use of agricultural
   mechanization where feasible.
   Key outputs of RNR Capacity Building
   a) Rice:
       Results-Framework Indicator: “Adoption of new rice varieties by at least 25% of
       farming HHs”
       Status: partly achieved
       Improved rice variety adoption rate is 65% in terms of household adoption and
       56% in area coverage. However, it is only valid for the Wangdue-Punakha
       valley as support in other Dzongkhags was not as extensive and data are not
       available. Other key outputs include:
        •     As per the Impact Assessment and Project Completion Report, 64.7%
              households reported cumulative increase in crop production for rice, maize
              and potato;
        •     Promotion of 26 tons of high yielding variety of paddy seeds in 6
              Dzongkhags benefited 3,406 farmers in 6 Dzongkhags;
        •     Double cropping of rice introduced. In Thedthso Geog, 48 households made
              substantial gains from double cropping of rice on 22 acres of land;




                                            38
    •    Mechanized farming adopted on 5000 acres of wetland including tray
         nursery technology on 25 acres; Land terracing done for extended research
         within the RNR-RDC sub-centers.

b) Maize:
   Results-Framework Indicator: “80% maize seeds of the Grey Leaf Spot (GLS)
   affected farmers are replaced”


   Status: fully achieved
   Seed replacement target rate of 80% for GLS affected farmers with GLS
   resistant varieties was fulfilled by either direct seed supply through the project or
   indirect supply through the National Seed Centre (NSC). Direct supply to 7
   dzonkhags (4 project-, and 3 non-project Dzongkhags) was as per the table
   below.

   The disease reached epidemic scale in 2007 and affected 4,821 acres in 12
   districts. Of which 75% was in the 7 Dzongkhags, listed above, leading to a
   baseline of affected area of 3,616 acres. With direct seed replacement for 2,899
   acres, DRDP fully achieved the target.
   Furthermore, indirect supply was possible through DRDP-supported 9 CBSPs
   with a total of 85 members. These groups produced 88,000 kg of quality maize
   seeds over a period of 3 years under a contract with NSC. The NSC purchased
   seeds from the groups and supplied it to GLS hit farmers across the affected
   Dzongkhags. Considering a seed rate of 15kg/acre, additional 58,886 acres have
   been covered under this seed replacement drive. Other key outputs included:
    •    582 farmers were trained in various topics such as maize seed selection and
         management of new maize varieties,
    •    Support to on-station research for basic seed production and variety
         maintenance,
    •    Initiation of spring maize program and hybrid maize introduction as part of
         the cropping system intensification initiative,
    •    Publication of brochure on “knowing maize varieties”.

c) Potato:
   Results-Framework Indicator: “100% increased production of potato basic seeds
   from 350 mt to 700 mt”
   Status: fully achieved
   A total of 875 tons of basic seed potatoes were produced and marketed, thus the
   project exceeded the target of increasing seed production from 350 mt to 700 mt
   by 121%;
    •    With the project support, aeroponics facility for potato seed production at
         the National Seed Centre (NSC) is operational since April 2012. Its harvest
         of minitubers was 11,616 in 2012 and 17,345 in 2013;
    •    Three Generation Seed Strategy (3G) for revamping the seed potato
         production system is at an advanced stage. About 8.8 tons of G2 potato seed
         that was harvested in 2014 will be planted in 2015 as 3rd generation on NSC
         fields. The next cycle will be multiplied by contract farmers;
    •    Publication of 500 booklets for aeroponic production of potato mini-tubers;
    •    Publication of training manual on positive selection to improve quality of
         farm saved potato seeds;
    •    Distribution of seed potatoes to 800 households (500 DRDP, 300 RGoB)
         who had not replaced their seeds for a long time. According to some
         estimates the seed replacement rate increased from previous 10 to 18%.
d) Farmers’ Group Formation
   Results-Framework Indicator: “At least 5 functional “growers group” formed
   with necessary skills on marketing and post harvest technologies”
   Status: partly achieved
    •    There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that farmer groups (rice grower groups,
         vegetable groups, etc) formed by the farmers are proactive, but data such as names
         of groups, numbers of membership, or trainings completed, was not regularly
         collected and compiles.
        Results-Framework Indicator: “At least 9 community based seed production
        groups are formed and linked with the national Seed center“
   Status: fully achieved
    •    DRDP facilitated establishment and training of 9 Community Based Seed Producer
         Groups (CBSPs) with a total of 85 members.
e) Training of Farmers:

   Results-Framework Indicator: “Number of farmers benefitted by extension
   services (maize, potato, rice) at least 8500, of which female beneficiaries constitute
   40%”

   Status: partly achieved




                                         40
   Farmers were trained through various means including field days and
   demonstrations, classroom training, study tours. The Impact Assessment and
   Project Completion Report stated that both males and females equally benefitted
   from training.

    • 1 researcher attended a rice breeding course of 4 weeks at International Rice
        Research Institute, IRRI-Philippines;
    • 1 research assistant working on maize attended 3 weeks on-the-job training
        on maize breeding, agronomy and seed production in Thailand;
    • 5 Researchers from the Renewable Natural Resource-Research and
        Development Centres (RNR-RDCs), National Post Harvest Centre (NPHC),
        and Agriculture Machinery Centre (AMC) attended training on maize
        products diversification.


                                          41
   g) Other Achievements
       DRDP successfully achieved additional targets, which will significantly
       contribute for the growth of the agricultural output. Some of those major
       achievements are listed below:
       •   Institutional support to the NSC and its farms (Bondey, Jephu, Paro, Bajo,
           Phubjikha) through construction of irrigation facilities and renovation of
           pumps, fencing the premises, upscaling the Aeroponics Unit, and road
           maintenance;
       •   Strengthening of RNR-RDCs Bajo, Bhur and Wenggkhag through supply of
           rice mills, nursery trays and rice planters as well as power weeders;
       •   Strengthening of agricultural machinery centre by supplying 21 power
           threshers for hiring services;
       •   Banana tissue culture started at RNR-RDC Paro;
       •   E-pest surveillance system installed and ready for use;
       •   110 sets of deep fat frying machines supplied to farmers for chips and
           cornflake making;
       •   30 on farm potato stores and 40 on farm maize stores constructed, and
           around 200 other seed storage containers distributed;
       •   Setting post harvest machineries (rice mill, flour mill and corn flake
           machine) and supplied to 9 CBSP groups;
       •   Supplying seeds and demonstrations on using dhaincha (sesbania aculeata)
           as green manure for rice.

3. Key Findings

   a) Project Development Objective – Indicators
       •   Two of the three PDO indicators state a “15% increase for food and cash
           crop production per targeted Geogs” as a target. The choice of these
           indicators led to substantial problems when it came to impact assessment.
           For instance production in terms of metric tons per Geog is a function of
           area under cultivation and yield per area, and DRDP was not always
           working in all irrigation schemes of targeted Geogs and, therefore, gains in
           some schemes could be offset by losses in other schemes within the same
           Geog. Accordingly production gains or losses per Geog have to be seen in
           the overall context, including factors beyond the project’s control, such as
           land loss or increasing shortage of farm labor.
       •   Considering the above, project achievements may appear lower than they
           actually were. A more appropriate indicator could have been to measure
           increase in productivity (yield increase per acre) per renovated or newly
           built irrigation scheme.




                                         42
b) Lack of Baseline Data
    •   After attempts to establish a project specific baseline through surveys it was
        finally agreed to use 2009 statistical data as baseline. Although this serves
        the purpose to monitor production data on Geogs level, it does not allow to
        measure productivity increases in renovated or newly built irrigation
        schemes.

c) Data Collection & Processing / Monitoring / Record Keeping
    •   In line with the RGoB policy, implementation of DRDP activities was
        decentralized and the responsibility for implementation rested with the
        respective Dzongkhags and eventually the Geogs. There was no separate
        Project Management Unit (PMU) as such, but a Project Director who,
        besides DRDP also had to take care of his usual duties. While this approach
        was useful in integrating DRDP into regular MoAF activities, some key
        functions required dedicated project staff and were not provided for in the
        project. For example, there was no dedicated M&E system in place to
        ensure regular project specific data collection, collation and analysis.
    •   Records (e.g. training sessions for farmer groups, curricula/topics of training
        sessions, etc) were often not available at the central level. However, some of
        them were available at Dzongkhag or Geog level. Crop specific data (rice,
        maize, potato) were mainly collected and stored by the commodity
        coordinators.
d) Alignment of infrastructure development with capacity building
    •    In the first phase (2005-2010), the project focused primarily on
         infrastructure. From 2011 onwards there was greater emphasis on capacity
         building and the provision of quality extension services.
e) According to available data, Geog or farming households benefitting from new or
    renovated irrigation schemes did not necessarily receive training in improved
    agricultural technologies (other than the existing extension services).
f) Farmers’ Training / Producer Group Establishment / Marketing
    •   Farmers’ training could have been more extensive and should have included
        more sessions on group formation and strengthening as well as on
        establishing common input supply and marketing mechanisms and group
        owned machinery services.

                      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A.     Pre Investment Analysis

Pre Investment Economic and Financial Analysis
No overall rates of return were provided in the financial and economic analysis annex of
the February, 2005 PAD. However, calculations were presented as to expected road
access improvements in the six Dzonkhags (districts) covered by the project under
Component 1 (Rural Infrastructure). Road investment was projected to affect 5,611
households, averaging almost 38 percent of target area households. Data was also
provided from secondary sources on previous experience of changes in agricultural
production following road construction, the variance in household incomes between those
with and without road access, and educational enrolment rates with and without road
access. Unfortunately, the PAD provided no analysis or estimates of the impact of
irrigation infrastructure provision (also under Component1).

Under Component 2 (RNR Centres) and Component 3 (Institutional Strengthening)
information was given only on construction targets (6 new RNR Centres) and training (5
course types), respectively.

B.     Post Investment Economic and Financial Analysis: Sub Components

Analytical Methods
Form of the analysis. The analysis of the project is able to be more specific about the
costs and benefits than was the case at appraisal because sub-projects, investments and
activities have been identified and implemented throughout the project period. However,
no baseline survey was conducted, nor was any dedicated monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) system established, for the project. With the exception of cost of production data
for rice and maize, data has therefore been largely obtained from other sources, including
an independent survey of over 1,400 producers and producer groups undertaken as part of
the borrower ICRR. Primary data collected during the ICRR mission was also used.
Component and Sub Component Analysis
Component 1: Rural Infrastructure (USD 7.86 million). This component comprised two
sub-components: (a) Rural Access, and; (b) Irrigation. The main beneficiaries comprised
isolated rural communities with little, if any, road access to the national transport system.
Achieved rural access investments are shown in Table 1 below, but do not include the
five bridges (of a total of six targeted). New farm roads, rehabilitated farm roads, power
tiller tracks and rehabilitated irrigation channels all exceeded original targets, while the
construction of new irrigation channels and bridges was slightly less than targeted.
As no baseline data was collected on productivity or other economic activities for
communities targeted for improved infrastructure, it is not possible to estimate returns to
project investments in these areas. However, enough data does exist for the average cost
per kilometre of construction and per beneficiary to be calculated, and these costs
compared with standard estimates and guidelines.


                                             44
 Table 1: Achievements and Beneficiary Households from Rural Access Investment




Overall, the rural access component incurred total costs of Nu.153.4 billion and
benefitted 10,938 households, or approximately 50,000 persons. This represents almost
27 percent of all households within the 11 target Dzonkhags and equates to a cost of Nu.
14,000 (USD 219) per household, or Nu. 3,066 (USD 48.1 per person), not including the
additional beneficiaries arising from the five bridges which were constructed.
In Table 2, the expenditures for each infrastructure category are presented in per unit
terms. As no differentiation is made in the project expenditure data between rehabilitated
and new farm roads, the costs shown represent an average across the two categories.

              Table 2: DRDP Expenditures on Infrastructure per Unit




Roads
The majority of road investment (138.3 km of a total of 207.6 km) was for the
construction of new roads – the remainder was for rehabilitation. Detailed cost data per
kilometre of road constructed was only available for a number of samples in a single
Dzonkhag (Wangdue). These are shown in Table 3 below. Given the relatively small
number of communities and households served by the roads[1], the cost per kilometre and
beneficiary is high; Nu. 869,000/km and USD 463/person. In the PAD, cost guidelines

  Enterprise Promotion Programme (AMEPP) in the West of Bhutan, noted a beneficiary

                                           45
issued by the MOA are given, which indicate that farm road costs should not exceed USD
425/beneficiary and the PAD itself anticipates project road costs at USD 385/person.
No updated version of the MOA costs could be identified, but adjusting these costs for
US dollar inflation since the guidelines were published suggests that the equivalent cost
in 2009 would be USD 459 – very close to the average of the six roads for which there is
data available, although still higher than the predicted costs in the PAD, adjusted for
inflation (USD 416/person).
             Table 3: Rural Road Costs per Beneficiary, Wangdue District




It should be stressed, however, that significant benefits are subsumed within increased
yields and household incomes for the key project crops as a result of irrigation and road
investments. In particular, the borrower ICRR (project completion report) participant
survey determined that expansion in maize and potato production were closely linked to
improved road access and, therefore, act as a proxy for road benefits in this analysis.
It is worth noting that an amount of Nu.2 million (USD 31,348) is set aside in each
district annual budget for road maintenance and repair, although this may not be
sufficient for all road works required annually within each district.
Power Tiller Tracks
The data in Table 1 and 2 show the number, length and number of beneficiaries from the
power tiller track investments, and an average cost of almost USD 5,500/km. This
represents almost one quarter of the per kilometre cost of farm roads constructed under
the project but it should be noted that the roads served more than twice as many
beneficiaries per kilometre as the tiller tracks.
Irrigation
No assessment of irrigation impacts or benefits was provided in the PAD for this project,
and this analysis assumes that irrigation benefits are subsumed within expanded crop
productivity within the project target area. However, the beneficiary ICR survey
determined that the principal impact of the irrigation investment was to permit the
expansion of wetland paddy production, and respondents indicated that this was more
important for them than road access in the case of rice. The benefits arising from the
investment in irrigation are therefore subsumed within the crop income calculations
presented under Component 2.


                                           46
Irrigation activities included the renovation of 521 km of channels in 58 Geogs,
benefitting 4,594 households and with command area of 4,733 ha, as well as 42.5 km of
new channels built in 11 Geogs benefitting 418 households with a command area of 276
hectares. Achieved renovation work therefore exceeded considerably the ex-ante
estimates in the PAD and AF Project Paper (393 Km.) but were marginally below the
projected new construction (44.3 Km).
The average costs per kilometre of canals and associated works are shown in Table 2 as
USD 5,362 for new construction and USD 3,182 for rehabilitation of existing systems.
Actual investment costs for irrigation works as assumed in the PAD and as incurred at
implementation, are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that actual costs were approximately
12 percent lower than assumed at design for new construction, but almost 33 percent
higher for rehabilitation.
        Table 4: Projected and Incurred Costs for Irrigation Infrastructure Works




According to data drawn from the relevant Five Year Plans, the 11 Dzonkhags included
in DRDP (five of which were included only later at the time of the AF) contained 521
schemes with 1,617 Km of canals. By the close of the project these numbers were 1,220
schemes and 3,060.2 Km of canals. In total, the project thus accounted for approximately
32 percent of the work carried out in these Dzonkhags over this time period[2].
Bridges
A total of 5 bridges were constructed under the project, at an average cost of almost USD
32,500 per bridge. This amount may over-estimate average costs as one bridge was
damaged by heavy flooding after the bridge was completed, rendering it necessary for the
bridge to be rebuilt. However, some additional funding was received by RGOB from
JICA towards this reconstruction cost.

Component 2: RNR Centres and Support for Improved Technologies and Marketing of
Rice, Maize and Potato (US$2.28 million). This component constructed 6 RNR centres
benefiting 2,430 HHs and provided support for capacity building among RNR staff. In
addition, under the revised project structure in December 2010, additional funds were
made available to include direct support for improved crop production technology,
including improved seed, mechanization and cultivation practices. It should be noted,
however, that not all crop based benefits derived from these additional funds, as the


[2]
       This calculation assumes that schemes which were renovated were not counted in the
      original numbers.



                                             47
provision of improved road access was, as noted above, important for the improvement in
maize and potato production, while the training offered through the new RNR centres
also contributed to benefits in this area.
In addition to the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation channels, other crop-related
improvements provided through the project included: (i) hybrid and high yielding
varieties, as well as seed with improved genetic resistance to grey leaf spot and other
diseases; (ii) the establishment of aeroponic production facilities for potatoes; (iii)
upgrading of research and testing facilities on MOAI research stations; (iv) the
development of an e-pest surveillance system; (v) the installation of a number of polynet
houses for both rice seedlings and vegetable production, and; (vi) improvements in
mechanization equipment and distribution.
The borrower’s completion survey identified that from 12-18 percent of potential
households in the 11 project Dzongkhags were beneficiaries of support to rice, maize and
potatoes[3]. The survey also identified output increases for each crop, as well as income
increases for maize only.
Table 3, below, summarizes the agronomic results of the project investments, through a
comparison of harvested area, production and yield within the project area with national
statistics over the period 2009-2013. Although the starting point (2009) is some four
years after the project commenced, there was little direct support to crop productivity
during the initial years of the project. In fact, in the case of potato, a major expansion of
the aeroponic seed production facility has yet to be completed, implying a far greater
impact from improved seed in the future.
While the use of national statistics for comparison with project area results is not wholly
satisfactory, as the project area accounts for from 62 to 90 percent of total national
production of the crops, the identification of a suitable control area gives rise to even
greater problems, due to the need to identify a significant production area not affected by
the project. Given the important role of project area production in national output,
however, the subsequent calculation of returns is based on the changes within the project
area.
It can be seen gains of over 20 percent in total production were achieved for paddy and
maize over the period 2009-2013. As the harvested area of both crops declined
significantly, these increases are due entirely to yield increases – up by almost half for




[3]
       Although mandarin was originally included in the list of target crops, this was later
      dropped and no project activities directly targeted at mandarins were undertaken.




                                               48
both crops. By contrast, potato balanced a small decline in yields with a major increase in
harvested area to generate a 10 percent increase in output.
       Table 5: Changes in Output of Key Crops – Project Area and National




Source: Project Crop Programmes and RNR Annual Surveys

Using the increased production levels from Table 6, together with data generated by the
various project-supported Crop Programmes on producer costs and output prices, it is
possible to calculate the incremental benefits generated since 2009 by investment in
paddy, maize and potato – the principal crops supported by the project. Production
increases in all three crops generate estimated annual net benefits of USD 1.02 million
per annum.
Table 6: Annual Net Benefit from Incremental Project Area Changes in Production




The project only indirectly financed crop productivity activities in the period 2005-2010
through irrigation construction and rehabilitation and some capacity building of RNR
staff, but direct productivity support investments were introduced into the project through
the 2010 Additional Financing, with USD 1.92 million allocated to Component 2
activities at that time. By 2010, the RNR Centres had already been completed; as a result
this additional amount went almost entirely to crop support measures.
Using this data, it is therefore possible to calculate rates of return to these investments
(Table 7). Benefits are assumed to be only partial in early years, deriving from the
irrigation investment, and reach full level only in 2011. To account for these initial
indirect benefits, the costs of the irrigation investment (USD 1.1 million) are also
assigned to this component.




                                              49
The estimated FIRR, of 28.9 percent, is high, but all road infrastructure and management
costs incurred in Components 1 and 3 are excluded, as well as those Component 2
expenditures (principally on the RNR Centres) prior to the additional financing.
        Table 7: Financial Rates of Return to Crop Productivity Investments




These results are robust, even with the inclusion of all irrigation investment costs.
Lowering the rate of crop productivity benefits by 10 percent reduces the FIRR by less
than three percent, to 26 percent. Even with a 20 percent reduction in benefits the FIRR
remains at 23 percent.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (USD 1.32 million). This component included
project management and training of government staff from MOAI at central, Dzongkhag
and Gewog level. Training comprised a series of short courses covering such areas as
financial management, capacity building, environmental and social safeguards and
monitoring & evaluation.
No attempt has been made to assign quantifiable benefits to these activities.

      C.     Post Investment Economic and Financial Analysis: Whole Project

The project had undoubted non-quantifiable benefits that cannot be measured in this case
due to the lack of adequate baseline or M&E data. The most important example is that of
non-crop production benefits arising from the investment in road construction and
rehabilitation, although other significant benefits are expected to arise from improved
access to education, health services and employment. For crops normally grown outside
of irrigation schemes and livestock, road access is critical, reducing input costs and
providing access to markets through lower transport costs as well as the expanded
presence of traders once vehicular access is feasible.

Most transport projects undertaken in Bhutan in the last decade have focused heavily on
larger roads than the farm and community access roads addressed by this project, and
none included power tiller tracks. Nevertheless, a review of World Bank and other IFI
experience in this sector shows the magnitude of benefits which are possible. Table 8
below shows that considerable increases in business activities and remittances, as well as
declines in transport costs can be expected.




                                            50
          Table 8: Results of the World Bank Bhutan Rural Access Project, 2006




       Source: Rural Access ICCR, World Bank, 2006

A 2008 study of an IFAD-funded transport project in Bangladesh calculated an average
39 percent decrease in transport costs, in addition to an estimated a 19 percent increase in
yields, although no mention was made of changes in cropping patterns[4], while an older
World Bank report estimated a 15-20 percent reduction in the cost of marketing
agricultural products in the Philippines[5].
Other unquantified benefits arising from the project include the development of micro-
enterprises for the processing and marketing of maize, vegetables and even livestock
products, which only became financially attractive once improved road access was
available. Increased social capital from the formation of a number of community-based
maize seed production groups may also have generated financial benefits.
In fact, according to data collected by the beneficiary survey conducted as part of the
borrower ICRR, the largest impact on the production of marketable surpluses was not in
the three primary crops targeted, but in vegetables (35 percent of households), dairy (15
percent) and citrus (14 percent). No data is available, however, on the quantities or net
incomes arising from these activities.

Financial Analysis
According to the borrower ICRR, the project provided direct benefits to 28,850
households and indirect benefits to a further 42,994 households. However, improved
crop productivity under Component 2 comprises the only element of the project for
which returns can be directly calculated, as there is insufficient M&E data or baseline
information to permit the assessment of quantitative benefits to infrastructure activities.
As the crop-based benefits relate to only approximately 30 percent of total investment
costs, they are not in themselves sufficiently large to provide positive returns to the entire

series of alternate assumptions concerning benefits arising from the provision of
improved access. These benefits have been identified in the borrower ICRR as resulting
from the increased production and sale of vegetables, dairy and citrus products, as well as
expanded commercial activity in non-agricultural areas.
The studies cited above suggest that reductions in transport costs alone are a significant
benefit, ranging from 15 to 40 percent. As a result, the impact of increases of 10, 15 and
20 percent in average household incomes among beneficiary households have been
calculated using average household expenditure data for project Dzongkhags as given in
the 2012 Bhutan Living Standards Survey as a proxy for income, and the result used in
calculating returns to the project.
These calculations are shown in Appendix 1 to this annex and summarized in Table 9
below. Under the assumption of phased benefit accrual as civil works are completed,
starting in the third year of implementation, an increase of only 10 percent in direct
beneficiary household incomes, the financial rate of return to the whole project switches
from negative to over 15 percent. This rises to an FIRR of over 20 percent for a 15
percent increase in household incomes and almost 25 percent for a 20 percent increase in
household incomes.
Table 9: Total Project Financial Returns under Different Assumptions as to Benefits
                           of Rural Access Infrastructure




Thus a very conservative estimate of an increase of only 10 percent in household incomes
among beneficiary households served by rural access infrastructure under the project
would render the project financially attractive.

Economic Analysis
The economic analysis attempts to modify market prices for costs and outputs to reflect
the real net benefit to the economy of the project. Two factors normally considered for
adjustment under economic analysis are labour and foreign exchange costs. Labour costs
are particularly important to this analysis as such a major portion of crop production costs
in Bhutan are for labour.
The Bhutan Investment Climate Assessment Report of the World Bank, published in
2010, states that average labour costs in Bhutan are 45 percent higher than in India, a
country to which Bhutan is very closely linked through trade, a tied exchange rate, and
substantial inbound investment to Bhutan. Nevertheless, the report also points out that
labour productivity is much higher in Bhutan than in other regional countries and, as a
result, per unit costs are lower than the regional average. The study concludes that labour
costs are, in fact, competitive. As a result, no adjustment has been made in labour costs
for the economic analysis.


                                            52
Nominal exchange rates (those at market prices) frequently do not adequately reflect the
real cost of imported items or the value of exported ones, due to distortions arising from
currency controls, speculation, trade imbalances or a number of other factors. In the IMF
Article IV Consultation Report, published in 2014, the authors specifically examine the
Ngultrum to determine if the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is significantly
different from the nominal one. They conclude that the Bhutanese currency is overvalued
in the range of 8.5-21 percent and propose an average valuation of 16 percent. This
means that all imported items used in production have a real value to the Bhutanese
economy of less than the nominal exchange rate suggests.
In the EIRR and ENPV, therefore, the cost of imported items used in the production of
the three target crops has been reduced. However, almost all production costs for rice,
maize and potatoes are labour-based, with only fertilizers and perhaps other
agrochemicals being imported[6]. No more than five percent of total production costs –
according to the data provided by the project crop coordinators – is accounted for by such
costs, reducing the impact of the adjustment to little more than one percent of total costs.
The results of these adjustments are shown in Table 10 in relation to the financial returns
calculated in the Appendix.
            Table 10: Economic NPV and IRR Estimate – Initial Disbursement




As can be seen, as a result of the very small reduction in costs the calculated EIRRs
increase only marginally, from 15.3 percent (financial) to 15.5 percent (economic) under
the assumption of a 10 percent increase in household incomes for direct beneficiaries of
project rural access investment.

Conclusions
Due to lack of data, a key set of assumptions has been applied in the above analysis,
relating to both crops not targeted by the project and to increases in non-crop activities
and earnings. The benefits from increased crop productivity are sufficient to cover all
costs associated with this activity as well as all investment made by the project in
irrigation infrastructure. Even when estimated crop benefits are reduced by 20 percent,
the FIRR to this activity is still 23 percent.



[6]
       In fact, even the fertilizer may well have been manufactured in Bhutan, but the
      feedstock for the plant will be imported.



                                               53
Using comparative data from other projects, both in Bhutan and elsewhere in Asia, the
analysis has shown that only minor (10 percent) increases in the household incomes of
those directly benefitting from access to new and rehabilitated rural roads and power
tiller tracks are sufficient to generate acceptable financial and economic rates of return. If
household benefits are higher than the minimum 10 percent assumed, the project is
strongly positive.
On the basis of this analysis, therefore, and even in the absence of considerable key
performance data, the project it is considered likely to have been highly satisfactory in
both financial and economic terms if the above assumptions of moderate increases in
beneficiary household incomes is accepted. It is worth noting that over 35 percent of
respondents interviewed in the beneficiary survey noted that they had increased vegetable
production as a result of road access, while 72 percent stated that market access had
improved, rendering these assumptions credible.
Given that previous studies cited in this annex have shown much higher impacts than this,
and the robustness of the quantified benefits arising from increased crop productivity, it is
believed that the project will have generated a strongly favourable impact on beneficiary
household incomes and welfare.

                        Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Background

The primary objective of impact assessment and preparation of project completion report
was “to ascertain and record major achievements of the project, success stories and
critically reflecting on the implementation performance of all project partners, and
assess the extent to which the project succeeded in reaching its stated objectives and
goals.”

Approach and Methodology

Field Research was conducted to collect both qualitative as well quantitative data from
six sampled Dzongkhags and 22 Geogs. Consultations were carried out with the
collaborating and implementing partners (RNR-RDCs, National Plant Protection Centre,
NSC, Dzongkhag and Geog Agriculture officers, and Dzongkhag Engineers) and farmers.

Survey Design

Within these Dzongkhags, Geogs were further sampled using sampling criteria as
follows:
       • Geogs where majority of the activities were implemented
       • Geogs (villages) with and without road access
       • Selecting a minimum of 40% of the Geogs within each selected Dzongkhag.


From DRDP coverage of 78 Geogs in eleven Dzongkhags, 22 Geogs from six
Dzongkhags (28.2%) was visited for the field work. The number of targeted beneficiaries
for discussion and interview were based on the number of activities in each Geog. In total,
731 farmers (56.2% males: 43.8% females) were interviewed and additionally 682
numbers of same farmers (55.1% males: 44.9% females) were also consulted through
focus group discussion.

Limitations of the Study

Though 2009 was identified as baseline, a system to record production and yield data for
beneficiaries’ households during project period did not exist. The Geogs and Dzongkhags
collect Geog’s production and yield data annually which is reflected in agricultural
statistics that is based on sample survey and represents the entire Geog. Therefore,
measuring the changes brought about by the project for beneficiaries households (HHs)
alone using secondary data was not possible. However, direct impact on beneficiaries’
households is supplemented by farmers own reflection on the yield and production as
collected during field survey.

Overall Assessment
(i) In comparison with targets in PDO, the project has made good achievements in
successfully implementing activities as planned: 101% for new farm roads construction;
102% for farm road improvement; 100% for power tiller track construction; 100% for
construction of new irrigation channels; 99.48% for rehabilitation of irrigation channels;
100% for construction of RNR/Geog centers; 83% for construction of bridges and 276%
for farmers’ trainings/ demonstrations and trails.
(ii) Analysis on productivity and production revealed that on an average the productivity
(yield) of paddy increased by 36.4% in 2012 as compared to 2006; and production by
6.4%. For potato there was 31% increase in production in the year 2013 as compared to
2006. For maize there was 11.5% increase in production in the year 2013 as compared to
2000; and 31% increase in yield.
(iii) Some of other key outcomes are: 19% higher yield than local variety for Bajo Maap
2 and Khangma Maap (paddy); 49% higher yield than local variety for IR-64 (paddy);
17345 minitubers of potato harvested in 2013 from aeroponics; increase from earlier 5
tons production to 60 tons potato seeds from Phobjikha NSC in 2012; 7 tons of G2 potato
seed of Desiree variety harvested in 2014; 875 tons seed potatoes produced and
marketed; 9 community maize seed production group formed that produced 27MT of
seeds in 2012 with 37% increased income as compared to 2011; 15% seed replacement
(in 2011), 45% replacement (in 2012) and another 15% replacement (in 2013) done for
maize (for Grey Leaf Spot: GLS disease affected areas).
(iv) Impacts based on livelihood domains were diverse and many. With regards to
physical assets, availability of farm roads and increased income from agricultural
products have helped farmers to purchase many assets. Out of 1148 multiple responses
from respondents, followings were reported with respective percentage: purchased TV/
refrigerators (28%); constructed new house (13.2%); constructed new toilets (7.9%);
undertook CGI roofing (7.2%); purchased agricultural tools and machineries (6.5%);
purchased improved cattle (6.3%); and purchased vehicle/power tillers (3.4%).
The comparison of the rural infrastructures (mainly roads and irrigation schemes) at the
start of the project and closure shows the followings: irrigation schemes (521 in 2007 vs
1220 in 2013); length of irrigation channels (1616.93 km vs 3060.205 km now); and
length of farm roads (473.02 km vs 2392.87 km now).As compared to food last in HHs in
past six years, presently food lasts for 1–3 months has increased for 10.3% HHs. While
food lasts for 4–6 months and 7–11 months decreased for 55.2% and 30.6% HHs
respectively, the sufficiency for 12 months increased for 123.8% HHs10.
(v) The project interventions towards environment and common resource base were
related mainly with farm roads constructions. With earlier knowledge and experiences on
bio-engineering, environmental assessment and mitigation measures, environmental
friendly survey and design were incorporated as well during implementation.

(vi) Farmers mentioned having acquired better knowledge and skills for: pest
management; planting potato on ridges for higher yield; cultivate improved variety of
paddy and maize (draught tolerant and disease resistant respectively); proper harvest and
seed selection for maize; and up-land rice cultivation techniques. Extension agents now
have added proper knowledge on paddy production and farmers group formation.
Similarly, a few engineers now have proper knowledge on irrigation survey, design,
construction technology and water management that guided implementation in proper
ways. Significant contribution has been the capacity building on aeroponics with which
now the unit is functional for potato seed production, to be continued by NSC. Some
officials also have added knowledge in the field of post harvest, value addition, and e-
pest surveillance.
(vii) The survey revealed: increased paddy production (for 18.5% of total respondents);
increased maize production (18.1%); increased cash income (12.7%); eased marketing
(12.6%); reduced walking distance (12.5%); increased potato production (12.2%); and
smaller percentages for other such as availability of transportation vehicles, saving labor
for agriculture, and service facilities being available at closer distances.

(viii)The marketing situations for agricultural products have improved over past six
years for 71.9% of respondents, have remained the same as before for 27.8%, and has
become more difficult for 0.3% of them (only from Zhemgang Dzonkhag where markets
and consumers are not available along national highways despite having farm road
connectivity).

(ix) In terms of walking distance to nearest road point, it is within ½ an hour for 78.2%
572 HHs; between ½ to 1 hour for 14.5% (106) HHs; between 1-3 hours for 4.4% (32)
HHs and between 4-6 hours for 2.9% (21) HHs. This is a substantial improvement in
access to markets, as in 2007 the nearest road was within 1 hour walking distance for
45.7% HHs, which improved to 50.6% in 2011 and now to 78.2% HHs having nearest
road within ½ an hour of walking distance. This shows 191% increase over May 2008
MTR results on HHs having reach to road within ½ an hour of walking distance.
(x) The main source of income for rural population was agriculture for 57.7% of
respondents. These were from marketing of orange, vegetables, rice, ginger, potato, chilli,
and maize. Livestock products remained another source of income for 17%, followed by
wage income (14.5%), remittances (7.4%), business (3.2%), and forest resources (0.2%).
As compared to HHs income in the past six years (pre and post situation), the annual
income per HHs is above Nu. 30,000 for 43.5% HHs, which is an increase of 354.3% as
compared to HHs with this level of income in past six years. Presently, remaining 24.4%
HHs have income between Nu. 5001–Nu. 15000 per year; 16.4% have between Nu.
15001–Nu. 30,000 per year; and 15.7% still have less than Nu.5000 per year.
(xi) With regards to sustainability, the activities initiated and implemented by DRDP are
picked up and programs are further incorporated into the government’s 11th FYP, the
post project period (2013 – 2018). However, adequate resources for these and other
unplanned activities could still be an issue for sustenance.
(xii) There were some innovations of the project. The use of pipes for irrigation was new
that not only minimized losses through infiltration but also provided experiences to the


                                            59
engineers. The aeroponics facility for seed production is the first of its kind in the country
and also probably first in the South Asian region especially in terms of its usage in potato
seed production. The e-pest surveillance system is ready for use. The positive selection
process to raise awareness on the quality seed, i.e to produce quality seed and to impart
knowledge on the safe storage of seed for the next season was an innovation of the
project. Another innovation was in providing irrigation facilities for vegetables
cultivation with pipes for people from Orong Geog where farmers suffered without
proper irrigation facilities.

Project Development Objective and Components: The objective of the project was to
“improve market access and increase agricultural output for rural communities in selected
areas of Bhutan to contribute to RNR strategy of 9th FYP”.

Project Components: The project activities were distributed amongst three components:
(a) Rural Infrastructures (improvement of farm roads and irrigation canals); (b)
Renewable Natural Resources Centers and Support for Improved Technologies and
Marketing of Rice, Maize and Potato; and (c) Institutional Strengthening, Project
Management and Monitoring.

Main Beneficiaries: At project appraisal 62 Geogs were targeted and by closure, the
project impacted (direct 11 ) beneficiaries were from 78 Geogs with 28,860 households
(population of 189563) which is 40.76% households from a total of eleven Dzongkhags.
At project completion, the total HHs (for 11 Dzongkhags) were 71804 HHs (32520 HHs
for six Dzongkhags and 39284 HHs for additional 5 Dzongkhags) with a total population
of 415583 numbers 12. The women beneficiaries are 202445 numbers out of which 91643
numbers are direct beneficiaries (45.25% of total female population) and remaining
110802 numbers (54.73% of total) are indirect beneficiaries.

Apart from farmers, government officials were also the beneficiaries (through capacity
building). The implementation partners’ (government units and centers) such as NSC,
National Plant Protection Centre (NPPC), National Post Harvest Centre (NHPC), and
Renewable Natural Resources Research and Development Centers (RNR-RDCs)’s
existing technologies and facilities were strengthened by DRDP-AF.

Monitoring and Evaluation: A social and environmental screening criterion was used
during planning period and before implementation of the activities in case of rural
infrastructures (for farm roads, PTT and irrigation channels). The responsibility for
regular monitoring during the process of implementation remained with Geog officials
(agriculture and the Gup). Dzongkhag Engineers and Agriculture officers were also
involved in the monitoring. However, the heavy work load for Dzongkhag engineers and
merger of irrigation section with Dzongkhag engineering section diluted focus on
irrigation and farm roads and full time monitoring by the engineers were not in place.
Though project trained a few engineers on survey and design of irrigation, inadequate
technical expertise with engineers on irrigation and farm roads and also on the
environmental engineering parameters were mentioned by most of the Dzongkhag
engineers. The execution and supervision was mostly based on the in-house experiences
gained by the engineers in similar structures. The officials from PCU and collaborating
partners (RNR-RDCs, NPPC and NSC) were also involved in monitoring activities
specific to them.

Key Factors Effecting Implementation and Outcomes:

(i) Initially being not oriented to WB procurement guidelines, it took much time for PCU
and Dzongkhag officials to get acquainted with it. Being a strict process for selection of
contractors, many got disqualified on a few occasions and required re-tendering at times.
On the aspects of free labor contribution by the beneficiaries for renovation, rural
households facing shortage of productive manpower with rural-urban migration faced
difficulty in providing timely labor.

(ii) All DRDP Farm Roads and PTTs were screened and environmental clearances were
issued by the District Environmental Office. A factor contributing to improved
environmental knowledge of engineers and construction of environmental friendly roads
was the technical support provided by Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV-
Bhutan) in the initial years of DRDP. With SNV support to Dzongkhang in preparation of
site specific environmental management plans (EMPs), the district capacity to prepare
these plans improved. All DRDP farm roads since then had EMPs prepared. These EMPs
were presented in simple tabular form and in general, identified potential issues and risks.

(iii) In general the co-management involving PCU, Dzongkhags, Geogs and relevant
partner organisations was another key issue that lead to smooth implementation.
Flexibility on utilising savings from an activity provided opportunity to invest in the
same or other required but associated activities that was not funded by the government.

Project Costs and Financing: The consolidated (reconciliation) for the period 2005 to
June 2013 shows that a total of US$ 11.01 million was received against expenditure of
US$ 10.71 million. The total fund received for loan and grant by the year are presented in

Overall Assessment

Project Achievements and Outputs:

The project’s achievements were the following: renovated irrigation channel (58 Geogs);
new irrigation (11 Geogs); new farm roads (16 Geogs); farm road improvement (12
Geogs); Power tiller tracks (11 Geogs); RNR centres (6 Geogs); Maize activities (9
Geogs); Paddy activities (7 Geogs) and Potato activities (9 Geogs). The seeds promotion
and distribution as supported through RNR-RDC and Potato Program is across all Geogs
of the Dzongkhags, wherein if accounted for coverage, would be all Geogs (135 numbers
from 11 Dzongkhags).

The project has made good achievements in successfully implementing activities as
planned till December 2014. The consolidated physical progress for the period 2005–
2014 reflects the following achievements: 101% for new farm roads; 102% for farm road
improvement; 100% for power tiller track construction; 100% for construction of new
irrigation channels; 99.48% for renovated irrigation channels; 100% for construction of
RNR/Geog centres; 83% for construction of bridges and 276% for farmers’ trainings/
demonstrations and trails .These % achievements (for road, irrigation and PTT) are
however compared to the revised targets as reflected in progress reports and not as per
PAD or DRDP-AF targets, which if measured would be as follows:
     • 138.27 Kms of new farm road constructed against the DRDP-AF target of 95.5
         Kms (145% achieved) benefitting 2520 households.
     • 69.35 Kms of farm roads improved against the DRDP-AF target of 15 Kms
         (462% achieved) benefitting 1575 households.
     • 128.99 Kms of power tiller tracks constructed against DRDP PAD target of 114
         Kms (113% achieved) benefitting 1831 households.
     • 42.50 Kms of new irrigation channel constructed against the DRDP-AF target of
         44.3 Kms (96% achieved) benefitting 418 households with a command area of
         687acres.
     • 521.24 Kms of irrigation channels renovated against the DRDP-AF target of 393
         Kms (133% achieved) benefitting 4594 households with command area of
         11784.56 acres.
     • 6 RNR centres constructed against the same target of DRDP PAD benefiting 2430
         HHs.
     • 5 bridges constructed against the DRDP PAD target of 6 (83% achieved).
     • 3311 numbers of farmers trained against the DRDP PAD target of 1200 (276%
         achieved)

Apart from rural infrastructures, as capacity building and extension activities related to
paddy, maize and potato were also the focus of the project during DRDP-AF, summary of
the outputs reported by various commodity coordinators (rice, potato and maize) are as
follows:



                                           64
   •   promoted 26 tons of high yielding variety of paddy seeds in 6 Dzongkhags,
   •   spring rice cultivation undertaken (for 22 acres) with double cropping benefitting
       48 HHs (Thedtsho Geog),
   •   land terracing done for extended research within the RNR-RDC sub-centres,
   •   contributed to 5054 acres of wetland being brought under mechanisation till
       August 2013 owing to farm mechanisation demonstrations, recording 1553 acres
       of rice paddies under mechanisation from Punakha and Wandue Dzongkhags
       alone (a eight times more than previous year),
   •   advancement done in research of rice germplasm,
   •   double cropping of rice initiated at Lamoyzinkha (Dagana Dzongkhag) on 6 acres
       land,
   •   poly houses in Baap Geog (Punakha) also used for vegetables nursery apart from
       paddy alone,
   •   tray nursery training undertaken leading to 25 acres land under paddy
       mechanisation,
   •   publication undertaken for “knowing maize varieties,”
   •   aeroponics facility for potato seed production operational since April 2012,
   •   60 acres land brought under potato seed production in Phobjikha, NSC,
   •   3G seed strategy for revamping the seed potato production system is in its
       advanced stage,
   •   17345 minitubers for Potato harvested unit in 2013 from aeroponics,
   •   7 tons of G2 potato seed of Desiree variety harvested in 2014,
   •   875 tons seed potatoes produced and marketed,
   •   increased from earlier 5 tons production to 60 tons potato seeds from Phobjikha
       NSC in 2012,
   •   published booklet for aeroponic production of potato mini-tubers and 500 copies
       made,
   •   published manual on positive selection to improve quality of farm saved potato
       seeds and 1000 copies made,
   •   published poster on 3G strategy and 16 copies made,
   •   9 community maize seed production group are functional having total of 85
       members,
   •   1250 kgs of hybrid maize seeds imported and planted in 100 acres,
   •   spring maize introduced (249 acres cultivated covering 324 HHs),
   •   Grey Leaf Spot - GLS tolerant foundation maize seeds were produced (3.2 MT),
   •   report on maize products diversification is ready for up-scaling,
   •   Banana tissue culture instituted,
   •   E-pest surveillance system installed and ready for use.

Furthermore, other significant achievements are development of national irrigation data
base along with maps at Geogs and Dzongkhag levels as until recent the data on
irrigation was old and incomplete as well unreliable; and the NSC facilities for seed
production were enhanced with support for water reservoir, micro irrigation, installation
of 2 units of seed processing units, construction of GI chain link fence and also supply of
four power tillers.




                                            65
Relevancy: The relevancy of the activities from beneficiaries’ (farmers) perception
reflects that most relevant were: farm roads (for 28.8 % of total 731 respondents);
renovated irrigation channels (24.7%); power tiller tracks (12%); seed distribution
(10.3%); Trainings / demonstration (5.5%); new irrigation channels (5.1%); Geog / RNR
centres (4.8%); bridges (3.5%); and smaller percentages for other such as nursery houses,
post harvest machineries / equipments, trainings and support for group formation (mainly
road user and water user groups).

Linking relevancy to value addition for the households (HHs) and for improved access to
markets, the survey revealed: increased paddy production (for 18.5% of total
respondents); increased maize production (18.1%); increased cash income (12.7%); eased
marketing (12.6%); reduced walking distance (12.5%); increased potato production
(12.2%); and smaller percentages reported for others such as availability of transportation
vehicles, saving labour for agriculture, and service facilities being available at closer
distances. All of these show that activities were much relevant to the needs and situations
of the communities.

DRDP activities were in line with the government policy to enhance self sufficiency in
food crops that was challenged with remoteness of the villages without road connectivity
and irrigations facilities. The construction of power tiller tracks opened space for
widening some of them to farm roads. Having road connectivity and irrigation facilities
presently enabled Dzongkhags to undertake agreement with the present government on
increasing production for self sufficiency. Apart from that, the focus remained on
activities that lagged without fund such as promotion and spread of improved seeds,
acquiring more knowledge and exposure to technologies for implementers, overcoming
the challenge faced with maize (devastating GLS disease) with seed replacement program,
and timely support for potato seed production using aeroponic facility, which were thus
much relevant.

Efficiency: The survey illustrated that the quality of infrastructures were good (for
64.8% respondents), very good (for 21.3%), and not so good (only 2.3%), while
remaining 11.5% remained non-beneficiaries of rural infrastructures. Similarly the
quality of improved seeds promoted and distributed (maize, potato and paddy) were
found good (by 46.8% respondents), very good (for 11.1%), not good (for 0.5%), and
remaining 41.5% remained to be non-recipients of seeds.

The quality of demonstrations/trainings in terms of delivery and methods, and
understanding by the farmers showed that majority did not avail any trainings supported
by DRDP (55.7% respondents) as usual agricultural trainings to farmers is a regular
mandate of the Geogs extension supported by RGoB fund. Out of remaining 44.3%
respondents that attended trainings, it was very good (for 23.7%) and good (for 20.7%),
confirming that the quality and efficiency of demonstrations and trainings to farmers

Effectiveness: As analyzed in earlier sections, the activities have led to achievements of
targets. In terms of achieving the goals and objectives as project outcomes, the overall
increase in production and yield of paddy for 37 Geogs supported for irrigation were



                                            66
assessed using available agricultural statistics. The analysis shows sharp drop in
harvested area owing to factors outside the control of the project (i.e, rural-urban
migration, shortage of agricultural manpower in rural households, land being left fallow,
and migration of people from villages for better income opportunities).Paddy
productivity (yield) has increased to average of 1076/acre/kg in 2012 as compared 984 in
the year 2010; but had overall decrease in production owing to decreased harvested area.

A separate analysis on potato for targeted Geogs showed an average increased
productivity from 4947 /acre/kg in the year 2010 to 5374 in the year 2012; and increased
production from 9333360 kgs (2010) to 11352540 (2012). A similar analysis for maize
showed increased productivity from 1025 to 1034; and increased production from
4256530 kgs to 4461293 kgs.

Looking at Dzongkhag data for paddy, it showed that for DRDP first phase 6
Dzongkhags, there have been increase in production from 20289 MT to 23719 MT; and
increased yield from initial 823 to 1440 in the year 2012 as compared to 2006. For all
eleven Dzongkhags, there was increase in production (from initial 49623 MT to 56310
MT) and increase in yield (from initial 1159 to 1446) in the year 2012 as compared to
2010. Note: Compiled data for Dzongkhags for paddy for the year 2013 is not available
yet.

Similarly Dzongkhag’s data for potato showed increased yield (from initial 3643 to
19864); and increased production (from initial 211.52MT to 20619 MT) in the year 2013
as compared to 2006 for first 6 Dzongkhags. For all eleven Dzongkhags, there has been
increased production (from initial 24870 to 32576) despite decrease in yield in the year
2013 as compared to 2010.

Dzongkhag data for maize showed that there have been increased yield (from initial 848
to 1111) and increased production (from initial 20199 MT to 22514 MT) in the year 2013
as compared to 2006 for first phase 6 Dzongkhags. Similarly, there was increased
production (from initial 43233 MT to 54315MT) and increased yield (from initial 932 to
1177) in 2013 over 2010 for all Dzongkhags.

In terms of vegetables (reported having intensified after having road), Dzongkhag data
revealed increase in production and harvested area for major vegetables like beans,
cabbage, cauliflower and carrot.

In case of mandarin (the main cash crop apart from potato), despite decrease in numbers
of bearing trees and in production, there was increase in yield (from initial 38 to 42) in
the year 2012 over 2006 for first 6 Dzongkhags. In the year 2012 compared over 2010,
there was decrease in numbers of bearing trees; decrease in production and increase in
yield (from initial 33 to 44) for all Dzongkhags.

During field survey, in areas where irrigation channel were constructed or renovated,
farmers have reported increased paddy production owing to availability of water during
season and for the period required. The food lasts from own cultivated paddy was also



                                           67
reported to have increased. The case studies collected during field survey shows
substantial outcomes out of irrigation.

Impacts:

Impacts based on livelihood domains were diverse and many. Collected through FDGs
and interview with beneficiaries and Dzongkhags and Geogs officials, with regards to
physical assets, availability of farm roads and increased income from agricultural
products have helped farmers to purchase household assets such as television, rice
cookers, and refrigerators and to bring in good furniture for few. Sergithang farmers
(Tsirang) reported that after road and electricity, now 60% households have television.
Many reported to have purchased vehicles (cars, pick-ups and trucks) including power
tiller after having road and PTT. For example people from Barshong Geog (Tsirang)
reported that about 80% of the households have either repaired their houses or made a
new one after they could transport needed materials at cheaper costs after having farm
road.

Likewise, apart from supply of post harvest machineries on subsidy from the project or
the government, few in every Geogs visited reported to have purchased on their own after
having road and also irrigation. Better shed for cattle, purchase of improved cattle and
establishment of livestock farms (poultry) were also reported in few occasions.
Rangthangling Geog farmers (Tsirang) mentioned that after road, every household now
have a trained driver, even if not owning a vehicle yet but soon would have capacity to
purchase vehicles with income from cardamom. Rukha village farmers (Athang:
Wangdue) despite having suspension bridge at entry point to power tiller track from
national highway (Tsirang – Wangdue), three people have power tillers that is used on
hire, not only for ploughing but also for transporting (bringing in essential items to
villages and marketing their traditional dried fishes).

The comparison of the rural infrastructures (mainly roads and irrigation schemes) at the
start of the project and closure shows the followings: irrigation schemes (521 nos in 2007
vs 1220 nos in 2013); length of irrigation channels (1616.93 Kms vs 3060.205 Kms
now); and length of farm roads (473.02 Kms vs 2392.87 Kms now).

With regards to food security, increases in paddy production were reported by farmers
wherever irrigation was supported. With roads and ease in marketing, intensification of
vegetables and with varieties including potato was reported that contributed towards
improvement in nutrition at households. For majority of the households rice is the staple
food while maize is also consumed by some. As few examples, Bongo (Chukha) farmers
mentioned that after renovation of irrigation channel, they have rice sufficiency for at
least 6-7 months for all HHs. Dremtse (Mongar) farmers mentioned that even if they
consume maize alone, they will not only have sufficiency for 12 months but will also
have some marketable surplus.

Impacts on institution creation and strengthening were more evident in areas where
RNR centres and farm roads were constructed. With RNR centres, people now have



                                           68
extension facilities at nearer distances. With road, extension service providers reach their
village unlike in past requiring them to walk long distance and gather at one point.

There has been increased workload for rural women after having irrigation and roads
(except in very few places) as in many places earlier fallow land were cultivated for
paddy and vegetables production were intensified, as reported by women respondents.
The increase in workload is equally for their male partners too. As gender concerns,
lives however have improved for women with comfortable households assets (rice cooker
saving time for cooking; time saved from fetching firewood, contributing to better health
without smoke in kitchens, and lighting facility with electricity). Decision making is
mostly joint between male and female, and most of the trainings or meetings were usually
participated by women.

The access to credits has also improved after having road with mobile banking facilities
and banks being opened up in several Geogs now. About 21% of the respondents
reported having availed loans by their HHs mainly for the following purposes: purchase
of seedlings (cardamom and orange); purchase of improved cattle; house construction;
purchase power tillers, power chain, post harvest machineries; establishment of
agricultural farms (mainly livestock related); and even for commercial business
enterprises.

With regards to financial resources and income, the main source of income for rural
HHs was agriculture for 57.7% of respondents. These as mentioned were from marketing
of orange, vegetables, rice, ginger, potato, chilli, and maize. Livestock products remained
another source of income for 17%, followed by wage income (14.5%), remittances
(7.4%), business (3.2%), and forest resources (0.2%).

As compared to HHs income past six years (pre and post situation), the annual income
per HHs is above Nu. 30,000 for 43.5% HHs, which is an increase by 354.3%
(manifolds) as compared to HHs with this level of income in past six years. Presently,
remaining 24.4% HHs have income between Nu. 5001–Nu.15000 per year; 16.4% have
between Nu. 15001–Nu.30,000 per year; and 15.7% still have less than Nu.5000 per year.

Sustainability: For continuity and sustainability of programme initiated and
implemented by DRDP, resources both in terms of human and fund have to be made
available for all activities (under three components supported by DRDP) by the
government to maintain and upscale the momentum gained thus far. To this effect, the
activities thus initiated and implemented by DRDP are actually picked up and programs
are further incorporated into the government’s 11th FYP, the post project period (2013–
2018).

Innovations: There were some innovations of the project. The use of pipes for irrigation
was new that not only minimized losses through infiltration but also provided experiences
to the engineers. Engineers now have added knowledge on irrigation survey, design and
water management, through which lift irrigation and water harvesting techniques were
added as initiatives of the project.



                                            69
   •   DRDP enabled the National Potato Program (NPP) and the National Seed Centre
       (NSC) to produce potato seed tubers using aeroponic facility at the NSC complex
       at Paro since April 2012. It is the first of its kind in the country and also probably
       first in the South Asian region especially in terms of its usage in seed potato
       production.
   •   Other innovation was promotion and spread of biotic and abiotic stress tolerant
       crop varieties (drought tolerant rice varieties and disease resistant maize varieties).
       The positive selection process to raise awareness on the quality seed: to produce
       quality seed and to impart knowledge on the safe storage of seed for the next
       season was an innovation of the project..
   •   Another significant innovation is providing irrigation to farmers from Orong
       Geog (Samdrupjongkhar) for vegetables cultivation. Lack of adequate irrigation
       water was a limiting factor for agriculture farming in the Geog and local school
       children suffered from malnutrition owing to lack of adequate nutritious
       vegetables in the school’s mess menu. While formation of vegetable group was
       supported by the government to make link for vegetables supply to the school, the
       project funded irrigation scheme (long piped irrigation water supply scheme).
       With a flow of 5.3 litres per second the scheme has now alleviated the problem of
       water shortage for vegetable production in the area.
   •   The e-pest surveillance system is another innovation of the project that is
       designed to capture information of all pest organisms (insect pests, disease
       organisms, weeds) that causes or has potential to cause damage and loss to crops
       of importance (economically and food security) over time and space .
Performance of Partners: On the whole the implementation support and guidance
provided by the Bank to the project team was good and satisfactory. However, at the
early stage of project implementation and following the transfer of the original Task
Team Leader (TTL) there was a complete break in communication between the Bank and
project team. In absence of a replacement and without an interim TTL the project team
could not communicate with Bank on any issues. Added to it, the inexperience of the
project team in planning and project management collectively contributed to delayed
implementation of project activities on the ground.

The Engineering Division under Department of Agriculture (DoA), Ministry of
Agriculture and Forests (MoAF) was the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). Instead of a
separate management unit, the project implementation was instituted within the existing
institutional set up of MoAF. However, without a separate project management unit with
adequate personals, the PCU suffered a lot, as evident from inadequate documentation of
the progress and also inadequate monitoring.

With regards to procurement procedures, for each contract to be financed by the Credit,
the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
prequalification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame needed to be
agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project team in the Procurement Plan were
some criteria. In the beginning, the project team was not conversant with the Bank’s


                                            70
procurement guidelines and system and a lot of difficulties were faced then. Though an
assessment of the procurement capacity of implementing agencies were done in the
beginning of the project, it was also identified that government procurement differed
from Bank’s guideline mainly for rejection of bids, dispute resolution and negotiation
with bidders. Lack of familiarisation on Bank’s procurement procedures with the
Dzongkhags were also identified in the very beginning. Therefore many tenders had to be
re-tendered in the beginning as one or another procurement requirement were not
understood and met, which led to delays in implementation of project activities.

However, towards the later part of original DRDP phase and after the appointment of a
new TTL and with few changes in the Bank’s team members many of the issues faced
earlier were addressed. Since then project implementation in general became smooth and
was on track. The project management was able to receive timely support and assistance
from the Bank’s team.

The support of SNV during the original DRDP played a crucial role towards Institutional
Strengthening and Capacity Building component. Given that the project coordination unit
consisted of only the Project Coordinator and finance personal, SNV’s support was much
needed and beneficial.

Delay in fund release and timely reporting of expenditure statements was an issue during
the early stages due to the Dzongkhag accounts staff not being familiar with the project’s
financial system and fund disbursement arrangement. Often funds were not utilised on
time, which led to funds getting “spilled over” at the end of every fiscal year. This caused
problems in reconciling the funds, especially when the project accounts team did not
provide adequate and timely oversight. Here again, inadequate numbers of Dzongkhag
staffed who were trained and experienced in project’s procedures became a problem for
the project management.

On the positive side, some project Dzongkhags were more proactive and efficient in
implementing their activities. Judicious use of funds and efficient implementation made it
possible for these administrations to surpass their project targets. This was possible
mainly due to the strong leadership provided by the Dzongda (district administrator) and
the district agriculture officer (DAO).

The Department of Public Accounts & Department of National Budget provided
necessary support to the project without major issues. The delays in fund release that
occurred were mainly due to the weakness of PCU and implementing agencies.

The collaborating partners in DRDP-AF period (RNR-RDCs, NPPC, NSC and AMC)
were all proactive and implementation were taken as priority as the project supported
those key areas that was lagging without fund and many supported activities were
initiatives and innovations that added much value not only to the end beneficiaries
(farmers) but also to the collaborating partners.

7. Lessons Learned

• The importance of a strong project management team for a successful project
  implementation cannot be overemphasized. The team needs to be also staffed
  adequately. In this regard, DRDP with its inexperienced project coordinator and
  finance staff suffered during its early stages. In the absence of focal persons the
  project coordinator had to perform the duties of procurement officer, environment and
  social focal persons and M&E officer in addition to other regular mandates within the
  division. Needless to mention, the project coordinator could not fulfill all the needs.

• The importance of M&E officer to monitor, collect and document project data,
  information, impacts and experiences is amply demonstrated by the existence of
  minimal project reports.

• Often most donor funded projects have differing fund disbursement and procurement
  systems.than the RGoB’s. This creates confusion among the implementing agencies,
  especially when there are many stakeholders and involves local governments. This
  leads to delay in fund release, replenishment, reconciliation and re-bidding of tenders.
  It is therefore deemed crucial to conduct a training workshop for all the key
  stakeholders on the project’s budgeting, fund release and procurement systems in the
  first few months of project. Such an exercise once annually for the next two years
  would have been much appropriate.

• The DAO as a focal person needs to nurture and maintain a close working
  relationship with the Dzongkhag Engineering Sector for civil works. Most of the farm
  roads under DRDP were constructed with budget allocation far below the prescribed
  amount of Nu 3.0 million per Km. Consequently, their quality was below the
  minimum standard required for a farm road. This came about because planning and
  budgeting were left to the local governments as required by the decentralization
  policy without any control from the Centre (Project Coordination Office). To ensure
  quality and make farm roads pliable throughout the year future projects should make
  it mandatory for new farm roads to meet the minimum technical standards, and a
  strict monitoring can be instituted only by having M&E personal under a separate
  project management unit.


• The CBSP approach used under DRDP to grow and multiply quality maize seeds has
  been successful to a great extent. This could be replicated in similar projects in the
  future.

• The lengthy process (engineering studies, social, environmental clearances, bidding)
  involved in getting start farm roads and irrigation construction activities and the
  delays it causes indicate that these activities should be undertaken and completed in
  the first year for all the sub-projects. This will leave the remaining years for the actual
  construction. The current practice of planning and implementing these activities is
  time consuming and thereby causes delays.


                                            72
• New farm road designs should be done only by qualified and experienced civil/road
  engineers. Prior assessment needs to be carried out whether this capacity exists with
  the implementing agencies. Where it is not available this task needs to be outsourced
  to local consultants. This strategy is critical in creating and maintaining good and
  environmental friendly roads.

• Institutional capacity building is one of the key factors in sustainability of any project
  interventions. Few good examples to cite are: the training of NSC staffs on tissue
  culture of potato and banana has led to propagation of high quality and disease free
  basic seeds. Over the past year the quantity of these seeds propagated and multiplied
  for mass distribution has increased manifold. Same is the experience with maize seed.

• Despite devolution of authority for planning and implementation to the local
  government, often activities had to be implemented and monitored only by Geog
  agriculture officers at Geog level. There are many times weak ownership of the
  infrastructures with the local government as after completion of the construction, it
  usually lies again with Geog agriculture office for further monitoring (mainly for
  irrigation channels and roads).

• Though Dzongkhags and Geogs agriculture officers implemented the activities, they
  had inadequate knowledge and skills with regards to roads and irrigation technologies.
  This also applies for the engineers as all are not trained on road or irrigation, Though
  measures were taken to expose and train few engineers, it would have been good to
  orient all agriculture officers and engineers on basics (technologies) of roads / PTTs
  and irrigation schemes before actual implementation of such a big infrastructure
  development activities.
