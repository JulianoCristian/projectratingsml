                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is performing well with regard to the project development objectives. Activities under the additional financing are at 50% of completion, with approximately 1.5 years left
                         under the project. Under the credit approximately 200,000 USD (of disbursed funds) remain unaccounted for due to delays in completion of some works and related expenditure
                         reporting. The project has indicated that these funds will be fully accounted for within this fiscal year.

                         There are changes in initial allocations for sub-components of Component 2 - this came about following the last detailed mission when all activities that should be carried till
                         December 2013 under this component were identified, discussed and budgeted. Moreover, post harvest related activities have been included within the respective crop (rice, maize
                         and potato) budgets and therefore not maintained separately. Expected expenditures for Component 3 will also be higher because expenses for capacity building activities for field
