                         Implementation Status Overview
                         With about eight months remaining for implementation, the project is well in course to achieve its development targets, mainly in the areas of food crop production (rice, maize and

                         The project (DRDP AF) has contributed to the improvement of 43.95 km of farm roads and 256.60 km of irrigation canals. Additionally, rehabilitation work for 17.6 km of farm road is

                         project support, 9 CSBP groups across the country produced over 45 MT of quality maize seeds. And the majority of additional activities that were agreed to be undertaken with the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         With the project coming to an end in December 30, 2014, the Project Management Team (PMT) has been requested to give utmost priority to timely completion of outstanding
                         activities. The PMT has therefore been advised to speed up implementation and urgently identify those items that can be procured within the project life, and initiate procurement. An
                         assessment survey that records the exact project impact on the ground, is planned to be commissioned by June 2014. The details of the impact assessment report will feed into the
                         Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) that would be due fairly soon after the project ends.
