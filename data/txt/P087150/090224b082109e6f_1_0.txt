                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects findings and recommends of the recent implementation support mission which took place from September 23-October 4, 2013. The DRDP-AF is on course to
                         achieving and in most cases exceeding its targets in improving rural infrastructure (irrigation canals and farm roads) and food crop production (rice, maize and potato). To date the
                         project has benefited over 8272 households (target 6700 households) from improved infrastructure and over 8703 households (target 8500 households) through improved extension

                         canals have been rehabilitated far exceeding the initial target

                         However despite the significant progress made towards achieving the project development objectives (PDO) the mission was informed that a significant amount of project funds (USD

                         1.80 million) will remain unused at project closure on December 31, 2013. The reason for the significant savings is a result of implementation efficiencies and exchange rate gains
                         due to a 55% depreciation of the Bhutan Ngultrum (BTN), resulting in the project gaining an additional 110 million BTN.
