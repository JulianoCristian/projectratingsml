The project introduced several innovations;\n            and it was beset by unforeseen events, all of which\n            influenced overall performance to various degrees. Here are\n            the key lessons to be drawn: 1) A realistic, sound project\n            design should require only standard Effectiveness\n            Conditions. 2) Formal project restructuring and target\n            adjustments are a must, when there are significant changes\n            in project funding and/or design. 3) An investment program\n            for irrigation improvement based on credit with 100 percent\n            cost recovery has a high probability of failure if: (a) no\n            prior willingness to pay and participate surveys are carried\n            out; (b) loan conditions, interest rates, and repayment time\n            are inadequate for farmers' socio-economic conditions;\n            and (3) water user organizations (WUOs) can not provide\n            collateral to satisfy commercial banks. 4) In an environment\n            with virtually no previous culture of cost recovery,\n            government support for a certain portion of the investment\n            is crucial. 5) User participation in the process of\n            selecting, designing, executing and financing irrigation\n            works, assures greater effectiveness and sustainability in\n            their use and maintenance. 6) Transferring irrigation\n            schemes from the Government to WUOs requires institutional,\n            administrative, and technical support of associations. 7)\n            Improvement in infrastructure must be accompanied by\n            training and coaching of WUOs. 8) Extended training and\n            awareness programs and economic resources are needed to help\n            farmers understand the market for technical assistance. 9)\n            The demand of farmers for the creation of productive chains\n            demonstrated the importance of irrigation as a broader\n            vehicle for agricultural development."}, "docdt": "2004-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
