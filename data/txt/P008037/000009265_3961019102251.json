systems. The project will also help reduce the\n            role of the public sector in irrigation. There will be five\n            components to the project: a) rehabilitation of the\n            infrastructure for approximately 25 irrigation schemes,\n            estimated to cover and area of over 200,000 hectares and\n            reach over 50,000 families; b) institutional development and\n            strengthening of water users' organizations and\n            training of their management in administration, finance, and\n            operation and maintenance; c) an incentive program for\n            technology improvement, including a training program for\n            private technicians, extensionists and farmers in irrigation\n            techniques and practices, fertilization, and pesticide\n            management as well as a matching grant program to encourage\n            the adoption of modern irrigation technology; d) project\n            administration and monitoring; and e) an emergency dam\n            safety program to deal with immediate hazards which\n            significantly affect large numbers of water users along the coast."}, "docdt": "1996-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
