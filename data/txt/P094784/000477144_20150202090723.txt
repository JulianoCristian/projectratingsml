F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project objective is to increase production and market access of rural families living
in the Chambo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins within Chimborazo Province, through
investments in irrigation and roads improvement.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Project Development Objectives were not revised. However, a Level Two Restructuring
was approved on June 18, 2012 revised the PDO/Results Indicators and Intermediate
Outcome Indicators to reflect actual conditions affecting project execution, and improve
relevance and measurability. As the Restructuring was approved by the RVP, not by "the
original approving authority that approved the loan", a split assessment of outcome was
not prepared. However, for clarity, the revised indicators and achievements are listed
separately, after the PAD originals in the case of both the PDO Indicators and Intermediate
Outcome Indicators. Annex 2 includes a matrix of these changes and their rationale. The
main sources for the pre- and post-Restructuring results are respectively, the Mid-term
Impact Evaluation (Carrasco 2012) and Final Impact Evaluation (Carrasco 2013/14).
Intermediate Indicators 11-15 (Component 2, Project Management) did not change.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1        Following years of political and economic crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the
economy of Ecuador expanded at an average 5.2% per year from 2000-2005 due to political,
economic and monetary stability, increased oil prices and remittances. Major political reforms
starting in 2007 under a newly-elected president included the drafting of a new constitution and an
emphasis on production, employment, regional integration and social equity. This was timely given
that the national poverty rate remained high at 45%, with poverty concentrated in rural areas of the
eastern region and the Sierra highlands.

1.1.2        The Sierra Province of Chimborazo covers an area of 6,560 km2 and had already been
the focus of several donor/related efforts. It was the nation’s second poorest province with a poverty
rate of 78% among its 403,000 inhabitants, of which an estimated 62% were indigenous and 61%
worked in agriculture. While agriculture/agro-industry accounted for 26.5% of provincial GDP and
employed over half the labor force, the sector was characterized by extreme land fragmentation,
over-exploitation and soil degradation, low productivity and access to financial and technical means
of production, and limited access to markets. Rural living conditions were described as precarious:
poor access to basic socio-economic services (other than electricity), and high rates of child
malnutrition, child labor, adult illiteracy and out-migration.

1.1.3        The Chimborazo Development Investment Project (known as PIDD) was the first Bank
loan to a sub-national government in Ecuador. Thus, this project served as a learning opportunity
both for the Bank and the Government of Chimborazo Province. The project benefited greatly from
political support from the Prefect and his administration, promoting the merits of the project for his
constituents and region. This support was probably the most important factor in the advancement
of the operation.

1.1.4        Sector issues: The Sierra region itself played an integral contextual role. This project
is about highlands irrigation and roads development, amply demonstrating the “cost of topography”,
a crucial financial, technical and operational determinant of development in Ecuador. In the case
of irrigation, multiple issues affected progress nationally and within the province: institutions,
equitable water rights, concessions and usage, operation and maintenance (O&M), poor water use
efficiency and environmental degradation/depletion of headwaters. In Chimborazo Province, about
25% of productive land was irrigated and 90% of such land was under inefficient traditional, surface
systems. Over 50% of all irrigated land units were less than 2 ha dedicated primarily to traditional
food crops and livestock. Yields and cropping intensity were low as was water use efficiency
mainly due to outdated technology and deteriorating infrastructure. Conflicts over water were
common and sapped farmers’ willingness to innovate. However, farming and irrigation in
Chimborazo also had advantages: potential for the production of crops requiring a period of cold;
better phytosanitary conditions than coastal areas; a strong tradition of communal work (minga);
the possibility of drip or sprinkler irrigation with natural pressure; and, potential production of
higher value crops such as flowers, berries and cocoa.

1.1.5       In the case of rural roads, deterioration due to difficult highland climatic and other
conditions and erratic maintenance contributed directly to the marginalization of rural families in
remote areas through high transportation costs for farmers and suppliers of goods/services, reduced
tourism, and limited school attendance and access to basic services. The roads inventory was

                                                  1
outdated, planning was driven by demand or political/social criteria, the capacity to plan, contract
and execute road works was weak and, rates of rehabilitation and maintenance were extremely low.
An IDB-financed Participatory Road Plan for Chimborazo (2003), with civil society input,
proposed a set of priority investments based on socio-economic and technical criteria. Meanwhile,
the Chimborazo Provincial Council (CHPC) began to strengthen the institutional and operational
capacity of its Department of Public Works.

1.1.6       Policy and strategic context supporting Bank intervention: First, the province had
come under strong leadership stressing representation and participation. Administrative practices
were sound, based on indigenous ancestral approaches using participatory decision-making and
social accountability introduced by the Prefect, the first indigenous leader elected to this post in
Chimborazo. Second, the PIDD was linked closely to a series of strategic frameworks: the National
Development Plan and poverty reduction strategy; the Provincial Development Plan (PDP) which
sought integrated rural development with cultural identity/conservation and explicitly highlighted
roads and irrigation; and, the 2006 Chimborazo Participatory Rural Development Plan (PRDP)
which showed that roads and irrigation were farmers’ overall top priorities and in combination were
considered the best way to increase productivity, improve access to urban markets and diversify
production. Third, the Bank’s experience in rural development in Ecuador including in Chimborazo
Province lent weight to its intervention, 1 as did the objectives of the 2003 Country Assistance
Strategy (no update was available at appraisal) which sought to broaden access to resources and
ensure that reforms were socially sustainable, and the Bank’s 2005 Ecuador Rural Development
Strategy.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1      The project objective as stated in the Loan Agreement was “to increase production and
market access of rural families living in the Chambo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins in the
Borrower’s territory, through investments in irrigation and roads improvement”.2

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

N/A

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1        Irrigation systems investments were expected to benefit around 17,500 poor rural
families settled in the Chambo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins. No target was set at appraisal
for beneficiaries of improved roads but the 2012 Restructuring established a target of 7,102 families.
A high proportion of direct beneficiaries were expected to be indigenous people. As described in
the PAD, Chimborazo farmers were constrained by land fragmentation and extensive soil
degradation; a harsher climate and topography than coastal regions; decreasing water flows and
resulting conflicts; limited access to markets, and depressed, variable farmgate prices due to
dependence on intermediaries; and limited access to the financial and technical means of production.


1    National Sustainable Rural Development Project (PRONADER); Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorean Peoples
Development Project (PRODEPINE); Agricultural Research Project (PROMSA); Agricultural Census and Information
System Project (SICA); and Poverty Reduction and Local Rural Development Project (PROLOCAL), and others.
2   The PAD version of the PDO shows a slight difference from the Loan Agreement, using “…within Chimborazo
Province….” rather than “…in the Borrower’s Territory…”. The ICR uses the version from the Loan Agreement.

                                                     2
Specific socio-economic data concerning beneficiaries is not presented in the PAD but the 2010
Baseline Study is instructive.3

1.4.2       The CHPC would benefit from training to coordinate and manage the project, the Road
Maintenance Micro-enterprises (MEMR) and Water User Associations (WUA) would also be
trained to execute defined responsibilities, and implicitly, contracted professionals would gain
experience in development by working in a Bank-financed operation.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1          Project components were as follows (details in Annex 2):

Component 1: Productive Investments (US$20.5 m of which Bank US$13.2m, 64.4%).

Sub-component 1.1: Irrigation Improvements (US$12.1 m of which Bank US$9.0 m, 74.4%)
was to finance the rehabilitation and modernization of 265 irrigation systems based on eligibility
criteria and the strengthening of Water User Associations (WUA) in O&M and administration. 4
Works were expected to represent 80% of subproject (SP) cost and training/institutional
strengthening 20%. 5 Only off-farm irrigation improvements would be financed, except for 15
demonstration SPs promoting modern, on-farm irrigation techniques. WUAs would cost-share
feasibility studies (10% in cash, in advance) and civil works (min. 5% cash contribution and 20%
in unskilled labor).

Sub-component 1.2: Roads Improvements (US$8.3 m of which Bank US$4.2 m, 51%) was to
finance the improvement and maintenance of about 60.5 km of rural road segments (Riobamba-
Cebadas 35 km, and Charicando-Turubamba 25.5 km) selected based on the priority road matrix
of the Provincial Participatory Roads Plan (2003).6 Road preparation works would be conducted
by the Chimborazo Provincial Council using its own equipment, while major works would be
contracted through national competitive bidding (NCB). Maintenance works conducted by CHPC
and contracted Road Maintenance Micro-enterprises (MEMR) would be financed by counterpart
funds; 15 MEMRs already existed, and six more would be created.




3    The Baseline Study (2010) in the project area, prepared three years after appraisal, shows a less precarious socio-
economic picture than that mentioned in the PAD. Socio-economic indices for farm families within the project-targeted
showed: 97.5% living in fully-owned homes; 85.7% of houses of stone or brick, with an average 3.6 family members and
little sign of over-crowding; 76.3% had public, piped water supply; about 80% had sanitation systems of which 63%
septic tank and 17.4% public sewerage; 93% had electricity; about 73% cooked with gas and only 27% used wood or
coal. The Baseline concluded that a majority of the project universe was not in calamitous circumstances. In productive
terms: 93% had land for economic activity with average landholdings of 1.2 ha and 71.4% had additional lands; 46.6%
of land area was devoted to short cycle crops and 36.9% to perennial. Agricultural activities generated 86% of production,
and livestock/dairy 14%. Some 86% of all families had access to irrigation but operating at very low levels of efficiency.
An estimated 54% of lands were cultivated using irrigation.
4 Total cost below US$500,000; subsidy <US$2,500/farmer; identified via participatory processes; managed by a legally

registered WUA; dependent on an updated water concession; acceptable design standards; compliance with social and
environmental safeguards; financially and economically viable; and, compliant with cost-sharing rules.
5 Works comprised: (i) increased water storage; (ii) rehabilitation and/or modernization of intakes and primary water

conduction (concrete lining of open canal, substitution of canal by pipe); and, (iii) improved water regulation on primary
canals.
6 The PAD roads indicator is “125 km of roads are regularly maintained and in good condition”. The intention was to

rehabilitate 60.5 km but maintain an additional 64.5 km, the responsibility of the existing 15 MEMRs to be strengthened
by the PIDD.

                                                            3
Component 2: Project Management (US$1.7 m of which Bank US$1.4 m, 82.3%) was to finance
project coordination using the CHPC’s existing structure, a monitoring and evaluation system, and
a communications strategy. The component would finance a Project Coordinator and sector
specialists to strengthen CHPC’s technical capacity to implement the project and comply with the
Bank’s fiduciary and safeguards requirements, as well as equipment and supplies to support
implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1        Roads: The Bank team was formally notified by the CHPC in October 2008 during
the first regular supervision mission that for budgetary reasons associated with the availability of
alternative funds under the Central Government’s Emergency Roads Plan, CHPC wished to
withdraw certain road segments targeted for financing under Sub-component 1.2 and substitutes
would be needed. Roads eligible for Central Government financing required final
technical/feasibility studies. The project’s Riobamba-Cebadas segment was the only one meeting
that condition and was thus withdrawn. The availability of good quality feasibility and engineering
studies financed by the JSDF during PIDD preparation was a positive incentive/catalyst to CHPC’s
actions. The Bank required that any substitute segments be among those identified in the PPRP;
that they replicate the project approach/framework, i.e., technical, social, economic and
environmental standards, O&M and cost-sharing aspects; and, that they benefit populations in areas
subject to PIDD irrigation investments. Substitute roads selected after exhaustive research, were:
Charicando-Cocan-La Dolorosa (21.4 km), Cubijies-Quimiag-Quebrada de Pulchucahuan (16.1
km) and Flores-Y de Achullay (12.9 km), a total 50.4 km. Due to overall higher cost of roads
activities, US$550,000 was reallocated from Component 2 Project Management. 7 The new
segments completed strategic ring roads vital for agricultural production and marketing in the area.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1       Project Restructuring: As a direct outcome of the Mid-term Review (MTR, see 2.2.6),
but with a 19-month delay, an RVP-approved Level Two Restructuring in June 2012 did the
following: (i) modified the Results Framework to better reflect project activities and actual costs
which were under-estimated at appraisal (see 2.1.5 and Annex 2); (ii) adjusted the location of
targeted road segments due to government’s decision to finance part of the original plan using
national funds (see 1.6);8 (iii) reallocated US$760,000 from Component 2 Project Management to
Sub-components 1.1 Irrigation and 1.2 Roads; (iv) updated the project financing plan; and (v)
changed the name of the Borrower to Decentralized Autonomous Government of Chimborazo
Province (DAGCHP). The PDO was not changed, nor were any additional safeguards triggered
but project scale was significantly reduced: from 265 to 55 irrigation systems and from 17,500
beneficiary families to 7,990. A Mid-Term Impact Evaluation (Carrasco 2012) underscored project
achievements and impacts at the time, based on the original Results Framework (see Data Sheet
and Annexes 2 and 5).




7   The Provincial Government needed to complete the rehabilitation of these segments together with their associated
ring roads to fulfill annual operating plans and get Central Government financing for the new fiscal year.
8 In regard to the road changes, restructuring the PIDD as a condition for financing the two new segments with the Loan

would have prevented Government from executing its revised road plans and was a key reason for the 19 month gap
between the decision to restructure and its formal approval. In addition to the 35 km Riobamba-Cebadas segment financed
with Central Government resources, CHPC leveraged additional funds to complete a Tunshi-San Nicolas segment of 42
km for a combined total length of 127.4 km (253% of the formally targeted 50.4 km).

1.7.2       Closing Date: The closing date was extended by nine months from September 30,
2013 to June 30, 2014 (part of the Restructuring approved June 18, 2012).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1        Project preparation was protracted but this improved the quality and appropriateness
of the final product primarily by narrowing its scope to two major, complementary development
streams enhanced by training and institutional capacity-building. The requirements of the Organic
Act of Financial Administration and Control (LOAYFC) which inter alia, limited Central
Government guarantees to basic infrastructure investment projects financed with loan proceeds was
also a key factor focusing project design on irrigation and roads. Further, the supporting analytics
showed that irrigation and roads were farmers’ clear priorities, with strong potential to both drive
greater agricultural productivity and in the case of roads, support agricultural development
constrained by their lack. Preparation was consultative with the views of the client and beneficiaries
well-represented.

2.1.2        The project was complex and ambitious in both its investment and institutional goals,
given the difficult operational environment and existing capacity. Technical solutions were
carefully-crafted and long-term sustainability was integrated through the focus on a framework of
beneficiary organization and capacity-building, user contributions in labor and cash, and
institutional strengthening.9 The fundamental approach was participatory but also private sector-
oriented; the project broke away from the conventional idea of public investment, especially
evident in the training of the WUAs to inculcate a culture of payment for water and professionalized
user management of systems, and RCAs integrating traditional indigenous collective labor
practices for routine roads maintenance in partnership with scheduled public sector responsibilities
for more major repairs.

2.1.3         The technical design of irrigation works was conventional per se but complicated by
the terrain, and limited to off-farm improvements due to government regulations restricting the use
of public funds to investments in collective productive infrastructure.10The demands for specialist
skills and time for the highly participatory irrigation rehabilitation cycle were under-estimated
(because unknown) at appraisal, only becoming evident during the execution of initial, pilot
subprojects. However, all stakeholders acknowledge the value of this methodology to the project’s
achievements and sustainability. The overall goal was to improve water availability and its reliable
delivery to farms. The focus was productive but not explicitly on income. Demonstration plots were
expected to promote improved on-farm technologies via training and site visits, and to encourage
independent adoption. Hindsight shows that this methodology needs to be tailored to local social
and cultural traditions and the packages – in order to promote wider adoption - should include
entrepreneurship, value-added, marketing and longer-term technical support as well as guidance on
sources of financing.

2.1.4        Road works also used conventional solutions: removal of existing surfaces and
installation of asphalt cover and drainage; simple rehabilitation of local connector roads; and,


9   The Project Concept Note (2005) described an operation of much broader scope.
10  The PAD also acknowledged that on-farm irrigation improvement was the key to moving into higher value crops but
that the technology was costly and its O&M more complex. The new Bank-supported operation does propose investment
in on-farm works.

                                                        5
technical and administrative strengthening of the RCAs (initially called MEMR) and the overall
maintenance framework. Engineering choices were challenged/driven by the topography and
climatic conditions of the Sierra and the demonstrable inadequacy of temporary solutions involving
patching and similar activities (see 2.1.6). The innovative aspects of the roads lay in strengthening
the RCAs and involving users in O&M – in this case through mingas - since institutionalized as the
model for road works province-wide and garnering commitment/interest beyond Chimborazo.

2.1.5        Costs: Among cross-cutting issues of design, costs merit attention. The irrigation
subcomponent was expected to benefit 17,500 water user families and finance 265 subprojects (250
small subprojects of <US$50,000 and 15 large of US$50,000 to US$500,000). Re-estimation of
costs by the 2010 Mid-term Review using feasibility studies and field assessments showed these
targets were over-estimated. 11 Unit cost ceilings established during preparation had sought to
maximize the number of beneficiaries and systems and ensure cost-effectiveness, setting an average
cost of US$60,250/subproject based on a sample of 11 subprojects ranging from US$20,000 to
US$120,000, and with cost effectiveness established as a fixed ceiling of US$5,000 (liters per
second of concession). Based on the real costs and water flow concession data for the pilot
subprojects prepared after effectiveness, the diversity of systems financed, and using the complete
preparation cycle, it was clear that the cost effectiveness rate was too low especially for smaller
systems. To ensure water availability, gain greater level to pressurize networks and to increase
systems’ resilience to extreme events, most planned systems required a higher investment on water
intake structures. A new five-category subproject size classification system based on reliable water
availability parameters using the real costs and water concession data of the completed pilot
subprojects was developed to underpin more realistic projections. Actual costs per subproject were
averaging US$153,550 at the time of the MTR, or 255% of the appraisal estimate, and at closing
averaged US$158,000 per subproject or 262%.

2.1.6        In the case of roads, the rehabilitation design might be viewed as over-engineered, with
relatively high costs per kilometer of construction - US$137,000/km at appraisal vs
US$180,000/km at completion - for rural roads traveled by an average of 45 vehicles per day (Final
Evaluation, 2014). It is not uncommon in Bank roads projects for international design standards to
be applied to very low volume rural roads when other, simpler solutions may be more cost-effective.
Further, the need to shift road design to alternative stretches while trying to build project
momentum may have led to applying the same high standards to roads which with different
selection criteria might have been rehabilitated to a lower standard. However, the ICR maintains
that despite quantified benefits not compensating for the initial investment, a comparison of the
before and after-project situation shows: technical solutions were acceptable given the overall net
benefit to the province; travel times and vehicle O&M costs were reduced; reasonable costs per
beneficiary;12 a range of important social and economic benefits promoted by greater connectivity
(benefiting 371,000 people indirectly) but difficult to measure; and the roads’ likely sustainability
based on Bank inspection at closing and given the roads’ three-year track record of good
maintenance. See Annex 3.

2.1.7       Sustainability: Institutional, technical, financial and environmental measures
constituted a framework designed to boost sustainability: ensuring that the CHPC built
administrative, technical and managerial capacity; quality design and construction of both irrigation



11   Targets were also inconsistent with the completion schedule - the participatory decision-making cycle proved
protracted - and with initial technical and operational capacity.
12  US$26.30 per indirect beneficiary compared for example to the result of US$30.00/indirect beneficiary obtained by
ex post analysis of Peru Rural Transport Project (P095570).

                                                         6
systems and roads; environmental sustainability through links to the parallel GEF operation (2.1.9)
focusing on conservation and sustainable management of the paramos (high plains grasslands/eco-
system) and watershed resources, and training farmers in natural resource management practices;
ensuring user “ownership” and consistent O&M of both irrigation systems and road segments
through capacity building of WUAs and MEMRs respectively and mandatory cash payments
(irrigation); and, strengthening the CHPC (subsequently DAGPCH) road unit to ensure adequate
technical and budgetary capacity for proper roads maintenance. 13

2.1.8        Lessons of experience: Project design reflected the lessons of previous projects in
Ecuador and the region in regard to: (i) working with indigenous groups and using their cultural
assets/practices to mobilize labor and capital, and improve productivity; (ii) the positive impact of
irrigation improvements on farmer income, employment and resource conservation when demand-
driven and participatory mechanisms are used throughout the subproject cycle, and WUAs and
farmer groups receive training and support; and (iii) use of MEMRs, a proven, cost-effective
mechanism in other countries of the region due to its employment creation potential, and capacity
to empower such bodies to undertake other local development initiatives.

2.1.9        GEF: A US$4.0 m Global Environment Facility (GEF) partially-blended operation in
Chimborazo Province – Management of Natural Resources of Chimborazo” (PROMAREN) - was
prepared jointly with the PIDD along with a Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant-
financed operation, “Improved Access to Markets for Small Farmers of Chimborazo”. The GEF
sought to support the conservation and sustainable management of the Chimborazo paramos and
related highland eco-systems through integrated watershed management. The CHPC was to
coordinate/manage all three operations under a single, integrated Operational Manual. The Bank
transferred the GEF to FAO and postponed the JSDF due to the difficult country relationship of
that period and the lack of a current CPS. 14 Even so, the Bank formally agreed in 2010 to co-finance
US$3.2 m through the PIDD, of which: US$3.0 m to rehabilitate irrigation systems in five micro-
catchments based on the original PIDD implementation plan/activities and eligibility criteria (i.e.,
no incrementality or changes) complemented by GEF-financed NRM activities in those same
micro-catchments; and, US$200,000 towards PROMAREN management costs, also embedded in
the existing PIDD cost structure/estimates.15

2.1.10       Implementation arrangements: A project coordination unit was created within
CHPC’s existing structure with execution through its Department of Public Works (DPW) to
prevent the unit’s isolation from mainstream government. The idea was to use regular staff from
various units, supported by external specialists to build internal capacity. The DPW Director would
be responsible for overall implementation, supported by a Project Operational Team responsible
for planning and coordination and led by a Project Coordinator. More care was needed in devising
a strategy for securing specialist support, which in practice became a major challenge impeding
progress given serious capacity gaps and inexperience. However, embedding the coordination unit
within the regular structure of DPW paid off: since project closing, trained, experienced PIDD staff
have been incorporated into the new Irrigation Unit of DAGPCH and into the Implementation Unit
of the new IDB operation in this province.


13 The PAD mentions the creation of an Irrigation Investment Fund but the idea never took root and it’s unclear whether

it was associated with the PIDD or another Bank-supported project, PRODEPINE.
14 The Bank decided in mid-2008: to continue to implement the PIDD as per legal documents; stop Bank processing of

the GEF and assist the CHPC to identify a new implementing agency to which the GEF could be transferred (ultimately,
FAO); and, postpone submission of the JSDF grant.
15 See Bank letter of August 5, 2010. The letter advised that even though the PIDD was to share the administrative costs,

the GEF would finance/contract the additional staff needed for FM and Procurement.

                                                           7
2.1.11      Risk analysis and mitigation: Experience shows that the most likely risks were
correctly identified at appraisal. However, in several cases risks were under-estimated and/or
inadequately mitigated, for example, rating as low “limited human capital and limited local capacity
to implement subprojects” when actual risk was substantial/high due to the project’s technical
demands. A related risk “insufficient project management and fiduciary capacity within the CHPC”
was appropriately rated substantial but the mitigation included “hiring of qualified personnel”
which was a risk in its own right for the pace and quality of project execution. Attracting and
recruiting appropriately-skilled staff for key positions was hindered by lack of supply and low
provincial salaries. Notably, the risk associated with the uncertainty of medium-term national
government strategy vis a vis multilateral agencies was correctly mitigated: the close involvement
of the Provincial Government, local stakeholders and beneficiaries in the full project/subproject
cycle enabled the project to implement and achieve locally despite difficult conditions and
relationships at the national level.16

2.1.12       Participatory processes: Participation was the hallmark of project preparation and
execution, including the source of key plans and strategies underpinning the project’s rationale, and
CHPC’s established governance and administrative methodologies (e.g., participatory budgeting,
the use of mingas or indigenous collective labor for irrigation and road works and their
maintenance). Preparation included consultations/interviews with institutions, municipalities,
parishes, indigenous and other community leaders, service providers and stakeholders, as well as a
rural Social Assessment and an Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF).

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1          Several factors affected the pace and quality of project implementation:

         First sub-national project: The PIDD was the first loan to a sub-national government in
          Ecuador implying a longer than anticipated learning process for the Provincial Government
          and the Bank, and inevitable delays. The difficult Bank-country environment added
          complexity to project execution, a situation where the critical importance of leadership was
          evident in the full support of the Prefect, his personal advocacy of the project at the local
          and national levels, and the project’s role in preserving a measure of normalcy in the
          country relationship.

         Participatory subproject processing and execution: The approach to irrigation
          development was complex and time-consuming, involving linked, complementary streams
          of activity: (i) Consultation/participation: subproject selection through the annual
          participatory budget process, under the Provincial Government’s Development Plan;
          consultation with WUAs; beneficiary surveys and cadasters; participatory discussions and
          decision-making regarding technical solutions for adoption; feasibility/basic studies and
          final designs for procurement/bidding; and, collection of the required, up-front beneficiary
          cost-share which could and did delay subproject initiation in many cases; (ii) Technical
          assistance/training: strengthening provincial government capacity to identify, evaluate,
          select and supervise irrigation subprojects; and, strengthening WUA and farmers’ capacity


16  The 2012 Restructuring added two new risks: (i) complexity of irrigation activities involving multiple parties and
beneficiaries could prevent timely project completion, signaling the potential need for an extension of the closing date;
and (ii) the switch from Local Shopping to National Competitive Bidding (NCB) to improve competition and
transparency risked not attracting sufficient interested firms. Mitigation measures were rational/adequate.

                                                           8
       in O&M, systems administration, on-farm irrigation methods and agricultural practices;
       (iii) Collective labor: upon starting subprojects, mingas - indigenous collective labor
       groups - became an important and crucial community contribution to the participatory
       cycle including the O&M of completed works. Despite its complexity, this methodology
       is widely acknowledged to have been beneficial and has been adopted by the DAGPCH for
       all interventions in irrigation and other sectors where relevant. It clearly implies trade-offs
       in realistic project targets and scheduling and requires a well-conceived and executed
       communications plan.

      Human resource constraints: The project was challenging due to its technical nature and
       consequent human resource and capacity building needs. Over time, with continuous Bank
       mentoring supported by FAO specialists, adequate technical capacity was generated and
       has since been absorbed into DAGPCH’s new Irrigation Unit. While the potential risks of
       local capacity gaps were recognized at appraisal and training was a core project focus, the
       processes involved in building capacity in real time, i.e., simultaneously with its
       deployment, were under-estimated. The project needed to “train the trainers”. Staffing of
       key positions was delayed by bureaucratic selection/hiring processes, deficient supply of
       trained professionals familiar with World Bank projects, and local salary scales. This
       situation was aggravated by several years of weak project coordination/leadership and
       inadequate communication between the technical and administrative teams, mainly due to
       inexperience. Such issues must be both anticipated and acted upon ex ante to the extent
       possible, given the known nature of the client and operational context.

      Reduced staffing of the implementation unit: The unit’s operating capacity was also
       adversely affected by an exodus of key specialists in the final quarter of 2011. This may
       have been prompted by a formal external analysis – proposed by the MTR – of the
       performance of individual contracted specialists. Most contracts were up for renewal in
       2011. Some also left to work on a new Ministry of Agriculture project which offered better
       conditions. Those leaving included the environmental and M&E specialists, principal
       project administrative assistant and the financial monitoring officer, causing deterioration
       in established practices including the environmental regulation of irrigation subprojects.
       The incoming Bank team leader urged the immediate filling of vacancies and DAGPCH
       responded rapidly to reconstitute the unit. The pace and quality of project execution
       improved at a critical time for project completion.

2.2.2        Mid-term Review (MTR): The November 2010 MTR reviewed all key elements of
project implementation, progress in achieving objectives and the rate of disbursement. As
mentioned, an external evaluation of the implementation unit’s contracted personnel was underway
at the time to support contract renewal. Results of satisfaction surveys of irrigation and road
beneficiaries were reviewed. Road works were relatively advanced but only six irrigation systems
were completed, albeit resulting in a 90% average increase in water availability. Another 40
systems were at various stages of the processing cycle. The primary recommendation was that the
project be restructured inter alia, to revise the Results Framework and establish more
reasonable/reachable targets given the actual pace of implementation and evidence of flawed cost
estimates for irrigation works. A comprehensive mid-term impact evaluation was
discussed/planned.

2.2.3       Additional Financing: Following the Restructuring in June 2012, DAGPCH and the
Bank discussed the outline of a possible Additional Financing (AF) intended to cover the higher
costs of some irrigation SPs already underway, expand several existing/completed irrigation
systems, execute new SPs which had missed the first “round”, and finance additional road works.

                                                 9
The proposed AF was to use the same participatory methodology, and focus on agricultural
extension services as well as water management training for DAGPCH. The Bank team was
supportive in principle but did not proceed in part due to the ongoing lack of a Bank ISN or CPS,
and because the Bank favored a free-standing follow-on operation which could scale up the PIDD
methodology and expand project scope. In practice, the AF design became the basis for the IDB-
financed operation, regarded as the second phase of the PIDD.

2.2.4        GEF/PROMAREN execution: The GEF-FAO Management of Natural
Resources/Chimborazo (PROMAREN GCP-ECU/080GFF) started implementation in mid-2012.
Although well beyond the original timetable which envisaged parallel execution of the two
operations, the Bank team continued to stress collaboration and synergy. PROMAREN’s main
objective was management and conservation of watersheds emphasizing paramos ecosystems.
Progress was incipient in the first year, the GEF working mostly in the Rio Chimborazo and Rio
Blanco micro-watersheds preparing participatory management plans, identifying priority
investments and focusing on slope protection and clean production practices. By the final semester
of the PIDD, GEF-financed subprojects were underway to install protective fencing in paramos
areas and to map PIDD irrigation systems benefited by GEF activities and PIDD reforestation
activities. Management Plans were under discussion with beneficiaries/water users. As noted, and
because the two operations were at completely different stages, there was actually little direct
collaboration or coordination, although the nature and location of GEF activities suggests that
positive synergies will benefit PIDD irrigation beneficiaries in focus areas.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1        M&E design: M&E was generally well-conceived and contemplated ongoing
monitoring of activities, the use of social accountability mechanisms (or participatory monitoring)
and external impact evaluations. The Results Framework (RF) was adequate but key targets proved
too ambitious, based on flawed cost estimates and an unrealistic timeline. This, combined with
variable clarity and measurability of indicators, prompted restructuring in 2012. Modifications
improved RF quality overall but issues persisted: some indicators remained qualitative when hard
data would have provided greater insight; important/useful indicators were dropped without a
strong rationale; superior results indicators could have been devised to support both PDO themes;
and, the RF continued to lack indicators measuring the participation of women and indigenous
peoples. 17 The impact assessment plan included a baseline study, mid-term and final impact
evaluations, and a Borrower Completion Report (BCR), a challenging program for any
coordination unit let alone a subnational unit with no experience of the Bank.

2.3.2        M&E implementation: Overall performance was satisfactory, exceeding that of
many such units with more favorable conditions and experience. A Baseline Study, intermediate
and final impact evaluations (Carrasco, 2010, 2012, 2013/’2014), and a BCR were produced. These
were complemented by “systematization” studies (annual status round-ups), a final report by the
DAGPCH entitled “Rendicion de Cuentas” (2014), and a video for PIDD dissemination purposes.
In addition, the Bank team contracted an ex post research exercise to establish a Control Group to
boost evidence of PDO achievement. The project did not establish a project-specific Management



17    Irrigation: measuring the actual costs of irrigation O&M and actual payments by farmers; gauging numbers of
WUAs with an established reserve fund by end-project; an indicator demonstrating better management of micro-
catchments; and/or, better defining the anticipated shift from rain fed to irrigated agriculture given that the project
rehabilitated systems but did not establish new ones. Roads: increased volume of agricultural product transported to
market and attributable to improved roads.

                                                         10
Information System (MIS), instead monitoring through other methods deemed acceptable by the
Bank. The project lacked an M&E “platform” within SINFO and new projects need to support the
automation of M&E. However, with Bank concurrence, the EOP embedded project databases
within the existing institutional framework/system, which took time to organize but was
satisfactory and potentially more sustainable. With the exception of the staffing crisis described in
2.2.1, the project had an M&E specialist from the beginning which was a pioneering effort in the
Borrower institution because the impact of project activities, when related to the Baseline, could
be seen by everyone.

2.3.3       M&E utilization: Results of the mid-term impact evaluation (Carrasco 2012)
provided a solid foundation for the Restructuring. Final impact results (Carrasco 2013/14) were
disseminated via two workshops with broad-based attendance including from other provinces likely
to participate in the Bank’s proposed follow-on operation. The availability of hard data
demonstrating results – and at two data points - prompted DAGPCH’s adoption of the basic
methodology as a policy for other development efforts, and provides the new Bank operation under
preparation with a solid basis for scaling up PIDD’s core framework/approach country-wide and
expanding its scope.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary compliance:

2.4.1       The PIDD triggered the following safeguards for which compliance was rated
Satisfactory throughout in all cases. The implementation experience is discussed below.

2.4.2         OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment): Feasibility studies for irrigation SPs
included an environmental baseline, as well as potential impacts and mitigation measures, and an
Environmental Manual guided preparation of environmental management plans (EMP) for each
rehabilitated system. Procedures for the certification and environmental licensing of irrigation and
roads respectively were agreed with the Ministry of Environment (ME) and national environmental
norms were observed. 18 The project Environmental Specialist (ES) adequately monitored
mitigation measures (see 2.4.3). On the ground, PIDD training stressed community participation,
awareness of more efficient water use and reducing pressure on natural resources, and ecological
agriculture. This was complemented by demonstration plots and reforestation activities (using
native species/plants) designed to protect watersheds and paramos eco-systems. Bank safeguards
specialists provided explicit instructions to WUAs regarding potential environmental
problems/threats associated with systems operations, physical stability/integrity and the
management of solid waste/contaminants. O&M training reinforced environmental messages.
Reforestation using native species designed to conserve soil and regulate water flow had a slow
start but gained momentum in the final year. Over 65,000 trees supplied by DAGPCH were planted
around the water sources of 16 systems, with Bank guidance on correct maintenance.

2.4.3        Departure of the Environmental Specialist in 2011 disrupted established environmental
routines - especially in regard to the environmental regulation of irrigation systems and
management of permits with the MAE (local agency of the Ministry of Environment) - and delayed
the contracting of irrigation works. The M&E of environmental impacts was also suspended. Bank
safeguards supervision found in 2012 that all subprojects contracted after September 2012 lacked
environmental permits/licenses. A new specialist was rapidly contracted and licensing/M&E were
regularized for all affected subprojects to the Bank’s satisfaction. It was also agreed that DAGPCH



18   Details, Aide Memoire, July 2009.

                                                 11
would continue to supervise achievement of EMPs for one year after issuance of the final batch of
permits. Through closing, the project continued to train beneficiaries in solid waste management,
their EMP, and awareness concerning NRM, collective clean-up, water purity and reforestation.
Overall, the project gave visibility to the environment in public construction works – all subprojects
contained environmental mitigation measures which had to be financed with the works budgets.

2.4.4       OP/BP 4.04 (Natural Habitats): Environmental oversight by the EOP and Bank was
regular and comprehensive, finding no damage or threat to natural habitats.

2.4.5        OP/BP 4.36 (Forests): No damage/destruction to forests was reported. Specific cases
of irrigation works being revised/re-routed to maintain forested areas were noted. As mentioned
above, road and irrigation subprojects had individual EIAs with mitigation measures, and the PIDD
financed/supervised the planting of native species trees to mitigate potential erosion of irrigation
canals/margins and to protect upstream water sources (2.4.2).

2.4.6        OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples, revised as OP 4.10 Social Safeguard): By end-
project, about 82% of all irrigation beneficiary families were indigenous. Implementation processes
for both irrigation and roads were highly participatory, based on local cultural traditions/practices,
conducted bilingually in kichwa and Spanish, using local organizations and including indigenous
women. The irrigation decision-making cycle was recorded and signed by all participants. Even so,
issues arose. Due to the sensitivity of water access and history of conflicts, certain groups sought
to operate outside project norms and regulations, refusing to pay for water use and creating tension
between communities. This coincided with and was exacerbated by controversial provisions of a
proposed new Water Law. To help resolve this situation the Bank insisted that: (i) all consultations
and agreements be well-documented; (ii) DAGPCH establish a grievance resolution mechanism
and point person; (iii) the delayed project communications campaign be activated to ensure that all
stakeholders understood project objectives and activities. This was also considered crucial in
motivating irrigation users to pay for O&M; and, (iv) the project not generate expectations before
technical solutions could be found. The EOP’s lack of a Social Specialist until the final stages may
have contributed to certain difficulties but was compensated by the widespread use of locally-based
social promoters acting as brokers between the communities and project staff. By end-project,
stakeholders/beneficiaries acknowledged that the level of conflict had been greatly reduced. See
3.5.

2.4.7      OP/BP 4.09 (Pest Management): The project systematically promoted ecologically
sound farming methods including natural forms of pest management. No issues were detected by
Bank safeguards supervision.

2.4.8        Related issues: During the analysis of potential alternative road segments in 2009, it
appeared that the project would need to retroactively trigger OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement)
due to likely physical/social impacts on local pasture lands and re-location of community buildings.
This would have required Board approval. Participatory assemblies with affected farmers led to
alternative, technical solutions to avoid adverse impacts and the safeguard was not triggered.
Further, as standard procedure, project activities ensured compliance with OP 4.12 by: (i)
documenting all information provided to community members who had voluntarily ceded small
pieces of land for the construction of community infrastructure; (ii) archiving all documents
confirming user acceptance of such arrangements; (iii) documenting confirmation that the option




                                                 12
to use an individual’s land was selected after consideration of all possible alternatives;19and, (iv) in
cases where a user’s land was purchased for project purposes, confirming that a fair price was paid
through an open sales contract between the parties.

Fiduciary compliance:

2.4.9     Compliance with the Bank’s fiduciary requirements in both Financial Management and
Procurement proved a continuous challenge to the EOP. Key aspects of this experience are
summarized below.

2.4.10       Financial Management (FM): FM performance was monitored by the Bank specialist
for every supervision mission, and reported in detail with action plans and follow-up. Ratings
fluctuated over time, dropping into the negative range at the mid-period but improving to a
sustained moderately satisfactory rating over the final 18 months as the EOP gained experience.
The key performance factors over time were: (i) high level of rotation of accounting/FM personnel
and prolonged lack of a project treasurer position; (ii) partial implementation of agreed action plans;
(iii) untimely transmission of FM information/data to auditors and deficient follow-up of auditors’
recommendations; (iv) unsystematic financial and budget monitoring/reporting and data errors; and,
(v) delayed payments to suppliers and contractors. Audit performance was uneven with some audit
cycles resulting in qualified opinions and protracted interaction with the Bank to rectify failings.
Weak FM performance was characteristic of an inexperienced borrower, made more challenging
by project coordination/leadership issues. Further, the project unit’s insertion within DAGPCH
meant that the latter’s bureaucratic procedures permeated the project unit’s FM efforts. Also,
project design involved central funds management (DAGPCH) but implementation and monitoring
of multiple subprojects in distant rural areas. Quarterly Bank FM supervision was started in 2010
with positive impacts on overall FM performance and compliance as the project unit gained
experience. There was greater synergy between Bank and DAGPCH processes, more timely
systematic preparation of interim financial reports and compliance with Bank recommendations,
improved internal controls, and closer oversight of subprojects ready to be transferred to the WUAs.
The Bank provided training and mentoring throughout from its Quito office and headquarters.

2.4.11        Procurement: The EOP’s procurement performance was troubled as reflected by
ratings in the negative range during the mid-period, but did show sustained improvement in the
final 18 months with ratings rising to moderately satisfactory. As with FM, procurement was
formally analyzed and detailed in aide memoires by the Bank procurement specialist included in
every supervision mission; time-bound action plans with training/mentoring and seminars were
standard procedure. The project unit struggled to master Bank rules and its progress was slow,
delaying project activities – especially the contracting of essential specialist staff - and causing
repeated modifications to annual procurement plans. Standard procurement documents were not
approved by the Bank until end-2009. The ICR suggests more could have been done to
analyze/formulate such elements during preparation. The Borrower Completion Report (2014)
refers to the valuable contribution of the whole experience in terms of transparency, discipline and
combating corruption, and its impact on the creation of a market for suppliers of consulting and




19 The MTR states that the PIDD did not activate OP 4.12 due to project works being exclusively the rehabilitation of

already existing irrigation systems and roads. Consequently, the right of way and use of irrigation systems were already
established prior to construction and were not changed.


                                                          13
construction services. But, Bank requirements were seen as “overly rigid and made for global
conditions” not adapted to the local context. The Borrower suggests that Bank rules blended
with/adapted to national conditions might have resulted in time savings of up to 50%.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

O&M and transitional arrangements:

2.5.1         Irrigation: WUAs were strengthened organizationally and trained in all aspects of the
O&M of their systems. DAGPCH has undertaken to continue to boost their operational and
institutional capacity beyond project closing. The WUAs have legal responsibility for their systems,
with formal transfer procedures and documentation outlining rights and responsibilities involving
DAGPCH/Irrigation Unit and the WUAs occurring after completion and initial systems operation.20
Surveys showed that some 72% of all WUAs are collecting adequate fees from users to cover full
O&M costs (see Annex 2). Interviews with WUA presidents in 2012 quantified O&M costs for 19
systems, i.e., verified the adequacy/otherwise of the fee charged in relation to actual needs. This
exercise could usefully have been done for all 55 systems. The main O&M issues in this case are:
(i) Financial capacity to pay: Without a quantum leap in income-earning capacity, full O&M
coverage will remain problematic for small-scale farmers still using traditional irrigation methods
and cropping; and, (ii) Willingness to pay: Awareness building and hence information campaigns
and training are critical, and this includes continuous efforts to promote diversification and higher
value farming, reinforcing ownership of systems – potentially through the use of incentives - and
inculcating the message that water is not free. These ideas were the core focus of project-financed
administration, operation and maintenance (AOM) training from the outset and showed that the
learning process is slow and needs to be addressed longer-term.

2.5.2        Roads: Bringing the lessons from irrigation to roads, the PIDD strengthened 16 Road
Conservation Associations (RCA), and created 68 new, permanent jobs in road AOM. Three of the
16 RCAs were created and trained by the PIDD, related directly to the segments improved. RCAs’
routine road maintenance activities are supervised by the DAGPCH Department of Public Works
(DPW). Periodic, more extensive maintenance (every 3-5 years) is also conducted by the DPW
and securing adequate budget is essential. The Provincial Government has created and is now
levying a fee on vehicle license plates to fund roads O&M, which is expected to benefit PIDD-
financed roads. The road works were completed by 2012 and the Bank’s subsequent physical
supervision/inspection of these segments up through project closing showed them to be in excellent
condition with RCAs and DPW fulfilling their responsibilities including cleaning of culverts, as
water is the critical element in mountainous areas, not heavy truck traffic. Construction quality is
good, the roads are considered robust and signage is well-located and clear. The contrast between
the before and after situations is marked.

2.5.3       Sustaining capacity: Workshops conducted at closing highlighted the PIDD’s impacts
on capacity, both internal within DAGPCH and in the wider consulting community. Financial
management, procurement and safeguards capacity-building boosted institutional and professional


20The systems belong to the communities and their WUAs, who have statutes and legal powers to grant water concessions.
DAGPCH under the Constitution of 2008 and territorial planning laws, executes irrigation and roads projects to improve
productivity and access to new markets with its own resources. The DAGPCH maintains legal responsibility for the
investment for 6 or 7 years beyond its completion. DAGPCH does not conduct a formal handover to users since the latter,
through their financial and physical support, are implicitly empowered in regard to systems.


                                                         14
modernization; sustaining those skills is recognized as key to further successful engagement with
the Bank and other IFIs, but also to the ability of such professionals to shape capacity development
in the wider provincial economy. The fact that the EOP was embedded in a line agency and that
its core staff was seconded to the project and has since devolved back into the new DAGPCH
Irrigation Department and/or is supporting the IDB and other operations, suggests that acquired
capacity has been institutionalized. No performance indicators were established to monitor the
project ex-post, but the Bank team is confident that M&E per se, for broader DAGPCH purposes,
will be sustained due to the project experience and demonstrated benefits, and the M&E needs of
other development activities.

2.5.4        Follow-on operation: A new Bank loan of US$60.0 m is proposed for a project of
national scope, focused on the Central Sierra (including Chimborazo) and Coastal regions of
Ecuador, to “enhance the profitability and sustainable production of small and medium farmers in
targeted areas by improving productivity and by supporting more efficient and climate-smart uses
for land and water”. The new project builds on the PIDD, takes its lessons into account in project
design, is consistent with the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Ecuador for the period 2014-
2015, and targets three strategic areas: sustainable and inclusive growth, access to social protection
and quality services, and the country’s National Plan for Good Living. The proposed operation is
a framework program supporting demand-based provincial investment subprojects to strengthen
the sustainable modernization and intensification of agricultural systems for small and medium-
sized family farms. Importantly, the new project plans to work with PIDD beneficiaries to further
support and consolidate their transition to modern farming.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1         Relevance of objectives: The objectives, design and implementation of the PIDD were
and remain highly relevant to country priorities and the Bank’s assistance strategy. The PIDD
sought to increase production and market access through better roads and irrigation systems, using
equitable, inclusive, participatory decision-making and a framework of technical, social and
institutional support. As such, it remains consistent with the institutional objectives of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAGAP) National Irrigation Plan (2012-2017). The Plan stresses
improving the lives of farmers and rural communities through social inclusion and links to
national/international markets as well as access to the benefits of improved infrastructure and
services, and modernized farming methods/practices. Further, the Bank’s Interim Strategy Note
(ISN) for Ecuador (April 9, 2013) identifies agriculture and rural development as ongoing, key
priorities for both the Government and the Bank.

3.1.2       Relevance of design and implementation: Targeting and financing the PDO at the
sub-national level was and remains consistent with the 2008 Constitution. The relevance of PIDD
design and implementation is underlined by its having been adopted by the DAGPCH as the
model/methodology for all similar development interventions in that province, its influence on the
design of the proposed new Bank intervention, and on IDB’s current operation in Chimborazo, the
Rural Development Investment Program (PIDR).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives21

3.2.1       Overview: The PIDD proved critical to the Bank’s engagement in Ecuador, setting the
model and tone for financing at the sub-national level, and maintaining a degree of normalcy even
when no new operations were being approved and the CPS dialogue was moribund. The
challenging political and physical context, the struggle to launch the project simultaneously with
securing and training essential human resources, and the complex methodology, all exerted an
influence on the investment aspects. The PIDD’s impacts went beyond the physical and productive
sought by the PDO. Its “soft” outcomes - policy and planning instruments, inclusive development
and conflict resolution, and capacity-building – were also important. The PIDD was crucial for
Chimborazo Province, reflected in the amount of provincial counterpart funding provided by a very
poor province, exceeding appraisal estimates by US$650,000 after a slow start. In this complex
scenario, the leadership of the provincial Prefect was consistent and a crucial determinant of
outcomes.

3.2.2       The assessment of efficacy is based primarily on the restructured indicators as reported
in the Final Impact Evaluation (Carrasco 2013/14) supported by collateral findings from the
Intermediate Impact Evaluation (Carrasco, 2012). As noted in 2.4, several relevant indicators were
dropped by the Restructuring and thus data was only collected up to 2012, but they suggest positive
outcomes. Results below are presented selectively, based on relevance to the intervention logic of
the PDO. Complete results are presented in the Data Sheet and Annex 2 and the evaluation narrative
is summarized in Annex 5.

Objective 1: Increased production through investments in irrigation

3.2.3        This objective was achieved and is rated Satisfactory: The primary results indicator
was “beneficiaries’ annual agricultural production value has increased at least 10% on average in
constant prices”. The target was exceeded, with an average increase of 64% by closing, over the
55 systems. The cumulative value of agricultural production pre-PIDD was US$5.3 m and post-
PIDD – with improved irrigation efficiency and training in modern irrigation techniques – was
US$8.7 m. At the farm level, 7,867 PIDD beneficiaries’ average value of production was US$1,177
by closing – up from US$880 at Baseline. In comparison, the average production value of a Control
Group of families with very similar characteristics but who had not benefited from irrigation
investments was US$863 by end-project (see Annex 5). For attribution purposes, the ICR
acknowledges - but has not measured - the importance of external elements pushing productive
outcomes including the commodities boom of this period which is likely to have affected
production decisions even in Chimborazo, and associated increased value of production in real
terms. However, controlling for price between baseline and final impact implies that production
volumes increased, driven by a 53% relative increase in water distribution efficiency on 51 (of 55)
systems surveyed, resulting from project-financed works, the WUAs’ use of an effective irrigation
calendar, and to training provided on the productive use of irrigation and its administration,
operation and maintenance. 22 Higher production can also be inferred from an estimated 6,240
additional, permanent jobs stemming from the 25% expansion of area cultivated (from 4,500 ha to
6,000 ha over 55 systems) as well as 562 ha (13.6%) expansion of area irrigated, multiple/rotational


21  As the Restructuring of the Results Indicators was a Level Two - not approved by the “original approving authority
that approved the loan”, not involving changes to the PDO, and not considered a “formal revision” as defined by/for
purposes of the ICR Guidelines Appendix B - a split assessment of outcome was not conducted.
22   These plots were the nexus for all project productive TA with surrounding farmers brought in for instruction. Most
demonstration farmers did not replicate their technology package into a second cycle/year but wider replication of
selected elements of packages was common.

                                                         16
cropping of the same unit of land depending on the type of crop, increasing demand for permanent
labor, as determined by the costs of production of the crops incorporated into the new areas and
other factors (Carrasco, 2014). Yields increased an average 37.5% on the 77 demonstration plots
within 55 systems and frequent, independent external replication of key elements of the
demonstration packages was noted by researchers. Finally, area devoted to higher value crops
increased 33.2% (versus targeted 15%), representing an additional 471 ha – including alfalfa, corn,
onion, tomato, potato and lima bean - following PIDD irrigation investments through June 2012
(an indicator dropped by the Restructuring).

Objective 2: Increased market access through investment in road improvements

3.2.4        This objective was achieved and is rated Satisfactory: The primary indicator called
for a “30% reduction in average travel time on 50.4 km of roads that are rehabilitated and turned
into all-weather roads”. An estimated 27,500 families, 387% of the revised target, benefited directly
from PIDD road works. Well-maintained, safer, all-weather asphalted roads reduced average travel
time by 38.3% over Baseline. Farmers stated that the basic physical conditions for moving product
to market had improved: 50.4 km of road improvements along key stretches, with complementary
rehabilitation of connector roads, completed strategic ring roads vital to regional agricultural
production and marketing. An important PAD indicator (measured by the Intermediate Evaluation
but dropped by the 2012 Restructuring) also shows that 2,615 families had increased their net
commercial sales with aggregate sales value rising from US$726,000 at Baseline to US$1.1 million
by June 2012, prompted by improved road access, irrigation-related production gains and rising
market prices. Transit rates and tonnage carried, especially of trucks and vans, increased on all
three segments. Vehicle O&M costs decreased 55% over Baseline on the 50.4 km of improved
roads, a significant factor for small farmers trying to limit marketing and transportation costs.
Beneficiaries surveyed stressed that improved access via road upgrades went beyond markets to
include schools, health services, access to work opportunities and tourism. Inspection of these roads
at closing showed that trained RCAs were fulfilling their O&M responsibilities, cleaning culverts,
clearing fallen vegetation, removing obstacles and general emergency work especially in the rainy
season. Roads remained in excellent condition several years after their completion in early 2012,
demonstrating the high value of routine maintenance in mountainous terrain.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1       The model used to evaluate benefits of the 55 irrigation investments benefiting about
7,867 farm families consisted of estimating the net present value (NPV) of the highest agricultural
production resulting from greater water availability (Marginal Productivity Method). Water is
viewed as an intermediate input in agricultural production and is based on the principle that the
farmer maximizes his benefits using water (as with any other productive input) up to the point
where the net marginal income generated to utilize one additional unit of water is equal to the
marginal cost of obtaining this additional unit.

3.3.2        The methodology applied to evaluate benefits of the 50.4 km of improved roads –
38.3% decrease in travel time, 55% decrease in vehicle O&M costs – considers transportation as
an economic good for which there is user demand demonstrated by willingness to pay for these
trips, and a supply represented by the cost incurred in making them. The economic and financial
analysis considered two direct benefits: (i) decrease in the cost of vehicle O&M between the with-
project compared to without-project due to improved yields and useful life; and, (ii) decreased costs
in terms of the time taken to make the trip between the with-project and without- project situation,



                                                 17
since users are able to arrive at their destination using less time. A minimum cost analysis also
quantified the cost per beneficiary for roads investments.

3.3.3         The table below presents the results of the economic evaluation compared to appraisal
estimates. The Irrigation sub-component generated a net present value (NPV) of US$15.77 m with
an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 29.30%, reflecting increased productivity per hectare and the
increase in area irrigated. The Road Improvement sub-component shows a negative NPV of minus
US$5.39 m due to the economic evaluation being unable to compensate for the high initial
investment. This evaluation took into account reduced travel times and vehicle O&M costs, along
with a cost per beneficiary of US$26.30/person – considered reasonable for similar roads
investments - but did not incorporate other difficult to measure but valuable benefits stemming
from greater connectivity and access to markets and services. See Annex 3. The table below shows
final results compared to appraisal estimates.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1       The overall rating takes into account the following conclusions:

       Relevance: High. The objectives, design and implementation of the PIDD were and
        remain highly relevant to country and provincial priorities as well as the Bank’s assistance
        strategy. Also, to reiterate, DAGPCH has adopted the model/methodology for all similar
        interventions including those financed by other IFIs operating in the province, e.g., IDB’s
        scaled up project in Chimborazo Province based on the Additional Financing proposed in
        2012.
       Achievement of PDO: Satisfactory. The combination of improved irrigation and resulting
        productive gains combined with better access as measured by time and maintenance
        savings on modernized roads, along with improved transit rates and tonnage carried
        especially by vans and trucks, indicates that the PDO was achieved. Results are compared
        with a Baseline, and with a Control Group where relevant.
       Efficiency: Satisfactory. The overall project IRR is positive at 18.51%. The Net Present
        Value on irrigation investments beat appraisal estimates despite higher unit costs and show
        robust prospects through the useful life of the investments. This aggregate masks the
        negative returns on the roads investments, explained by the high initial investment not
        being matched by benefit value. However, in addition to the analysis in Annex 3, road
        works were completed to a high standard, costs per beneficiary were reasonable when
        compared to similar regional projects (see Annex 3), RCAs were trained and are clearly
        active, and the analysis does not account for the additional road works indirectly prompted
        by the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

                                                18
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1         Poverty impacts: Evidence of increased incomes from increased productivity and
sales, better access to markets and social services, and direct evidence of new job creation suggest
that the PIDD had an impact on poverty. A small but growing number of farmers started to grow
organic products and were already selling to the Supermaxi chain of supermarkets in local centers.
The Baseline (2010) showed that 53% of water users lacked jobs, whereas by 2014 65% of those
who participated in the PIDD irrigation investments were employed.

3.5.2        Gender: Women’s participation, while not a core project theme, showed promising
gains and was a key element in the management of irrigation systems and in road maintenance.
Some 1,687 female-headed households were direct beneficiaries of the 55 irrigation systems.
Women gained space, traction and regard through their leadership of WUAs and through their
participation in the RCAs, stepping outside traditional roles. The project could have done a better
job of documenting women’s participation including small, site-specific case studies. Missions
repeatedly requested that the implementation unit build a profile on women’s participation but
progress was modest.

3.5.3        Social development: The PIDD developed a methodology for irrigation and roads
interventions under which users voluntarily provided financial and/or physical support and
collective management and, in the case of irrigation established calendars to improve the efficiency
and equity of water usage. The project fostered good governance, requiring that users have a current
water concession permitting consumption and that they be fully informed re their rights and
responsibilities. Communities socially monitored the performance of contractors. The project was
seen/used successfully as an instrument for conflict resolution/reduction through its regulation of
water flow and installation of meters, its focus on catchments and geo-referencing of all systems
financed, and on adherence to modern standards and rules. The experience also showed the need
for convergence between technical oversight and social themes to ensure more systematic
experiences to guide future public water policy and, continuous support to users of both roads and
irrigation systems, especially beyond the construction stage.

3.5.4        Farmer/rural organizations were effectively strengthened by training the WUAs and
by the social organization of communities. The PIDD reactivated local organizations and promoted
internal cohesion through organized, collective work on their systems (mingas). By closing, the
concept and rationale for payment for water services had taken hold in all WUAs although the
amounts paid were not always adequate to fully cover costs including replacements. This needs
greater awareness-building, incentives and training. Communities also reported that their daily diet
had improved through more plentiful supply and diversity of vegetables, and that migrants were
returning to their communities of origin, attracted by the possibility of regular work and better
economic conditions. Out-migration had slowed. 23 Contracting of a social specialist was seriously
delayed but the impacts were evident in more frequent meetings of communities to discuss project-
related issues. Valuable grassroots work was done throughout by trained project social promoters
from the localities, speaking kichwa.



23  Emigration from Ecuador in the 1990s and early 2000s especially to Europe was high but dwindled when the global
economic crisis hit. Migrants returned to Ecuador for a combination of reasons including better economic conditions
and work opportunities in their homeland and/or the sheer need to leave Europe and elsewhere. Attribution of reverse
migration to the PIDD can only be partial.


                                                        19
3.5.5        Indigenous peoples: The PIDD was a “vector” for indigenous inclusion. Some 76%
of all PIDD irrigation beneficiaries (5,925 families) were indigenous. Of the 55 systems, 41 were
in indigenous communities. The PIDD’s focus on indigenous participation reduced conflicts and
raised the profile of indigenous communities and indigenous women specifically.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.6        Strengthening institutional capacity was a challenge and the Bank team, supported by
FAO specialists, invested much time, close guidance and mentoring to DAGPCH throughout. The
end result was considerable success in the project’s “soft” outcomes at all levels. The project
technical team turned over several times but the institution learned and responded to new,
international norms, cutting the processing time for many procedures. But it took time to grasp the
overall logic of the project, especially compliance with high standards for procurement and
financial management. The institution finally developed the expertise, logistics, technical capacity
and knowledge to leverage resources for and implement similar projects. It also developed a
“culture of participation” through the PIDD’s cost-sharing requirements and participatory decision-
making. The project’s technical demands helped develop a small but well-trained group of
consultants and contractors which did not exist before. Similarly, a cohort of community-based
promoters acquired and consolidated experience from repeated application of
surveys/questionnaires - starting with the 2010 Baseline - supporting the M&E program.

3.5.7        Beneficiary/local management of basic infrastructure through the strengthened WUAs
and RCAs was another significant achievement, demonstrating that the transfer of maintenance
responsibilities to private organizations and promoting partnerships with public agencies as in the
case of roads can be an efficient and effective strategy. The WUAs were trained, including through
preparing an updated list of actual users of respective systems, hours and shifts for operators,
internal rules for administration and O&M differentiated according to land tenancy typology, and
internal consensus on monthly payments. Tariffs varied from US$1.00/month to US$10/month,
and maintenance was joint using “mingas”. The RCAs are legally constituted under public
standards and have generated jobs for 68 people. Longer-term budget support for sustaining the
roads maintenance framework cannot be predicted but is considered likely.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.8        Job creation was strong, albeit not an explicit project objective. An estimated 6,240
additional, permanent jobs were created (Carrasco, 2014). Irrigation permitted an expansion of area
cultivated, and rotational cropping of the same unit of land depending on the type of crop,
increasing demand for permanent labor, as determined by the costs of production of the crops
incorporated into the new areas and other factors.

3.5.9       JSDF-financed feasibility and engineering studies provided the catalyst to the
Central Government’s financing of the Riobamba-Cebadas segment, while project analysis
prompted the leveraging of additional financing for the Tunshi-San Nicolas road, totaling an
additional 77 km over the 50.4 km target attributable directly or indirectly to the project.

3.5.10      Some 77 demonstration plots were financed versus the 15 originally planned,
increasing the opportunities for dissemination of better technologies and farming practices. As
noted by Carrasco (2014), demonstration farmers did not adopt those technologies independently
into a second cycle most likely due to a combination of cost and lack of access to technical

                                                20
assistance (paid by the project in the first cycle). However, there were numerous examples of wider-
ranging replication of segments of the demonstrated technical packages, e.g., use of sprinkler
irrigation, improved pasture management and rotation in larger systems, and the preparation and
use of agro-ecological fertilizers and pesticides (bioles).

3.5.11       Inter-institutional coordination exceeded expectations. In several irrigation systems,
MAGAP provided training in organic production and for alternative markets. Entities such as
FEDEXPO and INIAP supported the introduction of high value crops (strawberry, citrus, avocado)
to inject greater dynamism into local production. Commitments were reached with SENAGUA to
further strengthen water resources management in PIDD-financed systems through social,
territorial and cultural practices, developing water resource inventories and water quality studies
designed to improve provincial water planning and policy-making. DAGPCH also developed a
close relationship with the National Irrigation Institute (INAR) given revised responsibilities and
competencies at the provincial level expected under the anticipated, new National Water Law.

3.5.12       The PIDD methodology was a key element in project development. It was seen as
a process of social construction within each organization starting with a consensus on normally
highly conflictive issues, progressively forming alliances fortifying mutual confidence between
actors. There was a high degree of satisfaction and consequent flow of counterpart funding,
overcoming certain negative externalities such as public and private institutions supplying similar
benefits to other, non-PIDD communities without a counterpart requirement from beneficiaries.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1        Final impact evaluation: The impact evaluation studies used interviews of sampled,
randomly-selected families. The main findings are reported in the Data Sheet, discussed in Section
3.2 and in Annexes 2 and 5. Results met or exceeded key targets in most cases and are not reiterated
here. Satisfaction levels were high across the 55 systems: over 94% of surveyed beneficiaries were
very content/content.

3.6.2        Stakeholder workshop: The project organized a final workshop in Riobamba in June
2014 to disseminate the main lessons and impacts and determine how they might be multiplied.
Attendance was diverse including many beneficiary leaders and authorities from other provinces
interested in a similar operation. Participants stressed the improved communication between local
authorities and communities and better, overall understanding of sustainable land use and
management, and the impact of technology. Beneficiaries also described the benefits of improved
roads including access to health and education services, markets and tourism. Local authorities
stressed the capacity-building impacts including preparedness for other development interventions.
The workshop findings are summarized in a DAGPCH publication “Rendicion de Cuentas” and a
video produced for broad dissemination.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1 The Moderate rating for risk to development outcome is based on the following:

Irrigation: The key factors indicative of promising sustainability are: 72% of WUAs over 55
systems were collecting adequate user fees, and 88.3% of the final 17 systems




                                                21
completed/analyzed; 24 by closing 88% of the WUAs had been trained to manage, operate and
maintain those systems and understood the need to collect sufficient fees from users. DAGPCH
was still training the remaining 12% using the PIDD’s standardized training approach; trained
community promoters effectively socialized beneficiaries by building awareness about the
organized, equitable management of systems and link to long-term sustainability; the Bank urged
consideration of incentives, e.g., increasing the supply of training and support for agro-livestock
development in exchange for better fee collection rates; analysis of financed irrigation systems
suggests that financial flows are robust even with significant declines in benefits, and the systems
are economically viable; and, a proposed follow-on Bank operation intends to work with PIDD
beneficiaries on more complex irrigated agricultural activities including the marketing phase which
should provide continuity and reduce uncertainty.

Technical: Technical sustainability naturally entails some uncertainty: Demonstration plots
successfully showed the productive benefits of more efficient irrigation systems and selective,
independent replication/adoption of certain elements of those packages (beyond the demonstration
plots) did occur: adoption of sprinkler irrigation, improved management and rotation of pasture in
larger systems, and the widespread preparation and use of agro-ecological fertilizers and pesticides
(bioles) were common. However, the kind of intensive TA/training delivered by a project in a
demonstration setting is not necessarily replicable ex-post and depends on factors such as
institutions and budgets to achieve/promote more wholesale adoption of modern “packages”.

Roads: Confidence is promoted by: experience since road works were completed in 2012 which
shows that maintenance practices have been good and roads are in excellent condition after almost
three years and difficult climatic conditions. The main uncertainty is recurrent budget for
DAGPCH/DPW’s responsibilities/share of the O&M burden; trained RCAs are complying with
their O&M responsibilities and the methodological soundness of the public/private approach has
been verified. Increased occupancy of currently idle vehicle capacity, and confidence regarding
likely budget allocations for rural roads, would reduce residual uncertainty.

Institutions and policies: The availability of hard data demonstrating results – and at two data
points - prompted DAGPCH’s adoption of the PIDD’s basic methodology as a policy for other
development efforts, and provides the new Bank operation under preparation with a foundation for
scaling up PIDD’s core framework/approach country-wide and expanding its scope. Both national
and provincial rural development policies remain fully-supportive of the PIDD’s objectives,
targeted beneficiaries and the works implemented. PIDD-trained specialist staff have been
absorbed into the new DAGPCH Irrigation Unit and DPW and a well-trained/experienced, albeit
small, group of contractors and consultants is now available.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




24 The data difference between the 55 systems and the final 17 evaluated is that as the project team over time gained

experience and a more organized approach and methodology for training the WUAs, which is reflected in the even better
O&M performance - especially payment of water fees proportional to usage - of those trained later in the project.


                                                        22
5.1.1        The Bank team calibrated project design to the expressed priorities of targeted
beneficiaries and to Bank and Government strategies. The project’s comparatively long gestation
resulted in an improved design, simplified and aligned to real needs and the expressed priorities of
beneficiaries and the provincial leadership. Project design was structurally simple – acknowledging
the critical developmental relationship between roads and agriculture, especially in the Sierra
region - but complex technically and institutionally. There was sufficient flexibility to adapt as
needed and important ex-ante studies helped accelerate implementation, especially of road works
and despite unanticipated changes requested by government. The Bank team made a conscious
decision to focus on off-farm works and to use demonstration plots to encourage replication of
modernized technologies, mainly on the grounds of cost and O&M complexity, but this required a
stronger analysis of what would motivate small farmers to invest in/adopt superior practices both
during and beyond the life of the project. The scheduling of project activities - at least irrigation
works - was unrealistic but that is explained by lack of familiarity with how the participatory
methodology would play out on the ground. The main caveat on quality at entry was flawed cost
estimates for irrigation systems making key targets unachievable and restructuring essential. In
addition, the Results Framework developed for the project was inadequate.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2        The Bank conducted 12 implementation support missions from headquarters over six
years and the Bank’s Quito office maintained open communication with the Borrower. Missions
were well-staffed and meticulously reported with strong support from Bank Quito-based staff. The
project had five Task Team Leaders (TTL), four of which during implementation but supervision
quality remained strong/proactive. FAO/CP consultants provided valuable continuity and technical
training in key project activity lines. Field oversight of works was thorough and demonstrated a
consistent, problem-solving approach designed to support the DAGPCH team and beneficiaries in
ensuring quality works and strengthening capacity. Supervision of financial management and
procurement was intensive – all missions included FM and Procurement specialists; analysis was
detailed with time-bound action plans and close follow-up. The Bank team understood the effort
needed for a provincial entity to become familiar with and execute efficiently Bank fiduciary
requirements, and consistently provided assistance. Safeguards supervision was regular, well-
reported and followed up with a strong focus on environmental and social safeguards. The Bank
team shares credit - with the client - for ensuring a complete and well-designed evaluation
framework with good quality products, a better outcome than many, more experienced Bank clients.
The ICR delivery date was extended by one month to January 30, 2015 primarily to finalize the
processing and incorporation of Control Group analysis – for which field work was conducted in
October and November 2014 - into the final impact evaluation to boost the accuracy of ICR
conclusions regarding outcomes. Two deficiencies in supervision are acknowledged: (i) the 19
month delay in approving the Restructuring after its initial diagnosis by the MTR, explained in
footnote 8); and (ii) lack of reporting on the GEF, explained primarily by lack of synchrony in the
implementation schedule – the PIDD was under finalization and the GEF was barely underway in
the field - and by the Bank’s contribution not entailing any new activities additional to what was
originally planned. However, due to these two deficiencies in supervision, and the fact that the
project did become a Problem Project at one point during implementation, the quality of Bank
supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                 23
5.1.4       Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The team adopted a
pragmatic, lessons- and strategy-based approach to project preparation, marred by errors in cost-
estimation/analysis and certain other flaws. Implementation support was of generally good quality
and the team was focused on finding solutions, enhancing project outcomes and building capacity,
laying the foundation for Chimborazo’s further productive engagement with the development
community. However, certain shortcomings in supervision frequency and the project’s problem
status reduce the rating to MS. Rating both dimensions as MS results in an overall Bank rating of
MS, notwithstanding the project Outcome rating of Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1        The Provincial Government, under the exceptionally able leadership of the Prefect,
supported the project from the outset, setting the pace by ensuring that it was consistent with
national and provincial strategies and the priorities of rural people including the most vulnerable.
A determination to adhere to cultural norms through innovative methodological features paid off.
The Prefect and his Government’s staunch advocacy of the project and role in building ownership
and momentum were crucial, sustaining the Bank’s confidence both in the project and the Borrower,
as well as the national government’s willingness to guarantee the Bank loan. Nonetheless, the
relationships/events at the national level were very limited. Government’s counterpart funding
performance was satisfactory throughout, exceeding appraisal estimates. Government has already
institutionalized and mainstreamed the methodology, and has moved forward rapidly to build on
the PIDD through new rural development projects. Government’s performance is rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2        At the implementation level, the project implementation unit struggled to gain the skills
and traction needed to execute a project with demanding fiduciary requirements and time schedule,
while coping with repeated staff turnover and related issues. The overall experience can be seen as
an eight-year mutual learning process with valuable direct and indirect impacts. Even by mid-term,
as demonstrated by evaluation surveys, important results were evident. The shortage of provincial
technical specialists/contractors should be understood in context and the unit made every effort to
respond to project needs. M&E performance was exceptionally good, as described above. An
extension of only nine months was needed, primarily to complete several large-scale irrigation
systems, and the project met/exceeded its key targets. Performance of the project unit is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3       The sound analytical rationale for this project and strong provincial
support/leadership were instrumental in the project’s ultimate success. Provincial
authorities knew what rural families needed and framed the project accordingly, reining
in a larger and more diffuse initial concept to one they could support and execute.
Distinct from the project’s many successes – evidence of the substantial learning process
which occurred – is the Borrower’s sense of empowerment and its strengthened mandate,
stemming directly from hard-won institutional growth and being able to
compare/demonstrate, through its excellent M&E performance, conditions at the outset

                                                 24
and what project investments were capable of delivering. The overall Satisfactory rating
for Borrower performance – given                                     MS and S ratings for
the two dimensions - derives from the Satisfactory rating for project Outcome.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1         The PIDD generated a substantial body of lessons including: the capacity of a sub-
national government in a poor province to implement a successful investment operation under
challenging physical, technical and institutional conditions; the use of public/private partnerships
for basic road maintenance; the incentives needed to promote payment for water and a shift to
higher-value farming; and, the ongoing validation of combining physical investments with
capacity-building using inclusive, participatory methodologies. Given that these/related lessons are
by now well-understood Bank-wide, the ICR presents lessons which are more fundamental to this
project even while having global importance.

             Leadership and ownership: This project thrived in large part because of a dynamic,
well-connected leader who championed its goals, “owned” the methodology, understood the
project’s strategic context, saw the longer-term potential for his province of working successfully
with the Bank, and consistently advocated/argued the project’s merits nationally and locally despite
significant difficulties in Bank-country relations for much of the project period. He understood the
importance of beneficiaries’ becoming personally invested in their irrigation systems and roads,
requiring cash contributions as a logical step in cementing their ownership. The fact that the PIDD
had five TTLs and four Sector Leaders yet was able to maintain course and succeed was also linked
– at least partly - to the Prefect’s ability to convene stakeholders in a sense of common purpose.
The potential downside in the global sense is the implications of a discontinuity of such leadership
but this does not detract from the lesson that leadership matters, and projects need to find and
cultivate leaders and champions at all levels.

            Monitoring and evaluation: The products of project M&E were unusually complete,
exceeding many larger, national and sub-national projects with extensive track records of
engagement with the Bank and leaving a database which is already proving valuable for further
investment planning. Such performance requires complete buy-in to a coherent progression of
research/reporting throughout, on the part of both the Borrower and the Bank teams. The permanent
presence of an M&E specialist in the implementation unit is essential not only to the products
generated but instilling the idea of M&E and institutionalizing its practices. A key contributing
factor was the continuity of the consulting firm initially contracted to conduct the Baseline study,
then going on to prepare all subsequent evaluations. Finally, in this case also, the Prefect wanted to
know the results of the project and cared about its impacts.

             Indirect benefits and key transformations: The indirect benefits of a well-conceived
investment operation can be considerable and important. In this case, the strong emphasis on local
institutional capacity-building based on standards, rules, rights and responsibilities had a marked
impact on reducing conflict among irrigator communities, liberating them to focus on agricultural
advancement rather than the constant and corrosive struggle for water. Similarly, while not a core
project goal, employment creation was the natural offshoot of providing families with the means to
expand agricultural production and hire labor. Road improvements opened up access to schools,
health clinics, tourism and external job opportunities. The inclusive, participatory methodology
successfully increased the visibility of indigenous families and women. These transformations were
not formally described at appraisal but emerged from the combination of investment and well-
planned capacity-building activities, the hard and soft elements of a good project.

                                                 25
            Technical transformation and behavior change: Demonstration plots showed
farmers the productive impacts of modern farming techniques and there was selective adoption in
the wider communities. However, the necessary conditions for promoting a larger shift to higher
value crops require careful attention to the incentives: what will motivate small farmers to change
their behavior and invest in/adopt superior practices once out on their own without the intensive
support of a project? The design, content and delivery – including culturally appropriate social
mobilization behind and communicating the desirability of change – along with reliable, continuous
technical and financial support, market intelligence, and productive organization and
entrepreneurship, are basic pre-requisites to secure farmer buy-in.

     B. Key Outputs by Component

Component 1: Productive Investments (total cost US$20.5 m; Bank US$13.2 m, 63.9%)

2.2          This component supported two critical productive infrastructure systems essential to
the local rural economy – irrigation rehabilitation and road improvement. Selected roads ran
through major irrigation areas covered by the project in most cases. Several targeted irrigation areas
were outside the scope of the selected roads. It should be noted that road segments for project
investment were pre-defined at appraisal (then revised immediately after project effectiveness) but
irrigation infrastructure sites were to be defined during implementation, although the types of
systems to be rehabilitated were defined ex-ante.

Sub-component 1.1: Irrigation Improvements (US$12.1 m; Bank US$9.0 m, 74.4%)

2.3          This sub-component financed the rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation
systems and the strengthening of Water User Associations (WUA) in operation, maintenance and
administration of those systems. Irrigation subprojects (SP) were to be a mix of works (80% of
cost) – mainly canal linings, water intake structures, and small regulating reservoirs - and
training/institutional strengthening (20%). Training would improve the organizational, financial
and administrative capacity of the WUAs, technical aspects of O&M, irrigation and cultivation
techniques for crops including high value, and processing and marketing capacity. The project
intended to finance only off-farm irrigation improvements, except for a planned 15 demonstration
areas/parcels designed to promote modernized on-farm irrigation practices.

2.4         Eligibility for financing: This required that a proposed SP: (i) have total cost
<US$500,000 and a subsidy <US$2,500/farmer; (ii) be identified using participatory methods; (iii)
be managed by a legally registered WUA; (iv) have an updated water concession; (v) use acceptable
design standards; (vi) comply with social and environmental safeguards; (vii) be financially and
economically viable; and (viii) comply with project cost-sharing rules. 25 A priority-setting
mechanism would be used to select SPs in cases where the number of eligible SPs exceeded the
annual budget allocated to the sub-component.




25
  Cost sharing rules: (i) 10% cash contribution to feasibility studies (Provincial Government to finance the
balance) plus contributions in time and participation in their preparation; and (ii) 20% of the cost of civil
works (in labor) and min. 5% of their cost in cash.

2.5          Table 2 shows substantial variation in the share of investment by Canton with
Riobamba and Guamote securing the greatest share, but with the former investing in smaller, lower
cost systems compared to Cumanda for example where cost per family and cost per hectare were
significantly higher than all other locations. The matrix in Appendix 1 shows a summary of the 55
irrigation investments including a description of the works financed for each system.

2.6          Table 3 and graphic show the marked increase in efficiency of water delivery and
distribution as a result of PIDD investments with some easing of the trend between 2012 and 2014
but still well above the baseline. Efficiency improved some 25.5 percentage points over baseline
and in relative terms by 53%.

2.7          Demonstration plots: The project established 77 demonstration plots of around 3,000-
5,000 m2 each - depending on the characteristics of the plot sizes of the different systems - on
individual farmers’ land, exceeding the original target of 15. Recipients of demonstration plots
were selected by demand and with the community’s agreement. Potential candidates were screened
by the project for interest and willingness to pay the 5% producer counterpart. Some systems
received more than one demonstration plot due to interest in participating, relatively low cost
(mostly project-funded), and community agreement. Surrounding farmers were brought in for
technical assistance. While there was virtually no replication of the technical package per se on the
demonstration plots for reasons including the cost of TA (provided free under the project), there
was ample evidence of independent replication by other farmers of specific elements of the
packages, e.g., use of sprinkler irrigation, improved management and rotation of pasture in the
larger systems, and the preparation and use of agro-ecological fertilizers and pesticides (bioles).

2.8         Table 5 shows that before PIDD intervention, the area irrigated was 89% of area
cropped and post-PIDD, 97%. The total area irrigated by 55 systems increased 562 ha (and 227 ha
within the 17 systems studied for the final evaluation). Total area cropped by project beneficiaries
(whether irrigated or not) increased significantly from around 4,500 ha to about 6,000 ha by end-
project. As shown below, the value of agricultural production increased 64% in constant prices.

gap between needs and collections. At that time, five of the 19 systems were not collecting
sufficient fees to cover O&M costs. Similar data was not collected at end-project for the 55 systems.

Sub-component 1.2: Road Improvements (US$8.3 m; Bank US$4.2 m, 50.6%)

2.11         This sub-component planned to rehabilitate the Riobamba-San Luis-Punin-Flores-
Cebadas provincial road (referred to as the Riobamba-Cebadas Road) of about 35 km, and improve
the Charicando-San Patricio-Turubamba rural road (referred to as the Charicando-Turubamba road)
of about 25.5 km.28 These roads were selected based on a priority road matrix under the Provincial
Participatory Roads Plan, conducted in 2003. This sub-component was expected to benefit mainly
local residents, predominantly engaged in agriculture and living near the roads, as well as other
roads users including transport companies. The localities affected by the selected roads had at
appraisal a total population of about 70,000 (15,600 families). Investment activities included the
rehabilitation and improvement of the roads mentioned, plus their maintenance, as well as simple
rehabilitation of major local roads connecting to them.

2.12         Revised project roads plan: Just prior to project effectiveness (June 2008), the
Borrower announced that the National Government planned to finance the Riobamba-Cebadas road
(35 km) under its US$100 m National Emergency Road Plan and that US$10 m had already been
allocated and a private contractor selected. It is important to note that the JSDF-funded feasibility
studies facilitated government’s efforts. However, this decision required that PIDD road funds be
reallocated to other roads identified by the Plan, and new feasibility studies. Substitute roads
selected were: Charicando-Cocan-La Dolorosa; Cubijies-Quimiag-Puchulcahuan; Via Flores-Y de
Achullay; and, Via Tunshi-San Nicolas but the latter was dropped due to the need for variances
which could have triggered Safeguard OP4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). The target for total roads
rehabilitated/improved (including Charicando –Turubamba) became 50.4 km, formalized by the
2012 restructuring.

2.13         Roads maintenance would be conducted by the Chimborazo Provincial Council
(CHPC) and contracted Routine Road Maintenance Micro-enterprises (MEMR, later referred to as
Road Maintenance Associations) using counterpart funds, and ex-post, provincial budget
allocations. At appraisal, there were 15 MEMRs working for the CHPC and the project planned to
create another six to service the selected roads, and to strengthen all 21.




28
  The original RF called for improvements to 125 km of rural roads but the source of this target was not
explained.

Outputs:

2.14         The PIDD financed all planned segments within the planned period and budget agreed
by the 2012 Restructuring. Oversight of the RCAs’ routine road maintenance is being conducted
by the DAGPCH Department of Public Works. The PIDD created three new RCAs (Road
Conservation Associations) associated with the roads actually rehabilitated, and strengthened 16
(including the three new units) leveraging project training to have broader coverage of the
maintenance of about 218 km (including the three segments totaling 50.4 km improved by the
project). See Table 8.

Component 2: Project Management (US$1.7 m; Bank US$1.4 m, 82.3%)

2.15        This component sought to ensure the efficient and effective coordination and
management of the project within the existing structure of the CHPC; an adequate M&E system;
and a communications strategy – to be designed and launched within the first six months - to
disseminate project activities, progress and results to stakeholders, as an instrument to facilitate the
supervision and social accountability of the project. Specialized technical assistance would be
delivered through a Coordinator, involving the contracting of consultants/sector specialists to
strengthen CHPC’s technical capacity. Independent annual audits were also required.


Outputs:

2.16         In addition to the Project Coordinator, DAGPCH selected and recruited 14 consultants
specialized in accounting, procurement, irrigation, irrigate agriculture, social work, monitoring and
evaluation, environment and project administration. Their recruitment was difficult due to the lack
of qualified professionals with appropriate technical profiles at the provincial level and most were
contracted well after the initial six month deadline.

2.17         The project designed a system for the physical and financial monitoring of project
activities (MIS) but it did not become operational. The Bank and government agreed that a project-
specific system would not be set up. The system utilized was a combination of VISUAL SINFO,
an accounting system already installed within DAGPCH, and Excel and Word spreadsheets.
VISUAL SINFO was also used for required, periodic financial reporting. The PIDD had its “space”
within SINFO where all project activities/accounts were administered and recorded, and statements
generated. While M&E was not automated, the efficient use of excel sheets by the project Technical
Team resulted in regular reporting on project performance as stipulated in the Loan Agreement.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
Objectives of the Economic and Financial Analysis
3.1          The objective of the Economic and Financial Analysis is to evaluate the efficiency of
the results expected, that is, to study and determine whether the costs involved in achieving project
targets were reasonable in relation to the benefits. This analysis takes into account traditional
measures of economic efficiency (e.g., net present value, economic rate of return) and aspects of
design and application which could be continuously improved to increase the efficiency of future
projects. There is a need to discuss whether the effects were foreseeable, identify the factors of
success or the deficiencies, and evaluate how they might affect the future operation of the project.
         
Methodology for estimation of benefits

3.2         The following presents the economic concepts supporting this evaluation of economic
and financial impact.

Methodology for evaluating the economic impact of irrigation:30 The analysis worked with the
variable “production by hectare” (or yield) to analyze productive impacts, isolating the price effect
on net income by taking into account: net income for the crop; unit sale price of the crop; yield per
hectare for the crop; and, the price and quantity of productive inputs.

3.3          The function of net income (or margin) depends on several variables: crop sales price,
crop yield, input prices and quantity of inputs considered in the production function. To estimate
the productive effect corresponding to the “with-project” situation, one would need to leave as fixed
the variables of input and product prices in order to evaluate how farmers’ net income changed
when they improved their yields.31 In the contrary case, it is possible that changes in net incomes
expected from the project could be caused in part by price effects, thus not permitting certainty in
evaluating the productive changes in agricultural systems.

3.4          A recommended methodology for measuring productive impact of the project is
Marginal Productivity, which consists of estimating the Net Present Value (NPV) of increased
agricultural production due to the increased availability and better management of water as a result
of the project. This method considers water as an intermediate input in the production of
agricultural products. The analysis took into account: yield per hectare of the crop; availability of
water per hectare/year; and other inputs.

3.5         This method is based on the principle that the farmer maximizes his benefits using
water (like any other productive input) up to the point where marginal net income generated by



30 Reference: Manual for the Development of Large Scale Irrigation Works, April 2011 version
http://www.cnr.gob.cl/DivisionDeEstudios/Documents/Manual

31
  The quantity of productive inputs can be varied, taking into account the existence of variable costs which
depend on the level of production.


                                                    51
using an additional unit of water is equal to the marginal cost of obtaining this additional unit. The
method is based on the principle of limitation, whereby the production ceiling is determined by the
productive input which is found to be available at a lesser level and which impedes increased yields,
without heeding the fact that other productive inputs are available at levels which permit increased
production.

3.6          The method assumes perfect markets where the total value of production is equal to
the opportunity cost of all productive inputs (including the cost of capital and land). When the
opportunity costs of other inputs, distinct from water, are determined by their market price (or
shadow price), then the shadow price of water is the same as the residual difference between the
value of production and the costs of all inputs distinct from water. The analysis took into account:
total value of production of the crop; price of other production inputs; quantity of other production
inputs; and, value of marginal production of water per hectare of the crop (a function of the quantity
consumed).

3.7          The Value of Marginal Production of Water in equilibrium will be the market price of
the resource. Therefore, the greater availability of water allowing farmers to increase their
agricultural production is the difference between the agricultural benefits of the With and Without
Project situations.

3.8          The agricultural benefits from improvements in irrigation systems takes into account
the following: total economic benefits from improved irrigation; sales price of the crop; yield per
hectare of the crop in the With Project situation; price of inputs of production; quantity of inputs
of production in the With Project situation; area of crop in With Project situation; yield per hectare
of the crop i in Without Project situation; and, quantity of inputs of production in With Project
situation.

Methodology for evaluating the economic impact of road transport32
3.9        Below, some basic economic principles for evaluating the impact of benefits generated
by road transport projects are outlined. These are applicable to projects which expand roads,
improve road layout, improve the surface/cover, replace the surface/cover and for new roads.

3.10         The methodology is based on viewing transportation as an “economic good” for which
there is a demand from users due to their readiness to pay for it in order to travel, and there exists
a supply represented by the cost incurred in carrying out these trips.

3.11          The cost which users pay to do a certain number of trips is determined mainly by the
time taken to do them, and in the costs of maintenance and repair of the vehicle used (in the case
of individual vehicles it will be fuel, tires, oil etc. In the case of public transport it will be the cost
of the trip). Commonly these costs are denominated as Cost and Trip (Costo e Viaje - CV).

3.12         In order to measure the economic benefits of this type of project or surplus of the
consumer it is necessary to estimate the difference in the readiness to pay to carry out a determined
number of trips in a given period of time (D) and the effective cost paid by consumers to carry out
this number of trips in the Without Project situation (CVsp) and With Project (CVcp). It is hoped
that in the With Project situation the consumer surplus will be greater than in the Without Project
situation, due to a reduction in the cost of the trip and/or cost of maintenance and repair of vehicles
(A).




                                                    53
Figure 1   shows graphically the change in well-being with the project.

3.13           The following presents the benefits expected from a roads project.

     a. Savings in travel costs and time

With improved roads, users can arrive at their destination using less time because it is expected that
the speed of the trip will be greater on better roads. The time saving is determined via the difference
in the cost of the trip with and without the project. This analysis takes into account: annual benefit
in transportation time saved; average utilization rate (# of persons) in vehicle (individual vehicle,
taxis, communal vehicles, trucks etc.); daily number of trips of the vehicle; trip time (hours) of the
vehicle without project; trip time (hours) of the vehicle with project; and, cost of the time (hours)
for users.

Certain precautions are needed in applying this formula. One is the unit of time to be incorporated
in values so as to obtain an annual benefit in transportation time saved which can be incorporated
in the flow to estimate the Net Present Value of the project.

     b. Savings in the operating costs of vehicles

Improved road quality generates an improvement in the general “yield” of vehicles and their useful
life, which signifies a benefit for users. Benefits from reduced costs of vehicle operation can be
gauged taking the following into account: annual benefit from savings in vehicle operation;
operating cost per kilometer for the vehicle (individual vehicle, taxis, communal vehicles, trucks
etc.) in without project situation; road kilometers without project; cost of vehicle i operation per
km (individual vehicle, taxis, communal vehicles, trucks, etc.) in with project situation; road km in
with project situation; and, average daily rate of trips per vehicle (individual vehicle, taxis,
communal vehicles, trucks etc.).

     c. Savings in maintenance costs

The project can also generate a reduction in maintenance costs in the case of trucks where
frequently expenses need to be incurred to repair infrastructure to maintain the road in operating
condition in the without-project situation. To estimate the benefits from reducing costs of
maintenance in the with- and without-project situation, one needs to value the expenses incurred in
repairs as a function of the quality of the road in both situations. The analysis takes the following
into account: annual benefit of reducing costs of maintenance; annual cost of road maintenance in
the without-project situation; and, annual cost of maintaining the road in the with- project situation.

     d. Changes in fuel usage33

Road projects can generate increases or reductions in the use of fuel depending on the vehicle trip
speed in the with- or without-project situation. This is due to the fact that fuel yield is a function of
speed, in principle decreasing but at a certain point starting to increase. Based on estimations of


33
  Savings from changes in fuel use were not considered in the information-gathering process, and thus are
not incorporated in the benefits of the present evaluation.


                                                   54
vehicle travel speed, one can obtain fuel consumption yields in the with- and without-project
situation.

Estimation of the benefits (costs) from the lower or higher consumption of fuel take the following
into account: annual benefit from vehicle operation savings; cost of fuel consumption per km for
the vehicle (individual vehicle, taxis, communal vehicles, trucks etc.); road km in without-project
situation; cost of fuel consumption per km for the vehicle (individual vehicle, taxis, communal
vehicles, trucks etc.) in with-project situation; and, road km in with-project situation.

    e. Benefits from new permanent employment

Roads projects can be sources of jobs, if they can generate new permanent and temporary
employment associated with their administration, operation and maintenance. In such case, the
economic benefit of the new jobs corresponds to the real net value of the income or salaries received
by the persons employed in the with-project situation.

The analysis takes into account the following: net present value of new employment generated;
monthly value of employment generated (US$227.50 per person/month); months in the year (12);
number of jobs created (68); and, social discount rate (6% per annum).




Cost effectiveness analysis for roads:
The methodology described in a-e above corresponds to a cost-effectiveness analysis where
one compares the investments made inter alia, in rehabilitation, operation and maintenance
of the roads versus the positive impacts perceived by the beneficiary population including
reduced travel time and decreased cost of operation and maintenance of vehicles. This cost-
benefit analysis typically applies to the evaluation of road rehabilitation projects with
relatively high rates of Annualized Daily Average Transit (TPDA) – exceeding 50
vehicles/day.

However, for rural roads with low TPDA (low flow) the focus used is that of minimum
cost per beneficiary, that is, that it be cost effective. This focus measures the relation
between the total investment in rehabilitation of the roads and their costs of operation and
maintenance per person benefited (cost/beneficiary – CB). The economic evaluation under
such a focus for roads with low transit rates such as rehabilitated rural roads is a necessary
and common practice due to the social benefits linked to reduced isolation of communities
from providing connectivity and access to basic services, which while they have tangible
and high impacts for those families, are very difficult to value from an economic standpoint.




                                                 55
For this reason, the classic analytical tools of cost benefit analysis applied to such cases
generally produce negative results because they under-estimate the real benefits generated.

The idea is that this relationship will be smaller than the scenario pre-defined ex ante, that
is, at the moment of project formulation when the level of costs and benefits/beneficiaries
from the investments are projected.

Calculation of indicators:
3.14        Once the investment costs and economic benefits of the project are identified and
estimated, economic indicators to evaluate profitability can be constructed ex-post. Typically, NPV
is used and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). For this analysis, the Cost per Beneficiary is also
presented for the Roads Sub-component.

    a. Net Present Value

The NPV permits accounting of a flow obtained at distinct moments within a period of time,
applying a rate of interest to the initial starting point of the project. The analysis takes the following
into account: Net Present Value; Initial investment; benefits in a specific year; Costs in a specific
year; discount rate; and, Project Evaluation Horizon.

Criteria for decision-making indicate that:
    ‐ If the NPV is greater than 0, the project is successful
    ‐ If the NPV is equal to 0, he project is neutral
    ‐ If the NPV is below 0, the project is not successful.

However, certain considerations need to be made explicit in regard to the NPV. The NPV can
measure benefits and costs which are possible to quantify. There are benefits and costs which
cannot be measured due to their nature (lack of markets, lack of information etc.), but which can
be of high importance for the decision-maker. On the other hand, if a project derives a negative
NPV, it does not necessarily indicate that the plan should be discarded because it can be
reformulated with the intention of improving its indicators.

    b. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The IRR is a complementary indicator to the NPV, measuring the average profitability of the project
from period to period. Mathematically, the IRR corresponds to that discount rate which has an
actual value equal to zero. The variable is the IRR.

Criteria for decision-making show that:

    ‐   If the IRR is greater than the discount rate r, the project is positive
    ‐   If the IRR is equal to the discount rate r, the project is neutral
    ‐   If the IRR is lower than the discount rate r, the project is negative

The discount rate applied to this analysis is 12%.

    c. Cost per Beneficiary (CB)


                                                   56
This indicator is used to determine the efficiency of the investments by relating the total costs
incurred in rehabilitating the roads to the beneficiaries. Factors taken into account include: cost
per beneficiary; summation of total costs of rehabilitating the roads (including investment,
maintenance, operation); and, total beneficiaries.


Financial Analysis:


Sub-component: Irrigation Improvement
3.15         As indicated, this sub-component sought to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation
systems and strengthen water user organizations’ (WUA) capacity to manage these systems in order
to increase agricultural production and promote the wellbeing of beneficiary farm families.

3.16         One of the important results observed was the increase in area irrigated due to greater
efficiency in water distribution and better management by WUAs. The project area went from
4,123 hectares irrigated without project to 4,685 hectares irrigated with project, an increase of
13.6%. As a result of project investments, beneficiary families increased the economic value of
production by 64%, going from US$5.3 m without the project to US$8.7 m with the project,
measured in constant prices (an incremental increase of US$3.4 m). Better infrastructure and
management resulted in greater water availability and/or water available closer to where it was
needed, improving production and shifting the pattern of cropping towards crops with higher
economic value.

3.17        Table 1 shows the changes in the economic value of production based on crop in a
sample of 17 irrigation systems out of the total 55. This shows an increment of 32% in the value of
production per hectare cropped, equivalent to US$666 per year between the with- and without-
project situation. Also identified is the cultivation of pasture for animal feed which
supports/explains to a great extent the overall value of production, while demonstrating the

value of production per hectare between the with- and without-project situations.

Sub-component: Road Improvements
3.18        This sub-component sought to rehabilitate canton roadways to increase access and
connectivity with markets for local products and reduce the costs of transporting the labor force,
among other effects expected. As a result of investments in road infrastructure, two main benefits
are observed: reduced travel time and reduced costs of O&M of vehicles. Table 2 shows travel
times on the three roads rehabilitated. Reductions in travel times ranged from 35% to 41%, with an
overall reduction of 39%34.

3.20         Below are presented results in regard to changes observed in annual average transit and
the cargo capacity available and occupied/utilized by vehicles which transit these roads in the with-
project situation. Table 16 presents the number of annual trips, the supply of cargo capacity, cargo
transported and the index of occupation/utilization for the three rehabilitated roads, with and
without project.

  It should be mentioned that for the Flores - La Y de Achullay road, travel times were not presented in the
Baseline Study of 2010, but only in the Intermediate Impact Evaluation of 2012 and the Final Impact
Evaluation of 2014.

Charicando – Cocan – La Dolorosa road: A relatively minor 3.6% increase in the number of annual
trips, can be seen. However, cargo transported increased from 6,261 tons/year to 9,011 tons/year,
an increase of 44%. This also reflects an increase in the index of occupation/utilization which went
from 21% in the without-project situation to 28% with-project (Table 4).

Cubijíes - Quimiag – Puchulcahuan road: 8,008 trips annually were estimated for the with-project
situation. Also detected was a decline of 34% in cargo transported on this road, passing from 3,707
tons/year without-project to 2,462 tons/year with-project. At the same time, the total capacity
supply increased due to the reconfiguration of vehicles which in the with-project situation transit
this road, as the vehicles with greater transportation capacity have increased. To summarize, this
situation translates into a decrease in the occupancy index from 17% to 7% (Table 4).

Flores - Y De Achullay road: An estimated 8,000 annual trips were estimated under the with-project
situation. Cargo transported increased from 2,778 tons/year to 9,337 tons/year, an incremental
increase of 236% between the with- and without-project situation. Similarly, the index of
occupancy went from 20% to 35% between the without- and with-project situation (Table 4).
Further, it can be observed that the TPDA reached 21.9 vehicles/day in the with-project situation.

3.21         At the aggregate level, Table 4 shows that total cargo transported went from 12,746
tons/year in the without-project situation to 20,810 tons/year with the project. The index of
occupancy went from 19% to 22% but still maintained a level which translates into a high unit cost
of transportation, with the effect of greater costs to consumers and/or smaller margins for
agricultural producers. Also, while results are positive for cargo transported and the occupancy
index, they cannot be attributed to the project as the primary causal agent because they can also
reflect other, uncontrollable variables.

3.22         The economic analysis seeks to determine the effects at the macro-economic level of
project results. The analysis reviews the incremental NPV obtained under the with-project situation,
as well as the IRR.

Sub-component: Irrigation Improvement
3.23         The economic evaluation quantifies the incremental margins/gains between the with-
and without-project situation due to project investments, which permitted an improvement in water
availability for irrigation by improving the water conveyance infrastructure and water user
management of systems.

3.24       Below is presented an estimate of the NPV of project benefits for the Irrigation sub-
component, taking into account the following assumptions:

     ‐    Period for evaluating irrigation systems, 20 years;
     ‐    Residual value of irrigation systems at year 20 is 20% of the original investment value;
     ‐    Rate of opportunity cost, 12%;
     ‐    Annual cost of administration, O&M of the irrigation systems estimated at 2% of the
          investment amount or the equivalent of what is paid to use the water;
     ‐    Annual cost of technical assistance is 1% of the investment; and,
     ‐    Productive incorporation in three stages/steps: 35% of farmers incorporate into project
          benefits by year 1; 40% by year 2; and, 25% by year 3.

3.25      The total amount invested in the Irrigation sub-component was US$10.82 m of which
US$8.69 m was for investment, equivalent to 80% (Table 5).

3.26        Taking into account the total amount executed under the Irrigation Sub-component,
estimates show an incremental NPV of US$15.77 m with an IRR of 29.3% for 55 systems in
aggregate. This signifies an incremental NPV of around US$3,388 per hectare irrigated.36

3.27         It should be noted that the information presented for the economic evaluation of the
Irrigation Sub-component only defines the incremental impact on yields, costs and incomes, and
does not describe the without-project or the with-project situation. This situation creates difficulties


36
  To estimate the benefits of future flows of the differential in the economic value of production with the
same assumptions considered for the calculation of NPV of the Irrigation Sub-component, an NPV of
US$14.99 m was obtained. Even though under a rigorous analysis both methods would tend to converge
around the same value, the difference obtained in this case is less than 5%.

in analyzing the changes relative to yields and costs from baseline, and did not permit a comparison
of the structure of cropping between the 55 irrigation systems. The analysis the incremental effect
is taken as a fixed data without the possibility of sensitivity analysis.

3.28        In the same manner, in estimating the economic benefits presented, certain
fundamental variables are not mentioned such as yields and prices (kilos, tons/other; US$/kg,
US$/ton), only that they are defined as a “unit”. This is because each irrigation system (and each
farmer) manages a particular production unit which does not necessarily coincide with another
system or farmer. For cultural reasons, beneficiary farmers use their own units of measurement
including qualitative to quantify their production (e.g., sacks, boxes etc) and do not standardize
yields using modern terms. Consequently, nor do they present standardized units in terms of prices
considered for the economic analysis, only that they are “US$/unit”. Due to lack of standardization
of production/yields and prices, it is difficult to compare productive impacts between irrigation
systems to check the consistency and coherence of project results.

Sub-component: Roads Improvement
3.29         The economic evaluation of the benefits of the Roads Sub-component takes into
consideration the application of cost benefit methodologies and mínimum cost. The first consists
of estimating savings in the costs of O&M of vehicles as a result of traveling on better quality
roadways, savings in travel times of those transiting these roads, and the value of new employment
generated by the Road Conservation Associations (RCA). Table 6 presents the resources executed
for this sub-component, where one can observe that 98% went into investment (US$9.06 m).

3.30        Below is an estimate of the NPV of benefits of the Roads Sub-component, based on
the following assumptions:

    ‐   Road evaluation period of 20 years;
    ‐   Annual cost of O&M of roads of 1.06% on the investment (corresponding to the average
        of O&M costs realized by DAGPCH in the with-project situation (2012-2014));
    ‐   Opportunity cost of 12%.

3.31         Based on the information presented, an estimation of savings in the costs of O&M can
be obtained by multiplying the number of kilometers rehabilitated by the annual number of trips
and by the savings in the cost of O&M declared by those driving the vehicles at the time the surveys
were conducted. In this way, the annual benefit obtained for the three rehabilitated roads reached
US$172,581 per year ( Table 7:):

3.32         In the same way, the value of the savings in time resulting from road improvements
which permitted vehicular flow at greater speed and/or constant speed, can be gauged. The total
time saved is obtained by multiplying the minutes of each trip by the total number of trips per year,
and by the number of occupants in each vehicle (the assumption was 4 occupants/vehicle). Then,
the alternative cost was estimated (shadow price) of the time saved, and the annual monthly income
was taken into account for the category “permanent salaried worker”, presented in the Final Impact
Evaluation (2014), obtained from the questionnaires of beneficiary families. This value reached
US$227.50/month. In this way, the value of the time savings per trip reached US$59,714/year
(Table 8).

3.33         Finally, the economic benefit resulting from the 68 new, permanent jobs in the RCAs
of the three rehabilitated roads were estimFor this anayted. The real net value is US$3,094,000,
obtained from multiplying the US$227.50/month - the average monthly income of a “Permanent
Salaried Worker” presented in the Final Evaluation (2014) – by 12 months/year and by 68 new
Jobs, divided by the social rate of discount used to discount salaries, equivalent to 6% per year.

3.34        Considering the costs of the investment and of O&M of roads, and the benefits
obtained from the lower costs of vehicle maintenance and in trip time savings, and the benefits
from newly-created jobs, one obtains an NPV of minus US$5.38 m. This number is due to the
benefits considered in the economic evaluation not compensating for the high initial investments.

3.35        Presented below is a mínimum cost analysis for this Project. This methodology
measures the relationship between the total investment in roads rehabilitation and their costs of
operation and maintenance per person benefited (cost/beneficiary, CB). This is applied to this
Project due to the fact that the roads rehabilitated show low rates of vehicle transit.

                                                        62
Minimum Cost Analysis - Roads

3.36        For this analysis, the following assumptions are considered: evaluation period of 10
years; anual cost of O&M of roads of 1.06% of the investment (number corresponding to the
average of O&M costs actually incurred by DAGPCH in the with-project situation (2012-2014));
and, opportunity cost of 14%.

3.37         The methodology is applied to two scenarios. The first consists of considering only the
direct beneficiaries of the Irrigation Improvement Sub-component, that is, the 7,867 families. The
second considers the total population living in the cantons through which the rehabilitated roads
pass as indirect beneficiaries. Table 9 presents the beneficiary population indirectly benefited by
roads rehabilitation, based on information provided by DAGPCH. Table 10 presents the results
obtained. A cost per direct beneficiary is obtained of US$310.40/person and if total indirect
beneficiaries are considered, a cost per beneficiary of US$26.30/person is obtained. For such
analysis, typically one also uses the total population indirectly benefited since the investments have
an impact also on residents located a bit further from the roads due to greater supply of products
and services from increased connectivity, which also augments their level of well-being even if
they do not transit the roads.

3.38          While this Project did not do an ex ante analysis to determine the cost per beneficiary
for comparison purposes, it is considered that the cost of US$26.30/person is within an aceptable
margin for this indicator. To compare, the Peru Rural Transport Project (P095570) obtained an
indicator of US$30.17/indirect beneficiary in its ex post analysis for investments in low vehicle
transit rural roads, as presented in the ICR of February 2014.

3.39        The statistical inference is a process which only has validity when the sample complies
with technical criteria for representativeness, specifically in the margin of error and level of
confidence. It would be of interest to analyze whether the size of the sample and the period when
questionnaires were applied to gather information about vehicle transit had the characteristics
which would permit extrapolation to characterize the population as having a statistically valid level
of representation.




Aggregate Results

3.40        This section analyzes results at the aggregate level of the Project, considering the
results of the Irrigation and Roads Sub-components, and incorporating the costs of the
Administration Component. Table 11 shows that the Irrigation Sub-component generated an NPV
of US$15.77 m and an IRR of 29.3%, while the Roads Sub-component presents an NPV of minus
US$8.1 m, due possibly to the non-inclusion of other important benefits which are difficult to
measure and estimate in the flows, such as improved connectivity, Access to markets and services.
The Administration Component reached US$1.06 m and included all activities technically
supporting the Project: technical assistance, goods and services, specialists and Project
management.

is prompted by the greater availability of wáter resources for beneficiary families, permitting them
to increase productivity and increase the area irrigated.

3.42      Analysis of the mínimum cost for low vehicle transit rural roads shows a cost of
US$26.30/person, a figure considered reasonable for projects of this nature.

Sensitivity Analysis:

3.43         A fundamental aspect of Project evaluation is the identification of variables which
could significantly affect Project costs and benefits and accordingly, their indicators of profitability.
This exercise is useful to identify important variables strongly affecting outcomes, as well as the
robustness of the Project, understood as its capacity to generate benefits even under unfavorable
scenarios, in the most important variables. This analysis assesses the sensitivity of annual benefit
flows under both the Irrigation Improvement and Road Improvement sub-components and
estimates the economic indicators of Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal rate of Return (IRR)
for each sub-component and their impact on the PIDD, maintaining the other sub-component
(Administration) unchanged.

3.44         In this manner, probable scenarios are generated based on different levels of change in
the flow of future benefits, and measures percentage changes in the economic indicators according
to how they vary within future flows, based on the following equation:

                                            VAN      X%    VAN	base
                              %∆VAN
                                                     VAN	base

    a. Sensitivity: Irrigation Sub-component

3.40         In the case of the Irrigation Sub-component, eight scenarios were simulated for
variations in the flow of benefits: -15%, -10%, -5%, 5%, 10% and 15%. The seventh scenario
corresponds to how much future benefit flows need to diminish for the NPV of the Irrigation Sub-
component to equal zero (-56,3%). The eighth scenario corresponds to how much benefit flows
need to diminish for the NPV of the PIDD at the aggregate level to be zero (-24,8%), considering
that the Roads Sub-component and Administration Component remain constant (ceteris paribus).
In Table 11 the sensitivity results are presented. It can be seen that the NPV of the Irrigation Sub-
component is equal to zero if future benefit flows fall by 59.3%. Similarly, the NPV of the PIDD
in aggregate, leaving the Roads Sub-component and Administration Sub-component unchanged, is
equal to zero with a fall of 24.8% in future agricultural benefit flows.

3.41         These results show the robustness of the Irrigation Sub-component, which present
positive indicators of economic performance even with significant declines in irrigation benefits.
Also presented are the results of other scenarios considered.

    b. Sensitivity: Roads Sub-component

3.42         The sensitivity analysis for the Roads Sub-component simulates four scenarios with
variations in the expected benefit flows: 5%, 10% and 15% (reduced flows were not included in
the simulation due to the NPV of this sub-component being already negative). The fourth scenario
corresponds to how much future benefit flows would need to increase for the sub-component NPV
to be equal to zero (139%). Table 12 shows the results of the simulation. Due to the NPV for this
Sub-component being minus US$5.38 m., with an increase of 139% in future benefit flows, the
NPV would be equal to zero.

3.43         This result is due to the benefits considered in the economic evaluation not being able
to cover the high initial investments. As noted in previous sections, the economic evaluation did
not consider other benefits perceived by beneficiary families such as improved access to services
and greater fluidity in the labor market among other, difficult to measure benefits.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Methodology:
5.1           The evaluation methodology was as follows:
         The Baseline Study (Carrasco, 2010) was conducted formally in 34 of the planned/defined
          55 irrigation systems. For the remaining 21 systems, the project required that contractors
          incorporate a baseline in their respective subproject proposal.
         Evaluation of all 55 irrigation systems was conducted at three time points: the 2012 Mid-
          Term Impact Evaluation analyzed 19 systems and a random sample of 331 families
          (measuring results against the original RF) in 2012; the Final I analyzed 19 systems and
          163 randomly-sampled families, and the Final II 17 systems and 272 randomly sampled
          families in 2014 (see Carrasco 2012 and 2014).
         Stratified Random Sampling sought to ensure that representation was adequate in relation
          to the universe in each case.


                                                 69
       A Control Group (details below) was not included in the original evaluation methodology
        but was constructed ex-post in a separate research effort to try to strengthen the evidence
        for attribution of productive benefits under revised Results Indicator #1 (“beneficiaries’
        annual average production value has increased by at least 10% on average, in constant
        prices”). Other findings regarding the Control Group are also important, including the
        proportion of their land under irrigation by end-project, and their use of paid labor (see
        Carrasco, 2014).
       To evaluate the roads outcomes, vehicular flow was measured by 6 community Promoters
        between 5 am and 4 pm on the three rehabilitated road segments, with two days for each
        segment.
       Questionnaires were applied to water users, community organizations, Presidents of
        community organizations and Presidents of WUAs. The survey instruments were agreed
        with the Bank, field piloted and adjusted where needed.
A. Executive Summary: Mid-Term Impact Evaluation (Carrasco, 2012)

5.2          The Decentralized Autonomous Government of the Province of Chimborazo
(DAGPCH) contracted a consultancy to conduct an Intermediate Impact Evaluation on the PIDD
operation, to understand the extent to which Project activities were achieving the results envisaged
in the Project Results Framework.

5.3          Direct surveys were administered to users of PIDD-financed irrigation systems, to the
Presidents of Water User Associations and to the users of the three PIDD-improved road segments.
In addition, secondary information generated by the Project and externally, was used. The universe
was 19 irrigation systems covering some 1,894 families from which a random sample of 331
families was established. In the case of roads, surveys were applied to users to determine their
origin and destination on three days of the week for each road segment.

Main Results:

5.4         At the time of the mid-term surveys in 2012, the PIDD had invested US$8.6 m of the
US$15.3 m IBRD loan; 2011 was the year of best financial performance since effectiveness, with
55% of the total executed.

5.5          Irrigation: Comparing the distribution of soil/land use observed by the Baseline Study
(2010) with the actual distribution, there was an important change in patterns of cultivation. In
effect, before the PIDD, 46.6% of crops cultivated were short cycle and only 36.9% were perennial.
After PIDD irrigation investments, 65 % were perennial and semi-perennial crops such as tree
tomatoes, blackberry, alfalfa and pasture.

5.6         PIDD investments had a strong impact on the volume of production marketed overall
and on the marketing of individual crops. For example, pre-PIDD, only 12.1% of short cycle crops
were marketed, whereas post-PIDD 86.9% went to market. Investments conducted by the PIDD
had a strong impact on volumes marketed both overall and at the level of individual
subprojects/systems.



                                                70
5.7         Prior to Project implementation, only 12.1% of all shortcycle crops were marketed
whereas post-project this figure rose to 86.9%. This same tendency is observed in the marketing
of perennial crops and livestock products.

5.8          Irrigation systems overall improved efficiency on average by 33% over Baseline.Water
User Associations acquired a system for programming water use which helped them to establish
irrigation calendars and water user fees.

5.9          The water user tariffs actually paid varied widely between systems. It was evident from
the statements of WUA Presidents that in some cases, the tariffs were barely sufficient to pay the
wáter operator’s salary. Lack of commitment of users to their WUA in such cases did not allow
WUA leaders to levy tariffs sufficient to cover the full costs of O&M. However, despite these
statements, 74% of WUAs levied tariffs which did cover the full costs of O&M with some
additional for reserve funds.

5.10        Through the training provided by the Project, and the implementation of
Demonstration Plots, irrigation users moved into higher value commercial crops such as peas, corn,
beans, potato, carrot, rabano and alfalfa/pasture. However, data show that these initial moves into
higher value crops were still incipient at this stage.

5.11         Roads: Time savings varied between the roads analyzed. The Charicando – Cocán –
La Dolorosa road showed time savings varying from 1.5 hours on the Guaylla – Guamote stretch
to 0.2 hours on the Pungupala – Guamote stretch. On the Cubijies – Guamote y Flores – Achullay
roads, time savings ranged from 0.2 hours to 0.9 hours. In aggregate, the estimated time saving was
around 55.1% at that point in time.

5.12        At the time of the 2012 impact evaluation, the Charicando – Cocán – La Dolorosa RCA
was fully operational and had contracted 5 permanent workers. The Charicando – Cocán – La
Dolorosa; Cubijies – Quimiag y Flores – Achullay, roads were completed and already receiving
permanent, routine maintenance.

5.13       The frequency of trips on improved roads increased 37% over the pre-PIDD situation.
Also, road users gained greater/easier access to basic services such as health, education and
employment.

5.14        The DAGPCH was responsable for recruiting and selection of Project staff, a process
it conducted within revised time periods since the recruitment process was challenging in the sub-
national context and staff turnover made the situation more complex.

5.15         In regard to results for Project Management, the Project designed a physical and
financial system but it could not be made operational due to disagreement between the DAGPCH
departments and the Project M&E team in terms of its codification. Up to end-project, performance
reports were presented to the Bank using the SINFO system and in manual form, which was
aceptable to the Bank FM team.


                                                71
Conclusions:

5.16        Irrigation: Execution of the PIDD improved irrigation conditions for families within
systems’ area of influence because users are now much more aware of issues such as water flow
water schedules, quality of irrigation systems, the incorporation of more efficient system such as
aspersion (using a sprinkler device) and others which deliver more water and are able to increase
cropping, and in the case of short cycle crops, increase rotation to three times/year. The Project
generated optimism in users that they now have secure, continuous access to water year-round, and
can develop agricultural activities. As stated: “We are conscious of having improved our incomes
– the multiple cropping helps a lot”.

5.17        Roads: In regard to improved roads, project investments have translated into greater
convenience for users/travellers; lowered the cost of transport for vehicle owners; trips are shorter;
increased the frequency of travel; and importantly, are allowing agricultural products to arrive at
markets in better condition resulting in better prices.

5.18         Despite the above, the 2012 Evaluation recommended the following: (i) technical and
financial strengthening of irrigation users: (ii) designing and applying a communication strategy to
reach and promote even greater participation of farmers in the entire cycle; (iii) strengthening the
WUAs so that they can use efficient AOM methods for their systems; and, (iv) promoting
awareness among farmers to introduce permanent planning of their productive processes to avoid
falling back into inefficiencies.

B. Executive Summary: Final Impact Evaluation (Carrasco/DAGPCH, 2014)

5.19         The final impact study evaluated 17 irrigation systems representing 4,389 beneficiary
families, as well as the vehicle flow on all three rehabilitated road segments. The 17 irrigation
systems represent a statistically significant sample of the universe of 55 systems and their
beneficiaries, and were selected using a stratified random sampling method. Some 272
questionnaires were applied. The sample was distributed based on proportionality, i.e., the number
of families per system sampled. In six systems where the sample was insufficiently representative,
adjustments were made. Three types of instruments were used: (i) questionnaire for users to capture
their perceptions and reactions concerning their operational systems, socio-economic information,
production systems with/without irrigation, costs of production, family income according to
economic activity and household expenditures; (ii) two separate guides for structured interviews of
Presidents of WUAs and for representatives of social organizations. These instruments were pre-
tested working with the WUAs, the PIDD M&E specialist, community promoters and the
evaluation research team. Adjustments were made to avoid distortions. The field team (local,
community-based Promoters) was trained and accompanied by experienced field researchers,
importantly to provide sustainable skills within the province for future, similar exercises.
Indigenous, kichwa speaking field staff were part of these teams. The PIDD M&E specialist
accompanied this process closely. Inconsistencies in data were followed-up and complementary




                                                 72
information sought. A Software Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was utilized to
codify and process data/information collected. Results are summarized below.38

5.20         Main findings:

        Irrigation: Annual production value increased 91% in constant prices for the 17 systems
         and 64% overall for all 55 systems. Agricultural production in the 17 systems was valued
         at US$2.3 million pre-PIDD and US$4.4 m after, and in the 55 systems was valued at
         US$5.3 m pre-PIDD and US$8.7 m after, taking into account the benefits of water and
         training in irrigation techniques. Pasture alone rose from US$906,000 pre-PIDD to US$1.6
         m ex-post, up 72%.
        By end-project, the average annual value of agricultural production per family in constant
         prices was US$1,177 for Treatment Group families versus US$863 for Control Group
         families.
        Some crops dropped out of the mix at the time of the surveys mainly because the
         questionnaires were applied at a certain point in the agricultural year and alternative crops
         were being grown, as well as a shift to higher value cropping especially in the higher
         altitude systems.
        Water distribution efficiency improved 74% over the 55 systems and 89.4% for the final
         17 systems surveyed.
        7,867 farmers benefited overall (55 systems) versus the targeted 7,900, and 4,358 from the
         17 final systems surveyed, some of which were much larger
        67.4% of WUAs were using an effective irrigation calendar over 55 systems (target 70%)
         and 94% under the final 17 systems, likely due to the intensification of training to ensure
         that all WUAs achieved a standard of operation which would ensure sustainability of
         systems longer-term. The conclusion is that the PIDD’s training regime was effective and
         widely applied by users.
        88% of WUAs over the 55 systems had trained leadership for better administration, O&M
         and 100% of the final 17 surveyed. Training covered the registration of all users,
         maintenance of operational manuals, and internal statutes and regulations governing WUA
         management and water use. All 17 WUAs stated that they had received technical support
         to strengthen their administration, operation and maintenance (AOM) of their systems.
        Of 55 systems, 20% of beneficiary families changed from rain-fed to irrigated agriculture
         and only 10% under the final 17 surveyed, about 67% of the original target. But all stated
         that their use of water was more efficient and conservative. Total area irrigated increased
         562 ha over the 55 systems.
        37.5% increase in annual value of production for beneficiaries of the 77 demonstration
         plots (55 systems), and 45.4% increase for plots on the 17 systems surveyed for the final
         evaluation (see table, Annex 2).
        71.9% of the 55 WUAs employed irrigation fees sufficient to cover O&M (90% of target),
         and 88.3% in the 17 systems surveyed for the Final in 2014.
        Some 99.3% of all families interviewed have irrigation access, 95% of available water is
         from canals, 2% from reservoirs and 1% from rivers/streams. Within the areas studied,
         50% of irrigation remains gravity-based, 40% is aspersion using sprinkler devices and 8%
         is delivered via drip systems (the most advanced/efficient).

    This summary does not repeat all findings of the study which are already captured in the Data Sheet, in
the ICR main text section 3.2, and in Annex 2.


                                                    73
       Average family income (not a specific project indicator) increased from US$181.00/month
        at Baseline to US$323.00/month at closing, attributed primarily to the impact of greater,
        more reliable and well-regulated access to water for agricultural activities combined with
        appropriate training in its use, along with rising prices for agricultural commodities of this
        period and better market access.

       Roads: 8,833 families were benefited directly from the PIDD-financed road segments and
        there was a 38.8% decrease in vehicle O&M costs (US$/km, average three segments).
       Time taken to transit the three improved road segments decreased 38.3% over Baseline.
       100% of RCAs were strengthened to effectively administer O&M of their respective
        responsibilities, and 68 new, permanent jobs were created for road administration,
        operation and maintenance.
       37% of trips surveyed were made by vans and 35% by trucks – some 8,944 trips/year
        carrying 9,011 tons, compared to the Baseline of 8,632 trips and 6,261 tons.
       Moderate increase in the flow of all types of vehicles registered which together have
        capacity of 617 tons/week and 32,084 tons/year. However, roads were only moving 173
        tons/week signifying idle capacity of 444 tons/week or 72% of total capacity.
       The study notes that clearly the cost of transportation remained quite high with only 28.1%
        capacity utilization across all types of vehicles.

Other impacts:

       Research found widespread community participation in O&M of respective irrigation
        systems: 47% provided labor; 47% labor plus cash contributions; 6% provided cash
        exclusively.
       100% of Presidents of WUAs said families had improved their overall standard of living:
        44.8% had improved incomes; 24.1% had greater access to schools/education; 20.7% had
        improved the quality of their homes; and 10.3% had better access to health services.
       All WUAs/Presidents had received continuous technical support and 76.5% said they had
        received PIDD TA for their demonstration plots.
       Demonstration plot beneficiaries had improved and diversified their diet, and increased
        family income.
       Opportunities to learn were frequently noted: better, more conservative use of water;
        increased area irrigated; learning how to irrigate, and learning how to cooperatively
        manage systems, working with community members.
       Interviews with Presidents of Social Organizations showed that 41% were very satisfied
        with project outcomes and 59% were satisfied, mainly due to improved productivity, and
        the reliable availability of water and technical support.
       100% of social organizations surveyed stated that in addition to infrastructure, they had
        received productive technical assistance. Some 59% were able to install demonstration
        plots and 8% received seeds and seedlings.

Control Group Study (Carrasco, 2014):

The Bank team decided to contract this study during the six month period of ICR preparation, to
bolster attribution of the key project benefit of irrigation – greater production value (as per the
Results Indicator) – to PIDD investments, and provide other insights. While it would have been
possible to justify project results using the already-existing before/after data, it was believed that
the Control Group exercise was worthwhile in the time available and would add weight to the
existing findings.

                                                 74
Methodology: The Control Group universe was established as a function of the number of families
attended by the 55 PIDD systems (7,857). The goal was to find a group of non-beneficiaries
comparable to the Treatment Group in key observable and non-observable characteristics.
     The 55 systems were divided into 4 strata corresponding to an altitudinal level, to form
        Groups 1-4.
     Numbers of families at each altitude were determined.
     Identification of a potential Control Group was based on social organizations which will
        have their systems renovated by the new IDB project. Some 19 such organizations were
        defined representing a universe of 2,744 families.
     Simple random sampling, with 6% margin of error and 90% level of confidence, resulted
        in a sample of 187 families/questionnaires. Questionnaires were distributed based on
        relative weight of the number of families per altitudinal Group vs the universe.
     Communities within each altitudinal Group were selected based on similarity to the
        Treatment Group, ease of physical access for researchers, and numbers of people.
     11 communities were selected and 187 questionnaires applied. Questionnaire design
        reflected those utilized for the intermediate and final impact evaluations. Trained local
        promoters were guided by a field supervisor.

Findings:

        Control Group families (as with Treatment Group) were not found to be in an alarming
         socio-economic situation, with some key indices being above the national average, e.g.
         land tenancy, no sign of residential over-crowding, and incomes above the poverty line in
         all but 2% of cases.
        Average family land-holding was 0.55 ha (versus 0.60 ha for the Treatment Group).39
        Family agricultural production value fluctuates depending on altitude (as with the
         Treatment Group). For example, Group 3 (2,000-2,499 meters above sea level), annual
         production is valued at US$3,952 while in Group 4 (1,400-1,999 meters above sea level)
         is only US$315. Group 3 grows higher value crops, e.g., potatoes, onions, strawberry and
         arveja.
        As noted, annual agricultural production values of the Control Group averaged US$863 by
         end-project (2,744 families), versus US$1,177 for the Treatment Group (7,867 families).
        Control Group farmers were using mostly family labor – they do not contract external labor.
         This contrasts with the Treatment Group where overall, some 6,239 jobs were created due
         to the impact of greater water availability, increased land under crops and multiple crops
         per year.
        64% of families had access to irrigation water (vs 99.3% of PIDD beneficiaries), and were
         irrigating 0.12 ha on average (total area irrigated of 212 ha, only 13% of the total land). In
         contrast, PIDD farmers are irrigating 87.5% of their total land.
        The average monthly income received by the economically active population within the
         Control Group rose was US$259 by end-project, while the Treatment Group average was
         25% higher at US$323.

Conclusions and recommendations:


39
  This is much lower than the Baseline Study (2010) which shows average landholdings of 1.26 ha per
family.


                                                  75
      Most indicators were achieved or exceeded – only three fell short: (i) WUAs using effective
       irrigation calendar; (ii) beneficiaries shifting from rain fed to irrigated systems; and (iii)
       WUAs applying tariffs covering the full costs of O&M (including replacements).
      High satisfaction levels indicate that PIDD funds were well-utilized.
      Provide further help to beneficiary organizations to ensure that they implement irrigation
       systems and incorporate a greater number of strategic crops aimed at specific markets.
      Conduct an ex-post monitoring of the PIDD so that the DAGPCH can build on the PIDD
      Strengthen support for the WUA leadership to develop more sustainable AOM




Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

6.1         A stakeholder seminar was conducted at end-project on project results, experiences
and lessons but no formal report was issued. Outcomes of the proceedings were synthesized with
other background information into a DAGPCH brochure “Rendicion de Cuentas” (2014) and a
video. See summary, main text 3.6.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

     A. Summary of Borrower Completion Report:

7.1          The following summarizes the main findings of the Borrower Completion Report. The
report is brief and derived mostly from the final impact evaluation already summarized in Annex
5.

7.2          The PIDD used a participatory, inclusive approach intended to frame experiences and
lessons for wide use and future development efforts. The impact evaluations adopted the same
approach. The Borrower viewed the project as complex, especially during the conceptual and
preparation phases and because the Bank had to adapt to working at the sub-national level in
Ecuador and was also in a difficult relationship at the national level with central government
authorities. The time taken to prepare the project was importantly due to these factors, but
provincial authorities were persistent and kept the discussion going due to the precarious nature of
key infrastructure and the need for immediate investment in the agriculture sector. The project was
the only active Bank operation in Ecuador at that time.

7.3          The report summarizes all main results described in the final impact evaluation: (i)
average annual value of production increased 64% in constant prices; (ii) productivity improved
due to irrigation investments and there was a shift from traditional rain fed crops to higher value
irrigated agriculture – mainly pasture, potato, corn and beans; (iii) average transit time on
rehabilitated roads segments was reduced by 40%.

7.4          The Borrower believes it would have been useful to measure the impact of better
conservation of water sources/micro-catchments and provides the example of Tuculay community
in Chunchi Canton in south Chimborazo. Reforestation with native species is now protecting a
critical water source and now, four years later, natural re-growth is protecting natural springs and
has increased water flow. Further, the Borrower states that the project did not work sufficiently
with issues such as value added, associative production, post-harvest management and marketing
– important elements for completing the value chain approach and for improving beneficiaries’
incomes. A follow-on operation should include these and measure them. It appears this more
complete approach was contemplated earlier on but the final design ended up focusing on market
access via better roads – an indirect impact on market access. New provincial investment operations
will adopt the more complete approach.

7.5         The report notes that the initial idea was to prepare a bank of studies to ensure that
investments amounts required were accurate but this was difficult due to the acute lack of technical
expertise/consultants at the provincial level. The Bank and FAO had to train professionals to fulfill
needed project technical assistance needs.

7.6          The project broke with the traditional public sector infrastructure approach, providing
training and strengthening in agricultural techniques and to WUAs, as well as to the RCAs
responsible for O&M of the roads. The irrigation sub-component was hampered/delayed by lack
of communication and understanding between the EOP team and the WUAs. The EOP was staffed
properly over time including with kichwa speaking professionals but this took time. The WUAs
are now making a major effort to increase the technical approach to irrigation which requires a
break with ancestral and cultural paradigms. But this did not result in demonstration plots being
replicated into a second cycle. The BCR recommends that demonstration plots be designed in more
culturally-sensitive ways with greater empowerment of beneficiaries, greater stimulation to outside

                                                 77
farmers to visit/participate, and that the technical/training package be more attractive including TA,
supervision and inputs well beyond project closing. Further, collaborative, associative activities
need direct promotion, as well as value-added, marketing and entrepreneurship. Not all WUAs are
equally prepared to move forward into more complex agriculture. But more well-rounded
demonstration plots would help. The BCR believes the expected change from rain-fed to irrigated
farming was under-dimensioned because it dealt only with existing systems. The financing limits
on individual subprojects meant that the additional, essential activities could not be included. This
may explain lack of replication into a second cycle. Overall, satisfaction levels exceeded 94% and
many important lessons were learned.

7.7           The focus of road improvements was on networks, linking various segments so that
investments were more efficient. Working segment by segment took much time. Today, the
strategy would be to link segments in order to benefit a greater number of communities. In the PDD,
due to initial problems, these roads were linked to primary provincial roads, creating new linkages
and ring roads to improve connectivity between cantons and regions. The innovative aspect was
the strengthening of the RCAs so that participating families could improve their incomes,
generating new jobs. The primary maintenance responsibilities of the RCAs were crucially
important and today, the RCAs are being replicated across all provincial road networks. Road users
have reduced their O&M costs substantially and reduced the time taken to travel from one point to
another. The RCAs are legally constituted, contracted under public standards and have generated
jobs for 68 people.

7.8          Experience generated by the EOP having to manage/coordinate the PIDD, making
administrative processes more agile, monitoring project activities, , providing technical assistance
and supervision to civil works. A special Irrigation Coordination Agency was created in DAGPCH
in 2012 as direct results of the PIDD. Some EOP staff had joint roles, working in bother bodies.
No doubt at certain periods, the high rate of EOP staff rotation caused uncertainty and instability
and many divergent opinions about how the PIDD should be implemented. Staff losses in
2011/2012 created a vacuum for about 6 months until they were replaced. The BCR recommends
greater stability of EOP staffing and provisions to ensure that the project is not disrupted and that
key project information and documentation is smoothly transferred.

7.9         The BCR maintains that the Bank’s institutional rules were extremely complex and
created doubt in the Bank’s mind about the Borrower’s ability to comply. But the BCR considers
it to have been very important that the project was embedded in a line agency even though this
caused many delays. It was seen as critical that DAGPCH grow institutionally to manage
relationships with multilateral development lending institutions. But the challenges in correctly
handling the Bank’s fiduciary requirements were formidable but invaluable for building local
capacity and enabling further collaboration with IFIs.

7.10        The project took into account the most pressing social risks such as inequitable
relationships between key players, vulnerability of women and indigenous groups and ensuring the
appropriation of project benefits by leaders, communities and other social actors. It also ensured
that the project reached these groups and that they had social control over the project and its
decision-making processes.

7.11         On environmental issues, the PIDD contributed greatly to foster awareness of
environmental positive technologies and to manage water resources I a more conservative manner,
relieving the pressure on water and reducing conflict. Training stressed agro-ecologically sound
practices and emphasized eliminating the use of pesticides. The demonstration plots were

                                                 78
especially important for showing farmers such practices. In this respect, the GEF-PROMAREN
project was very important, although its initiation was out of sync with the PIDD. The project gave
visibility to environmental principles and practices. All irrigation and road contracts had
environmental mitigation clauses. Their enforcement was financed by subproject funds. Most
environmental management activities however were location-specific and the more generalized
appreciation of the principle involved was more limited.

7.12         Procurement experiences and training were considered invaluable for introducing
transparency and combating corruption and created a market for consulting and construction
services but the BCR considers the Bank’s procurement processes/rules to have been too rigid for
local conditions and created significant delays. The BCR thinks time savings of up to 40-50% cold
have been achieved if Bank and Borrower rules could have been blended.

7.13        The PIDD had an M&E specialist throughout and M&E was a pioneering effort in the
Borrower institution because the impact of actions, when compared to the baseline, could be seen
immediately. But the PIDD did not have a “platform” within SINFO and needed automating for
modernization. The BCR also calls on the Bank to support a standardized methodology for
evaluating impact with the same consultant for all studies and a greater number of questionnaires
and of better quality. Also, the Bank needs to train the Borrower in project management,
communications and negotiations.

7.14        The BCR contains a limited set of tables – all of which already contained in Annex 2
– and none pertaining to roads. The lessons are not couched as such and the above text contains
the basic outlines of DAGPCH’s recommendations which it is considered unnecessary to re-state
here.

Final considerations and recommendations:

7.15        Tangible impacts of the PIDD:

       Strengthened social organizations (RCAs and WUAs); conflict resolution systems;
        communal, cooperative working arrangements; reactivation of moribund social
        organizations; and, creation of a culture of payment for services.
       PIDD built an integrated framework addressing two critical development streams.
       PIDD investments were for the most part rural, a sector which is mainly indigenous,
        reducing inequality by improving economic prospects and generating more sources of
        income, permitting some families to return to the sector.
       The PIDD revealed the reality of rural families through interactive, participatory processes,
        public consultation and effective communication in appropriate forms/language.
       Some 562 ha of additional land came under irrigation, and change did occur in the transition
        from gravity to pressure-based irrigation.
       Agricultural yields increased and patterns of cultivation changed slowly shifting towards
        higher value production – although this remains an evolving situation.
       Results show an increase in pasture, putting greater stress on the milk production value
        chain, in additional to the appearance of high value crops such as quinoa.

7.16         Intangible impacts of the PIDD:

        Evolution/growth of local technical capacity in consultants, contractors, supervisors,
         technical capacity within DAGPCH, and strengthening of WUAs.
        Through minga, community support, and conflict resolution, empowerment through
         investment decision-making and execution, and solidarity between community members.
        Legalization of the WUAs and RCAs so that they can fulfill their responsibilities and have
         a structure which can cope with/manage future investments.
        Improved self-esteem of participants/beneficiaries who now have excellent roads in their
         areas and modernized irrigation facilities.

7.17         Final observations:

        The PIDD is seen as a replicable model for other autonomous governments in the region
         and some have already asked DAGPCH to share experiences and to advise on how to
         capture resources from IFIs as well as how to plan and execute similar projects.
        It is critical that future, similar interventions build a stable, permanent team to avoid risks
         to the project’s chances of achieving its objectives.
        The PIDD demonstrated the technical, financial and operational capacity of the DAGPCH,
         opening windows for other provincial governments to obtain similar financing.
        The strong relationships between the DAGPCH and national government and international
         organizations have opened up opportunities for additional rural development financing
         including with JICA, KOICA, GEF, FAO, the World Bank and IDB.
        The reputation/credentials of the provincial Prefect in transparent, participatory
         management of resources was a source of confidence for the Bank’s financing and for the
         national government to provide its guarantee even at a time of difficult relations between
         the two entities.
