                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports on the findings of the February 2013 mission and subsequent reviews carried out through June 2013. Actual disbursements (May 2013) reach 69%, and committed
                         funds bring disbursements up to 87%.
                         The last supervision mission, confirmed significant improvements in project implementation status. Regarding Subcomponent 1.1 Irrigation Improvements shows notable
                         achievements, including the completion of the modernization of 38 irrigation systems (69% of a total of 56 systems). Project authorities have been able to gradually accelerate the
                         procurement of the rehabilitation and modernization of small to medium-sized irrigation systems the procurement of which has been challenging. Nonetheless these initial delays, 46

                         systems have been contracted until April 2013, 38 are to date fully operational, 8 systems are under implementation, and bids for the remaining 10 systems, amounting
                         approximately US$2 Million have been received.
                         The rehabilitated systems are operated and maintained by the corresponding Water User Associations (WUAs) who have been trained in the operation of pressurized distribution
                         systems, and in all cases new high value crops have been incorporated using modern irrigation systems, increasing water use efficiency in 33% and improving productivity

                         substantially. Thus, this Subcomponent is steadily moving towards the achievement of the PDO. The work plan indicates that the completion of the 10 remaining systems, with
                         procurement underway, will be done throughout the year 2013, for which an extension of the project closing date for another additional nine months has been processed and
                         approved.
                         Subcomponent 1.2 Roads Improvements is fully executed and disbursed and a total of 50.4 Km have been rehabilitated. The rehabilitated road segments are part of a road network
                         that serves the areas of higher agricultural production in the province, facilitating the transportation and commercialization of these products. The roads component has achieved a
                         substantial and visible impact, reducing travel time by 55% and increasing the frequency of trips by 37%.
                         The performance of Component 2 Institutional Strengthening and Project Management, has also substantially improved. All vacant positions in the Project Implementation Unit have
                         been filled but GoCh has recently informed that the Project Coordinator has been put n dual charge covering the head position at the Irrigation Unit at the Government. This topic will
                         be discussed with Government during the next supervision mission (July 2013) leading the team effectively. The procurement of services and works also shows a substantial
                         progress.
