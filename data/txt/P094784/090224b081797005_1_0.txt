                         The project objective is to increase production and market access of rural families living in the Chambo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins within Chimborazo Province,
                         through investments in irrigation and roads improvement.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports on the findings of the July 2012 mission and subsequent reviews carried out through August to October 2012. Actual disbursements (October 2012) reach 64.75%,
                         and committed funds bring disbursements up to 80%.
                         The roads Subcomponent is fully disbursed and finalized, a total of 50.4 Km have been rehabilitated. The operation and maintenance committees has been created 3 subporjects and
                         in one is fully operational.
                         The Provincial Government has been monitoring and reporting physical and financial progress regularly and an independent entity has established the base line and conducted a

                         The irrigation Subcomponent shows also notable achievements. The study and final designs of 74 systems, out of the 133 originally identified, have been finalized. During the
                         restructuring of the project and the revision of the procurement plan 59 systems have been prioritized for implementation, 44 systems have been contracted till October 2012
                         amounting 5.509 U$S million and contracts for another 6 amounting 2.685 U$S million are under process. The implementation of remaining 9 systems already prepared would

                         require an extension of the project closing date and additional funds. The number of systems fully operational to date is 38.
                         The corresponding Water User Associations (WUAs) have been trained successfully, new high value crops has been incorporated using modern irrigation systems (sprinkler and
                         other pressurized systems) increasing water use efficiency and improving productivity substantially. WUAs are depositing upfront their counterpart funding to cover capital costs and
                         are collecting irrigation service fees.
                         The impact evaluation recently completed, in a sample of 19 systems servicing 1894 families, indicates that the percentage of the cultivated area with perennial crops has increased
                         from 46% to 65% and that the volume of annual crops traded increased, during the project's period, from 12% to 86.9%.
                         The overall water use efficiency has increased in 33% and 74% of WUAs are collecting water charges regularly. The roads component has also achieved a substantial and visible
                         impact
                         reducig travel time saving time in 55% and increasing 37% the frequency of trips. The supervision of works have been strengthened hiring additional specialized staff. Areas that
                         require attention are the need of deepen the support to WA to improve agriculture technology and commercialization and to increase staff in the implementation unit to improve
                         critical areas of supervision of WUA work, increase of water fees collection and support social work in more disadvantaged and remote communities
