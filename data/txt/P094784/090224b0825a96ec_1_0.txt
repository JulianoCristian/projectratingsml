                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reports on the findings of the last supervision mission before closing, performed in May and June 2014. Actual disbursements reach 92%, and committed funds bring
                         disbursements up to 99%. At closing, it is expected that the project will have 180K USD unused.
                         Subcomponent 1.1 Irrigation Improvements is completing the modernization of the last 2 irrigation systems (of a total of 55 systems). All remaining works will be completed before
                         closing date (June, 30 2014). The Task Team has confirmed through field visits the high level of progress towards meeting project objectives. During field visits, beneficiaries have
                         expressed their satisfaction and requested extension of training services provided by the project (operation and maintenance, irrigation and agro-ecological production, etc.) which

                         Sub-component 1.2 Road improvement. This sub-component has been fully implemented with success both with regard to completion of works and provision of strengthening
                         activities to the local institutions in charge of road maintenance (Asociación de Conservación Vial or ACVs).
                         The last supervision mission also supported the dissemination of the PIDD's experience and achievements through: (i) a workshop held in Riobamba with 60 participants; (ii) large
