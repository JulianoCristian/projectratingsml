   with moderate risk to development outcome. The Bank received\n            a moderately satisfactory performance rating while the\n            Borrower was rated satisfactory. Two restructurings took\n            place during this project. The first restricting was a level\n            two restructuring that: (i) adjusted Results Framework to\n            better reflect project activities; (ii) adjusted the\n            location of roads rehabilitation segments; reallocated\n            US$790,000 of loan proceeds to reflect actual costs at\n            sub-component level; updated project financing plan; and,\n            changed the name of the Borrower. The second restructuring\n            was also a level two restructuring which extended the\n            closing date by nine months to permit completion of several\n            large irrigation subprojects. For budgetary reason, team\n            leaders withdrew certain road segments targeted for\n            financing under Sub-component 1.2 and substitutes would be\n            needed. Roads eligible for Central Government financing\n            required final technical/feasibility studies. The project\n            generated several lesson including: (1) the project thrived\n            in large part because of a dynamic, well-connected leader\n            who championed its goals, owned the methodology, understood\n            the project\u0092s strategic context, saw the longer-term\n            potential for his province of working successfully with the\n            Bank. (2) Successful monitoring and evaluation performance\n            requires complete buy-in to a coherent progression of\n            research/reporting throughout, on the part of both the\n            Borrower and the Bank teams. (3) The indirect benefits of a\n            well-conceived investment operation can be considerable and\n            important. In this case, the strong emphasis on local\n            institutional capacity-building based on standards, rules,\n            rights and responsibilities had a marked impact on reducing\n            conflict among irrigator communities, liberating them to\n            focus on agricultural advancement rather than the constant\n            and corrosive struggle for water. (4) The design, content\n            and delivery \u0096 including culturally appropriate social\n            mobilization behind and communicating the desirability of\n            change \u0096 along with reliable, continuous technical and\n            financial support, market intelligence, and productive\n            organization and entrepreneurship, are basic pre-requisites\n            to secure farmer buy-in."}, "docdt": "2015-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
