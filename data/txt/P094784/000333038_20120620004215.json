The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the project\n            identified the need to restructure the project. Subsequent\n            missions in 2011 and 2012 provided the data and agreements\n            needed to prepare the project restructuring. This paper\n            presents the restructuring, which entails: (i) adjustment of\n            the results framework to better reflect project activities;\n            (ii) adjustments to the location of the rehabilitated roads\n            segments; (iii) reallocation of loan proceeds to reflect the\n            actual costs at the component level; (iv) update of the\n            Project financing plan; and (v) change in the name of the\n            Borrower. The evaluation highlights how beneficiaries are\n            contributing to the Project with both financial resources\n            and community work, and are effectively organized in Water\n            User Associations (WUAs), which represents a significant accomplishment."}, "docdt": "2012-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
