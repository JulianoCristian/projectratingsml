{"cdata!": "The main objectives of the\n            Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project are to improve the\n            efficiency of the transport and power sectors, support\n            private sector development, strengthen local institutions,\n            examine the possibility of developing indigenous sources of\n            energy, and preserve the capital investment already made in\n            the country's road network. The project comprises\n            elements of policy reform as well as investments. Policy\n            reforms will focus on modification of the institutional\n            framework to eliminate restrictive regulations in the\n            transport sector, and support rationalization of transport\n            and power tariffs. On the investment side, the project will\n            support the purchase of buses, vehicles and spare parts, as\n            well as construction of a new workshop. Also financed will\n            be transformers, conductors, meters and other equipment for\n            reducing losses and rehabilitating the power sector.\n            Finally, the project will finance technical assistance and\n            studies to help strengthen institutions in both the power\n            and transport sectors."}, "docdt": "1988-08-19T00:00:00Z"}
