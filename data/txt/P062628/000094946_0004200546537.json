development and facilitate investment programming. The\n            project has three components. The first builds the capacity\n            of the regional development committees through seminars and\n            thematic workshops; prepares and completes the regional\n            development framework (RDF); prepares regional public\n            investment programs (PIP); sets up regional data units,\n            public information centers, and regional economic accounts.\n            The second component funds regional information and\n            knowledge management. Specific activities include designing\n            methodologies to prepare RDFs and regional PIPs; designing a\n            regional information system; establishing a regional\n            economic accounting system; carrying out follow-ups and\n            ex-post evaluations; and designing and producing information\n            material. The third component disseminates the model to\n            other regions."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
