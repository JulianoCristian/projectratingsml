   .         e project was identified by the government and the        a&   during  199       was
  appraised and negotiated in December 1999. The Board approved a Learning and Innovation
  Credit for US$ 4.6 million     on March 3 1, 2000.   The Development Credit Agreement was
  signed on May 26,200O. The expected effectiveness date of the credit, as agreedin the Project
  Appraisal Document, was June 30, 2000; however, the credit became effective only on May
  24,200 1, signaling problems of commitment and complexity from the outset.




  2      The objective of the project was to assist the Government of Madagascar (GOM) and
  the country's economic regions in developing model methodologies and tools that would
  promote regional development and facilitate investment planning. This was to be done on a
  pilot basis in at least three economic regions, Menabe, Anosy, and Mangoro, along with other
  regions that might have chosen to participate as the project unfolded. The objective of the LIL
  was clear and important to the country's economic and social development, especially because
  regional and local economic growth led by private sector investment was critical to the
  economic development of Madagascar. Decentralizing the decision-making process for public
  investment, which would support private sector efforts in order to achieve economic growth,
  and build public-private partnerships in support of regional and local priorities, was necessary
  for the promotion of a more sustainable development.        Further, creating a better business
  environment in each region required better and more productive public investment, and such
  investment required better coordination across sectors, i.e. improved geographic integration,
  and a systematic search for ways to create synergy `between public and private sector
  investment.


  3      The project was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by
 the Board on February 18, 1997. One of the main strategic objectives of the CAS was to
. strengthen the public sector's ability to deliver quality services, thereby creating a business
 environment that enables the private sector to thrive. The project was expected to significantly
 contribute to achieving this objective by implementing the above activities.

(iv) adoptionof an acceptableProject ImplementationManual. The project only became
effectivein May 2001.

6       Implementationwas very slow from the outset and it becamerapidly apparentthat
capacitywas insufficient: the ProjectImplementationUnit was not equippedto follow up
contracts,take the agendaforward or makereasonableprogressin the executionof project
activities. Thecontractmanagerfor ComponentA alsoappearedto haveinsufficientcapacity

7       No commitment or support was provided by central governmentfor this project.
Madagascarconstitution provides for three levels of decentralizedgovernment:national,
provincial andcommune;in additionthere are legelprovisionsfor the regionallevel. The
selectedpilot regions,however,remainedinterestedin the project and becameincreasingly
fmstrated with the lack of project support. This was particularlyapparentin the Regionof
Anosy (Fort Dauphin) where the regional planning committee managedto sustain its
momentumdespitelack of supportfrom the project. The political crisis of 2002 and the
changeof two taskmanagersbroughtadditionaldelaysto projectimplementation.During the

Lessons learnt

 .    The following lessons can be drawn:

            i. As    a LIL    the project was "intended      to finance applied learning      and
               development,     and   is  judged   to  be    essential to    facilitate follow-on
                            rams within acceptable levels of risk, as such the project should
               provide structured sup ort for time-sensitive initiatives ."                  atio
               period of five years' suggests that the project was more intended as a
               freestanding activity rather than one that preparesfor follow-on actions.
           ii. The project design appears to have been overly ambitious in view of the very
               limited capacity of the implementing agency and the selected contract manager.


               interdependent components.
          iii. The turnover in task management might also have rendered more limited the
               chances of the project to succeed. Stability appears particularly important for
               innovative projects that operate without a clear institutional framework.
          iv.  Government at the time appearsto have been less committed to this project than
               the Bank and there was no manifest interest by the line ministry to support this
               initiative which would have reinforced decentralization.       While regions have
               legal status, the regional development committees which were to be the strategic
               partners of this LIL,     operate as consultatative bodies but without        legal
               recognition.
           V.  The project concept might *quite well have been ahead of its time.        The new
               government fully subscribes to the decentralization agenda and looks towards
               the regions as a key partner in economic development. This is becoming quite
               apparent in the government's growth pole program which relies heavily on the
               notion of regional development to leverage private sector initiative with public
               investments and which will be supported by a Bank project.
