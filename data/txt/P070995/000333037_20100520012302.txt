  1. Primary objective: improvement of basic services and facilities (through investments
in non-revenue generating socially oriented projects and programs) for low-income and
poor communities in under-served municipalities.
  2. Secondary objective: improvement of governance and capacity of local governments
to deliver services to the poor through better partnerships between poor communities and
their local governments in investment identification and decision making. The project is
also aimed at building the capacity of municipalities to lead community development
processes, thus increasing the voice of local communities in investment planning.

1.   Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The Community Development Project (CDP) was approved on 26 January 2001. The
International Development Association (IDA) Credit was signed on October 19, 2001 and it became
effective on March 26, 2002. An Additional Financing was approved on January 9, 2007 for which
the IDA Credit was signed on June 5, 2007, becoming effective on November 2, 2007.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background.        Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) is a post-war country and, as envisaged in
the Dayton Peace Agreement, BH evolved into a single sovereign state with a decentralized
administrative structure. The State of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the central authority and the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH ­ henceforth referred as the FBH) and Republika
Srpska (RS) are its two constituent Entities. [For the purpose of easy reading of the ICR, the
reference to the two Entities will be listed in alphabetical order].

The two Entities at the time of appraisal and to date are politically, administratively, and fiscally
autonomous. They had and today have different governance structures: the Federation is
decentralized, being composed of 10 Cantons with significant fiscal authority and their constituent
municipalities. The RS is centralized, with relatively few functions decentralized to its constituent
municipalities and no mid-level governments.

Following the end of the devastating war, BH launched an intensive and ambitious recovery program
(Priority Reconstruction and Recovery Program endorsed by the BH in 1995). The Program relayed
on international technical and financial assistance, with a particular focus on rebuilding the
infrastructure damaged by the war and securing long term peace. By the end of 2000, most of the
road, telecom, power, water and educations services were back in place, close to the pre-war
availability levels.

During the first four years of reconstruction, BH registered strong (but less sustainable) economic
growth rates (69 percent in 1996, 30 percent in 1997, 13 percent in 1998 and 10 percent in 1999 ­
affected by Kosovo crisis). This growth was accompanied by significant increases in the income and
welfare of the population, with per capita incomes more than doubled, from US$456 at end of 1995
to US$1,080 in 2000. However, most of the population was still worse off than before the war with
high regional disparities present both on economic growth and welfare. Half of the population of the
RS was below the poverty line and substantial differences existed among the FBH's cantons, with
Sarajevo and West Herzegovina having the lowest poverty incidence.

Sector background.       The rebuilding of the damaged infrastructure was initially supported by a
series of IDA financed projects including the Emergency Public Works and Employment Project
(PWEP ­ P045310), whose objective was to improve infrastructure damaged by the war and to
create short-term jobs through grant financing of small scale infrastructure projects. The PWEP was
largely based on a social fund model with municipalities able to apply for project financing in
accordance with clear eligibility and appraisal criteria. The project successfully achieved its
objectives.

The Community Development Project (CDP) was designed as a follow-up operation built on the
PWEP implementation capacity, providing grants to communities in under-served and low-income
municipalities. The CDP complemented the Local Development Project (LDP) that strengthened the
institutional and financial capacity of the more developed local governments and piloted a credit line
as a source of long-term financing for infrastructure in creditworthy municipalities.
The CDP aimed to address the following strategic sector objectives:

    ·   Strengthening the institutional capacity of poor municipalities to work with their
        communities, rather than creating this capacity in a Social Fund type of institution for this
        purpose;

    ·   Focusing on building trust and cohesiveness at the local level between government and
        citizens through contractual arrangements on governance issues;

    ·   Strengthening mechanisms for community participation in service delivery and increasing
        local government transparency and public accountability; and

    ·   Creating the possibility of channeling funds directly to poor communities for community-
        based initiatives, including "minority areas" or in support for refugees' return in areas
        excluded under the Lautenberg provision, if demonstrated that these groups would be direct
        beneficiaries.

Rationale for World Bank assistance. The rationale for a new IDA financed operation derived from
the need to continue the improvement of the infrastructure focusing on poor communities, not
targeted by the two previous projects (PWEP and LDP). The successful implementation of these
projects provided confidence for continuing the Bank's support within the framework of social
investment lending instruments.

The approach used for the CDP, differed from the PWEP in the sense that it included a wider range
of decision makers in the implementation of the works and management of resources. This approach
provided more appropriate mechanism to work with municipalities and strengthen their capacities to
better target programs and projects to low-income and under-served communities. The Project was
designed as a performance grant operation to municipalities.

The Project's focus on the poorer municipalities and communities was also considered as a rationale
for creating the enabling environment for safe and viable conditions under which people could return
home and rebuild their lives.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objectives of the project, as listed in the PAD, were:

    ·   Improvement of basic services and facilities for low-income and poor communities in under-
        served municipalities (through investments in non-revenue generating socially oriented
        projects and programs).
    ·   Improvement of governance and capacity of local governments to deliver services to the poor
        through better partnerships between poor communities and municipalities in investment
        identification and decisions. The Project was to build the capacity of municipalities to lead
        community development processes, thus increasing the voice of local communities in
        investment decisions.

The Key Project Outcome Indicators, originally approved, were as follows:

(i) Number of subprojects created;
(ii) Quality of work;
(iii) Quality and quantity of services provided to beneficiaries;
(iv) Level of employment;
(v) Number of final municipalities;
(vi) Demonstrated consultations mechanisms for meeting communities needs;
(vii) Collection of user-fee charges; and
(viii)Level of satisfaction with municipal services.
                                                   6
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators, and
Reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised during project implementation. An Additional Financing (AF) credit in the
amount of US$5.0 million equivalent was approved in 2006. The PDO remained the same with the
AF. The AF was approved because of the high demand for financing of a higher number of
identified eligible sub-projects and because of the satisfactory performance of the original project.
At the time, some of the Key Indicators were informally revised, to better reflect the results that
could be attributed to the Project. Since then, the following additional outcome indicators were also
monitored until the Project closed:

    (i) Improved access to basic services (water supply, local roads) in poor communities, in
    participating municipalities;
    (ii) Improved quality of basic services (water supply, local roads) in participating municipalities;
    (iii)Capacity of participating municipalities for systemic participatory budget planning (PBP);
    and
    (iv) Improved access and quality of social infrastructure in participating municipalities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The PAD included the following beneficiaries: poor municipalities and their communities were
jointly eligible for receiving performance grants based on joint proposals submitted to Project
Implementation Units (PIUs). Thus the Project focused on:

    ·   Those municipalities and communities which were not eligible under the LDP (e.g. those
        which were poor, badly managed and undeveloped);

    ·   Poor municipalities, which had been categorized and identified as the poorest, through a
        consensus from a range of stakeholders; and from these municipalities, those which
        demonstrated interest in participating in the Project;

    ·   Municipalities with a high degree of damage and displacement, and where people started to
        return; and

    ·   Minority communities who were poor within the municipalities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project aimed at improving the quality of basic infrastructure and services in poor communities
with low-income municipalities, while seeking to strengthen their institutional and financial capacity
to manage such services over the long-term. The scope and content of the components remained
unchanged with the additional financing (see Section 1.7). To achieve this, the following
components were included in the Project:

Component 1: Performance­based Grant Agreements (US$15.31 million equivalent or 86.85% of
total project cost at appraisal). This component provided grants as a mechanism to support non-
revenue generating investments to low-income municipalities and their poor communities. It focused
on improving service delivery, cost recovery, financial management capacity of local governments,
public accountability, and community participation. The grant applications were to support
investments with high social benefits such as: water supply, rural roads, bridges, schools, clinic,
market places etc, or services such as maintenance, waste collection, community recreation, parks,
lighting, day care etc.

Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building (US$0.75 million equivalent or 4.25% of total
project cost at appraisal). Given the successful experience of the Public Works and Employment
Project, the municipalities were considered to be a key implementing partner. Hence this component
                                                   7
was intended to build capacity at municipality levels to reach poor clients, through strong
partnerships with communities in identifying, implementing, and maintaining non-revenue
generating investments. The preparation of proposals for performance grants and the completion of
the contractual agreements were considered to be central to the participation of communities in
decision making and governance strengthening.

Component 3: Project Implementation (US$1.57 million equivalent or 8.90% of total project cost
at appraisal). This component financed the costs of the implementing agencies. The Project was
designed to be implemented by two implementing agencies (PIUs) - one in the Federation and the
second in the RS. These two PIUs were also responsible for implementation of the PWEP, in
partnership with municipalities, citizens associations, and NGOs. The PIUs were responsible for
coordinating project implementation, monitoring the activities and their results, and carrying out
financial management and procurement obligations.

1.6 Revised Components

No revision of the project components was conducted during the project life.

1.7 Other significant changes

Additional Financing (AF). The Additional Financing for SDR 3.4 million (US$ 5 million
equivalent) increased the amounts allocated to project components, but the components remained
unchanged.

        Component 1: Performance­based Grant Agreements (US$20.31 million or 85.95% of
        revised total projects costs)

        Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building (US$1.25 million or 5.29% of revised total
        projects costs)

        Component 3: Project Implementation (US$2.07 million or 8.76 % of revised total projects
        costs)


Extension of closing date. The Credit's closing date was extended four times as follows:

        Original Project. Although the activities of the original project were completed by the
        initial credit closing date (March 31, 2005), two subsequent closing date extensions (first
        extension until August 31, 2006 and second extension until December 31, 2006) were
        granted to bridge the AF, whose effectiveness was significantly delayed due to the late
        formation of the new governments, following the October 2006 elections. The extension was
        for a total of 54 months

        Additional Financing. The Credit for the AF closing date was initially set for August 31,
        2008, but given the delays in effectiveness its closing date had to be extended by 12 months,
        until August 31, 2009 to allow sufficient time to complete implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The project did not encounter factors that had a significant impact on its implementation and
outcomes.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) team rates design and quality at entry
Satisfactory. The project objectives, as well as its design, were relevant to the country's overall
situation in the post-conflict period, when reconstruction was the first priority. Also, the Country
Assistance Strategy dated June 2000 acknowledged reconstruction as one of the main priorities. The
project supported this CAS priority by: (i) strengthening and consolidating the governance
arrangements for creating a solid foundation for broad-based self-sustaining growth and democratic
participation, and (ii) building social sustainability by establishing affordable and equitable social
services.

The Project's structure was kept simple with only three components, most of the project funds being
directed to the first component (approximately 86 percent including AF), supporting the performance
grants to low income municipalities and their poor communities. The other project components were
designed to support the proper implementation of the first component, including complementary
activities that enabled the proper identification of the targeted municipalities, institutional capacity
building, and development and enhancement of the participatory process.

The design of the CDP drew lessons from previous Bank-financed interventions in the sector,
including by making important changes in terms of targeting and process approach. Thus, the CDP
targeted weak municipalities and their poor communities, and proposed an approach that promoted
citizens' participation in the decision-making process in municipal investment planning and
financing, while the PWEP targeted the most developed municipalities that identified and proposed
projects by themselves, as they were identified by their boards.

The Implementation Completion Report for the PWEP provided several key lessons which guided
the design of the CDP, such as: (i) investments in infrastructure have to be based on criteria including
sustainability, social, economic and environment impacts; (ii) need for improving the decision
making mechanisms in the identification of investments at the municipal level, so that they are
inclusive of communities and provide conditions for sustainable local level institutions; and (iii) the
institutional capacity building process is key to local development and the provision of services in an
efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner.

These lessons, were discussed during the CDP preparation, in a consultation workshop held in
Sarajevo (September 2000), which recommended that the following principles be considered (among
others) for the design of the CDP: (i) education of all the participant stakeholders about the project;
(ii) small financial support be provided to the unskilled communities for the preparation of their
proposals; (iii) flexibility should exist in relation to the amount available per sub-project; (iv)
particular attention be paid to the slow pace implementation sub-projects to prevent the loss of people
commitment to the sub-project; and (v) education, capacity building and administrative processes
used for the PWEP be applied to the CDP as well, with special emphasis on transparency and
accountability.

The implementation was carefully structured to enable a pilot phase to be conducted in the beginning
of project life, in 20 municipalities (10 in each Entity) before the full scale project launch. The pilot
was undertaken to check the suitability of the proposed design features related to the community
participation in the identification of needs and establishment of priorities, and the feasibility of the
co-financing requirements. The good results obtained in the pilot phase confirmed the
appropriateness of the design, revealing a great interest for the participatory process, as well as strong
willingness of the citizens for contributing (both cash and in kind) to the sub-projects.

                                                    9
Risk Assessment. The proper assessment of the risk factors that could have impeded the project
implementation and sustainability as well as the appropriate identification of the related mitigation
measures, contributed to the successful implementation of the project.

Three critical factors that could have affected the project sustainability were identified: poor
institutional capacity at the local level, financial constraints, and legal impediments. To prevent the
possible adverse impact of these factors, several risk mitigation measures were identified, considered
in project design, and monitored during implementation such as: (i) provision of technical assistance
to the municipalities; (ii) enhancement of participatory processes to build up ownership and enable
the mobilization of community contribution; and (iii) enabling legal framework for the signing of the
contracts for services and civil works, jointly by the PIUs, municipalities, contractors and
communities.

The ICR mission rates implementation as Satisfactory. The project was successful in delivering
most of its outputs under the three components and achieving all of its expected outcomes. The
Project was coordinated by two separate implementation units, one in the FBH and one in the RS,
both of them established as Government agencies.

In the FBH, the implementation was undertaken by the Foundation for Sustainable Development
(FSD/ODRAZ abbreviation in local language), which resulted from the merger of two other
previously operating foundations: Employment and Training Foundation and Local Development
Foundation. FSD has been coordinated by a Board of Executive Directors, chaired by the Minister of
Finance and comprising of seven Ministers from the line Ministries with responsibilities relevant to
this project. The Board met regularly and provided policy guidance and approved the major
decisions related to project implementation.

In the RS, the Project was implemented by the Development and Employment Fund (DEF),
previously known as Employment and Training Foundation. During project implementation, the
DEF was integrated within the structure of the RS Investment and Development Bank (publicly
owned banking institution), reporting to its Management Board.

The above-mentioned foundations (both previous and newly emerged) had extensive experience in
the implementation of World Bank-financed projects, so that no particular efforts were required to
develop implementation capacity at the beginning of the project life. They were properly staffed in
terms of number and technical expertise, for the entire duration of the project implementation. Both
implementation units (FSD and DEF) continue to function, currently implementing similar type of
programs with financial support from Entities' budgets.

A Mid Term Review (MTR) was carried out during the period March 15-April 17, 2004. The MTR
was mainly seen as an in-house joint learning exercise for a team of project stakeholders, including
the staff from the implementing agencies, local consultants, and municipalities, and was targeted to
the future actions that were to be implemented in the second part of the project life. As part of the
MTR, a public opinion survey was conducted among the beneficiaries of selected sub-projects. Some
of main conclusions of the MTR are selectively listed below:

    ·   Project beneficiaries were mostly satisfied with the results achieved in infrastructure sub-
        projects and considered these achievements as positive for restoring hope for better life.

    ·   The participatory approach for the identification and prioritization of community needs was
        extremely successful, and represented a remarkable departure from the previous PWEP
        Project.



                                                  10
    ·   Apart from the tangible benefits of improved infrastructure, the community participation
        promoted by the CDP facilitated the process of reintegration of people into local
        communities and municipalities.

    ·   Participation of community and municipality stakeholders was higher at the stage of sub-
        projects identification and lower at the stage of the decision making during the
        implementation of the sub-projects.

The report made also several recommendations, which were considered during the remaining project
implementation period, including the AF.

Over the life of the project, the implementation performance (including AF) was satisfactory.
Disbursements were low in the first two years of project life due to the lengthy processes of
consultations at community levels, but this did not affect the overall project performance. Thus, by
the time the AF was approved, the CDP had fully disbursed the initial allocation of US$15 million,
and basically completed all the planned activities.

Notably, due to the evolution of the exchange rates and strengthening of the Euro, the credit amount
SDR converted in dollar equivalent became US$17.32 million (USS$2.32 million higher than
initially anticipated), which resulted in the implementation of a higher number of sub-projects.

As noted earlier, the AF was approved in November 2006. The request was made as a result of the
high demand from the participating municipalities and their communities for financing a higher
number of sub-projects in the pipeline, which although eligible, could not be supported by the CDF
initial allocation. The implementation arrangements for the AF were the same as the ones in place
under the original project.

A total of 502 sub-projects were financed in 80 of the poorest municipalities, covering a wide range
of small investment needs in utility and social infrastructure and services areas. Initially, a number of
400 sub-projects were planned to be implemented. All the sub-projects were identified, prepared, and
implemented using a full participatory approach, involving more than 60,000 citizens in the
consultations held at various stages of sub-project cycle. This led to a significant increase in social
capital and stability at the community level, as well as to the increased awareness of citizens about
their rights and obligations. Thus, the CDP participatory procedures were internalized in the regular
activities of the municipalities, and also promoted a high level of co-financing from the
municipalities, communities, and citizens.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design, implementation, and utilization of M&E is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Design: Besides the key performance indicators initially considered for monitoring the project
results, the PAD included a larger number of performance output indicators.

Most of the key performance indicators were appropriate to measure the PDOs. However, some of
the indicators such as: quality of work, level of employment and collection of user-fee charges,
remained non-measured until the end of the project implementation, either because they were not
clearly defined or data was not available. For these indicators, the MTR Report (2004) and Impact
Assessment Study (2006) provided some progress information, as perceived by the stakeholders and
beneficiaries interviewed. Given the above mentioned deficiencies, the M&E section was rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

Other selected indicators were regularly monitored during the project implementation (as part of the
ISRs). When the AF was approved, some of the ISR indicators were detailed to be more relevant for
assessing the PDOs. These were systematically updated until the credit closing date. The Results

                                                   11
Framework Analysis section of the Datasheet presents the key performance indicators (as initially
approved), their baseline and target values (as defined during the early stages of project
implementation) and their final values (at ICR time), which were used for the evaluation of the
achievement of PDOs (Section 3.2 of the ICR).

Implementation and utilization: The M&E was based on fairly complex management information
systems (MISs) developed by the PIU in each Entity. These MISs incorporated data resulting from
the day to day implementation reports, periodical reports, supervision missions, and internal and
external evaluations, and proved to be useful sources of information in the final evaluation conducted
at the ICR stage, and for decision making during implementation.

In the FBH, the implementing agency (FSD/ODRAZ) opened and maintained a Web Page
(http://www.odraz.ba) in two languages (local and English), where rich information about the CDP
has been presented. Thus, information regarding project features, procedures, implementation
progress, sub-projects, and related contracts (values, workload, co-financing) is posted.

In the RS, the implementing agency (DEF) has in its MIS a significant amount of information related
to the participatory processes organized at the municipality and community levels.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguard Compliance Review

The CDP was categorized as a Financial Intermediary (FI) project. Since the Project was designed to
support non-revenue generating community-level investments that were not precisely identified at the
time of Project Appraisal, each sub-project was to be screened during appraisal of the individual sub-
projects. The procedures were outlined in the Project Operational Manual - POM (the section on
Environment corresponding to an Environmental Management Framework).

In addition, Annex 11 of the PAD included Terms of Reference (ToR) for environmental assessment
procedures during sub-project appraisals. Approval of the ToR was a condition of effectiveness.
The ToR included a checklist for a number of impacts, along with suggested mitigation measures for
the different type of projects such as water supply, minor construction, rural roads, small-scale
irrigation, domestic wastewater and sewerage, and solid waste management. Most of the investments
were rather small in scope such as the public lighting systems, pavement of existing roads and
electrification, and the key impacts associated with such activities were to include adequate
construction permits and proper waste management disposal sites designated by the municipalities
along with proper safety measures.

The CDP POM highlighted that it was the responsibility of the CDP's engineers to take into account
the impact on the physical, biological, and social environment of the concerned municipalities. In
addition, the CDP staff were to screen projects according to the Environmental Guidelines and
Checklist included in the POM. The checklist provided an easy-to-use screening list with positive
and negative points associated with each answer, where a negative total would immediately call for
adequate mitigation measures. The PIUs systematically monitored the proper use of the checklists
and provided adequate evidence, having all these lists on project records. The compliance with the
environmental safeguards was rated as satisfactory throughout the entire project implementation
supervision.

Procurement is rated Satisfactory. Both PIUs were staffed with experienced staff and properly
monitored the procurement activities conducted in a decentralized manner by the recipient
municipalities. All procurement activities were executed in accordance with World Bank's
Guidelines, and competitive procedures were adequately followed. No major procurement related
problems were encountered during project implementation. Procurement was rated satisfactory
throughout the whole implementation period.


                                                 12
Financial management is rated Satisfactory. In October 2009 (after the credit closing date), the
World Bank conducted a final review of the financial management arrangements at both
implementing agencies.
The review of the financial management arrangements confirmed that the financial management
system, including accounting, budgeting, and reporting, was adequate and satisfied the World Bank's
requirements, during the entire project implementation life. Also the two implementing agencies had
adequate internal controls. The audited financial statements were mostly received by due date and the
auditors' opinions on the financial statements were unqualified during the entire implementation
period and only minor points were raised in the management letters. The final audit of financial
statements for 2009 is expected to be done by June 30, 2010.
Regular quarterly Interim Unaudited Financial Statement (IFRs) were submitted on time and found
acceptable to the World Bank. Apart from slow disbursements during the first two years of
implementation due to delays in effectiveness, disbursements proceeded as planned and proceeds of
both credits were almost entirely disbursed.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

In the post-completion phase, the participating municipalities secured budgetary resources to cover
maintenance costs, in addition to the revenues obtained from the user fees formally collected for the
provision of various services.

No further investment operation is envisaged following the completion of the CDP at this stage.
However, during the ICR discussions, almost all the counterparts who the team met recognized that,
although a lot has been accomplished, a lot remains to be done. The participating municipalities
interviewed in both Entities mentioned that there is a high demand for such programs and many other
eligible proposals are already in the pipeline waiting for financial support.

Moreover, the RS Government is exploring the possibility of accessing further financial support from
the Bank to continue the implementation of similar programs in other municipalities, while the FBH
already provides budget support for further financing of selected eligible sub-projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Project's objectives were clear and valid for the entire project life, and continue to be relevant to
the country's social and economic development today. These objectives as well as project design
responded adequately to the typical conditions of post-conflict countries.

The latest Country Partnership Strategy for BH, dated November 12, 2007, acknowledges the
improvement of infrastructure and service delivery as critical needs for FY08-FY11, especially in the
poor rural areas, where almost 80 percent of the country's poor live.

The relevance of the CDP to the country's current context is also confirmed by the senior decision
makers from both Entities and State level, who noted during ICR discussions that still much needs to
be done to improve the infrastructure and service delivery especially in the poor areas, and expressed
the intention to secure new financial resources to continue implementing such programs.

For reasons elaborated above, the relevance of objectives, design, and implementation arrangements
was Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Overall rating for outcomes. For reasons elaborated below, the achievement of Project
Development Objectives is rated Satisfactory.

                                                   13
The primary project development objective - improvement of basic services and facilities
(through investments in non-revenue generating socially oriented projects and programs) for low-
income and poor communities in under-served municipalities - was measured by five outcome
indicators: number of sub-projects created [KPI 1], quality of work [KPI 2], quality and quantity of
services provided to beneficiaries [KPI 3, detailed in Data Sheet under KPI 9, KPI 10 and KPI 11],
level of employment [KPI 4], and number of final municipalities [KPI 5]. In addition, the ICR
assessed overall project achievements against the project objectives, taking into account other
relevant indicators, monitored by the project, particularly those related to project beneficiaries and
social capital.

Number of sub-projects identified in participatory approach and implemented [KPI 1]. The
initial target for this indicator of 400 sub-projects was increased to 460 sub-projects as a result of the
Additional Financing. By credit closing, 502 sub-projects were implemented (281 in the FBH and
221 in the RS) exceeding by 42 units (9.1 percent increase) the above mentioned revised target,
mainly as a result of a higher level of co-financing provided by the Government and participating
municipalities and communities (citizens). The overall average level of co-financing (60.6 percent
from the IDA credit), from various counterparts (Entity, canton, municipality and citizens) was four
times higher that the initial estimates (15 percent from IDA credit). By Entities, it varied from 57.4
percent from the IDA credit in the FBH to 75.4 percent in RS [Intermediate Output Indicator 1 ­
IO 1].

Quality of work [KPI 2]. Although listed as a KPI, this indicator was neither defined in the PAD
nor the Project Paper for AF. As it was not quantified it was difficult to measure. However, the
regular site visits conducted during the project implementation supervision, as well as the MTR
(2004) and the impact assessment (2006) revealed that all the sub-projects implemented continued to
produce effects in one or more years after their completions. Also, since not a single contract out of
the 502 implemented was terminated due to quality reasons it can be considered that the quality of
the works was satisfactory.

Quality and quantity of services to beneficiaries was monitored by three key performance sub-
indicators: (i) one for quality of services, in terms of impact of their utilization [KPI 9], (ii) one for
quantity, in terms of access to municipal services [KPI 10], and (iii) one for access to social
services [KPI 11] as presented below:

(i) The improvement of the quality of these services, as measured by [KPI 9], shows that the average
time spent by the rural residents to reach schools, health services and markets, halved from 3 hours to
1.5 hours in the FBH, and reduced to 60 minutes in the RS as a result of increased local
transportation provision. Thus, target of 450 regular lines of public transportation was also exceeded,
reaching the number of 496 lines (368 in the FBH and 128 in the RS). However, it is noted that the
quality indicator measuring the access time to education and health services is an imperfect proxy
that does not measure the quality of accessed services. The quality of these services could have been
measured through other sector specific indicators, which were not defined either during the
preparation or implementation stages.

(ii) Access to a wide range of types of small infrastructure and services has improved. Thus, the
Project supported the increase of available all-season local roads to the population from the poor
communities by 16.4 percent, from 7,000 km to 8,149 km (3,834 km in the FBH and 4,315 in the RS)
exceeding the original target of a 10 percent increase [KPI 10]. The number of households having
access to these kinds of roads, exceeded by 33.4 percent the original target of 150,000 households,
reaching the number of 200,214 households. Also the access to regular 24 hour water supply was
improved, having 119,209 households benefiting (82,318 in the FBH and 36,891 in the RS),
compared with original target of 109,250.

(iii) The improvement of access to social infrastructure was also observed in the participating
municipalities. Initially it was estimated that 200 playgrounds, 200 active centers of social interest
(libraries, youth centers, internet facilities, music associations, culture centers, sport clubs) were to
exist at the end of project implementation in the participating municipalities [KPI 11]. With a
                                                    14
number of 187 playgrounds (125 in the FBH and 62 in the RS), the target was missed by few units
only. The reason for having a lower number of playgrounds derives from the prioritization of the
community needs, resulting from participatory processes. A bigger demand for centers of social
interest was observed. Thus, at the end of the project implementation, 219 operating centers existed,
with 19 units more that initially envisaged. Also the number of 44,220 active members (14,220 in
the FBH and 30,000 in the RS) was twice higher that initially anticipated.

Level of employment [KPI 4]. This indicator is less relevant to the PDO since the project supports
investments in non-revenue generating projects, and it was not systematically monitored. However,
the civil works contracts signed under the CDP, provided activity opportunities to many companies,
allowing them to maintain their employment at constant levels. The public utilities and services
established under the CDP, contributed to some extent the promotion of employment for operating
these services. Few training programs delivered on agricultural activities as well as in small business
start-ups, enabled limited promotion of self-employment in farming and commercial/service
activities. Also, since the citizens co-financing was mainly in-kind, some short term employment
opportunities materialized. Some additional regular supplementary employment that could be
attributed to the CDP, was the one related to the few consultants hired by the PIU in RS, that
supported project implementation and facilitated the development of the participatory process at the
local level. Most of them were hired by the municipalities when the CDP implementation ended.
The MTR Report (2004) and the Impact Assessment (2006) mentioned these limited employment
opportunities but since they were not sizeable they were not monitored.

Number of municipalities benefiting from the CPD support [KPI 5]. Initially a number of 80 of
the poorest municipalities were envisaged to be included in the CDP. By the project end, 88 poorest
municipalities were included in the project, exceeding the target by 8 municipalities. The increase
was due to more poor municipalities' ability to comply with the co-financing participatory and co-
financing requirements.

The secondary project development objective - improvement of governance and capacity of local
governments to deliver services to the poor, through better partnerships between poor communities
and their local governments in investment identification and decision making - was measured by
three outcome indicators: demonstrated consultations mechanisms [KPI 6], collection of user-fee
charges [KPI 7] and level of satisfaction [KPI 8].

Demonstrated consultations mechanisms for meeting the communities' needs [KPI 6]. The
wide participatory process supported by the project involved more that 60,000 citizens from the
participating municipalities and communities in the identification, preparation, and implementation
of a wide range of sub-projects. Out of them, 6,000 citizens were selected as their representatives
and participated in the Community Action Groups that defined the final priorities for investments in
their constituencies.

The involvement of the citizens in the decision making process related to the identification and
implementation of sub-projects was complemented in some municipalities by the internalization in
their regular functioning of the Participatory Budget Planning (PBP). Thus in 32 municipalities (14
in the FBH and 18 in RS) a significant part of budget investments were made in the PBP approach
(70 percent in the FBH and 50 percent in RS), exceeding the initially estimated targets [IO 2]. This
also helped the municipalities to secure the needed funds and allocate them for further maintenance
of the investments made, thus ensuring appropriate sustainability.

Collection of user-fee charges [KPI 7]. As in the case of the KPI 4 (level of employment), given
the project's feature of supporting non-revenue generating projects, this indicator was less relevant to
the PDOs, and was not systematically monitored. However, the interviews with the representatives
of various municipalities from both Entities revealed that the collection user fee charges was not a
problem even for the poorest communities.

Level of satisfaction with municipal services [KPI 8]. The improved access to a wide range of
municipal services of reasonably quality was acknowledged by most of the citizens from the
                                                  15
participating municipalities/communities. The impact study conducted in 2006 in the beneficiary
municipalities, revealed that 51.6% of the interviewed persons in the FBH and 61.8% in the RS,
considered that their living conditions have been improved as a result of the CDP.

Considering that all the monitored PDO indicators exceeded their initially estimated (PAD or Project
Paper for AF) targets, some of them with significantly high margin, the overall achievement of PDO
is rated Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

As most of the social development fund type of projects, it is difficult to provide an overall economic
and financial analysis because of the difficulty of quantifying the benefits in the absence of the
necessary data. Even in the case that data regarding the unit costs are available, as in the case of
CDP, the relevance of comparison is not that meaningful due to the wide diversity of sub-project
types and the local conditions where they were implemented.

While it was not feasible to calculate Economic Rates of Return for sub-projects, unit costs were
accurately calculated. The actual average total cost of sub-projects (including the contribution of
various stakeholder levels (Government, municipalities and communities) was US$ 72,582 [IO 3],
with some differences between the FBH (US$ 78,394) and the RS (US$ 65,192). These values were
higher than the initial estimates due to the increase (following the MTR) in the eligibility sub-project
cost from US$ 50,000 to US$ 100,000, and the higher co-financing secured from the municipalities
and communities.

Notably, for all the 502 sub-project implemented under the project, each US$ 1.00 from the IDA
credit, actually attracted an additional US$ 0.60 contribution from the Government, municipalities,
and communities (beneficiary citizens), exceeding the initial co-financing estimates. This indicates a
strong ownership achieved at the municipal and community levels.

The total average cost per beneficiary was US$ 35.9, again with slight differences between the FBH
(US$38.7) and the RS (US$ 32.3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The Project achieved its development objectives with only limited shortcomings.
Rating: Satisfactory

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Reduction. The Project targeted the underdeveloped and low income municipalities and
their poor communities, by providing those groups with access to basic infrastructure and social
services. The eligible communities were established according to certain selection criteria as defined
in the PAD (Annex 2). By project closing, 1,014,462 people from 366,329 household had benefited
from it.

Social Development. The participatory approach promoted by the CDP with the involvement of
beneficiaries in the entire sub-project cycle (in terms of consultations, decision making, co-financing
and project implementation), led to strong social capital building. It also gave a real ownership of the
communities over the implemented sub-projects. Such features of social development were hardly
acknowledged or did not really exist before the CDP. Only in the RS, more that 30,000 inhabitants
were consulted through questionnaires, and 2,000 people representing the participating communities
attended the meetings organized at various stages of the sub-project preparation and implementation.



                                                   16
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project led to visible institutional impact at the local level, promoting the municipalities' ability
to work in partnership with other stakeholders, and to gain their trust. The training provided to the
staff of the recipient municipalities helped to develop capacity to identify and prioritize the
community needs, prepare and implement projects, and follow-up to ensure sustainability.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Although the Project was intended to improve the living conditions in the participating communities,
and thus to enable the return of the refugees to their home sites, in practice it also enabled the
returned inhabitants in these areas to remain, preventing thus massive migration to more developed
areas or abroad, especially in the RS.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

As a result of the MTR reccomendation, an independent Impact Evaluation Report was prepared in
2006 (the initially envisaged credit closing date) jointly by the Economic Institute Banja Luka and
Kronauer. The evaluation, based on in-depth interviews with focus groups and workshops with
various stakeholders and beneficiaries, confirmed most of the MTR conclusions. Detailed reference
is included in Annexes 5 and 6 (merged).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: The ICR rate the risk to development outcomes as Moderate. The achievements of the
project are robust and the benefits gained from the sub-projects are benefiting the communities. The
institutional capacity developed by the project has been retained and is being used for the benefits of
the communities.

As mentioned above, the PDOs were achieved, and the short term sustainability is ensured for most
types of project investments. The training delivered to the participating municipalities' staff and the
experience accumulated by the sub-project committees enabled them to prepare maintenance plans
and adequately budget the related post completion activities. Also, the strong ownership built during
project implementation gives confidence that the community is interested in supporting the proper
maintenance of the investments made under the project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

At the design phase, significant attention was paid to the lessons learned from the implementation of
the previous PWEP and the recommendations of the consultation workshop conducted during the
preparation of the CDP (September 2000), as presented in Section 2.3 of the ICR.

The details of the proposed participatory approach were successfully tested during the pilot phase
carried out at the beginning of the project life.

Also the responsiveness of the World Bank team in the preparation of the additional financing was
acknowledged during ICR discussions.




                                                   17
(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Project implementation was adequately supervised by the Bank team with significant time devoted to
site visits, in which the World Bank Task Team Leader (TTL) and the supervision team attended
several meetings of community representatives getting thus first hand information on the way that the
participatory processes were conducted, as well as feedback from the end beneficiaries on the
implemented sub-projects.

Also, the wide range of technical skills and implementation experience that the members of
supervision teams had, enabled the provision of responsive and professional support to the
implementing agencies, during the entire project life. The pro-active technical and operational
support continuously provided locally by the World Bank office in BiH, as well as the good
communication with the Government counterparts from both Entities, enabled a smooth
implementation of the project.

The flexibility showed by the World Bank, both during supervision and during policy dialogue with
high level counterparts was highly appreciated by senior government officials from both Entities.
The agreement for increasing the sub-project size, from initially estimated US$ 50,000 to US$
100,000/ sub-project, and the flexibility in enforcing the co-financing requirements according to the
conditions of each community, are just two examples in this sense. Continuity in the World Bank
team helped the successful implementation of the project. The same TTL, who was responsible for
project preparation remained throughout project implementation. In addition, there was continuity in
the team based in the World Bank office in Sarajevo, who was able to provide guidance
systematically in between missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall World Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall World Bank performance can be rated as Satisfactory taking into account the following
features:

    ·   Promotion, through project design, of a participatory process at the municipal and
        community levels, that allowed the involvement of citizens in the identification, preparation,
        and supervision of sub-projects;
    ·   Proper identification of risk factors and related mitigation measures;
    ·   Adequate composition (skill-mix) of the supervision teams and frequency of supervision
        missions;
    ·   Systematic follow up by the locally-based World Bank staff in between missions, and
    ·   Flexibility of the World Bank team in the policy dialogue with the Government counterparts.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Although the post-war recovery period was difficult, the Governments of the two Entities remained
committed to project objectives and supported the participatory implementation approach.

Despite some occasional delays in the provision of the co-financing, overall project implementation
did not suffer. In the end, the Government co-financing exceeded the initial estimates, by providing
additional support to the poorest municipalities and communities, which were not able to secure the
required co-financing.
                                                  18
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The implementation arrangements with two existing implementing agencies (the FSD in the FBH and
the DEF in the RS) proved to be successful. The experience gained by these agencies during the
implementation of previously World Bank-financed programs saved time and resources that
otherwise would have been spent with initial setting up arrangements needed for project launch.
Their experience was beneficial for the overall project implementation performance.

Both implementing agencies had an active role in the increase of public awareness regarding the
importance of local governance and citizen's participatory role in community development and
cohesion.

The participatory process, which was the thematic feature of the project objective and design, was
managed differently in each Entity. In the FBH, the PIU (FSD) organized staff training of recipient
municipalities, which facilitated the participatory process and oversaw the sub-projects
implementation. In the RS, the PIU (DEF) hired individual consultants to assist in performing the
same tasks, including provision of close supervision of activities.

Interestingly, both approaches had similarly good results regarding the effectiveness of the
participatory processes, with some side particular effects in each Entity. In the FBH, this approach
contributed to local capacity building and institutionalization of processes, while in the RS the
implementation of the sub-projects through external consultants, was seen as being protected by
political interference.

The fiduciary responsibilities (procurement and financial) were properly conducted by both
implementing agencies, being rated as satisfactory for the entire project life. Also the environmental
and social safeguards were systematically monitored in both Entities, and all the activities were
reported as being fully compliant with the World Bank's safeguards policies.

The seriousness with which the M&E activities were considered, allowed the development and the
maintenance of rich databases that enabled the regular monitoring of the PDOs.

Both PIUs continue to function after Credit closing, implementing similar programs financed out of
Government resources or other donors.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower's overall performance is rated satisfactory, considering that:

    ·   Government's commitment to the PDOs remained high during the entire project life;
    ·   Counterpart funds and co-financing requirements exceeded the initial estimates; and
    ·   Both implementing agencies properly conducted all their tasks, ensuring adequate conditions
        for the timely implementation of all the project activities, as well as full compliance with the
        Bank's procedures.


6. Lessons Learned

Participatory process promoted by the CDP was critical to achieving a high ownership for project
activities. The large participation of the community in the various stages of the sub-project cycle
empowered the communities. It gave the feeling that citizens, as end beneficiaries, own the
                                                  19
investments and their results. It also made them aware of the rights and responsibilities they have,
and gave confidence that they are capable to manage their own development.

Significant local co-financing requirements were conducive to better sustainability of implemented
sub-projects. Although a certain degree of skepticism regarding the affordability of complying with
high co-financing requirements was observed during the project preparation phase, in practice, in
spite of the poverty widely spread among the members of the participating communities, their
willingness to contribute to the proposed investments was quite high. Their contribution promoted a
sense of being real shareholders thus providing an incentive to protect and properly maintain their
own investments, ensuring thus sustainability.

Flexibility in project implementation was essential to the success of the CDP. The wide variation
of local conditions and needs required a degree of flexibility, both in the identification and
implementation phases. Several atypical sub-projects (outside of initially envisaged typology) were
identified and implemented, with positive unforeseen results. For example the installation of a radio
power transmitter (in Pale/Praca) allowed: (i) access to various communications channels for both
public services (civil protection, police, health) and individual community members, and (ii) access
to internet services and establishment of a local radio station that broadcasts news about the local
events, as well as entertainment programs that can be accessed via internet by the Bosnians in
diasporas, keeping thus them informed on what is happening in the home land. Also, the flexibility
related to the local co-financing requirements enabled eligibility for several sub-projects identified in
extremely poor areas.

Identification and definition of the M&E indicators, is critical to the proper documentation of the
project performance. Although, it is widely recognized that the CDP satisfactorily achieved it
PDOs, some of the progress indicators could not be used in documenting this achievement, because
they were not monitored due to either lack of data, or unclear definition.
The absence of these data, had to be compensated by information resulted from the beneficiary and
stakeholder assessments (based on perceptions, rather than on institutional data), as mentioned in
Sections 2.3 and 3.2.

Note:
(i) The IDA credit (including AF) was 100% disbursed in SDR terms. However the tables above
show cumulative disbursements in US$ historical equivalents and hence the actual values are bigger
because of the SDR exchange rate fluctuations. The Borrower's contribution increased accordingly
also.

Component 1: Performance­based Grant Agreements. Total actual costs US$ 29.13 million
(IDA and Government) + US$ 7.3 million (Municipality and community participation).

The CDP selected and supported the implementation of 502 sub-projects (281 in the FBH and 221 in
the RS) in 88 of poorest and underdeveloped municipalities and their communities, that supported the
improvement of the local infrastructure destroyed by the war, the delivery of the utility (water
supply, sanitation, solid waste management, power, roads) and social services (health, education,
cultural and sport centers). More than one million citizens benefited from the CDP investments,
having improved access to quality infrastructure and social services.

All these sub-projects were identified, prioritized/selected and implemented in a participatory
approach where the citizens, as end beneficiaries and representatives of their communities developed
partnerships with the local administration, and other stakeholders. The cost-sharing (cash or in-kind)
of the communities and local governments, as well as the plans for operation and maintenance were
pre-requisites for the sub-projects eligibility. Notably, the total Borrower's co-financing (entities,

                                                  22
cantons, municipalities and communities/citizens) was much higher that the initial estimates. As a
result the total project cost (including AF) was US$ 38.32 million, which compared with the initial
estimated cost (including AF) of US$ 23.63 million, representing an increase of 162.16 percent.

The higher co-financing, enabled the increase of average size of subprojects from the initially
estimated value of US$ 50,000 to US$ 72,582/subproject, allowing thus access to more services of
better quality. The table below presents the level of project financing, by various sources.

Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building (US$ 1.25 million out of which, US$ 1.26 million,
Bank financing).

As key partners in the implementation of the sub-projects supported by the original CDP and AF, the
eligible municipalities got training and technical support to develop capacity to organize and conduct
community consultations, involving the citizens from their constituencies in the decision making
process related to the identification of the community needs, the preparation of investment proposals,
the implementation of the approved sub-projects and the follow-up to ensure their maintenance in the
post investment phase.

Following the training delivered to the staff of the participating municipalities, and the technical
support provided through the consultants hired, the participatory processes involved more than
60,000 inhabitants, in the local needs assessments and, more than 6,000 of them became the
community representatives and participated in the final selection of the sub-projects to be proposed
for approval.

The AF supported also training on participatory budgetary planning (PBP) for municipal staff from
32 municipalities which internalized PBP in their current practice, enabling the participation of the
citizens in the planning of investments to be made for their communities.

Component 3: Project Implementation (US$ 2.07 million out of which, US$ 1.39 million, Bank
financing).

The Project was implemented independently by two separate implementation units, one in the FBH
and one in the RS, both of them being established as Government agencies.

In the FBH, the implementation was undertaken by the Foundation for Sustainable Development
(FSD/ODRAZ abbreviation in local language), which resulted from the merger of two other
previously operating foundations: Employment and Training Foundation and Local Development
Foundation. FSD is coordinated by a Board of Executive Directors, chaired by the Minister of
Finance, and comprising of seven Ministers from the line Ministries with responsibilities relevant to
this project. The Board met regularly and provided policy guidance and approved the major decisions
related to the project implementation.



                                                   23
In the RS, the project was implemented by the Development and Employment Fund (DEF),
previously known as Employment and Training Foundation. During the project implementation the
DEF was integrated within the structure of the RS Investment and Development Bank (publicly
owned banking institution), reporting to its Management Board.

Both PIUs were properly staffed in terms of number and technical expertise, for the entire duration of
the project implementation. All the fiduciary responsibilities (procurement, financial management) as
well as safeguards compliance, were properly carried out by both implementing agencies, in line with
the World Bank guidelines and procedures. Both implementation units (FSD and DEF) continue to
function, currently implementing similar type of programs with financial support from the authorities
of both Entities or from other donors.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Community Development Project (hereafter called CDP), funded by the World Bank, is being
implemented in BiH since April 2002. Officially, expected date of completion is December 31, 2006
when all project activities would be finally implemented.

For the purpose of impact evaluation of Community Development Project, the survey has been made
during the period August-September 2006. The survey was carried out simultaneously in both entities
of BiH. The following report considers on results of survey by which Community Development
Project influence on local community capacity building where project was implemented, as well as
the benefits gained by stakeholders in BiH.

For the need of gathering all relevant information, the Economic Institute and Kronauer Consulting
have jointly designed methodology for in-depth interview and public opinion survey. Consultants
have agreed that Kronauer Consulting would be responsible for producing the Inception Report,
while Economics Institute would be responsible for producing the Final Report. Economic Institute
prepared the Impact Evaluation Report of the CDP in the RS, implemented by the RS DEF, while
Kronauer Consulting prepared the Impact Evaluation Report of the CDP in the FBH, implemented by
the FSD. In line with these two reports and analysis of answers given by the BiH citizens, the
Summary Impact Evaluation Report of CDP in BiH is provided at the end of this report.

Impact Evaluation Report focus on several important aspects. The First and Second Part of the
Report deal with objectives of this research and evaluation methodology (designing specific
evaluation forms, guide for in-depth interviews and questionnaires for public opinion survey), has
employed qualitative and quantitative survey techniques for obtaining the relevant information.
These can be briefly described as:

      ·   Desk study of projects documents: technical proposals, annual and progress reports, plan of
          actions, etc;
      ·   Compilation and analysis of available data from CDP management-information system;
      ·   Compilation and analysis of available statistics data;
      ·   Preparation and designing of the questionnaires for in depth interviews and public opinion
          survey;
      ·   Preparation and designing of data entry methodology;
      ·   Preparation of manuals for interviewers, pollsters and supervisors; and

                                                  26
    ·   Defining sample research.

The Third and Fourth Part of the Report look at CDP's development goals, and brief description
of project activities/procedures, as well as the analysis of CDP total investment value both by
participants in funding and subprojects.

Evaluation of social impact of the project referring to the effective social service delivery
mechanisms to the poorest segments of communities and strengthening the participatory approach in
decision making process on local level, resulted from discussions with key project stakeholders and
household survey with the selected representatives of the citizens, are provided in the Fifth Part of
the Report.

Overall, the findings of the survey reveal that the CDP has notably reached its objectives, having in
mind that:

    ·   There is a very high probability that small positive trends recorded regarding the economic
        and social impact can be claimed to be the result of the CDP implementation. This was stated
        both by the individual interviewees (citizens) and municipal officials and staff. Even though
        small but positive material/quantifiable economic effects have been reported, another impact
        equally if not even more important is the psychological effect that has been accomplished
        through the intensive cooperation among the population and municipalities as reported by the
        targeted interviewees. It especially relates to regaining the citizen's trust in sustainable
        development of local communities where CDP has been implemented;

    ·   Among all stakeholders significant level of the satisfaction with project's policies,
        procedures and sub-project impact has been recognized. It can be also stated with high
        probability that this has happened due to the successful CDP implementation. Some
        interesting proposals from very poor communities have been recorded also, and such
        examples are indicative by themselves about the level of cooperation reached;

    ·   It can be claimed with high probability that the level of the citizen's participation in decision
        making process on the local level has been significantly improved thanks to the influence of
        the CDP implementation. The Impact Evaluation Report concludes with key
        recommendations drawn from the survey results, and aimed at designing more suitable future
        project activities which would preserve their focus on improving social services delivery
        mechanisms to underserved local communities and promotion of partnership between local
        communities and their inhabitants.

KEY FINDINGS

a) Successful implementation of CDP has mostly depended on interest and engagement of mayors
   of the municipalities. Better results are achieved in municipalities where mayors were truly
   dedicated to resolve development problems in their own community and were they establish
   better communication with representatives of Foundations;

b) Municipalities from the sample have started with processes of strengthening and improving of
   local government after the implementation of CDP; the improvements can be noticed especially
   in so called Dayton municipalities, with no tradition or previous experience in local governance.
   In some cases CDP had direct impacts on improvement of situation in municipalities
   (improvement of social services, rehabilitating the infrastructure) and indirect impact on
   strengthening the economic activities and employment. These effects were also highlighted by
   the citizens in both BiH entities, since, according to both public surveys, the quality of life has
   improved in the past four years in local community/municipality where they live. The major
   achievements are gained in local phone network, construction and maintenance of roads, water
   supply system, local power network and street lightning, what also corresponds with the sub-

     the following table

Besides, the CDP contributed to the services quality improvement in municipalities. The respondents
are satisfied with kindness of municipal staff (59.1% of respondents are satisfied and 37% are not
satisfied) and service speed delivery (52.3% of respondents declared themselves as satisfied and
42.2% declared themselves as unsatisfied);

c) CDP project had multiple positive impacts on municipality development, comparing to the
   period prior to implementation of CDP. It is realistic to argue that CDP mostly generated the
   fundamental preconditions for revitalization of economic activity through infrastructure
   investments, and rising public awareness about importance of local government and citizens'
   participatory role. Citizen's participation in activities financed by their municipalities was
   unsatisfactory prior to the CDP implementation, since only 7.4% of respondents were involved in
   activities on local level, mostly related to the building construction (30%) and infrastructure
   rehabilitation (16%);

d) Created, improved and strengthened social service delivery mechanisms mostly due to direct
   impact of CDP project implementation process, comparing the situation before and after CDP
   implementation. When asked ''Which services from that program you have utilized?'', 26.6% of
   respondents mentioned ''economic investments'', 56.6% of respondents reported ''investments
   in cultural and sport acitivities'', while 72% of respondents reported `'environment
   investments'';

e) CDP impact on income generation and employment can be evaluated as direct and indirect.
   Through its parts, CDP has made significant impact on employment and self-employment
   promotion, and, to a certain degree, also had direct impact on increasing household's revenues.
   The key achievements were created fundamental requirements for increasing and strengthening
   economic activity, improvement of living conditions and creation of minimum basic conditions
   required for people to stay and work in their local communities. The influence on social and
   economic situation of local community residents involved in CDP was limited. Considerable
   percentage of respondents (35.7%) stated that CDP had positive impact on their economic status
   (23.2% of respondents perceived that CDP positively contributed to their households' budget),
   comparing to 31.3% of respondents who believed that the influence of CDP was unsatisfactory
   (54.8% of respondents stated that participation in CDP influenced their households' budget);

     At the BiH level, only 15.5% of respondents were directly involved in activities financed by their
     municipality in past four years, with opportunity to generate the income or some other social
     benefit;

f) Community development and cohesion, as two simultaneous processes in sample municipalities
   are improved, intensified and considerably innovated, comparing with the period before the
   implementation of CDP. Major benefit of CDP is promotion of participatory approach, where
   citizens and local community representatives are seen as key partners in community development
                                                   28
     and cohesion. Due to experience with CDP, municipalities initiated a budgetary financing of
     local communities; most mayors introduced an `'open door'' practice to discuss with citizens
     about their problems; they support initiatives where citizens are willing to contribute toward the
     financing of proposed project with 50 percents; local community's problems are being resolved
     through prioritizing the main concerns and participatory contribution based on CDP experiences.
     Nevertheless, as it is stated, the processes are just being initiated and improved, comparing to the
     period before the CDP implementation. When asked `'How would you define the development of
     your local community?'', 32.4% of respondents stated that local community was `'not
     developing at all'' or `'poorly developing'', while 19% of respondents stated that local
     community were `'developing good''. The second answer was the request for creation of more
     work places (22%) and infrastructure and economy investments (9.1%);

g) CDP played a very important role in regaining the citizen's confidence in local communities
   where they are able to make some positive changes by their own engagement. This experience
   should be taken into account since it represented some of the key levers of sustainable
   development of local communities. With CDP sub-project implementation citizens perceived that
   local community representatives truly listen and understand their needs and requirements since
   the processes of communication between them are improving, and that they should be entirely
   involved in work of local community, to control it and to be an equal partner in the development
   process. Based on public opinion survey results, CDP had enormous psychological effects on
   citizens since positive democratic changes occurred. 41% of respondents declare themselves to
   be satisfied with their social status, while 26.9% of respondents declare themselves as
   unsatisfied;

h) Sustainability of approach is determined by character of subprojects, i.e. long-term investment
   in public goods; during the period of implementation of this type of projects, the procedures and
   processes of local government work have been institutionalized, which made possible
   strengthening and creation of social capital which influence on local government became
   important and viable in processes of growth and development of both local government and local
   community. Majority of respondents revealed that such projects have a long-term impact for
   future generations, but they also emphasize that the World Bank should increase the grant
   amount, what would made municipalities eligible to increase their financial contribution in order
   to implement bigger and more costly projects highly ranked in priority listing and proposed by
   citizens, that could not be implemented earlier. Analysis of summary results indicated that
   majority of respondents (36%) believed that sustainability could be achieved by donor sources,
   while only 17.2% believed that it could be sustained by bank loans. It is interesting that only
   13.8% of respondents gave priority to public-private partnership, what is perceived as an
   important direct effect of CDP gained by the training and practical experiences;

i)   Multi-sectoral activities are created and coordinated by activities in several sectors, comparing
     to the period before the implementation of CDP. Project has generated the greatest benefits in
     municipalities which integrated public-private partnership in sub-project implementation.
     Citizen's financial contributions allowed municipalities to use resources more effectively in
     infrastructure related sub-projects for the benefit of all citizens;

j)   Processes of social, economic and society reforms have been initiated on municipal level, and
     then on cantonal and entity level, due to implementation of CDP. Special attention should be paid
     on subproject of inter-entity cooperation (example of bonus grant in Krupa na Uni), as well as
     ideas for cooperation between municipalities situated in both sides of inter-entity boundary line;

k) Approaches, methods and techniques created during the implementation of CDP have proved
   to be successful referring to effective work of all key actors and improvement of technical skills
   of municipalities to prepare themselves better for participation in such projects in the future.
   Implementation of CDP contributed to significant progress in organizational techniques of local
   communities, especially by implementing the examples of good practices provided by the
   representatives of the RS DEF and the FSD in the FBH. According to the opinions of
   respondents, clear and defined relations with both Foundations and clear rules and procedures,
                                                   29
     professionalism and discipline of all stakeholders in CDP implementation, partner relationship,
     and the burden of problems that need to be solved, were the most crucial for successful
     implementation of the project.;

l)   New methods and techniques that have not been previously used in local development process
     are developed. They brought positive change, introducing a plan driven local community
     development process in line with development objectives of municipalities because CDP
     successful implementation. These results were also the consequence of good technical assistance
     that PIUs staff provided to municipality's staff. The survey indicate that 55.5% of respondents
     are satisfied with changes in local community/municipality activities, perceived as citizen's
     delivery service mechanism in past four years;

m) Significant contribution to the poorest segments of communities through strengthening the
   social dialogue with partners in development process, i.e. citizens and local communities;

n) Citizen's participation in activities and decision making process in local communities where
   CDP was implemented is still on unsatisfactory level. Nevertheless, it could be concluded that
   CDP improve the knowledge of municipality authorities to involve citizens into the decision
   making processes. Identification of needs and selection of projects to be implemented were done
   with full citizens' participation.

     When asked `'Have you participated in any way in decision making process regarding the
     community development in your municipality in past four years?'', 71.6% of respondents gave
     negative answer.

     Majority of respondents (60.2%) are not satisfied with possibilities to participate in solving the
     problems in municipality/local community where they live.

     Citizens still have a habit to talk about their problems with the representatives of local
     communities (22%) and municipalities (34.9%).

     When asked `'Are you familiar with community development project?'', 41.2% of respondents
     gave affirmative answer, while 35.2% were aware of such projects in their local community. The
     following projects were highlighted: construction/reconstruction of local power and water supply
     system (34.2%), construction/reconstruction of roads (21.5%), renovating city library (11.8%)
     and investments in cultural and sport activities (7.6%).

o) Majority of citizens believe that local government is not efficient enough, and that is one of the
   major reasons for their dissatisfaction. Out of total number of respondents, 49.8% of them
   weren't satisfied with the activities of certain municipal offices, comparing to 44.9% of satisfied
   respondents. This statement is supported by the fact that 46.3% of respondents weren't satisfied
   with capabilities of municipal staff, comparing to 44.3% of satisfied;

p) Citizens perceived that the quality of life has been improved due to direct impact CDP
   implementation had on their communities. Major progress is achieved in roads construction and
   maintenance, improved water supply, phone and power network rehabilitation, maintaining
   public buildings and street lightning, where CDP invested the most. The respondents also
   emphasize that CDP prevented people from leaving their homes for bigger towns. When asked
   ''What should be done in your local community in future to improve your quality of life?'', 55.7%
   of respondents answered that ''better conditions for entrepreneurship development should be
   created'', 23.5% of respondents stated that ''the municipality activities should be improved'',
   22.1% of respondents indicated ''improvement of health protection'', 17.5% of respondents
   pointed out ''the improvement of water supply system'', while 12.3% of respondents indicated
   ''better quality of education'';

q) Communication between municipalities and citizens needs to be additionally strengthened, as
   well as their inclusion into the activities on local level, what could be explained by the lack of
                                                    30
    information about CDP objectives and activities and/or poor promotion of CDP among citizens.
    The survey indicated that 59% of respondents weren't satisfied with availability of information
    about budget and prospective projects in their municipalities. 38.5% of respondents understand
    how they can participate in decision making process related to the activities in their
    community/municipality.

    When comparing the communication between citizens and municipalities before and after the
    implementation of CDP, it is clear that the progress was very modest (the number of people
    satisfied with communication with their municipality in past four years increased from 56.3%
    before the implementation to 59.5% after the implementation). The number of respondents who
    assessed the communication as ''excellent'' and ''very good'' also increased from 6.7% before the
    implementation, to 14.6% after the implementation of CDP.

r) Positive results of CDP implementation have contributed to the implementation and
   standardizing the procedures into the local governance (transparency, methodology and
   principles of public procurement, priority listing of development projects, participatory approach
   in local community development).

Introduction

The Community Development Project (hereafter called the CDP), funded by the World Bank,
was designed as a follow up project of the Public Works and Employment Project (PWEP).
The PWEP was largely based on a social fund model, where all municipalities were eligible
to apply for financing for labor intensive local infrastructure sub-projects, based on clearly
defined eligibility and appraisal criteria. Working in partnership with 150 participating
municipalities, the PWEP has achieved its objectives of creating rapid, temporary
employment and repairing of damaged infrastructure during the immediate post-conflict
reconstruction.

The CDP has been implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) since April 2002 till
August 31, 2009 (closing date) i.e. December 31, 2009, which was the date when all project
activities were finally completed. The CDP was fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for BiH, and CAS objective of generating sustainable growth and expanding
benefits and opportunities of this growth to all citizens, including the most vulnerable.

BiH municipalities remained central partners during the project implementation. The CDP
particularly focused at increasing role of and partnership with communities and citizens in
project implementation. The CDP was implemented through two phases: the original CDP
2002-2007 (BOS 35380), and additional CDP financing 2007-2009 (BOS 35381). Additional
CDP financing was approved upon requests by the Governments of both Entities, based on
strong demand for project services expressed by participating municipalities and their local
communities. Both phases of the CDP were implemented with the same design and
implementing arrangements. PIUs responsible for the project implementation were
Foundation for Sustainable Development "ODRAZ" in the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (FBH); and Development and Employment Foundation in Republika Srpska
(RS).

CDP Project Design and Objectives

Through the CDP, the has been an important source of financing for investments in physical
and social infrastructure in the poorest municipalities and a critical leverage for municipal
reforms in terms of participatory processes for citizen involvement in investment planning.
With focus to the poorest municipalities, the project has supported stability at the community
level and invested in long term sustainability of the peace process and has launched a process
of long-term institutional change based on citizen participation. Project was focused at
investments financing, which strengthened ability of local governments to leverage and
mobilize resources while increasing participation of citizens in planning and decision making
process. The CDP aimed, from the beginning to the end, to increase partnership between
municipal governments and local communities/citizens and as result of it, to reach high level
of public and private co-financing of projects by citizens, municipal and cantonal
governments and other relevant stakeholders.


                                              33
Project development objectives were:

·   the improvement of basic services and facilities (through investments in non-revenue
    generating socially oriented projects and programs) for low income and poor
    communities in underserved municipalities; and

·   the improvement of governance and capacity of local governments to deliver services to
    the poor communities through better partnerships between poor communities and
    municipalities, building the capacity of municipalities to lead community development
    processes, thus increasing the voice of local communities in investment decisions.

To achieve project development objectives, the CDP was supported through three
components:

Component 1 - Performance Based Grants

The CDP provided grant financing as a mechanism to target non-revenue generating
investments to low-income municipalities and their poor communities with a focus on
improving service delivery, cost recovery, the financial management capacity of local
governments, and public accountability/community participation.

Poor municipalities and poor communities within these municipalities were jointly eligible for
receiving performance grants based on joint proposals submitted to the PIUs. Performance
grants were awarded on the basis of well developed proposals based on Community Action
Plans, developed by wide range of decision makers.

Eligible investments could include repair of infrastructure such as water supply, rural roads,
bridges, schools, clinics, market places etc. Services could include maintenance services,
garbage collection, community recreation, parks, lighting, day care centers etc. Selection of
investments in infrastructure or services sub-projects was based on proposals with well
defined plans including for operations and maintenance. It was foreseen that the PIUs will
appraise the proposed projects to verify their program eligibility.

Component 2 - Institutional Capacity Building

The project was to increase the capacity of municipalities to improve service delivery through
technical assistance and training. Capacity of municipalities was to be developed in the areas
of participatory and inclusive procedures. It was envisaged that this component be
implemented in close cooperation with the World Bank Institute.

Component 3 - Project Implementation

The project implementation arrangements envisaged implementation in partnership between
the two PIUs, municipalities and citizens associations and NGOs, as well as cantonal, entity
and other institutions which can contribute to project results. In the FBH, the PIU responsible
for the implementation operated as a part of the Foundation for Sustainable Development
(ODRAZ). In the RS, the Development and Employment Fund (DEF) was responsible for
project management. At the time of the project design the DEF operated as quasi-independent
Government Foundation while since 2007 it operates as an integral part of the RS
Development and Investment Bank (DIB).




                                              34
CDP Implementation

The most important CDP implementing partners in both the FBH and the RS were
municipalities, categorized as undeveloped and extremely undeveloped. The PIUs responsible
for the project implementation had the funding available to improve living conditions through
improvements in basic services and facilities and capacities of local governments, from
different sources.

Breakdown of financing by sources is outlined in the Table 1 bellow:

* in RS there is no cantonal level, these are all other sources of financing

Tasks for the PIUs responsible for the project implementation were:

    ·     to promote design and project objectives including developing partnership between
          all possible stakeholders, focusing at citizens participation as partners for investments
          decision making;
    ·     to increase awareness about importance of local governance and citizens participatory
          role in community development and cohesion;
    ·     to encourage all those most vulnerable to take active role in defining own and
          community future, as well as for the economic development and creating conditions
          for the return of those displaced or for the staying residents;
    ·     to act in re-establishing trust among citizens, local governments/entities level to
          participate in financing of investments with highest priorities, defined within
          community action groups, to the level significantly higher than documents required as
          a minimum;
    ·     to increase local governments capacities to deliver better services;
    ·     to implement as much as possible the most important and the most needed projects
          with participation of different stakeholders; to ensure in the field, that the project is
          implemented in accordance with the procedures (by local governments, bidding
          committees, contractors, supervisors)
    ·     to achieve agreed development objectives.

Project Achievements

    I.   Participatory approach results

Having in mind that performance grants were awarded on the basis of well developed joint
proposals, the CDP promoted and applied approaches and methods, which were not used
before, focused on the most important role of citizens and their representatives, as well as
local authority representatives, as the key partners. Participatory approaches under the CDP
enabled effective actions of all relevant stakeholders and created positive results:

    ·    in the BiH, 76 municipalities (39 in the RS, and 37 in the FBH) started with
         Participatory Community Assessment (PCA), where more than 60,000 inhabitants
         had active role in defining social needs, problems, priorities and possible solutions;
    ·    more than 5,000 people participated in community meetings to discuss results of PCA
         reports,
    ·    more than 600 citizens' representatives of their local communities, were members of
         Community Action Groups (CAG) in charge of defining final priorities in their
         respective municipalities that would be supported under the project;
    ·    each project application was co-signed by mayor, CAG president and representative
         of local community where projects were implemented,
    ·    each bidding process in municipality included CAG representatives and
         representatives of local community where sub-projects should be implemented, as
         well as participation of community representatives in steering committees (if
         community co-financed project).

By this way of implementation, the CDP procedures and activities have been institutionalized,
which enabled creation and increasing of social capital whose influence on the local
governments activities become essential and recognizable, necessary for development and
improvement processes in functioning of local governance, as well as local community.
Increased citizens awareness about importance of their rights and obligations to be active in
relations with local governments is crucial success of the project and crucial issue for further
local development.

These achievements enabled all other extraordinary multi-sectoral results of the CDP.

    II. Improved living conditions

Results of improving living conditions through improvements of basic services and facilities
(through investments in non-revenue generating socially oriented projects and programs) for
low income and poor communities in underserved municipalities can be estimated based on:

- Number of projects implemented in the field, projects typology and scope of works,
- Total value of implemented projects including IDA financing and all other sources of
financing,
- Rate of co-financing by citizens and others, observed through level of trust and cooperation,
- Number of projects' beneficiaries and households.

1. Based on demand driven participatory approached, the CDP implemented 502 projects
(221 in the RS, and 281 in the FBH) aimed to improve living conditions and to create
preconditions for local development and employment, among others:

         - 68 water supplying    (RS 33, FBH 35)          value - 7,320,317.00 USD
         - 105 local roads       (RS 47, FBH 58)          value - 12,134,660.00 USD
         - 29 sewage piping      (RS 17, FBH 12)          value - 2,814,278.00 USD

                                              36
        - 25 local power ntw. (RS 16, FBH 9)              value - 2,148,849.00 USD
        - 14 ambulances/health (RS 10, FBH 4)             value - 887,354.00 USD
        - 21 schools/education (RS 11, FBH 10)            value - 1,509,863.00 USD

2. The total value of implemented projects was 36,436,179 USD, out of which:

    -   in the RS, 221 implemented projects , value 14,407,513 USD, with IDA funds
        7,669,762.62 USD, and co-financing 6,737,750.38 USD (87,85% of IDA funds),

    -   in the FBH, 281 implemented projects , value 22,028,655,00 USD, with IDA funds
        14,459,000.00 USD and co-financing of 7,569,655.00 USD, (52,35 % of IDA funds),

3. The table 1 above showed how significant for the CDP implementation was co-financing,
especially from the point of encouraging citizens' participation in projects financing.
Government co-financing was as outlined in the Development Credit Agreement.

Local governments recognized importance of common actions, of mutual trust with all
possible financers, multiplication of results originated from this approach and found a way to
provide CDP with co-financing in the amount of 4,457,741.76 USD (RS 2,965,531.76 USD
and FBH 1,492,210.00 USD).

The final, but the most important source of financing was citizens' contribution for the project
implementation in the amount of 6,365,906.27 USD (RS 1,587456.27 USD, FBH
4,778,450.00 USD). At the same time, this was the most important result and the most
important condition for future planning in local communities.

This result of the CDP should never be lost in the field. Level of trust among the CDP staff,
local communities/citizens and local/entity government has shown how well-designed,
honestly and professionally managed project can give positive results.

Performance of the Borrower

Since the initiation of the Project, the Government of RS/FBH/BiH has remained committed
to the objectives laid out in the Project documentation and the strategies to achieve project
development objectives.

In terms of performance, the project implementation can be divided into two periods: original
CDP I 2002-2007 and CDP II ADF 2007-2009.

In the RS, at the time of the project design and original CDP implementation, the PIU DEF
operated as quazi-independent Government Foundation and project implementation was
without any kind of obstacles in close cooperation with other units within the DEF. The work
of the CDP PIU was very effective.

In FBH, the Project is implemented by the Foundation for Sustainable Development was
established by the Government of FBH.

In RS, at the time of CDP ADF implementation, since 2007, the DEF as PIU, operates as an
integral part of the RS Development and Investment Bank (DIB). Transition process of the
DEF into DIB, was not as smooth as expected, and some difficulties were experienced in the
transition period. However, a great experience of the CDP project staff, professionalism,
strong support from relevant ministries, Country Office, led to general satisfaction with the
successful completion of the CDP ADF.



                                              37
In the RS, there were three employees during the PWEP who continued during the CDP I, but
only two were in charge for the CDP ADF. Having in mind available IDA ADF funds and
officially required co-financing, it seemed appropriate.

Accumulated CDP lessons learned in the field and strong support of the Government, local
budgets and citizens created investments much more than initially expected. Short time for
implementation and status of CDP staff within DIB did not justified increasing of employees.

In the RS, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Governance and Self-governance
provided financial support but also policy advice and guidelines. Additional funding CDP
based on Memorandum with the World Bank was used to encourage citizens to co-finance
projects which were their priorities. Government funds of 1,000,000.00 KM/734,982.59 USD
were disbursed based on principle 1KM from citizens: 1 KM from the Government. In the
case of public facilities, a relation was established to municipal budget funding. These funds
mainly were reasons for unexpected increase of co-financing in the field.

The CDP as a project and CDP staff have received more than 60 awards and recognitions
from 30 municipalities for special contributions to local development and community
development.


Performance of the World Bank

The team was very effective during the implementation of the project, namely in the
identification of the needs before launching the Project, designing appropriate responses to
those needs, providing thorough supervision to the implementation of project activities.

The Project was designed to respond not only to the needs identified by the World Bank, but
also to the general priorities of the Government of BiH/RS/FBH. The organizational structure
of the project was designed to ensure efficient and effective institutional arrangements for the
managing of project activities, as well as to ensure effective coordination with government,
municipalities and local communities, and the donor community.

In terms of supervising the implementation the World Bank's performance was effective as
well. The financial and human resources allocated to this were sufficient to carry out effective
supervision and monitoring. Aide memoires were regularly prepared by the task team.

Having in mind that all implemented sub-projects have been subject of the World Bank prior
review in two phases before issuing bidding documentation and before contracts awarding,
just a professional relationship, timely action and sincere support could lead to successful
project implementation and achieved project development objectives. CDP staff owes great
gratitude to the World Bank Country Office employees and the TTL for excellent support.

Future Operation of the Project

The CDP showed how the project with clearly defined objectives, well-established
procedures, well-managed and coordinated with all participants, can create cohesion and
provide more than expected result. This is recognized by citizens, local authorities, relevant
ministries and government. Although CDP process was a time consuming process, it
generated better and sustainable results. CDP presented how available funds can be used in
the best possible manner.




                                               38
Based on it, the FBH Government, since 2008, has established a special budget line in the
amount of 3 to 5 million KM per year, to finance the Project for development of local
communities (PRLZ) following the CDP principles (with the same objectives and criteria).

In the RS, although the CDP is closed, municipalities continued to submit sub-project
applications, and continued to lobby with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Governance and Self-Governance that the CDP should continue. It is extremely important to
continue the same or similar project based on local funds or based on a new World Bank
credit.

        Comments on Draft Final Report

Dear Sirs,

         We, hereby, inform you that the Federal Ministry of Finance has neither complaints
nor any particular comments on the Draft Final Report for Community Development Project
(CDP), which we received enclosed to your letter of March 26, 2010.
         World Bank Mission's findings, evaluation and comments contained in the
Implementation Completion and Results Report are fully acceptable for the Federal Ministry
of Finance.
         I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the World Bank, you
personally and your staff, who have worked for many years on implementation of this Project,
together with local counterparts, for the achieved substantial effects, pointed out in the Final
Report, as well.
         Best confirmation of good results and achieved effects, through CDP Project, as well
as built institutional arrangements, both at local and Federation level, is reflected in the fact
that for the last three years, the Federation Government has been using the same
implementation capacities, following the same principles and eligibility criteria developed
under this Project for financial support provision from FBH budget resources for local
development amounting KM 3.0 to 5.0 million at annual level.
         Given that municipal requests and needs for local infrastructure reconstruction and
development by far exceed current capacity to provide support from municipal, Cantonal or
Federation level resources, we find it necessary to continue joint efforts on finding sources of
concessional financing for local development projects, which would contribute to faster
overall social and economic development of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a
whole. To that end, we expect your further assistance and initiative to design a new project,
which would be implemented with the World Bank support, benefiting from the good
experiences gained and lessons learned from CDP Project and other projects we implemented
together in the past.


Sincerely,
