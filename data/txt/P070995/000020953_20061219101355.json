No changes are proposed to the design or\n            implementation arrangements of the ongoing project. The\n            additional financing is expected to further strengthen the\n            results and outcomes achieved under the CDP by a continued\n            focus on financing investments which strengthen local\n            government abilities to leverage and mobilize resources\n            while increasing the participation of citizens in budget\n            planning and decision making. The project will directly\n            affect an additional 200,000 citizens in the poorest\n            communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and continue to\n            strengthen the capacity of participating municipalities to\n            deliver quality services to citizens while increasing\n            citizens access to municipal services.
