One of the\n            key lessons learnt in the course of the policy dialogue with\n            the Government of Orissa as well as with other Indian states\n            is the need for strong analytical underpinning for designing\n            effective state level policy based lending. This has been\n            adequately assured in the case of Orissa. Another lesson is\n            the need to take into account the political economy of\n            implementing reforms. For the reform program to gain public\n            support and be politically sustainable in Orissa, it is\n            essential to move beyond the original immediate objective of\n            fiscal correction, and address the key developmental needs\n            of this poor state. This lesson has informed and continues\n            to influence the design of the program and of the operation."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
