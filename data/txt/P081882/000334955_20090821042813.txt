1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 Over the course of the 1990s, as economic growth began to accelerate in India
following the liberalization of trade, investment and macro-economic policies, states
began to seriously compete for private investment. Fiscal management and investment
climate at the state level grew in importance. In line with this development, the focus of
World Bank assistance to India gradually shifted towards the states.
1.1.2. Alongside the growing importance of states for success of economic reforms in
India, the decade of the 1990s closed with a serious fiscal crisis affecting the vast
majority of states. The gradual build up of patronage politics and irresponsible populism
had led to fiscal deterioration over the decade; the large pay hike following the central
Fifth Pay Commission award announced in 1999 precipitated a crisis or near crisis
situation in all the states. The Government of India (GoI) faced increasing pressure from
states for special bail out packages. GoI sought the Bank's help in disciplining the states,
i.e., in inducing them to accept and abide by a hard budget constraint, in exchange for
quick disbursing and relatively cheap financing. The context was thus created for reform
linked budget support operations to qualifying states, consistent with the state focused
approach of the CAS.
1.1.3 Orissa is not only among the poorest, but was also one of the most highly
indebted states at the turn of the century. The Bank team produced two analytical reports
on Orissa, one in 1996 and another in 1999, both of which highlighted (a) significant
untapped potential for market oriented economic growth, and (b) acute fiscal stress and
structural imbalance in state finances posing the single most important binding constraint
to accelerating development in the state.
1.1.4 Following election of a new government in 2000, the state leadership decided to
take the public into confidence and commit to a major fiscal correction. GoO published a
White Paper on the dismal position of the state's finances in 2001; and approached the
World Bank for policy based financial assistance after signing a Memorandum of
Understanding with GoI to begin reforms to restore fiscal stability and create space for
effective public investment to address the developmental deficit. Orissa agreed with the
Bank's assessment that a tough fiscal correction was a prerequisite for accelerating
economic growth, poverty reduction and social development. This was the context for
preparation and appraisal of OSEDL-I, focused mainly on fiscal correction while also
initiating reforms to improve the climate for private investment and government
effectiveness in delivering services.       Satisfactory assessment of OSEDL-I (as
documented in the Simplified ICR Report No. 32765) was followed by preparation and
appraisal of OSEDL-II, strengthening the focus on economic growth while consolidating
fiscal adjustment and institutionalizing the process of modernizing government to
improve service delivery, with some success stories to showcase and emulate.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)




                                             1
1.2.1 The Government of Orissa's (GoO's) core development objectives, as articulated
in its Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002-07), include: (i) raising the rate of GSDP growth to 7-8
percent; (ii) reducing poverty by 7 percentage points during 2002-07 and by a further 15
percentage points during 2007-12; (iii) ensuring universal primary education for all
children aged 6-14; (iv) lowering the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) by 3.5 percent per year,
to 46 per 1000 life births in the next 15 years; (v) increasing access to safe drinking
water; and (vi) reducing the gender gap in wage rates.
1.2.2 With these multiple objectives in mind, the Orissa Socio Economic Development
Program was designed to focus on three key pillars:
(i) Economic growth-enhancing reforms
(ii) Fiscal and financial management reforms and anti-corruption action plan; and
(iii) Institutional measures to strengthen administrative effectiveness and service delivery,
with specific focus on school education and health care.
1.2.3 Table 1 shows the list of indicators that have been tracked during both the
operations. Those outcome indicators specific to one or the other operation only are
included in the Data Sheet but not shown here.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key

                                                          5
1.3.1 There were no revisions in PDO of OSEDL-I and OSEDL-II. Key indicators, as
agreed at appraisal of OSEDL-I, were reviewed and refined at appraisal of OSEDL-II,
adding some and dropping those that were either not relevant any more or not possible to
track. For instance, OSEDL-I had set targets for deficit reduction and for increasing
capital investment on budget starting 2004/05, after executing a Zero-Based Investment
(ZBI) review during 2002-04 to complete long pending priority schemes. However, two
developments made the capital investment targets unrealistic. First, it took an additional
year for GoO to complete long pending schemes under the ZBI review, and 2004/05
witnessed capital outlay declining as share of GSDP, and the overall fiscal deficit falling
to below 2% of GSDP. Second, recommendations of the 12th Finance Commission,
announced in 2005, required states to reduce fiscal deficit below the 2004/05 level to
qualify for performance based debt service waiver. This induced GoO to over-fulfill the
deficit reduction targets of the program, to avail of the debt servicing waiver, while
postponing the enhancement of capital spending to 2006/07, after having thoroughly
cleaned up its portfolio. The Bank team agreed with this strategy and decided to drop
capital spending targets from the OSEDL-II policy matrix. As it turned out, capital
spending on budget did increase starting 2006/07, and reached 2.7% of GSDP by 2007/08
from its lowest point of 1.4 percent of GSDP in 2003/04.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):
1.4.1 The original policy areas, agreed at the time OSEDL-I was negotiated, were: (a)
Economic growth enhancing reforms; (b) Fiscal reforms and expenditure policy; (c)
Public administration and financial accountability; and (d) Human development.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
1.5.1 The original components were not substantively revised, but consistent with the
concept of programmatic loans, the program itself evolved over time The relative
emphasis of the operation shifted from fiscal correction to growth acceleration and public
service delivery. The policy areas as formulated at the time OSEDL-II was negotiated
are: (a) Economic Reforms for Inclusive Growth; (b) Fiscal reforms, financial
management and accountability; and (c) Public service delivery and human development.
1.5.2 The change in formulation from the time OSEDL-I was appraised is to a large
extent an attempt to consolidate related components together, to form three key pillars.
Some of the changes, such as the introduction of the term "inclusive growth", reflect the
desire to address problems of social exclusion, which are significant and a major source
of risk identified at appraisal of OSEDL-II. The inclusion agenda was envisaged to be
addressed more strongly by a potential OSEDL-III, which has not materialized. For the
purpose of this ICR Report, it is appropriate to formulate the policy areas and
development objectives consistent with the Key Actions taken under OSEDL-I and
OSEDL-II, which are as shown in Table 1 above.

1.6 Other significant changes
1.6.1 When OSEDL-I was appraised, it was seen as the first in a series of single tranche
operations ­ potentially three such operations were envisaged during 2004-09. However,
the original design and schedule had to be adjusted due to the revised Guidelines issued


                                            6
by the Government of India in 2005, according to which state DPLs had to have at least
two tranches. As a result the appraisal of OSEDL-II was delayed, and so was the
processing of its second tranche within the Bank. Government of Orissa has sent a
request for OSEDL-III to the Government of India in late 2008, which is yet to be
forwarded to the Bank. Due to the delay in initiating OSEDL-III, which has now lapsed,
the first series of DPLs to Orissa is being considered as completed. Request for the next
operation may be considered as the beginning of a new chapter of second generation
reforms in Orissa.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)
2.1.1 All agreed prior actions for OSEDL-I and OSEDL-II, by design, were completed
prior to Board approval of each operation. Not only has there been no reversal of any
reform action since then, but there is considerable evidence of continued progress with
the implementation of the program. Subsequent to the approval of OSEDL-II in August
2006, Government of Orissa (GoO) has maintained the reform momentum along all three
key pillars of the program, and stayed within the agreed fiscal correction path during
2006/07 and 2007/08, qualifying for the release of the second tranche of OSEDL-II.
2.1.2 According to the latest estimates, GoO has been in compliance with the key
targets of the Orissa Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management Act 2005, not only
until 2007/08, but also in the first crisis year of 2008/09. The key target of achieving a
surplus on current account in 2008/09 has been achieved, according to the official revised
estimates. Public administration has been significantly streamlined and right-sized, and
innovations in service delivery have begun.
2.1.3 Significant improvement has been achieved in simplifying entry for private
investors in the state, starting with large-scale investors, and the outcome in terms of
private investment led growth acceleration has been a booming success. Economic
growth accelerated rapidly and has become faster than the rest of India since 2003/04.
Orissa gained first rank among Indian states for several years starting 2004/05, in terms
of the value of investment projects under implementation.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
2.2.1 Accelerated economic growth in India as a whole and continued progress
with national level reforms has created a favorable climate for the success of
reforms in Orissa. India's growth accelerated to reach 8-9 percent in recent years (2004-
08), far above the global average. Growth at the national level positively impacted
several sectors in the state; for instance, entry of major Indian information technology
companies into Orissa is a spillover effect of the rapid growth of that sector at the all-
India level. Rapid increase in central tax revenue, along with an increase in the share of
poor states in the national sharable pool, have contributed directly to the fiscal
improvement in the state.
2.2.2 Political stability is a favorable factor, which has made it possible to take a
protracted approach as well as to sequence the reforms sensibly. In the first period,
2000­04, fiscal correction in Orissa was mainly based on enhancing the state's own
revenues, which was politically less difficult than tackling the expenditure side. The


                                                        10
correction grew stronger after the 2004 re-election of the incumbent coalition and Chief
Minister, with significant expenditure containment and restructuring measures
accompanying tax reforms starting 2004/05. Acceleration of economic growth and
expansion of employment in the private sector made it politically feasible for GoO to
implement significant downsizing of the public sector during 2004­06. The medium to
long term perspective of the political leadership made it possible to over-fulfill deficit
reduction targets, so as to avail of conditional debt service waiver from the center, while
postponing recovery of aggregate capital spending to 2006/07.
2.2.3 Availability of technical assistance grant funding from DfID has been a
useful factor for the implementation of several components of the reform program.
DfID funded technical assistance has been especially effective and successful in the areas
of (i) investment climate reform and implementation of the policies in Industrial Policy
Resolution, 2001 of Government of Orissa (ii) VAT implementation, (iii) public
enterprise reform, (iv) computerization of treasury management, "(v) health sector
reforms including drugs procurement, and (vi) creation of a vehicle for channeling
professional expertise into reform implementation within government, called the Orissa
Modernizing Government Initiative
2.2.4 Increasing public awareness of the Right to Information is a factor that has
positively contributed to public accountability and anti-corruption efforts in Orissa.
The Anti-Corruption Action Plan adopted by GoO includes, as one of three pillars,
increasing `voice' and public awareness about rights and entitlements. The national
legislation on the Right to Information (RTI), and the pro-active role being played by the
State Information Commission (SIC) in Orissa, in collaboration with Non-Governmental
Organizations and rights activists, have strengthened this pillar. The SIC has published
people friendly pamphlets on RTI, not only in Oriya and Hindi but also in several tribal
dialects, including Santhali, Munda, Desia, Koya, Sadri, Saura, Kui and Kuvi -- an
unprecedented step in reaching out to linguistic minorities. Implementation of RTI is a
factor exogenous to the program as originally designed, which contributes positively to
the environment for public accountability and deterrence against corruption. While there
are no reliable estimates so far of the total number of applications received by all
departments and public agencies, the number of complaints received by the SIC has
increased from 518 in 2006 to over 2000 cases in 2008.
2.2.5 A violent clash between state police and street protestors delayed the
appraisal of OSEDL-II and brought concerns about inclusion to center-stage. In
January 2006, Orissa police opened fire on those who were protesting against land
acquisition for a new steel plant, in which 11 persons were killed. This prompted the
Orissa government to adopt a consultative process steered by a Group of Ministers,
before undertaking a progressive resettlement and rehabilitation policy covering all
investment projects in the state. It prompted the World Bank to strengthen the social and
environmental impact assessment of the program, as well as risk mitigation measures,
leading to several months delay in the appraisal of OSEDL-II.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
2.3.1 Progress of the program has been monitored on a regular quarterly basis at
the highest level of the state bureaucracy, supported by periodic visits of the Bank


                                            11
team to supervise and to support implementation. The Finance Department has
institutionalized the review process through the issuing of periodic calls for progress
reports from all the departments concerned with the program.
2.3.2 Results framework has generally provided a robust basis for monitoring
progress, but experience has also revealed some weaknesses in design. The results
framework evolved from the first to the second operation, with the Monitorable
Indicators agreed at appraisal of OSEDL-II serving as the framework since 2006. One of
the Development Objective Indicators, viz., proportion of agricultural produce sold
outside government operated markets, could not be tracked because such data is not
generated by the state statistical system. This reveals a design flaw: the choice of
indicator was not realistic and could not be implemented.
2.3.3 Evaluation of impact and outcomes of the program was first done in 2005, as part
of preparing a Simplified Implementation Completion Report for OSEDL-I. The second
such evaluation is the present ICRR for the series of two operations, the single tranche
OSEDL-I and the two-trance OSEDL-II.
2.3.4 The program has also provided technical support to GoO for the creation of a
Poverty & Human Development Monitoring Agency, for improving institutional capacity
for generating timely and reliable statistics, including a comprehensive baseline of
poverty and development indicators. Bank assistance, complemented by bilateral grant
support from DfID, has led to appreciable strengthening of the capacity of the Directorate
of Economics and Statistics (DES), decreasing the time needed for data processing, in
some instances from several years to only a few months. Several publications including
"Orissa Budget in Brief", "Report on Estimates of SDP from 1950-51 to 2002-03 at
1993-94 base" have been prepared ahead of schedule.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
2.4.1 Government of Orissa has sent a proposal for OSEDL-III to the Government
of India, which GoI may forward to the Bank shortly. There is a strong case for
follow-on operations, in view of the unfinished agenda relating to inclusion and to
government effectiveness. Given the time lag since approval of OSEDL-II (in August
2006), the next operation could be considered as the first in a potential second DPL series
­ aimed at addressing government effectiveness, or the inclusion agenda, or both.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.0.1 Orissa has made an impressive beginning in accelerating socio-economic
development from a very low base, raising hopes that it could `catch up' with the
rest of India by 2020. Economic growth as well as the degree of overall fiscal
improvement has been faster in Orissa than in the rest of the country since 2003. Human
development is improving, with a long way still to go. Orissa ranked 11 out of 15 major
states on the aggregate Human Development Index (2001), the same ranking that it had in
1981; but it has begun to move up the comparative scale more recently. Trends in child
malnutrition indicate that Orissa has caught up with the rest of India from being much
worse in the past. Between 1998/99 and 2005/06, several key indicators showed more
rapid improvement in Orissa as compared to other states, especially the average of 7
other low-income states, including percentage of under-weight children, professional


                                            12
attendance at birth, and proportion of 6-14 year old girl children in school (Table 3).
However, increased female enrollment is yet to translate into higher female literacy.
Orissa also continues to lag significantly behind other states in rural electrification.

3.0.2 One major factor that has positively affected development outcomes is the
synergy between improvements in fiscal and economic performance. Fiscal reforms
implemented in 2001-04, including prior actions for OSEDL-I, contributed to economic
growth by speeding up the completion of public investment projects, such as long-
pending construction of roads, bridges, and irrigation canals, through a Zero-Based
Investment Review. Acceleration of private sector led economic growth during 2004-06
created an enabling environment for further strengthening and consolidating fiscal
correction (Figure A), through significant reduction in the salary bill. Without
employment and livelihood opportunities expanding in the private sector, GoO would not
have been able to win public support and move ahead with rightsizing the civil service
and retrenching employees of public enterprises, as envisaged under OSEDL-II. Nor
would revenue growth have been as buoyant as it has been during 2004-08.
3.0.3 Development outcomes were also favorably influenced by reforms not
covered under the OSEDL operations, such as Mission Shakti. This home grown
initiative of the Orissa government to empower women has contributed to the increase in
self-employment and small business enterprise. It has also contributed to improving the
social status of women within communities, an important factor for human development.

3.0.4 Addressing problems of social exclusion in Orissa is a major outstanding challenge. The
scheduled castes and scheduled tribes together constitute nearly 40 percent of the state's
population. The scheduled tribes suffer from geographical isolation, being concentrated in
the hilly interior regions and residing largely in small, remote villages and hamlets. The
intersection of social and spatial inequality plays out in markedly poorer outcomes in areas
where the scheduled tribes are concentrated. Addressing this problem to any significant
degree was beyond the scope of OSEDL-I and OSEDL-II. The problem of social exclusion is
being addressed through several DfID supported investment projects and through Bank
supported technical assistance for developing effective mechanisms for sharing the benefits
of mineral based industrial growth with local communities.3.1 Relevance of Objectives,
Design and Implementation
3.1.1 Economic and fiscal turnaround in Orissa are highly relevant for inclusive
and sustainable growth in India, a key objective of the national development plan.
The 1990s had witnessed accelerated all-India growth along with widening interstate
divergence, with several poor states (including Orissa) lagging behind, and also weighed
down by a high debt burden. Against this backdrop, Orissa's recent performance heralds
a welcome change towards convergence at the national level.

3.1.2 Fiscal turnaround in Orissa, through reforms implemented after wide public
consultations, provides a strong positive example for other states to emulate.
Reforms to restore fiscal health were of top priority in the conditions that prevailed in the
2001-03 period. One of the key factors for success was the consultative approach
adopted by GoO to address the structural imbalance in its finances. During 2001-03, the
state conducted a series of regional workshops, inviting academics, NGOs, and prominent
personalities to sensitize them about the fiscal crisis. The main message conveyed at
these events was that "business as usual" cannot continue, and a major paradigm shift
was required ­ that Government cannot be a direct job provider, but must encourage the
private sector to grow and create jobs. Public consultations were also held on the need to
privatize, close down, or restructure the majority of state-owned enterprises.
3.1.3 The Bank's policy dialogue with Orissa, which began in 2001/02, served to
fill an important gap in the implementation of the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for India. The fact that the Bank had three middle-income southern states as its
main focus in 2002 epitomized the tension between supporting reformers and reaching
out to the weakest. There was growing concern that really lagging states were being
overlooked. This concern was addressed by taking forward the difficult but fruitful
dialogue with Orissa, which ultimately led to two DPL operations in this very poor and
highly indebted state, with highly visible positive outcomes.

3.2.1 Regulatory reforms have reduced the cost of doing business in Orissa. While
OSEDL-I supported overall industrial policy development and initial measures to
strengthen the regulatory framework, OSEDL-II supported further measures to
significantly simplify entry for private investors in the state. Regulatory simplification

through the single window mechanism is continuing, and being drilled down to regional
and district levels. Between 2004/05 and 2005/06, the number of days required to start a
business, to deal with licenses and to enforce a contract all declined significantly (left
panel, Figure B). With these improvements, the cost of doing business in Orissa is now
comparable with the rest of India.
3.2.2 Private investment boom and accelerated economic growth have been
convincingly achieved. The economy of Orissa grew faster (8.5 percent) than India as a
whole (7.8 percent) during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period of 2002-07. This is a major
acceleration from the 5 percent average growth that Orissa experienced in the 1990s and
3.3 percent in the 1980s. Growth acceleration in 2002-07 was led by industry, which
grew at 15 percent in Orissa compared to 9 percent in India as a whole. Not only mining
but manufacturing has also grown faster than the rest of the country, and so have trade
and transport services. During 2004-05, investment rose to US$32 million, up from
US$0.7 million in 2003/04. Orissa rose to first rank among Indian states, according to
data compiled by the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, on "investment projects
under implementation". Private investments are dominated by mega-scale projects in
power, steel, aluminum and other metals, followed by investments in power.
3.2.3 A combination of factors account for the success in accelerating private
investment led growth, including the regulatory reforms by the state. In a closed
economy, there is little advantage of being a Coastal state, and Orissa hardly benefited
from its close proximity to the ocean during the first three decades after independence.
This, along with the freight equalization policy, which ensured that freight rates for
minerals are equal across the country, annulled Orissa's geographical advantage of being
closer to the mineral base. Consequently, it became largely a raw material supplier to the
rest of India. In 1991, when India begun to gradually dismantle its industrial licensing
system and investment decisions were made by market forces, Orissa, with its poor
infrastructure network and low human capital base, initially lost out to the relatively
better-off states. It is only since 2003 that Orissa's share in both mining and
manufacturing sectors have begun to rise. New investments, unlike in the past, are having
a wider impact through forward and backward linkages.
3.2.4 GoO is making policy corrections to broaden the growth process and make it
more inclusive. GoO recognizes that there is increased potential for employment
intensive micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) to grow, as ancillaries or
downstream units linked to the large-scale industries that are growing rapidly. The
Industrial Policy Resolution adopted in 2007 focuses on broad-basing and strengthening
reforms in the regulatory and structural framework at both state and district levels, with a
particular focus on addressing barriers to investment faced by MSMEs and non-mineral
based industries. GoO has also issued a specific MSME Policy in February 2009.

DO ­ A2: More vibrant and diversified market oriented agriculture
3.2.5 Achievement of the objective of more vibrant and diversified market
oriented agricultural growth has been limited, and no reliable statistics exist for
measuring outcome. In addition to the legislative measure supported by OSEDL-II,
and follow-up measures to notify the Rules, GoO has introduced a renewed State



                                            16
Agriculture Policy in September 2008, which seeks to promote various liberalized
approaches to agro-processing and marketing. Public procurement of rice has increased,
but there is no statistical estimate available of the total quantum of private procurement
through direct purchases, including contract farming. Contract farming in oil seeds is
reportedly taking place in four districts, leading to higher rates of economic return for
farmers involved. Contract farming in cotton and sesame seeds have met with mixed
results: (a) in the case of cotton, proportion of produce marketed through the contract
route was 49% in 2006 and 57% in 2007 but fell to 22% in 2008; and (b) in the case of
sesame seeds, the contract could not be sustained after farmers received inputs from the
company, as they sold the output for higher prices available in the market and paid back
the input cost to the contracting company. The state authorities believe that the reforms
implemented so far have been a necessary beginning but not sufficient; and there is need
to implement additional measures.

DO ­ A3: Withdrawal of State from commercial activities
3.2.6 Highly satisfactory progress has been made in implementing the program of
public enterprise reform and privatization. The Public Enterprise Reform and
Privatization Policy, adopted after wide public consultations, is aimed at divesting from
commercial activities and reducing the fiscal losses, and facilitating private investment.
Since the inception of the program in 1999, 34,256 employees have been separated under
VRS/VSS, at a cost of about US$70 million; under the state's Social Safety Net Program,
supported by DfID. Over 10,000 workers have been counseled, of which more than a
third have been redeployed. A total of 11 privatization transactions have been completed
since 2003, exceeding the OSEDL-II target of at least 7. The Orissa Pollution Control
Board has worked closely with the Department of Public Enterprises to develop the
transaction guidelines on environmental matters. Environmental audit has been carried
out in the case of three public sector enterprises, namely: (i) Orissa Leather Corporation,
(ii) Orissa Seed Corporation, and (iii) Orissa Agro Industries Corporation.

DO ­ A4: Improve financial performance of the power sector and expand rural access
3.2.7 Moderately unsatisfactory progress has been made in improving financial
performance of the power sector, especially in reducing distribution losses including
power theft. Orissa was the state that pioneered power sector reforms in India, in the
late nineties. Reforms included the unbundling of the vertically-integrated power utility,
establishment of the autonomous Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC),
privatization of distribution, and 49% private participation (with management control) in
the major state-owned thermal generation plant. No budgetary subsidy has been provided
to the sector since distribution was privatized in 1999. Total fiscal savings is estimated
by GoO at US$ 1 billion during 1998-2008. However, reduction of distribution leakages
has been way below target. The sector's aggregate technical & commercial losses
(AT&C) have been reduced from a peak of 60.3 percent in 2001/02 to 40.9 percent in
2007/08, comparing poorly with states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal,
which have managed to bring down their AT&C losses to below 30%.
3.2.8 Efficiency of collection from (payment by) the government and its agencies has
improved but 4 percentage points less than target, and remains especially poor in the case


                                            17
of urban local bodies. Given that distribution had been privatized, and GoO could no
longer be held primarily accountable for distribution performance, a key objective
pursued under OSEDL operations was to improve payment of power bills by
government, which was clearly under GoO control. Aggregate collection efficiency by
all distribution companies from government departments in Orissa rose from 81% in
2004/05 to 91% in 2007/08, short of the target of 95% agreed at appraisal of OSEDL-II.
3.2.9 On the positive side, distribution companies are recovering their operating
costs unlike in the past. They are paying fully for their electricity supply and also
servicing some past dues, even though there has been no tariff increase for several years.
Collection efficiency and transmission and distribution (T&D) losses also show steady
improvement (Table 4). The state has set up 5 special courts and 5 energy police
stations; and an additional 29 police stations have been notified.

      2005/06                       91.6                 39.6                 44.7
      2006/07                       92.4                 38.6                 43.2
      2007/08                       94.6                 37.5                 40.9



3.2.10 Rural electrification has progressed slowly, but is expected to accelerate over
the coming years, posing new problems for financial sustainability of the sector.
Execution of works has begun in 4 districts under a new national scheme, with significant
acceleration expected in 2008/09. Given that this scheme does not cover habitations with
less than 100 population, GoO launched a complementary scheme in September 2007,
under which around 1000 habitations were covered by May 2008. Expansion of rural
electrification, where AT&C loss level is as high as 65 percent, would lower the
profitability of the distribution business, and may require re-introduction of an explicit
annual subsidy from GoO, which has ceased since 1996/97.

DO ­ B1: Achieve fiscal sustainability and avoid debt trap
3.2.11 Highly satisfactory progress has been achieved in fiscal correction and debt
sustainability. Orissa's fiscal stress was among the highest in India at the turn of the
century, as a result of over-expansion of government and public enterprise, with low
returns financed in part by high-cost debt from the Government of India. Salaries,
pensions, and interest payments exhausted the state's own revenues, as well as central
transfers. The fiscal crisis acted to galvanize reform momentum in Orissa, with policy-
based external assistance playing a catalytic role, and political commitment ensuring


                                           18
continuity and persistence. Orissa achieved the strongest fiscal correction among Indian
states during 2000­08, with the ambitious targets of the Orissa Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management Act being met ahead of time. In 2007/08 it enjoyed a surplus of 4
percent of GSDP on its current account, and an overall fiscal surplus of 1.2 percent of
GSDP. While new challenges have emerged as a result of the global economic downturn,
and a significant pay hike for civil servants to be implemented in 2009 and 2010, these
affect all Indian states, and Orissa is in a relatively strong position to deal with them.
3.2.12 The strength of fiscal correction is a result of GoO adopting bold revenue
raising and expenditure containment targets and steadfastly adhering to them, and
in addition benefiting from higher level of central transfers. Orissa is the only Indian
state where all sources of fiscal correction have contributed significantly in 2000-08.
While the majority of states have achieved an increase in their own revenues, hardly any
state other than Orissa has gained significantly both from revenue enhancement and
expenditure containment. The sources of improvement in the primary fiscal balance
during the period 2000-08 are shown in Table 5.

3.2.13 Orissa has implemented tax reforms very effectively, and sustained efforts to
modernize administration of Value Added Tax as well as other state taxes. The
state's own revenue has risen from 5.6 percent of GSDP in 1999/00 to 9.2 percent in
2007/08. The Value Added Tax Information System (VATIS), which has been
implemented with DfID support and is fully operational, also serves collection of taxes
other than VAT, such as the Central Sales Tax and Orissa Entry Tax. Training in modern
tax audit skills has been initiated, including the training of 20 in-house trainers.
3.2.14 Orissa has gained significantly from debt restructuring and the debt stock
and debt service ratios have fallen to manageable levels. GoO has used part of the
proceeds of DPL from the Bank to pre-pay expensive debt to domestic financial
institutions. It has qualified for debt relief under the Debt Consolidation and Relief


                                            19
Facility by passing the FRBM Act and reducing fiscal deficit to below the 2004/05 level
of 1.9 percent of GSDP. In addition, GoO has rescheduled high cost Government of India
loans at lower interest rates. As a consequence, it has saved Rs 1.6 billion in interest since
2002/03. Interest as proportion of total revenue, which rose to 35 percent and higher
during 2000-03, has been reduced to a comfortable 14.4 percent in 2007/08 (Figure C).

3.2.15 Satisfactory progress has been made in bringing down the stock of
outstanding guarantees: they are at about 2% of GSDP, down from 11% in 2001/02.
Over and above the immediate fiscal gains, the public enterprise program has also helped
to control the future build-up of liabilities and unproductive investments. During 2002/03,
GoO fixed the guarantee ceiling, and a Guarantee Redemption Fund was established, to
be utilized for meeting payment obligations from guarantees, if and when invoked.

DO ­ B2: Improve composition of public spending
3.2.16 Significant progress has been made in improving expenditure composition.
The ratio of the salary bill to the state's own revenues ­ selected by GoO as a key
indicator of its fiscal restructuring efforts ­ has been reduced dramatically from over 161
percent in 1999/00 to 48% in 2007/08. Capital outlay, which had been squeezed to 1.4
percent of GSDP in 2003/04, has recovered strongly to reach 2.7 percent in 2007/08.
Non-wage operation and maintenance has risen from less than 0.5 percent of GSDP in
2003/04 to over 1 percent in 2007/08, driven largely by increased spending on road
maintenance. The functional or sector composition of government spending (net of
interest and pensions) has shifted in favor of economic infrastructure and human
development (Table 6).

DO ­ B3: Improve budget formulation, execution, accounting and accountability
3.2.17 Satisfactory progress has been achieved in improving public financial
management and accountability. While OSEDL-I supported the development of a
government owned plan, OSEDL-II supported the implementation of that plan, which has
also benefited from a DfID technical supported grant. The new computerized Orissa
Treasury Management System, initiated in June 2005, has led to significant
improvements in budget formulation, execution and reporting of financial transactions.
3.2.18 Implementation of systemic reforms has started to produce positive results,
as seen in (a) reduction in the number of departments reporting expenditures in excess of
the appropriated annual allocations, from 12 in 1999/00 to 3 in 2004/05 and 2 in 2005/06;
(b) higher levels of compliance in responding to audit paragraphs as in 100% responses
noted for the Comptroller and Auditor General Civil Report for 2004-05 and 96% for the
Revenue Receipts Report; and (c) increased levels of utilization of funds under centrally
sponsored schemes (CSS). Utilization certificates submitted during the year for all CSS
schemes, in relation to the amount pending at the beginning of the year, increased from
68 percent in 2004/05 to 125 percent in 2007/08.

DO ­ B4: Reduce corruption and increase value from money, including through more
transparent and competitive process of public procurement
3.2.19 Significant progress has been made in implementing the state's Anti-
Corruption Action Plan, including procurement system reform. Vigilance offices,
with powers to investigate, have been established in all 30 districts. This has raised public
access to government's vigilance machinery: the number of cases registered last year
under the Prevention of Corruption Act was an all-time high. The conviction rate of
vigilance cases has risen from 29% in 2005 to 41% in 2008. Nine special courts to try
anti-corruption cases are running and three more have been notified. In addition, there are
two special courts to try cases of officials' disproportionate assets. The government's
dismissal of officials after their conviction in the first court has acted as a powerful
deterrent measure. However, while substantial reforms have been taken forward, the
challenge remains to develop anti - corruption programs at the sectoral and district levels.
The Detailed Implementation Review (DIR) of a Health Sector project in Orissa,



                                                  21
conducted by the World Bank, showed substantial leakages. Reforming corruption prone
processes across government is a long term process and part of the future reform agenda.
3.2.20 Implementation of anti-corruption actions has contributed to improved tax
compliance. The Commercial Tax Department has worked closely with the Vigilance
Department, which is responsible for the anticorruption and investigation functions. A
special cell has been established within the Vigilance Directorate, comprising tax
specialists. These specialists along with enforcement officials have the authority to do
spot checks on goods at check gates and directly collect fines and taxes. The Commercial
Tax Department has developed a practically independent tax enforcement function,
which has been responsible for collecting over Rs. 10 crore of penal taxes every year.
This has acted as a strong deterrent against tax evasion, with a positive impact on
compliance and tax revenue collections.
3.2.21 Procurement reforms have been initiated and progress has exceeded
OSEDL-II targets. An E-procurement Mission, staffed with government engineers, was
set up in late 2006. Large value construction tenders of seven major departments (Water
Resources, Public Works, Rural Development, Housing and Urban, Industry, Information
Technology and Agriculture) are now being advertized on the government's site, and on-
line bids are accepted. This method is being used for all tenders having value of Rs. 2
million or more, and will be further extended from April 2009 to cover all tenders above
Rs. 1 million. During the past year, more than 5300 tenders were floated online,
amounting to Rs. 1.3 billion (US$ 275m). To explain the process and familiarize users
with the system, GoO has trained 4800 potential bidders and owners of 200 cyber cafes,
where bids are usually prepared and submitted.

DO ­ C1: Streamline public administration and create institutional mechanism for
modernizing service delivery
3.2.22 Measures to streamline and right-size public administration have achieved
satisfactory outcomes. The public sector in Orissa had acted for years as the employer
of first resort, leading to a government work force proportionately much larger than in
most Indian states, with a ratio of public employees at 1.6 per 100 population compared
to an India average of 0.8. The first operation, OSEDL-II, supported policy formulation
in the form of a White Paper on Public Expenditure Management and Administrative
Reforms, which laid out a reform path for Orissa, and the implementation of actions to
reduce temporary staff. The second operation, OSEDL-II, supported the implementation
of the policy and set detailed targets for attrition based downsizing, through the abolition
of base level vacant regular positions, and through redeployment of staff. By the end of
January 2009, over 45,500 vacant positions have been abolished and about 3400 regular
employees identified as surplus and redeployed. The wage bill of the government has
fallen from 7.6% of GSDP in 2002/03 to 5.6% in 2004/05, and further to 4.2% by
2007/08. This is significantly larger downsizing than has been seen in any other state.
3.2.23 Orissa Modernizing Government Initiative (OMGI), an institutional
innovation for modernizing public administration and service delivery, has so far
achieved some modest results. The Human Resource Management System is still under
preparation. Personnel data for another 100,000 officials remains to be collected. A pilot
is being planned in the Planning and Coordination department. Besides creating an


                                            22
updated draft of the secretariat instructions, OMGI has responded to some ad hoc
requests by ministries. In the Housing and Urban Development department, common
audit errors have been identified; and a database of assembly questions raised and
answered was created for the Industries department.

DO ­ C2: Improve effectiveness of service delivery in education sector
3.2.24 Progress in improving the effectiveness of education service delivery has
been moderately satisfactory. Measures to improve effectiveness of public spending on
education, supported by OSEDL-I and II, were designed to (a) improve the composition
and results focus within education spending, (b) increase efficiency of the School & Mass
Education Department through a functional reorganization, and (c) enhance teacher
accountability in the school system. While the first objective has been achieved to a
considerable extent, efforts along the other two dimensions are ongoing and the key
outcome indicator has not been generated ­ viz., teacher absenteeism as revealed by an
independent survey.
3.2.25 Utilization of central assistance for elementary education has improved
significantly, while there is still room to improve. GoO has improved the composition
of education spending through (a) higher level of utilization of central grants available for
elementary education under the SSA program; and (b) rationalization of `grants-in-aid' to
secondary and higher education, to enhance value for money. Achievement of the first
objective is shown by steadily increasing levels of utilization of the allocations for SSA
in the state (Table 7), through higher levels of disbursement of the state's counterpart
funding requirement. .

  Table 6: Allocation and Expenditure on Universal Elementary Education (SSA)

                Year                 Allocation      Expenditure         Exp /

                2004-05                 640.04            280.61          44%
                2005-06                 654.44            384.39          59%
                2006-07                 939.60            657.79          70%

                2008-09                1050.41


3.2.26 Rationalization of `grants-in-aid' achieved important fiscal savings but is at
risk of slipping back unless a robust monitoring system is established. GoO started
in 2002 to address the problem of inefficient use of public funds in the form of `grants-in-
aid' to private higher education institutions, whose outcomes in terms of the number of
students educated did not warrant the level of public funding. As a first step, the Finance
Department began to publicize the outcomes delivered by grant receiving institutions, in
terms of the number of students passing the 10th and 12th standard school completion
examinations. This helped to win public support for rationalizing such grants. In
2003/04, GoO took a number of steps including (a) a complete freeze on new entrants
into the list of educational institutions eligible for government grants, (b) discontinuation


                                             23
of grants to 21 high schools where not a single student had passed the final examination
in the previous three years, and (c) replacement of wage bill linked grants by block grants
for all institutions that became eligible post-1994. However, since 2005/06, freeze on
new entrants seems to have been lifted, and it is doubtful whether adequate entry
qualifications are being enforced.
3.2.27 Departmental reorganization is beginning to yield results. GoO has
implemented the first phase of reorganizing the School and Mass Education Department,
including the introduction of computer based accounting system, electronic transfer of
funds to schools reducing time lag from an average of 70 days to one week, and
improvement in managing records and accounts by the village education committees.
3.2.28 Bold decisions have been taken to strengthen teacher accountability in
schools, but their implementation has been partial. GoO issued an Order authorizing
village bodies to certify attendance of teachers prior to their salary disbursement, but this
executive order has not been implemented. Significant progress has been made in
displaying information on resources allocated and spent at the school level; such display
of information has increased from 17 percent of schools in 2005-06 to about 90 percent in
2007/08. However, the decision to also display the name and photograph of the teachers
assigned to teach at the school has not been implemented. One positive and innovative
development is the formulation of a recruitment and career progression policy for para-
teachers, who constitute more than one-third of the total elementary teacher force. The
key indicator to be monitored, as agreed at appraisal of OSEDL-II, was teacher
absenteeism, for which a fairly reliable estimate exists for 2003/04. GoO had agreed to
undertake or sponsor another independent professional survey by 2007/08, which has not
been done.

DO ­ C3: Improve effectiveness of public service delivery in health sector
3.2.29 Some progress has been achieved in improving the effectiveness of health
service delivery. An agreed indicator to monitor this part of the program was the
percentage of children that have received all immunizations. The target was set at 65% of
children to have been covered by 2006-07, and 80% by 2007-08. The actual coverage in
2006-07, as determined by the District Level Health Survey, was 62%. Although survey
figures for 2007-08 are not available, estimates from the Health Department's own
records indicate that the target has been met. The steep growth in coverage is likely to
plateau somewhat during 2008-09 due to temporary shortages of measles and DPT
vaccines in India. OSEDL-I supported measures to rationalize drugs and equipment
procurement and supply. To further streamline this function, GoO has taken steps to
establish a separate corporation, with financial and technical support from DfID, to emulate
the positive experience of Tamil Nadu. To encourage local accountability, OSEDL-II
supported the transfer of paramedics to district cadres. This has been a huge task as it
involves the alteration of employment arrangements for several thousands of nurses,
laboratory technicians, radiographers, male heath workers, pharmacists and fridge
mechanics. The process has been completed in 2007.
3.2.30 Access to health services in remote areas continues to be a challenge. Health
facilities are very sparse interior tribal districts, so the government has deployed 95
mobile health units, each staffed with a doctor, nurse, pharmacist and attendant.


                                             24
Substantial allowances are being awarded to encourage doctors to serve in these areas.
More than 1,000 Ayurvedic (indigenous system) doctors have been recruited and
deployed to serve in rural areas. Further, the Chief District Medical Officer has been
authorized to hire retired doctors on contract. To reassure doctors about their security,
government has introduced an act containing severe penal provisions for those who beat
up doctors when a patient dies. Apart from increasing seats in the state's medical colleges,
three private medical colleges have been established. Simultaneously, the number of
radiographers and laboratory technicians being trained has been doubled.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Ratings: Satisfactory for both OSEDL-I and OSEDL-II
3.3.1 Achievement of key outcomes of national relevance has been highly
satisfactory in two out of three pillars of the reform program supported by each of the
two operations, OSEDL-I and OSEDL-II. Economic growth acceleration and the
turnaround in the state's fiscal position have both been beyond expectations, and
surpassed program targets in each phase. With respect to the third pillar of government
effectiveness and service delivery, with specific focus on education and health services,
outcomes have been more modest, yet satisfactory. The outcomes are highly relevant for
the achievement of national development objectives. Orissa's achievement serves as a
positive example to other poor states, and fiscally stressed states.
3.3.1 In the review of the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the ICR on the Socio-
Economic Development Loan/Credit-1 at the end of 2005, it raised the ratings in regard
to both Institutional Development and Bank Performance. This was notable, since IEG
considered the achievements to be above what the task team itself, perhaps
conservatively, judged the performance to have been. The second operation has in
essence continued with implementing the basic reform program and has improved upon it

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.4.1 Regional and some social inequalities within Orissa have begun to narrow,
while some others remain major outstanding challenges. Although Orissa's Coastal
region remains the wealthiest and the Southern region the poorest, the gaps did begin to
narrow during 2000­05. Real per-capita expenditure increased faster in rural than in
urban Orissa, and within rural areas, the highest expenditure growth was recorded in the
poorest Southern region. A wide cross-section of the population, including scheduled
castes, has gained from the expansion in income-earning opportunities since 2000.
However, the poorest 40 percent of the population has gained much less than the better-
off 60 percent, and most of the scheduled tribes remain among the poorest and continue
to lag behind.
3.4.2 Poverty reduction has accelerated in Orissa since 2000 and has perhaps been
more rapid during 2000­05 than in India as a whole. The data available from the



                                            25
National Sample Survey for 1993/94, 1999/2000, and 2004/05 are not strictly comparable
because of the mixed ­reference periods used in 1999/2000. Estimates based on the
"uniform reference period" indicate that poverty has declined much less in Orissa over
the past 10­12 years than in India as a whole, with the rural poverty rate declining by less
than 3 percentage points during 1993­2005 in Orissa, compared with 9 percentage points
in all of India. However, estimates based on the "mixed reference period" suggest that
during 2000­05, the poverty headcount ratio declined by more than 8 percentage points
in rural and 2.5 percentage points in urban Orissa, compared with 5 and 2 percentage
points, respectively, in India as a whole. The two comparisons, put together, suggest that
Orissa's performance has turned around from being much worse during 1993­99 to
probably better than the national average since 2000. Subject to caveats about
comparability of the MRP between 1999/00 and 2004/05, the best available estimate is
that the number of poor in Orissa declined by about 1.5 million between these two years.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)
3.4.3 Institutional change and modernization supported by the series of two DPL
operations is significant and an important foundation to build on. OSEDL-I and II
have supported several major systemic and institutional strengthening efforts. Following
the successful Zero-Based Investment review exercise initiated in 2002/03, GoO
introduced new investment procedures, including specification in advance of
departmental resource envelopes, giving priority to projects nearing completion and
requiring viability analysis for all new proposals. The establishment of the Orissa
Modernizing Government Initiative has created stronger incentives and an enabling
environment for departments to innovate and improve expenditure efficiency and service
delivery. Numerous home grown initiatives have been launched, such as (i) a new
Management Information System established by the Food and Civil Supplies Department
to enable more precise and timely monitoring of grain flows, off take and stocks in the
Public Distribution System, and (ii) measures to strengthen community oversight of food-
based programs of the Women and Child Welfare Department, including publicizing lists
of children entitled to special nutrition supplement, with quality certification by Mothers'
Committees. Cross-cutting systemic changes supported by the operation, and by DfID
technical assistance, include: (a) single window clearance system for private investments1,
(b) modern tax administration, (b) treasury management system, (c) transparent and
competitive procurement system, and (d) state government human resource management
and information system. Implementation has been completed and the modern system is
operational in the case of tax and treasury systems, and single window at the state level,
while the others are at different stages of implementation.


1
  Through the World Bank Institute's Capacity Enhancement Program in Investment Climate in Orissa, the
WBI has provided support to the implementation of the single window clearance mechanism through
workshops, training programs and an e-learning course on effective investment promotion for district level
officers and IPICOL staff.




                                                   26
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.4.4 The policy dialogue and technical cooperation between the Bank and GoO teams
during preparation, appraisal and supervision of OSEDL-I and OSEDL led to the creation
of a multi-departmental forum within the state government for periodical exchange of
views on reform progress and lessons learnt. This was an institutional development that
turned out to be a positive unintended outcome of these operations, given that different
line departments rarely talk to one another in their normal course of business.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

3.5.1 While there have been no beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop on the
OSEDL operations as such, workshops have been held on the main findings of the
analytical Bank report titled Orissa in Transition (2008). Academic researchers and civil
society representatives debated the economic and fiscal achievements and governance
challenges in Orissa, at a workshop held at the Nabakrushna Chaudhury Centre for
Development Studies in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, in May 2008. There was widespread
consensus that economic growth has accelerated and that the state has improved its
financial health; while divergent views and concerns were expressed about the
inclusiveness of economic growth, especially with respect to the Scheduled Tribes who
live largely in isolated tiny hamlets in Orissa.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Negligible to Low for OSEDL-I and Moderate for OSEDL-II
4.1.1   Risk mitigation strategy has progressed satisfactorily or moderately
satisfactorily except in the case of reform communication, and as a result the
political risk that mineral-based industrial investments may get blocked by mass
protests has not been adequately mitigated. In 2006, the OSEDL-II Program
Document identified 5 types of risk: (a) environmental, (b) social, (c) political, (d)
economic growth shock, and (e) lack of implementation capacity. Capacity building
efforts in the Orissa Pollution Control Board are progressing, to address the first risk.
Fiscal correction in 2000-08 has been so strong that Orissa will be able to weather the
impact of the civil service pay hike of 2008/09, and of growth slowing down in 2008-11,
better than most other Indian states. Ongoing investments are so large that Orissa is
likely to grow faster than the rest of the country when the upswing begins. Orissa has
gained experience in effectively using international and national professional expertise
for implementing systemic reforms in a number of functional areas, and lack of capacity
does not pose a serious risk any more. The only risk that remains a matter of concern is
the social-cum-political risk. Industrialization is still perceived negatively by various
parties and civil society groups. The Bank team has provided technical help to
operationalize benefit sharing mechanisms like the Periphery Development Fund to be
financed by sharing mining revenues. However, there is scope to strengthen Government
of Orissa's communication campaign to convince people of the benefits of


                                           27
industrialization and the possibility of managing it in such a way that everyone benefits,
through positive multiplier effect and by adequately compensating for negative impact
on some households and communities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: Satisfactory for OSEDL-I and Satisfactory for OSEDL-II
5.1.1 The Bank team showed patience, perseverance and a constructive problem
solving approach with the client during preparation of both operations. As a result,
there developed a relationship of trust and mutual respect between the Bank team and the
GoO senior officers' team; and the Bank could play a catalytic role in initiating the
process of difficult restructuring of the state's finances, involving both revenue
enhancement and expenditure containment measures. The Bank team was firm on the
necessity for a major fiscal correction, based on the analytical report produced in 1999.
Yet it was flexible in letting the state authorities work out the specific measures and
modalities, and in allowing time for GoO to build up adequate momentum for change,
establish concrete results and be encouraged by one's own success.
5.1.2 Over time, senior policy makers and managers in the Government of Orissa
have increasingly come to value the knowledge, expertise, technical and moral
support that engaging with the World Bank on DPL operations has brought. In
particular, the state officials value the multi-sector and multi-departmental forums that
have been created as mechanisms for monitoring the overall reform program of the state,
including the measures supported by the DPL operations. While initially attracted by the
concessional financing available for swapping old expensive debt, Orissa today values
the technical collaboration and policy dialogue at least as much, if not more than the
financing as such.
5.1.3 Design of OSEDL-II has suffered from some minor shortcomings in defining
outcome indicators, as in the case of agricultural marketing reforms (see para 3.2.6
above and 5.1.4 below).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Ratings: Satisfactory for OSEDL-I and Moderately Unsatisfactory for OSEDL-II
5.1.4 While the Bank team responded to the client satisfactorily, it was not
adequately focused on results during supervision and implementation support for
OSEDL-II. For instance, in the case of agricultural marketing reforms, the Indicator
agreed at appraisal of OSEDL-II was not possible to track. The state government did not
generate data on marketed agricultural surplus, not to speak of its disaggregation into
surplus sold at government markets and other channels. The Bank team did not
recognize this lacuna at any time during supervision, i.e., during 2006/07 and 2007/08.
This shows weakness in results orientation in the process of supervision.

5.1.5 Combining the rating of Satisfactory in Ensuring Quality at Entry with a
Satisfactory rating of the Quality of Supervision leads to an overall Satisfactory
rating for Bank performance in OSEDL-I. Combining the rating of Satisfactory in
Ensuring Quality at Entry with a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating of the Quality of
Supervision leads to an overall Moderately Satisfactory rating for Bank performance in
OSEDL-II.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory for OSEDL-I and Satisfactory for OSEDL-II
5.2.1 The reform program has been owned by the State, and is backed by political
commitment at the highest level. Key policy papers that underpin the program have
been approved by the Cabinet and GoO's strategy to accelerate growth and poverty
reduction is articulated in its Five-Year Plans. Continuation in leadership of the key
policy team in the Government of Orissa has greatly aided the ownership and
implementation of the program. Outcomes have been satisfactory for both operations, in
fact highly satisfactory with respect to economic growth and fiscal correction,
satisfactory with respect to anti-corruption actions, and moderately unsatisfactory with
respect to mitigating risks to development outcomes, especially in the case of social-
political risk associated with the actions supported by OSEDL-II.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1     One of the key lessons learnt is the need to take into account the political
economy of implementing reforms. Political stability helped to strengthen the program
over time, and to sequence the fiscal correction, starting with simpler measures and
tackling more difficult ones after re-election of the incumbent in 2004. Another lesson is
the need for effective public communication and consultation, to build support for the
reform program and minimize risk of social-political opposition. This was ensured by
GoO prior to initiation of fiscal reforms supported by OSEDL-I. Following political
opposition to land transfer for industrialization in January 2006, GoO adopted a
consultative approach to evolve a progressive Resettlement & Rehabilitation Policy.
There is need to monitor and report on its implementation, and to further strengthen
communication about the industrialization strategy and its benefits to the population.
Bank assistance is best provided in the form of technical assistance and advice, not as
legal agreements underpinning a lending operation.
6.2     The experience of OSEDL-I and II has shown how DPL operations can help
improve the enabling environment for investment projects. The improved financial
situation and the end of liquidity constraints enhanced the willingness of external donors
to place their faith in Orissa's future. The World Bank, which suspended preparation of a
State Roads Project in 2002, due to unsustainable state finances, has in 2008 approved a
bigger version of that project, as a result of the fiscal turnaround.

6.3     Orissa is one of the lagging states, and is poorer than most other Indian states. The
CAS emphasizes the need to assist the lagging states. The outcomes of the first two DPL
operations, as documented in this report, and the positive result of recent elections to the
Orissa Legislature, which has returned the incumbent ruling party (Biju Janata Dal) to
power with an absolute majority, for a third successive term (2009-14), provides an
excellent environment for the Bank to deepen its engagement with the state, including
through a new second generation DPL series. Second generation reforms are needed
especially to strengthen accountability and improve delivery of public services in vital
sectors of infrastructure and human development. The second DPL series in Orissa could
ideally consist of a series of single tranche operations, which is justified given the very
strong track record of responsible fiscal management by the state authorities.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
7.1     The Government of Orissa provided detailed comments on the draft ICR Report,
including updated data on the state's finances based on audited accounts for 2007-08,
which have been incorporated in this report. Suggestions to delete some sentences have
not been implemented, with reference to paragraphs 3.2.7, 3.2.10, and 3.4.1. In the case
of 3.2.7 and 3.2.10, the relevant sentences are factually correct and no reason has been
provided for the suggested deletions. The assessment in paragraph 3.4.1, that the poorest
40% of the population continue to lag behind, is based on analysis of National Sample
Survey data, as documented in the report INDIA: Orissa in Transition (Report No.
44612-IN).

(b) Cofinanciers
(c) Other partners and stakeholders
7.2     The UK Department of International Development (DfID) broadly agreed with
the assessment of outcomes as presented in this report. DfID noted that the Detailed
Implementation Review (DIR) of the Bank financed Orissa Health Systems Project had
exposed systemic weaknesses in the health sector, which are now being addressed
through DfID supported efforts to strengthen and reform the procurement process.

7.3      Comment: The OSEDL operations had been completed by the time the DIR was
published; and the post-DIR action plan, which is being supported by DfID and is
expected to be supported by the Bank through subsequent DPL operations, does not
strictly fall within the scope of this ICR report.

Annex 5. Comments of Co financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments of UK DfID:

Fiscal
While the state has made good progress and met all the indicators relating to
improvements in fiscal position so far, it is clearly concerned about the impact of the
economic downturn and of the implementation of the 6th pay commission
recommendations on its finances in the near future.

Education
We agree that bold decisions have been taken to strengthen teacher accountability in
schools, but, like so much else in Orissa's education sector, their implementation has been
partial. As for teacher absenteeism, GoO had agreed to undertake or sponsor another
independent professional survey of this phenomenon by 2007/08, which has not been
done. However, a national independent study of teacher attendance was carried out under
SSA during this year in 20 states, including Orissa. The results for Orissa were that
absenteeism was 24% in both primary and upper primary.

Health
We agree with Bank's overall assessment of progress on health as satisfactory. However,
the draft ICR Report does not make any reference to DIR which explicitly referred to
potential deficiencies within Orissa Health Sector systems.

Acknowledgement of DFID support
Thanks for acknowledging DFID's contribution to GoO's reform efforts in investment
climate, governance and fiscal performance. We will appreciate if you can mention our
support to health and education as well, In particular, our support to Health sector
procurement in Orissa (particularly post DIR) has greatly strengthened both the
transparency and effectiveness of state health procurement processes, resulting in
improved quality, cost, storage distribution, and general availability of drugs/equipment.
In addition, DFID support has also been instrumental in the state's commitment to
creating a drugs procurement agency on the model of TNMSC.
