development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Ratings for the Second Orissa\n            Socio-Economic Development Program Project (OSEDL II) for\n            India were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: one of the\n            key lessons learnt is the need to take into account the\n            political economy of implementing reforms. Political\n            stability helped to strengthen the program over time, and to\n            sequence the fiscal correction, starting with simpler\n            measures and tackling more difficult ones after re-election\n            of the incumbent in 2004. Another lesson is the need for\n            effective public communication and consultation, to build\n            support for the reform program and minimize risk of\n            social-political opposition. The experience of OSEDL-I and\n            II has shown how development policy lending (DPL) operations\n            can help improve the enabling environment for investment\n            projects. The improved financial situation and the end of\n            liquidity constraints enhanced the willingness of external\n            donors to place their faith in Orissa's future. The\n            World Bank, which suspended preparation of a State Roads\n            Project in 2002, due to unsustainable state finances, has in\n            2008 approved a bigger version of that project, as a result\n            of the fiscal turnaround."}, "docdt": "2009-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
