the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            The continuous availability of professionals in key\n            financial positions should be agreed during project\n            negotiations and it should be a legal covenant in the\n            project agreement. A gestation period of one year at the\n            outset of the project should be set aside for setting up\n            project management infrastructure, training of staff, and\n            formation of partnerships with outside stakeholders. It is\n            important that the government ensure that staff with a\n            procurement background are hired and are responsible for\n            contract administration. In addition there should be scope\n            for arbitration on non-government organizations (NGO)\n            contracts with a third-party, which can also help verify the\n            background and short-list potential NGO partners for the\n            program. Finally there is a the need to focus on completing\n            subprojects on time and ensuring utilization certificates\n            are issued in a timely manner. The project left these to the\n            end, and this resulted in a major campaign to ensure the\n            utilization certificates were issued towards the last six\n            months to ensure reimbursement from the Bank. The management\n            information systems (MIS) system should have been used to\n            track this more effectively. All new livelihood projects are\n            building robust MIS systems linked to financial management\n            software to track such milestones."}, "docdt": "2008-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
