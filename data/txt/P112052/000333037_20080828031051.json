social\n            screening process to allow for the identification,\n            assessment, and mitigation of potential negative\n            environmental and social impacts related to the construction\n            and rehabilitation of schools and special education centers\n            and related water supply and sanitation systems in the\n            schools. The adverse environmental impacts of the project\n            will mainly come from the rehabilitation and construction\n            works of the additional classrooms, schools, and teaching\n            facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems\n            (loss of vegetation, soil and ground water pollution, soil\n            erosion, generation of solid and liquid wastes). Mitigation\n            measures address:  (a) ensuring regular emptying, conduct\n            hygiene education campaign to raise awareness of the health\n            risks of exposed sewage, establishing and supporting\n            affordable pump out services; (b) establishing a system to\n            support the employment of a caretaker or routine cleaning\n            and maintenance; and (c) protecting water resources putting\n            them away from discharge areas of work sites wastes."}, "docdt": "2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
