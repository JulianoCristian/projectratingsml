Mozambique were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            government commitment at the highest level is critical to\n            successful implementation of key education reforms. For\n            example, dramatically increasing the number of teachers in\n            the civil service could have only been accomplished by the\n            government's budget and political commitment to this\n            expansion. Regular meetings with stakeholders to review key\n            monitoring indicators help in identifying key constraints in\n            the system, prioritization of those constraints and\n            interventions to address them. Increase in teacher supply\n            should be accompanied by a detailed and implementable plan\n            on continuous teacher education to ensure the increase in\n            teachers lead to an improvement in education outcomes.\n            Evaluations should be put in place during implementation to\n            allow evidence based decision making about scaling up\n            various alternative interventions. This was not done in this\n            program however it is planned in the next education project.\n            A results framework linking components to measurable\n            baseline and target indicators should be prepared in advance\n            of program implementation to be able to properly track\n            program progress."}, "docdt": "2012-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
