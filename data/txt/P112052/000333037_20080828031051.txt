                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I. Background

The S'trategicPlan for Education and Culture (SPEC) 2006-2011111 has recently been approved in the
Council of Ministers. The document is a result of intensive dialogue between government and its partners
that started as early as 2002. The approved five-year education strategy provides a credible framework
that translates Mozambique's political commitment to education into viable options for implementation. It
brings together a number of distinct components of policy and service delivery in a coherent way within
the context of current capacity and financial constraints.

Over the last four years, during which the strategc plan was being elaborated, a number of key policy
decisions have been taken in the areas that face major inefficiencies and inequalities, particularly in the
area of primary education:

1)      Introduction of new basic education curriculum;
ii)     Accelerated school construction at lower costs with community involvement;
iii)    Rationalisation of teacher training (in-service and pre-service);
iv)     Reform of technical and vocational education;
v)      Decentralisation of (financial) management, including direct support to schools.

The proposed Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (FTI CF) grant will contribute to the implementation of
the Mozambique Strategic Plan for Education and Culture (2006-2010111) (SPEC), by reducing its
projected financing gap in 2008, 2009, and 2010. The Catalytic Fund (CF) Grant will be channeled
through the Mozambique education sector donor funding pool, FASE, and will be implemented by the
Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC).

11.Project Components


The FASE annual program can be described in a general fashionbelow:

Comvonent 1: Primary Education. This component is designed to support improvement of access and
quality in primary education by building additional classrooms and new schools in rural areas (sites to be
determined); purchasing additional copies of primary textbooks, providing school grants, and
strengthening the provincial and district level education management capacity.

Comvonent 2: Non-formal Adult Literacy Program. This component is designed to support literacy
programs for adult learners by subsidizing trainer fees, developing and distributing teaching and learning
materials, and provision of training to provincial and district education officers involved in adult non-
formal education.

Component 3: Secondary Education. This component is designed to support development of secondary
education strategy and further to finance specific investment in secondary school construction (sites to be
determined), procurement of secondary textbooks, and grants to secondary schools.

Component 4: Teacher Training and Support. This component is designed to support in-service teacher
training programs. More than half of the primary teachers in Mozambique are considered "unqualified".
The component will also provide financing to strengthen school supervision.

Component 5: Special programs in Distance, Special, ICT, gender and HIVIAIDS Education. This
component brings together smaller programs under SPEC. It will support the construction of special
education centers (sites to be determined), procurement of hardware and software for ICT application at
the central and provincial level, procurement of sensitization materials for gender and HIVIAIDS
education and prevention, and development of programs in distance education and HIVIAIDS.

Component 6: Institutional Development. This component is designed to strengthen institutional capacity
of the Ministry at the central, provincial, and district level. At all levels of education administration, there
will be provision of equipment, technical assistance and training in policy development, monitoring and
evaluation. Emphasis is placed more at the provincial and district level.

111.Negative environmentaland social impacts

Under FASE, physical environmental impacts will result mainly from the rehabilitation and construction
activities. The environmental impacts are expected to be limited to (i) the management of wastes at the
rehabilitation /construction sites (waste water, solid waste, rejection and elimination of wastes such as oils
and paints, unsafe disposal of asbestos), soil erosion, loss of vegetation, rehabilitation of borrow pits, as
well as dust and noise during the works; (ii) issues around the water supply and sanitation in the schools;
(iii) high demand of wood for construction, e.g. furniture, windows; (iv) high demand for firewood for
cooking; and (v) use of chemical for the control of termites during the construction phase.

At the social level, the rehabilitation works can generate adverse effects, for example, risk of outbreak of
social conflicts; occupation of private lands during works; exclusion of vulnerable groups from
participating in and benefiting from project activities; land acquisitions/use resulting in involuntary
resettlement andlor loss of livelihoods or access to economic resources. FASE has prepared, separately, a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which will guide the implementation of mitigation measures
related to land acquisition should this become necessary.

IV. National Environmental legislation

At national level, there are various legal instruments approved in environmental field:

     -   The National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP);

     -   The Environmental laws: environmental law no20197, of October 1;The Land Law No19/97of 1
         October 1997;

     -   EIA regulations: The decree n045/2004of September, 29, related on the process of IEA;

     -   EIE guidelines: The decree no32/2003 of august, 12, concerning the Environmental Audit;
         Environmental quality standard

V. World Bank's Safeguard Policies

FASE has triggered two of the World Bank's Safeguard Policies, namely, OP 4.01 Environmental
Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The remaining operational policies are not triggered
by FASE. Annex 6 summarizesthese safeguardspolicies.

VI. Objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)

The objective of this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is to provide an
environmental and social screening process to allow for the identification, assessment and mitigation of
potential negative environmental and social impacts related to the construction and rehabilitation of
schools and special education centers and related water supply and sanitation systems in the schools. It
has not been determined which of the schools, training centers and related facilities will be rehabilitated.
According to Mozambique Environmental law, specific investment activities require EIAs, whereas there
are no clear EM requirements for activities of a smaller scale, but which might have negative localized
impacts that would require appropriate mitigation.

This is the reason why the FASE will use the environmentaland social screening process outlined in the
ESMF. This process will allow the FASE to identify, assess and mitigate potential negative
environmental and social impacts at the time they are planning rehabilitation activities, and, if necessary,
carry out separateEIAs should the screeningresults indicatethe need for such separateEIAs.

VII. Methodology used to prepare the ESMF

The present ESMF was prepared based on existing Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) which has been prepared for Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC), and general literature,
among them: the Mozambican Education Policy Framework, Mozambican Environmental Impact
Assessment Guidelines; and the World Bank's Safeguard Policies. Besides these documents, a lot of
consultations with various stakeholders for the existing ESMF, including communities and the general
public, were undertaken.

VIII. The screening process

The different stages of the environmental and social screening process are summarized in the following
paragraphs. The scope of the environmental and social measures required for the FASE activities will be
dependent on the results of the screening process. Thus, the results of this screening process will
determine whether (a) no environmental work will be required; (b) the implementation of simple
mitigation measures will suffice; or (c) a separate EM will be required. An Environmental Focal Point
(EFP) will be hired to implement the screeningprocess.

1. INTRODUCTION

Background:

The Strategic Plan for Education and Culture (SPEC) 2006-2011111 has recently been approved in the
Council of Ministers. The document is a result of intensive dialogue between government and its partners
that started as early as 2002. The approved five-year education strategy provides a credible framework
that translates Mozambique's political commitmentto education into viable options for implementation.It
brings together a number of distinct components of policy and service delivery in a coherent way within
the context of current capacity and financialconstraints.

Over the last four years, during which the strategic plan was being elaborated, a number of key policy
decisions have been taken in the areas that face major inefficiencies and inequalities, particularly in the
area of primary education:


vi)       Introduction of new basic educationcumculum;
vii)      Accelerated school constructionat lower costs with community involvement;
viii)     Rationalisation of teacher training (in-service and pre-service);
ix)       Reform of technical and vocational education;
x)        Decentralisationof (financial) management, including direct support to schools.

The proposed Fast Track Initiative CatalyticFund (FTI CF) grant will contribute to the implementationof
the Mozambique Strategic Plan for Education and Culture (2006-2010111) (SPEC), by reducing its
projected financinggap in 2008,2009, and 2010.

Mozambique prioritises education as an important strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction.
The Mozambique second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (2006 - 2009) highlights good
governance,economic growth and human capital development as three key pillars for growth and poverty
reduction. The SPEC translates the general principles of the PRSP into a clear strategic framework that
prioritises quality primary education for all within the context of an overall balanced education system
that would build the necessary capacity required to further national development.

The CF Grant will be channeled through the Mozambique education sector donor funding pool, FASE,
and will be implementedby the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC).

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT PROGRAM (2008-2010)

The Catalytic Fund (CF) grant will be channeled through the pool funding FASE, the description of the
program therefore pertains to the entire Education Sector SupportProgram financed by FASE, rather than
the CF grant per se.

Program Development Objectives @DO)

The Development Objectives of the Program are to support the implementation of the Strategic Plan for
Education and Culture 2006-2010111 (SPEC) approved by the Council of Ministers, in particular focusing
on primary and secondary education while ensuring capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Education
and Culture and its provincial and district departments in policy development, administration and
implementation,monitoring, and evaluation.


Description of FASE Annual Program Components

Though details of FASE program will differ from year to year based on the particular needs and gaps of
the year and as a result of consultations within the government and with CPs, FASE annual program can
be described in a general fashion below:

Component 1: Primary Education. This component is designed to support improvement of access and
quality in primary education by building additional classrooms in rural areas (sites to be determined);
purchasing additional copies of primary textbooks, providing school grants, and strengthening the
provincial and district level education management capacity.

Component 2: Non-formal Adult Literacy Program. This component is designed to support literacy
programs for adult learners by subsidizing trainer fees, developing and distributing teaching and learning
materials, and provision of training to provincial and district education officers involved in adult non-
formal education.

Component 3: Secondary Education. This component is designed to support development of secondary
education strategy and further to finance specific investment in secondary school construction (sites to be
determined),procurement of secondarytextbooks, and grants to secondaryschools.

Component 4: Teacher Training and Support. This component is designed to support in-service teacher
training programs. More than half of the primary teachers in Mozambique are considered "unqualified.
The component will also provide financingto strengthen school supervision.

Component 5: Special programs in Distance, Special. ICT, gender and HIVIAIDS Education. This
component brings together smaller programs under SPEC. It will support the construction of special
education centers (sites to be determined), procurement of hardware and software for ICT application at
the central and provincial level, procurement of sensitization materials for gender and HIVIAIDS
education and prevention, and development of programs in distance education and HIVIAIDS

Component 6: InstitutionalDevelopment. This component is designed to strengthen institutional capacity
of the Ministry at the central,provincial, and district level. At all levels of education administration,there

will be provision of equipment, technical assistance and training in policy development,monitoring and
evaluation. Emphasis is placed more at the provincial and district level.

The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)and the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) are designed to address potential adverse environmental and social impacts of future investments.
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will outline the principles, policies and procedures to be
followed in the event that future investments involve land acquisition which could lead to a loss of
livelihoodsamong affectedpersons.

These frameworks will also apply to future investments under the Education Sector Support Program to
be financed by FASE as well as future SWAps. Both, the ESMF and the RPF, will be disclosed in
Mozambique and at the Bank's Infoshop prior to the signing of the Grant Agreement.



3. BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRY

3.1. Biophysical Environment

The republic of Mozambique is located at the sub-east of Ahcan Continent. Tanzania borders it
at the North; Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Swaziland at the West; South Africa at the South
and Indian Ocean at the East. There are 799,380 km2 of national territory including inland
bodies of water. The country is relatively flat particularly in the coastal regions. From the coasts
to the interior in an east-west direction, there is a coastal plain (40% of the territory with the
highest population density); plateaus with altitudes of 200 to 1000 meters and finally high
plateaus and mountains over 1000 meters high. Mozambique's Indian coastline stretches for
approximately 2500 krn. The proximity of the sea and the richness of the Mozambican River
basins favor small scale and industrial fisheries. The country is rich in wild.life and natural
resources, such as coal and natural gas.

Soils
The northern and some parts of the central and western areas have red soils of varying texture
(from light sandy soils to clay loams). Low fertility red soils occur in Sofala province north of
Beira. Alluvial soils occur in the Zambezi river basin. Though prone to salinisation, particularly
in delta areas, these soils have a high potential for agriculture. Due to slope, shallowness of soil
ands high rainfall there is a high potential for soil erosion in these areas.

Climate
There is great variation in mean annual rainfall across the target area. Most of the coastline
receives 750 to 1,000 rnrnof rain per year. The interior of the Zambezi Valley, in Tete province,
is semi arid, receiving less than 600 mm average annual rainfall. There are a series of very humid
pockets associated with mountains areas e.g., Mt. Binga (Manica Province), Mt. Gorongosa
(Sofala Province) and Mt. Narnuli (Zambezia Province) which receive more than 2,000mm of
rainfall per year. There is a distinct rainy season between November to March followed by
adistinct dry season between April and October. Mozambique frequently suffers from floods,
cyclones and droughts that some times reach disastrous proportions, causing death of people and
animals, mass population displacement, negative effects on agriculturalproduction, etc.

Hydrology
Mozambique comprises thirty-nine major rivers which drain into to the Indian Ocean along the
country's 2,700 km coastline. The major perennial rivers of Zambezia province are the Licungo
(Lugela), Raraga, M'lela, Molocue, Ligonha and Meluli. The most important River in
Mozambique is the Zambezi. The Zambezi River enters Mozambique at Zumbo where it
immediately swells into the impoundment of Lake Cahora Bassa. The most important tributary
of the Zambezi is the Shire River, which drains Lake Mozambique via the Rift Valley.

Vegetation
In Mozambique the main broad vegetation type, based on structure, is savannah woodland. The
most common woodland type is "miombo" covering much of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Nampula,
Zambezia, Sofala, Manica and Inhambane provinces. There are several different types of
miombo determined by variations in rainfall and soils. The second most extensive woodland is
"mopane" wood.land occurring in the Limpopo- Save area and in the mid-Zambezi Valley.
Together these two types of woodland cover approximately 70% of Mozambique.

Other vegetation types include: Acacia woodland. There are two extensive areas of Acacia
woodland, a southern formation (in the area of Moamba, Magude and Guija) and a central
formation, running approximately in a north-east direction through Manica and Sofala provinces;
lowland palm savannah in coastal areas containing badly drained soils of Sofala province;
vegetation on alluviums in the Zambezi Delta. A seasonally-inundated lowland formation (the
Gorongosa "tandos") links the Zambezi Valley with the Pungue River in the south via the Urema
trough (Rift Valley); and Mangroves are well developed in coastal Zambeziia and Sofala.

Fauna
Mozambique has rich diversity of mammal fauna; 211terrestrial mammal species and 11 marine
mammals have been recorded. Only one mammal species is considered endemic to Mozambique,
a white-bellied red squirrel confined to Namuli Mountain (Zambezia province). Approximately
900 species have been recorded for southern Africa; of these 581 have been recorded in
Mozambique. There are a number of near endemic and restricted range species, mostly
associated with isolated mountains habitats such as Gorongosa (Sofala), Chimanimani (Manica),
Chiperone and Namrrli (Zambezia) Mountains.


3.2 Environmental potential constraints

Major environmental issues in the country can be classified in relation to either land degradation
or the erosion of biodiversity, both of which should be taken into consideration during both the
preparation and implementation on the Education Program

Land degradation

    -  loss of soil fertility - intrinsically linked to itinerant agriculture and it's shifting
       cultivation system and prevalent across all provinces;

        soil erosion - the area of great risk covers the central provinces of Manica, Tete and
        Zambezia;
        soil salinisation - a problem common to major river basins e.g. the Zambezi;
        soil acidification - typically a consequence of intensification of agriculture production;
        loss of vegetation cover - the driving forces are: forest clearings for agriculture purposes
        (itinerant agriculture and it's shifting cultivation system for regeneration of soil
        productivity, were the prime cause of the damages to forest, natural vegetation and
        ecosystems); uncontrolled forest fires; wood-fuel and building material extractions, and
        timber harvesting and hand-crafting.

Land productivity symptoms resulting from these situations may be the following:

    -   Reduced crop yields, because of the lower nutrient and organic matter content;
    -   Reduced soil depth, salinity, poor structure and aeration, etc;
    -   Great need for agriculture inputs, e.g. more fertilizers to compensate for nutrients losses;
    -   Reduced land value, and eventually loss of land due to salinisation, sodification,
        desertification, etc;
    -   Increased frequency and seriousness of floods;
    -   Loss of water resources with consequences to loss of hydropower and fish stocks;
    -   Effects on health and quality of life caused by soil and water pollution.

Erosion of Biodiversity

Of the country's entire protected areas network, 50% of the national parks, 40% of the game
reserves, 77% of the hunting "Coutadas" and all of the forest reserves are situated in the target
provinces, along with 75% of the country's areas of outstanding biological value. Loss of
biodiversity through a broad spectrum of development related activities remains a critical threat
and is of special significance to the target provinces which contain a disproportionate share of
the country's flagship areas of conservation significance.

3.3. Socioeconomic Environment

Mozambique's population is approximately 17, 600,0001and the natural growth rate is 2.4%.
The proportion of children under 15 years old, projected for 2001, is 44.5% of the population and
about 75% of the population lives in rural areas, but in the past 10 to 15 years, there has been
significant migration to cities due to the war (1976-1992). The groups that formed around the
cities and towns have been settled there, causing problems of urban organization, sanitation and
waste management. Administratively, the country is divided into 10provinces and Maputo City,
the national capital, which has the status of a province.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in Mozambique was estimated at 230 USD in
2000. Agriculture, manufacturing industry and commerce are the largest areas in the primary,
secondary and tertiary sectors. The variables that determine poverty are: (i) slow economic
growth until the beginning of the 1990s; (ii) low educational level of economically active
household members, particularly women; (iii) high rates of dependency within households; (iv)
low family agricultural productivity; (v) lack of work opportunities both within and outside the
agricultural sector; (vi) poor development of infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Some

indicators illustrate this situation: the incidence of poverty is 69.4% (72.2% in rural zone and
62% in urban zone); the number of doctors for 100 000 inhabitants is 6 and the prevalence of
HIV is rather high.

Mozambique's growth rate has been 9% from 1997 to 2002, well above the Ahcan average and
among the highest in the world, and is projected at between 7% and 12% annually until 2005.
Growth has been driven mainly by mega-projects, foreign investment, and strong agricultural
performance. Poverty, however, remains deep and may not have been reduced in the rural areas,
where 70% of Mozambicans live. Improved quality of and increased access to safe water in
urban and rural areas is among the six priority areas of the Government's poverty reduction
strategy, known as PARPA, endorsed by the Board of Directors of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund in August 2001.

Primary and Secondary Education Sector

In Primary Education, Mozambique has made substantial progress in improving access to
primary education. Between 1992 and 2004, Primary Education 1 and 2 enrolment rose from 1.3
million to 3.5 million, and the number of schools grew dramatically from 2,836 to 9,489. The
Gross Admission Rate in grade 1 increased from 59% to 123% in the same period. At the EP2
level enrolment has also risen substantially. The secondary education is marked by the following
situation: total 2004 enrolment (both was 200,000 in secondary education 1 of which 15% were
in private schools; secondary education 2 enrolment was 28,000 with 31% of these in private
schools; roughly 41% at both levels were girls.



4. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

4.1. Environmental impacts due to planned rehabilitation activities

4.1.1 Potential negative environmental impacts

The adverse environmental impacts of the project will mainly come from the rehabilitation and
construction works of the additional classrooms, schools and teaching facilities and related water
supply and sanitation systems (loss of vegetation, soil and ground water pollution, soil erosion,
generation of solid and liquid wastes). Rehabilitation activities will include water proofing of
leaking roofs, replacement of broken fittings, repairing of malfunctioning drainage, water and
electrical installations, painting, etc.

The extraction of construction materials from quarries cou.ld constitute a source of adverse
impacts on the natural environment in terms of loss of vegetation, but also the degradation of the
landscape aesthetics. The temporary quames will certainly need to be restored after exploitation.

The environmental impacts are expected to be limited to the management of wastes at the
construction sites (waste water, solid waste, rejection and elimination of wastes such as oils and
paints), asbestos disposal, as well as dust and noise during the works.

The environmental impacts such as soil erosion, soil and water pollution, vegetation loss, and the
impact caused by the increase of solid and liquid wastes can originate from the rehabilitation
activities, from the subsequent operation of these teaching facilities and the use of quarries as
sources of construction materials. These impacts depend mainly on the scope and scale of the
works, but also on the rolling stock to be mobilized, the surface area needs and the surface area
availability, the importance of the supply needs, etc. As a whole, the direct and indirect effects
are the following ones:


    -   Various pollutions (uncontrolled discharge of solid and liquid wastes from the
        rehabilitation sites) and possible negative impacts on public health such as traffic
        accidents, or exposure to noise and dust.

    -   The use of machines working with fuel, oils and lubricants on work sites may be a source
        of groundwater's contamination risks by infiltration, particularly in some communes
        where the groundwaters are shallow.

    -   Unsafe disposal of asbestos: the rehabilitation of training facilities will require the
        disposal of asbestos (from degraded roofs, etc.). Anarchical rejection of this hazardous
        waste may cause nuisances on public health if any safe system is not taken for their
        disposal. Proper asbestos disposal will be among the responsibilities of the contractors.
        Asbestos can be disposed safely in sealed plastic containers to be buried for example in
        municipal landfills. In order to cope with these adverse impacts, the environmental and
        social screening process proposed in the ESMF will be conducted in such a way as to
        ensure that potential negative impacts are mitigated appropriately. It is recommended that
        Environmental Guidelines for Contractors (Annex 5) are used to ensure that the
        rehabilitation activities are carried out in compliance with the mitigation measures
        proposed in the ESMF. These guidelines can be written into contractual agreements and
        form the basis for monitoring compliance. In addition, ESMF would have to mitigate
        potential health impacts on the surrounding population such as dust, noise, traffic
        accidents and an increase in water-related diseases due to standing waters in the borrow
        pits.

It might be possible that some of the schools and teaching facilities of thc FASE programnlc to
he constructed or rehabilitated inay kill ~vithinprotected areas. In that case. the EIA ineasures
shall bc enfol*cedand all the necessary permits and clearances have to be obtained from the
relevant Ministries, Depart~nentsand conlmu~litics.

and enforced by the MEC.

4.2. Social impacts due to planned rehabilitation activities

The main social issues in Mozambique today are:

   -   Acute Poverty - poverty is wide spread in the country, despite its potential and rich
       resource endowment

   -   The Tragedy of HIVIAIDS - HIVIAIDS affects both education coverage and quality. It
       dampens the demand for education as affected households have fewer resources to spend
       on education either because of reduced income due to morbidity of income earners or
       diversion of source resources for health care.

    -  The Crisis in Education - An exceedingly small proportion of the Mozambican age
       group completes secondary education.

    -  Gender Issues -Women are oRen poorer than men, own less land and livestock and have
       fewer years of schooling.

4.2.1 Positive Social Impacts

Overall, the FTI is likely to have a positive impact on the social issues in Mozambique, in the
short, medium and long term, for the following reasons:


    a) The FTI, under the overall objectives of the program will address the following four main
       issues: (i) Lack of access and completion of secondary level, mainly EP2;(ii) Inequity of
       access and throughput among geographical areas, income groups and between genders;
       (iii) Low quality of the learning process in terms of outcomes; (iv) Ineffective
       organization and management of the secondary education.


    b) Through increase enrolment in secondary education, additional opportunities for public
       health awareness and education for protection and prevention against HIVIAIDS will be
       available for schools of the general education, especially for the boys and girls at EP2
       level. It is this age group that is particularly vulnerable to this epidemic. Thus, the
       improvement of the teaching facilities will have major positive effects on the education
       system in general: increase of the number of schools, particularly at the rural areas;
       improve of learning conditions; improve of living conditions for the schools with resident
       students; improve water supply and sanitation, etc.

    c) In existing schools, the rehabilitation of teaching facilities as well as the administration
       premises and related water supply and sanitation systems are likely to contribute to
       improvements in the visual aesthetics of the environment including good landscape
       integration. More specifically, these activities can help improve the dilapidated state as
       well as the environmental hygiene at these facilities.

Construction and Rehabilitation of school infrastructures:
The rehabilitation or the construction of teaching facilities will facilitate the reintegration of a
great number of pupils into the school system, and particularly boost a qualitative and

quantitative development of the education system in the concerned areas (increase of school
attendance by boys and girls; etc.).

The works will contribute towards recreating a healthy school environments (schools are
enclosed and are not used anymore as open sewers, and access is controlled), the strengthening
of the quality of learning and work context for respectively pupils and teachers - the tranquility
of premises is ensured with the erected fences). This will encourage also many more parents to
send their children to school and mainly strengthen proximity teaching in concerned areas. This
situation will also help to improve hygiene, reduce begging and the number of children in the
streets.

Construction and rehabilitation will also contribute to: the increase of the number of schools
(increase of the number of available seats for students including working conditions; the
decrease of disparities between girls and boys; access to basic education for the poorest social
strata; the improvement of the quality of education, increasing schools attendance rate;
improvement of hygiene in the schools; the reduction of begging and the number of children in
the streets; the reduction of children working in the crafts industry and home economies; the
eradication of illiteracy as well as the reduction of disparitiesbetween regions.

Construction and rehabilitation works will also contribute to consolidating and creating jobs in
the towns and villages hosting the teaching facilities to be targeted by the project. The work will
bring about a high local manpower use and the hiring of skilled workers (masons, carpenters,
building workers, plumbers, electricians, etc.), this will increase the incomes of the local
populations, improve their living conditions, and contribute significantly to the fight against
poverty.

Construction and rehabilitation of the clean water in schools:
The availability of clean water in schools will help pupils to have correct personal hygiene and
dietary habits, and reduce the effects of lethal and debilitating diseases. As a whole, the living
conditions will be improved because the pupils will no longer use unsanitary water sources.
Moreover, the repair of some damaged pipes will allow for a reduction of water leaks and will
contribute thus to fighting against the waste of water.

Construction and rehabilitation of sanitary installations in schools:
The absence or the non-operation of sanitary installations (WC) in schools can be a cause for
serious nuisances in schools. The building or restoration of sanitary installations will strengthen
hygienic conditions prevailing in the concerned areas, avoid them to be areas for the
development and proliferation of waterborne diseases and other diseases given by insects, the
deterioration of living conditions of school attendants, to avoid the pollution of ground-waters
and other water sources by wastewaters, etc... The sanitary installations in schools must be
regularly cleaned in order to offer to pupils an environmentwhere it is pleasant to study.

4.2.2 Negative Social Impacts

At the social level, the rehabilitation works can generate the below adverse effects:

    a) During construction/rehabilitation - poor performance of civil works contractors (and
       their supervisors) leading to unsuccessful incorporation of the proposed mitigation
       measures.

    b) Poor implementation of the maintenance plan during operational phases of the public
       service infrastructure/school financed under this project, due to a lack of funds,
       negligence of staff or failure in the monitoring this stage.


    c) On the human environment, the goings and comings of vehicles transporting the building
       materials may hold up the traffic and mobility in general, thus adding to the nuisances
        (noise, dusts) the populations will be exposed to, without forgetting to mention road
        accidents. The same applies also to the handling of dust materials (cement and sand) that
        may annoy neighboring inhabitants (dusts).

Impacts on the health of the populations: The different pollution and nuisances associated
with the works could have some effects on the health of neighboring populations: dust, noise,
road and accidents.

Toilet facilities at schools (including waste management): The Headmasters or Directorates of
training facilities will be responsible for overseeing the maintenance of these facilities. .

Sanitary risks associated with quarries:FASE has to take into account potential environmental
impacts due to the use of borrow pits as sources of construction materials for the rehabilitation of
the teaching facilities. Quarries (mainly temporary ones) for the exploitation of the material
necessary for rehabilitation of infrastructures could contribute to the proliferation of disease
carrier insects (malaria), they can also be the cause of drowning particularly with children, and
contribute to the development of waterborne disease such as bilharzias.

Risk of outbreak of social conflicts: In terms of local employment, the non-use of local resident
manpower during the rehabilitation and construction of the infrastructures could cause some
frustrations at the local level (and could lead to social conflicts), if we know that unemployment
is widespread in the dry season.

Occupation of private lands during works: In the course of the rehabilitation works, it is
possible for the works to occupy private lands (installation of building sites bases, storage of
equipment, parking of machines etc.). This could lead to the degradation of concerned lands or
even be a source of loss of revenue and livelihoods for their owners and users in terms of
exploitation orlvalorization. In addition, other adverse social impacts are likely to arise from the
following:

    a) Absence of a participatory process involving local communities in the preparation of their
        District and Provincial Schools Development Plans by their Local Governments.

    b) Exclusion of vulnerable groups from participating in and benefiting from project
        activities, i.e., from barriers to access to enrolment in secondary schools due to

       stigmatization, harmful cultural practices, acute poverty among vulnerable groups,
       discrimination, lack of participation in the planning process etc.

       . FASE will also focus on reducing the spread of HIVIAIDS in schools and their
       surrounding communities through the following measures: Training of school
       administrators and teachers in methods of HIVIAIDS control in public institutions,
       building fences around institutions to avoid unnecessary interaction between surrounding
       communities and students, creating awareness among students, communities and staff
       through the introduction of HIVIAIDSprogrammes, provision of resources to schools for
       capacity building in HIVIAIDS and encouraging participation of public and private
       organizations including NGOs in HIVIAIDS awareness campaign in schools.

   d) Land acquisitions/use resulting in involuntary resettlement or loss of livelihoods   -these
       issues will be addressed in the Resettlement Policy Fremework.

According to Social Assessments made during similar programmes, the implementation of FASE
may pose some risks and adverse impacts vis-a-vis the socio-cultural and political context of
each province. Factors that may hinder the success of the program are of special interest. Among
the factors mentioned by stakeholders that constitute potential risks which may contribute to
adverse impact are:

   -   Economic sectors and employers incapable of absorbing all graduates in general
       education;

   -   Lack of capacity to increase the salary of workers even after acquiring professional skills;

   -   Lack of boarding facilities to facilitate access of women to secondary education;

   -   Insufficient classrooms, which results in a high student-teacher ratio, and low quality of
       teaching;

   -   Low involvement of communities in definition of teaching needs graduate profile and
       course contents;

   -   Inadequate or insufficient training of teachers and school directors in teaching-learning
       systems and school management;

   -   Teachers who are not well paid or who lack incentives to continue in the education
       system; and

   -   Misunderstanding or non consideration of the socio-cultural factors that prevent young
       women from secondary education levels or that force them to drop out of school.

The environmental and social screening form (Annex 2); the environmental and social checklist
(Annex 3); the mitigation measures described in Annex 4, and the environmental guidelines for
contractors described in Annex 5 are specifically designed to ensure that adverse social impacts

from FASE activities are identified and captured in the planning stages and there-in effectively
mitigated. Both environmental and social mitigation measures would be verifiable monitored
during the various stages of the program implementation.

5.   LEGAL      AND      INSTITU'TIONAL FRAMEWORK                FOR      ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT

In this section the legal and institutional framework for environmental management in
Mozambique is surnrnarised, as well at international as at national level. In the context of the
FASE, the key elements of the framework are:

   -   The international conventions
   -   The National Environment Management Program
   -   The Environmental Law
   -   EIA Regulations
   -   The Land Policy
    -  The others natural resources law
   -   The role of District and Provincial Administrations and MICOA and regarding
       environmental management in urban areas

5.1. International Conventions

The Republic of Mozambique is a party to many international agreements on Biodiversity,
Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Ozone layer protection, Marine Life,
Conservation, etc. Examples are:

    -  Base1 Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and
       their Disposal (1989)
    -   Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, Paris
        (1972)

        (CITES) (1973)
    -   Convention on the Ban of the Import into Africa and the Control of Transboundary
        Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes Within Ahca, Bamako, Mali (1991)
    -  UN Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought
        andlor Desertification particularly in Ahca (1994)
    -   Lusaka Agreement on Co-operative Enforcement Operations Directed at illegal Trade in
        W Id Fauna and Flora (1994)
    -   Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987)

    -   UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982)
    -   UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992)
    -   Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer.

5.2. National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP)

The National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP), approved by the Council of
Ministers in 1995, seeks to promote and implement sound environmental policy. The NEMP
represents the culmination of a series of initiatives and activities coordinated by the Ministry for
Co-ordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA). It is the master plan for the environment in
Mozambique and contains a National Environment Policy, Framework Environmental
Legislation and Environmental Strategy. The NEMP consists of Sectoral Plans, for the medium
and long term, which is intended to lead to sustainable development in Mozambique. Three
policy areas are defined: Rural, Coastal and Urban. The other environmental strategies existing
are:

    -   The National Strategy and action Plan on Biodiversity Conservation
    -   The National Strategy on Climate Change
    -   The National Action Plan to combat Desertification.



5.3. Social strategies

5.3.1 Action Plan for the reduction of absolute poverty (2001-2005) (PARPA)

The Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA) is the Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). As such it provides the blueprint for economic and social
development and reflects the commitments of both the Government and its external partners. It
further identifies expansion of access and increased educational opportunity as the first of six
priority areas of action, together with health, rural development, rural infrastructure, good
governance, and careful macro economic and financial management.

5.3.1 The Education Sector Strategic Plan I1
The ESSP I1 strategy is designed to support the three key objectives of the Government's overall
economic and social development policy: (i) Reducing absolute poverty; (ii) Ensuringjustice and
gender equity; and (iii) Fighting the spread of HIVIAIDS and mitigating its impact. ESSP I1
supports PARPA through strategic interventions in the education system.

5.4. National Environmental Legislation

At national level, there are various legal instruments approved in environmental field:

5.4.1 The fundamental law
The Mozambican Constitution mentioned that Government must promote initiatives in order to
guarantee ecological equilibrium, conservation and preservation of environment, aiming a better
quality of life for all citizens.

5.4.2 The National Environmental Management Programme (NEMP), which is the national
environmental strategy document. The NEMP puts special emphasis on environmental
management, pollutions and nuisances, and the necessity to have a safe well-being for
populations. This recommending needs to be considered during the rehabilitation of training
facilities.

5.4.3 Environmental laws

The environmental law no 20197, of October 1: The environmental law was approved by the
Parliament on October      lst,1997. The objective of this law is to define some legal basis for a
correct use and a viable management of environment and its components, in order to establish a
system of sustainable development in Mozambique. This law forbids storing or disposing toxic
pollutant products on the ground, the underground, on waters and in the atmosphere. It also
recommends that the Government establish environmental quality standards in order to ensure
the sustainable use of the Nation's resources. This law contains chapters about environmental
pollution and environmental quality standards. It focuses on the necessity of realizing
environmental impact assessment (EIA) for projects and programs having negative effects on
environment or public health. In this field, the MICOA had elaborated directives for EIA,
including the main component of the study and the approval procedure. In this respect, the
environmental law is directly relevant to the FASE activities.

The Land Law N019/97 of 1 October 1997: The law establishes the terms under which the
creation, exercise, modification, transfer and termination of the right of land use and benefit
operates. It mainly focuses on: ownership of the land and public domain; right of use and benefit
of land; exercising of economic activities; powers and responsibilities; authorisation process of
applications for land use and benefit.

5.4.5. EIA regulations

The decree n045/2004of September, 29, related on the process of IEA: This decree focus on
the following points: Categorization of projects et sub-projects (A, B, C); Competencies in EIA
field; Process of EIA; Initial Assessment; Criteria for Assessment; Technical commission for
assessment (members, functioning, etc.); Contains of Terms of references; Public participation
process; Modalities of assessment of EIA; Environmental Agreement; Procedures of
consultation. This decree concerns directly the FTI activities, particularly as regards the
classification of activities and the carrying out of the EIAs. In the appendices of the decree
governing EIAs dealing with the categorization of activities, there is a nominative list of areas
and sectors of activities (for instance: infrastructures, forest exploitation, Agriculture; Industry;
Energy; etc.) that have to be taken into consideration in Category A.

As per projects related to category B, the decree appendix does not indicate any specific list or
field of activities; it only indicates that these activities do not affect significantly populations and
environmental sensitive zones. These projects need only Simplified Environmental Assessment.

Concerning the category C, the decree precise that the environmental negative effects of such
activities are minor, neglictable and do not require Environmental Impacts Assessment

5.4.6 EIE guidelines


The decree n032/2003 of august, 12, concerning the Environmental Audit: This decree
defines the main component in the environmental auditing process, for existing infrastructures,

equipments or activities such may have negative impact on the environment. This decree does
not directly concern the FTI activities.

Environmental quality standard: Since 1997activities have been developed for the elaboration
of environmental quality standards. As a first step the Environmental Quality Standards of
Mozambique Projects has been formulated in order to define and prepare adequate standard for
the environmental situation in the country and to prepare required regulations. An environmental
standard regulation has been prepared and discussed with a broad participation of representatives
of relevant bodies. The FTI programme is concerned with the compliance with standards in the
field of building, rehabilitation and management of infrastructures and equipments.

5.4.7 The EIA procedure

The EIA process in Mozambique is presented in the decree n045/2004 of September, 29,
prepared by the MICOA. The E M procedure involves the following:


a) Registering a project: The proponent is required to register the project with the MICOA.

b) Screening: The project is classified to determine the level at which the environmental
assessment should be carried out. The screening is realised par the MICOA.

c) Conducting an EIA: This involves the three main stages of the EIA process (scoping,
preparing terms of reference and preparing an environmental impact statement). It is at this stage
that the decision is made whether to conduct the EIA or not.

d) Reviewing the EIA: A Technical Review Committee established by the MICOA reviews the
E M and decides whether the EIA is acceptable or not.

e) Issuing the relevant permits: If the E M is approved, the MICOA issues the necessary
environmental permit that confirms the EL4 has been satisfactorily completed and the project
may proceed.

f) Decision-making:A decision is made by MICOA as to whether a proposal is approved or not;
a record of decision explains how environmental issues were taken into consideration.

e) Monitoring project implementation: The proponent prepares and executes an appropriate
monitoring program (i.e. an environmental management program).

f) Extent of Public participation: Public participation is required during the scoping stages and
while fulfilling the terms of reference for the impact assessment of the EIA process. The
proponent is responsible for identifying interested and affected parties and ensuring that all
parties concerned are given adequate opportunity to participate in the process. A public
information program is initiated, and public notices are issued during the scoping and EIA
stages.

Whenever a strong public concern over the proposed project is indicated and impacts are
extensive and far-reaching, the MICOA services are required to organize a public hearing. The
results of the public hearing should be taken into account when a decision is taken whether or not
a permit is to be issued.

According to Mozambican EIA Regulations, all development projects are subject to
environmental screening. Prior to granting permission to proceed with a project, a proponent is
obliged to complete a Pre-evaluation Form ("Ficha de Pre-Avaliacao ") that has been developed
by the Ministry for Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA).

The nature, type and location of the project is described in the environmental screening form
with a preliminary indication of potential socio-economic and biophysical impacts (number of
people 1communities affected, sensitive habitats, threatened species, etc).

Based on the screening exercise MICOA makes a decision on whether an EIA is required or not.
In the event of an EIA not being required the proponent is still obliged to describe methods and
procedures for proper environmental management (storage of semi-hazardous materials, solid
waste disposal, etc).

Apart from the EIA content, the decree on EIA requires a public survey prior to the issuance of
any authorization on the basis of the EIA and within a maximum timeframe of three months. The
EIA conducted by the consultants at the request of the promoter is submitted for approval to the
departments of the Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MICOA), that looks aAer the procedure
for the conduction of EIAs (approval of the TOR, approval of the studies, authorization given to
consultants and consultancy firms, etc.). According to the classification level of the project, the
conduction of the procedure is monitored at national level (category A projects) by the
environmental directorate of MICOA, or at provincial level (category B or C projects) by
provincial departments of MICOA. Since the FTI project falls within category B, only the
MICOA provincial departments will be called upon, except for Maputo-City where this role is
played by the central level.

5.4.8 National needs to improve the national environmental selection process

If the institutional responsibilities are clearly defined during the carrying out, elaboration, and
approval of environmental assessments (between the MICOA departments, the project
promoters, the consultants and the concerned populations), it remains that in the environmental
legislation, some improvement will have to be brought regarding the classification of the
activities and the screening of projects. This recommendation is taken into account in the
screening process defined in the chapter 8 of this ESMF.

5.5. Institutional framework

Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs        - MICOA

At central level

The Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) is responsible for
implementing     the National     Environmental       Management Programme          and   associated
environmental policy and legislation. The Ministry has, primarily, a co-ordinating role. All
ministries share environmental management and sector policies must incorporate environmental
dimensions. The responsibilities of MICOA are: To revise and develop policies and sustainable,
inter-sectoral   development     plans;   Promote      sectoral   legislation;   Co-ordinate policy
implementation; Educate and promote public awareness; Create regulations. This ministry has
elaborated National Environmental Action Programmes and specifics strategies on Biodiversity
Conservation, Climate Change and Desertification.

MICOA is also responsible for regulating Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures
in Mozambique. In this process, the National Direction of Environmental Impact Assessment is
the mainly involved structure. As indicated above, all projects likely to have significant
environmental impacts are obliged by the new Environmental Law to carry out an EIA prior to
authorisation.

Legislation stipulates that it is MICOA's role to coordinate, assess, control and evaluate the
utilization of the natural resources of the country, and in doing so, to promote their preservation
and rational use. It should also coordinate the activities in the area of environment, in order to
ensure the integration of environmental variables in the process of planning and managing socio-
economic development.

Due to its role as a coordinating ministry, MICOA's performance depends to a large extent on
the degree to which it manages to co-operate with the other ministries and sectors because these
sectors remain responsible for the integration of environmental matters in their own sectoral
programmes. This means that MICOA has to establish a working relationship with each of the
sectors that are dealing with the environment.

In the environmental management of Education Program, the MICOA national department will
be responsible for giving the final approval of environmental assessments and certifying the
compliance of the proposed activities with Mozambique's EIA legislation, for EIAs that might
have to be carried out for rehabilitation activities in Maputo-City.

At provincial level

MICOA has established Provincial Directorates in all the Provincial capitals. The level of
organization and capacity varies from province to province. However, MICOA is not represented
at the lower levels of government (i.e. district level) in any of the provinces. The provincial
structure follows, but does not strictly adhere to, the structure at central level.

In the Education Program, the Technical Review Committees of the MICOA provincial
Directorates will be responsible for reviewing the results of the environmental and social
screening process, and, as necessary, the separate EIA reports, and the recommending
approval/d.isapprovalof these documents to the MICOA provincial Directorates.

Institutional and implementation arrangements of FASE

Overall responsibility for the implementation of FASE rests with the "DirecqEo de PlanificaqEo
e Cooperaqclo (DIPLAC), in the Unit of "Construc6ese Equipamentos Escolares " (CEE). The
DIPLAC-CEE is the Project Coordination Unit of the Ministry of Education (MEC) which
coordinates the overall process of construction and rehabilitation of schools, and the acquisition
of equipment and furniture. The Director of DIPLAC-CEE (the coordination unit) is the person
responsible for the management of the unit. DIPLAC-CEE is composed of Department of
Construction (with Project Units, and project coordinators) and Department of Finance &
Procurement. Meanwhile an HIV / AIDS and gender coordination unit is to be established.

DIPLAC-CEE will have the institutional responsibility for FASE's environmental management.
The Environmental Focal Point (EFP) will be responsible for supervising the implementation of
the Social and Environmental Management Framework (ESMF). In order to fulfill this mandate,
the environmental capacities of the MICOA Provincial Directorates will be strengthened.

5.6. Decentralization-Local Government

Since the mid-nineties, Mozambique has embarked upon a gradual process of deconcentration
and decentralization. Deconcentration is the process whereby administrative responsibilities are
gradually transferred to second (provinces) and third (districts) tiers of central government.

Decentralization started with the creation of 33 autonomous municipalities and is expected to
expand, both in terms of numbers as well as fiscal independence. This double process increases
the pressure on the local institutions and their human resources to perform better carry more
responsibility and be increasingly accountable.

Decentralization will not affect environmental management, however the municipalities and
decentralized other Local Communities will be involved in the screening process and
implementation of operational activities. These communities will also participate in the
supervision of the works that will take place in their area, particularly in urban areas; they can
even help in the regulation of the works (regulating diversions).

Municipalities have Technical services which should be involved during the monitoring of
mitigation measures, if their capacities are reinforced in environmental issues.

5.7. Institutional and legal constraints

Levels of Government

There are several levels (central, provincial and district/municipal) of decision-making involved
in environmental protection, land allocation and resource management. Central (national)
institutions comprise ministries with their respective national directorates based in Maputo.
These agencies have the competence to formulate policies and strategies and to enforce and
control their implementation. Other decision-making or consulting bodies include the Council of
Ministers and the National Council for Sustainable Development, created under the
Environmental Law.

All central level ministries are represented at Provincial level. The provincial government (under
a Provincial Governor) comprises a set of Directorates, representative of each Ministry, each
with component "Services". Provincial directorates are in charge of the implementation of
policies and strategies approved at central level. At the district level the administration falls
under a District Administrator. Most sectoral line ministries are represented at this level but not
all.

Policy development and implementation

Although the policy and legal framework for environmental management may be considered
well advanced, the institutional capacity to implement policies, laws and regulations is weak
especially at the lower levels of government. Institutional roles and competencies are not well
defined resulting in gaps and overlaps in environmental management especially in coastal and
marine management. In addition to weak institutional capacity within sectors there is lack of
inter-institutional coordination between higher and lower levels of government. In parallel, the
Government of Mozambique is promoting decentralization across sectors to provincial, district
and municipal levels.

Local Govenllnent

Both horizontal and vertical (mandating more authority to district administrations) processes
require further legal interventions. Progress on deconcentration is closely linked to the long
awaited approval of thc new law     011 local state bodies. Scveral vcrsioils of this law havc bccn
prepared and discussed (inten~ally,iiot publicly) over the past few years, but it has not yet foui~d
its way to the Parlianlent. It is anticipated that this law will foster a restructuring of provincial
and district govcrnnients as well as clcarly definc con~petelicicsof the different levels of
government responsibilities for the management of sector policies. Furthelmore, there is a clear
necessity to generalize procedures and working methods, as they both seem to vary froin one
district to the othcr. Without approval of thc new law and unifomlly applied procedures, it is
very hard to develop an effective capacity building strategy.

6. OVERVIEW OF THE WORLD BANK'S SAFEGUARD POLICIES

The World Bank's ten safeguard policies are designed to help ensure that projects proposed for
Bank financing are environmentally and socially sustainable, and thus improve decision making.

These Operational Policies include: OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment; OP 4.04 Natural
Habitats; OP 4.09 Pest Management; OP 4.11 Cultural Heritage; OP 4.12 Involuntary
Resettlement; OP 4.10 Indigenous People; OP 4.36 Forests; OP 4.37 Safety of Dams; OP 7.50
Projects on International Waterways ;OP 7.60 Projects in Disputed Areas. In addition, there is
the Bank's Disclosure Policy BP 17.50which requires that all safeguard documents are disclosed
in the respective countries and at the Bank's Infoshop prior to appraisal or for the Fast Track
Initiative prior to Signing of the Grant Agreement..

The FTI project has triggered two of the World Bank's Safeguard Policies, namely, OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The remaining operational
policies are not triggered by the FTI. Annex 6 summarizesthese safeguardspolicies.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment: The objective of OP 4.01 is to ensure that projects
financedby the Bank are environmentallyand socially sustainable, and that the decision making
process is improved through an appropriate analysis of the actions including their potential
environmental impacts. Environmental Assessment (EA) is a process whose breadth, depth, and
type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and potential environmental impact of the proposed
project. EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and
safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and
transboundary and global environmental aspects. EA considers natural and social aspects in an
integrated way. OP 4.01 is triggered if a project is likely to present some risks and potential
adverse environmental impacts in its area of influence. Thus, in the case of the FTI program,
potential negative environmental and social impacts due to rehabilitation and construction
activities are likely to include soil erosion, soil and groundwaterpollution, air pollution, loss of
vegetation, public health impacts such as traffic hazards, noise, dust, and loss of livelihoods.The
ESMF has been designed to address potential impacts at the planning stage of the rehabilitation
activities.

OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement: The objective of this operational policy is to (i) avoid or
minimize involuntary resettlement, where feasible and explore all viable alternative project
designs; (ii) assist displaced persons in improving their former living standards, income earning
capacity, and production levels, or at least in restoring them; (iii) encourage community
participation in planning and implementing resettlement, and (iv) provide assistance to affected
people regardless of the legality of land tenure. The policy does not only cover physical
relocation, but any loss of land or other assets resulting in: (i) relocation or loss of shelter; (ii)
loss of assets or access to assets; and (iii) loss of income sources or means of livelihood,whether
or not the affected people must move to another location. This policy also applies to the
involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected areas resulting in
adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the displaced persons. In the event of land acquisition
EDUCATION PROGRAM will implement the provisions of the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) which has been prepared as a separate document.

7. OBJECTIVES OF THE ESMF AND METHODOLOGY USED

7.1. Objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)

The objective of this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is to provide
an environmental and social screening process to allow for the identification, assessment and
mitigation of potential negative environmental and social impacts related to the rehabilitation and
construction of additional classrooms, teaching facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems.
It has not been determined at this time which of these facilities and schools will be rehabilitated or
constructed. The ESMF is intended to be used as a practical tool during project implementation.
The ESMF describes the steps involved in identifying and mitigating the potential environmental
and social impacts of future rehabilitation activities. It also provides guidance in cases where the
screening results indicate that a separate Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required.
The ESMF will be applied by a qualified Environmental Focal Point (EFP) located in DIPLAC-
CEE. The EFP will coordinate hisker activities with the MICOA Provincial Directorates. To
ensure that the screening process is carried out effectively, DPLAC-CEE will provide support
for environmental training, as required.

This ESMF has been prepared in recognition of the fact that Mozambique's regulation on EIA
(defined by the law of December 1997 and the decree 45/2000 of September, 29) include a tool
only for pre-assessment of sub project related on preliminary environmental information's of the
development projects (Ficha de Informacao Ambiental Preliminar -Annex I). The provisions of
the national law on EIA are less comprehensive than those of the World Bank's OP.4.01
Environmental Assessment which calls for the environmental screening of all Bank-financed
projects, and subsequently the assignment of an environmental category, ranging from category
A (significant negative impacts); to category B (impacts less significant than those of category A
project, and which can be mitigated effectively); to category C (no significant environmental
impacts, and hence, no additional environmental work is required). In comparison, the
assessment form of existing projects at the level of MICOA seem very brief and even incomplete
in the procedure for the classification of projects likely to have adverse environmental impacts,
but also in the conditions for the conduction of related environmental assessments.

To close this gap, an Environmental and Social Screening Form (ESSF, Annex 2) has been
designed to assist in the evaluation of planned construction and rehabilitation activities under the
FASE program. The form is designed to place information in the hands of implementers and
reviewers so that impacts and their mitigation measures, if any, can be identified andlor that
requirements for further environmental impact assessment be determined.

According to Mozambique Environmental law, specific investment activities require EIAs,
whereas there are no clear EIA requirements for activities of a smaller scale, but which might
have negative localized impacts that would require appropriate mitigation. This is the reason why
the FASE will use the environmental and social screening process outlined in the ESMF. This
process will allow the DIPLAC-CEE to identify, assess and mitigate potential negative
environmental and social impacts at the time they are planning rehabilitation activities, and, if
necessary, carry out separate EIAs should the screening results indicate the need for such
separate EIAs.

This is the reason why the DIPLAC-CEE will use the environmental and social screening
process outlined in the ESMF. This process will allow the DIPLAC-CEE to identify, assess and
mitigate potential negative environmental and social impacts at the time they are planning
rehabilitation activities, and, if necessary, carry out separate EIAs should the screening results
indicate the need for such separate EIAs.

TheESSF contains information that will allow reviewers to determine the characteristics of the
prevailing local bio-physical and social environment with the aim to assess the potential impacts
of the rehabilitation activities on this environment. The ESSF will also identify potential
socioeconomic impacts that will require mitigation measures andlor resettlement and
compensation.

As mentioned earlier, any resettlement andlor compensation measures will be implemented in
accordance with the RPF, and will be completed before any rehabilitation activities can begin.
The ESMF includes an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for FASE, to facilitate its
implementation. The EMP summarizes institutional arrangements for the implementation of
mitigation measures, the monitoring of the implementation of mitigation measures, and capacity
building needs as well as cost estimates and time horizons for such activities and monitoring
indicators.

The proposed screening process would be consistent with the Bank's safeguard policy OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment. This policy requires that all Bank-financed operations are screened
for potential environmental and social impacts, and that the required environmental work be
carried out on the basis of the screening results. Thus, the screening results may indicate that (i)
no additional environmental work would be required; (ii) the application of simple mitigation
measures by qualified staff would suffice; or, (iii) a separate environmental impact assessment
(EIA) would be required.

Although the potential negative environmental and social impacts of the rehabilitation activities
under Component C (3) above are expected to be generally minimal, potentially significant
localized impacts may occur, thus requiring appropriate mitigation. Potential environmental
impacts such as loss of vegetation, soil erosion, soil and groundwater pollution would be
addressed in the context of this ESMF, while potential social impacts due to land acquisition
such as loss of livelihoods or loss of access to economic assets would be addressed in the context
of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The RPF has been prepared as a separate
document and outlines the policies and procedures to be applied in the event of land acquisition
under the FTI program.

7.2. Methodology used to prepare the ESMF for FTI

The present ESMF was prepared based on on existing Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) of the Ministry of Education and Culture, and on existing general literature,
among them: the Mozambican Education Policy Framework, Mozambican Environmental
Impact Assessment Guidelines, the ESMF for PIREP ("Programa Integrado da Reforma da
EducaqTio Profissional") and the World Bank's Safeguard Policies.

Thc ESMF for PIREP it's a vcry recent documcnt produccd by an international consultant, with a
wide consultation with various stakeholders concerned with the program, including coinlnunities
and the general public, in straight collaboration with the Ministries of Education and Culture, and
Labor, but also with the Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MICOA) and some NGOs i~lvolved
in the health sector. The study was coliducted using participatory approacll on the basis of
consultatio~iwith different partners in order to allow for a coln~nonunderstanding of the
problematic subjcct, to further discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the different activities of
FASE at environmental and social levels. The ESFM document for PIREP was finally approved
by the concerned authorities (among others tlie MICOA) aiid adopted as a legal instrunie~iton
thc basis of which thc PIREP progralninc was approvcd by the World Bank in 2006.

Tlie FASE programnle has siniilaiities with PIREP. On the basis of these similarities the World
Bank and thc Ministry of Education and Culture agrccd to adapt the PIREP ESMF to the FASE
programme. A task group of members from DIPLAC-CEE and PIREP was created, and this task
group, assisted by two World Bank specialists, was responsible for introducing the necessary
alterations to thc document which rcsiilted in the draft ESMF for FASE programme.

Tlie adaptation of the docunients required tlie members of the goup to look at FASE progranlnie
docun~ents,and at othcr stratcgic planning documents at national and local levels, including
internal orgaiiization of thc MEC and DTPLAC-CEE. It also required an analysis of internal
practices on environmental and social mitigation measures already put in place by DIPLAC-
CEE, on its long experience in implementing similar prqjects.

The draft docunie~ltwill then be disclosed for discussioii with all concerned stakeholders with
the FASE, among othcrs MICOA, who will at the end release the final document.



8. THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING PROCESS

8.1. The Environmental and Social Screening Process

The sections below illustrate the stages (steps 1-7) of the environmental and social screening
process (the screening process) leading towards the review and approval of architectural plans
for the rehabilitation of teaching facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems.

The purpose of this screening process is to detennine which rehabilitation activities are likely to
have negative environmental and social impacts; to determine appropriate mitigation measures
for activities with adverse impacts; to incorporate mitigation measures into the architectural
designs of the teaching facilities as appropriate; to review and approve the rehabilitation
proposals; to monitor environmental parameters during the construction and rehabilitation of the
teaching facilities, including the related water supply and sanitation systems.

The extent of environmental work that might be required prior to the commencement of the
rehabilitation of the teaching facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems will
depend on the outcome of the screening process described below.

8.2. The screening steps

The process of screening can be broken down into the following steps:

Step 1: Screeningof Teaching Facilitiesand Sites

Before visiting the teaching facilities to be rehabilitated, a desk appraisal of the rehabilitation
plans and activities, including structural designs, will be carried out by the Environmental Focal
Point (EFP), located at the "Construq6es e Equipamentos Escolares" (CEE) unit of DPLAC.

Subsequently, the initial screening in the field will be carried out by the EFP of DIPLAC-CEE.
The EFP will complete the Environmental and Social Screening Form (Annex 2). Completion of
this screening form will facilitate the identification of potential environmental and social
impacts, determination of their significance, assignment of the appropriate environmental
category, proposal of appropriate environmental mitigation measures, and conduct of an
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), if necessary.

To ensure that the screening form is completed correctly in the various project locations,
environmental and social training will be provided to the EFP appointed in the DIPLAC-CEE.
The EFP will travel to the locations at the time the rehabilitation activities are planned.

Step 2: Assigning the appropriateEnvironmental Categories

The assignment of the appropriate environmental category to a particular rehabilitation activity
will be based on the information provided in the environmental and social screening form
(Annex2). The EFP will be responsible for categorizing a rehabilitation activity either as A, B, or
C.

    -   Category A: activities requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment

    -   Category B: activities requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or and EMP

    -   Category C: activities neither requiring neither an environmental impact statement nor an
        environmental impact assessment.

The assignment of the appropriate environmental category will be based on the provisions in OP
4.01 Environmental Assessment. Consistent with this operational policy, most rehabilitation
activities under FASE are likely to be categorized as B, meaning that their potential adverse
environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas            - including
wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats - are site-specific, few if any of the
impacts are irreversible, and can be mitigated readily.

Some rehabilitation activities such as the water proofing of leaky roofs or painting of classrooms
might be categorized as "C" if the environmental and social screening results indicate that such
activities will have no significant environmental and social impacts and therefore do not require
additional environmental work. Thus, if the screening form has ONLY "No" entries, the

proposed activity will not require further environmental work, and EFP will recommend
approval of this proposal and implementation can proceed immediately.

Since the FASE project has been classified as a category B project, it will not fund any
rehabilitation or construction activities that have been assigned the environmental category A
based on the environmental and social screening results.

In the context of FASE activities, the DIPLAC-CEE Environmental Focal Point (an agent of the
CEE Unit) will have to fill the environmental and social screening forms of the activities,
propose an environmental classification of the planned rehabilitation activities and send the
results to the MICOA Provincial Directorates Managers for approval.

Step 3: Carrying out Environmental Work

After analyzing the data contained in the environmental and social screening form and after
having identified the right environmental category and thus the scope of the environmental work
required, the EFP will make a recommendation to establish whether: (a) no environmental work
will be required; (b) the implementation of simple mitigation measures will be enough; or (c) a
separate environmental impact assessment EIA will be carried out.

According to the results of the screening process, the following environmental work can be
carried out:

(a) Use of the environmental and social check list (Annex 3): The environmental and social
check list will be filled by the Environmental Focal Point (EFP) of the project. This activity will
be handled in parallel to the preparation of the plans and sketches of the rehabilitation of the
teaching facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems. Activities categorized as
simple category B activities might benefit from the application of simple mitigation measures
outlined in this checklist. In situations where the screening process identifies the need for land
acquisition, qualified service providers would prepare a Resettlement Action PlanlCompensation
Plan, consistent with OP 4.12.

(b) Carrying out Environmental impact assessment (EIA - Annex 8): In some cases, the results
of the environmental and social screening process may indicate that the activities scheduled are
more complex and they consequently require conducting a separate EIA; The EIA will be
conducted by the consultancy firms authorizedJagreedby the EFP in coordination with MICOA.
These consultancy firms will be recruited by the EFP, under the supervision of it's coordinator
and after announcement made of the consultation position in the local newspapers.

The EIA will follow the national procedure established in the framework of the Environmental
Framework Law and the decree regulating EIAs and will be consistent with OP 4.01. Draft EIA
terms of reference have been provided in Annex 8 of the ESMF, to be adapted as necessary.

Step 4: Review and Approval

Review: The MICOA Provincial Directorate will review the environmental and social screening
forms as well as the EIA reports, and will make recommendationsas to whether the results of the
screening process or the EIA reports are acceptable or not. Thus, this structure at the provincial
level will review (i) the results and recommendations presented in the environmental and social
screening forms; (ii) the proposed mitigation measures presented in the environmental and social
checklists; and (iii) as appropriate,the results of EIAs to ensure that all environmental and social
impacts have been identified and effective mitigation measures have been proposed for
Education Program 's activities.

Recommendation for ApprovaYDisapproval: Based on the results of the above review process,
the Provincial Technical Review Committee will make recommendations to the provincial level
of MICOA for approval/disapprovalof the review results and proposed mitigation measures.

ApprovaVDisapproval: The screening results and EIA reports will have to be approved /
disapproved by the Provincial MICOA Directorates. If the EIA is approved, the MICOA issues
the necessary environmental permit that confirms the EIA has been satisfactorily completed and
the project may proceed. A decision is made and a record of decision explains how
environmental issues were taken into consideration. Upon approval of the recommendations of
the environmental and social screening process, MICOA's Provincial Directorates will inform
the EFP, and subsequently,rehabilitation activitiescan proceed.

Stage 5: Public consultations and disclosure:

Public consultations will also take place during the screening process, and the results will be
communicated to the public by the EFP. According to the decree governing the EIA, public
information and participation must be ensured during the scoping period and the preparation of
the Environmental Impact Assessment, in collaboration with the competent bodies of the
administrative constituency and the concerned commune. Public information includes
particularly:

    -  One or several meetings for the presentation of the project gathering local authorities,the
       populations, the concerned organizations;

    -  The opening of a register available to all the populations where are kept the
       appreciations, remarks and suggestions formulatedon the project.

Public notices are issued during the scoping and EIA stages. Whenever a strong public concern
over the proposed project is indicated and impacts are extensive and far-reaching, the DIPLAC-
CEE is required to organize a public hearing. The results of the public hearing should be taken
into account when a decision is taken whether or not a permit is to be issued.

These consultations should allow for the identification of the main issues and determine how the
concerns of all parties will be tackled in the terms of reference for the EIA. The results of the
consultations will be included in the EIA report and made available to the public by DIPLAC-
CEE, through its EFP.

In the frameworkof the FASE, the consultationprocess will be done in two phases: (i) during the
screening and classification of project activities and (ii) during the analysis of environmentaland
social impacts. Upon receipt of the EIA report, the MICOA Provincial Directorates will also
send a copy to the concerned Local Communities in order to get their remarks and comments.
The MICOA Provincial Directorates, in collaborationwith the DIPLAC-CEE (through the EFP),
will involve all relevant stakeholders in the project's public information process; these
stakeholders would include: State technical departments, municipal technical departments,
NGOs, local associations,etc.

Stage 6: Environmental monitoring and follow up:

Environmental monitoring aims at checking the effectiveness and relevance of the
implementation of the proposed mitigation measures.

In coordination with the Project Coordination Unit, monitoring will be done at local levels, by
Technical services of municipalities where training facilities should be rehabilitated. However,
the capacities of these technical servicesneed to be reinforced in environmentalmonitoring.

Stage 7: Monitoring indicators:

In order to assess the efficiency of FASE construction activities, we propose to use the below
monitoring indicators:

Environmental indicators

    -   Maintenance of improved sanitation systems at the teaching facilities
    -   Water quality at the teaching facilities meets local standards
    -   Compliance with the EnvironmentalGuidelines for Contractors
    -   Safe disposal of asbestos

Social indicators

    -   Number of people provided with environmentaltraining to implementthe ESMF
    -   The number of local workers used during of the works

These monitoring indicators will be further developed wit in the first 3 months fo the
appointmentof the EnvironmentalFocal Point..

 9. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)

 9.1. Environmental management for the implementation of activities

 An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for FASE is intended to ensure efficient
 environmentalmanagement of the Project. Thus, the EMP lists (a) the relevant project activities;
 (b) the potential negative environmental and social impacts; (c) the proposed mitigation
 measures; (d) those who will be responsible for implementingthe mitigation measures; (e) those
 who will monitor the implementation of the mitigation measures; (f) the frequency of the
 aforementioned measures; (g) capacity building needs; and (h) the cost estimates for these
 activities.

 The costs for implementing the EMP will be included in FASE's Project Costs. The budget wil
 be allocated annually and activities wil be included in the annual workporgram of the MEC.

        will be responsible for monitoring of the implementationof the mitigationmeasures.



9.3. Capacity building for the environmental and social management of the project

9.3.1 Training needs

Environmental capacity will be needed for technical personnel who are involved with the civil
works program of FASE (from DIPLAC-CEE, including the Plan and Monitoring Unit,
Technical Services of Municipalities, and Provincial Directorate of MICOA if necessary).

To ensure that screening and FASE activities are carried out in a manner that is environmentally
and socially sound, it has been suggested to appoint an Environmental Focal Point (EFP) within
the Plan and Monitoring Unit of DIPLAC-CEE. To do his job, particularly in:


(i)    Completing the screening forms; completing the environmental and social checklists;
       developing the terms of References for EIA to realize; recruitment of consultants; and
(ii)   Submitting the screening results and the EL4 to the approval of MICOA, the Focal Point
       will be trained in environmental and social assessment and on EIA procedures and the
       implementation of the ESMF to allow them play the role of environmental and social
       experts during the implementation of FASE activities.

The environmental focal point will be responsible at the level of DIPLAC-CEE for coordination
and supervision (overseeing) of the implementation of the ESMF. For this, the EFP should visit
all the facilities to be rehabilitated, only one time, at the beginning of the works, in order to
complete the screening forms. This expert will take advantage of the support and permanent
assistance of the MICOA environmental department services at the provincial levels.

In coordination with the Project Coordination Unit, the day-by-day monitoring activities will be
done by the Technical services of municipalities where training facilitiesare rehabilitated, to follow-up
environmental and social indicators and the implementation of corrective measures if necessary.

Capacity for environmental management and monitoring will be required at the national,
provincial and municipal level for:

    -   The EFP of DIPLAC-CEE to strengthen hisher capacity to apply the screening process
        as outlined in the ESMF;

    -   Selected members of the Technical services of municipalities, to reinforce their capacities
        in environmental monitoring; and

    -   As necessary, members of Provincial Directorates of MICOA, to enable them to assist the
        EFP in the implementation of the screening process as outlined in the ESMF, including
        the review and approval of EIAs for projects of category B (see Annex I1 and I11 of the
        decree related to EIA and OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment) as well as the
        environmental and social screening results of the ESMF.

The Environmental Focal Point within the DIPLAC-CEE will conduct the below activities:


    a) Screening of the teaching facilities and related water supply and sanitation systems at
        each of the sites of these facilities, using the Environmental and Social Screening Form;
    b) Completion of the Environmental and Social Screening Form (Annex 2) and submission
        for approval to the MICOA Provincial services;
    c) Carrying out Environmental Work, i.e. recommending simple mitigation measures
        (Annex 3), or, arranging for the preparation of a separate EIA (Annex 8);
    d) Preparation of the draft TORS for the Program of Education                activities requiring a
        separate EIA;

   e) Submission of the TORSto MICOA departments for approval;
   f)  Recruitment of qualified consultancy firms to conduct the EIAs if necessary;
   g) Sending the EIA reports to the appropriate institutions accessible to the public;

Concerning the environmental management of FASE activities, the specific needs in the field of
environmental capacity building are the following ones by category of stakeholders.

The following environmental training would be necessary to ensure that FASE activities will be
implemented in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner:

Environmental and Social Management process

       Review of Environmental and Social Management Process;
       Assignment of environmental categories;
       Use of Screening form and Checklist;
       Preparation of terms of reference for carrying out EA;
       Design of appropriate mitigation measures;
       How to review and approve EA reports;
       The importance of public consultations in the ESMF process;
       How to monitor project implementation and mitigation measures; and
       How to embed the Environmental and Social Management process into the works.

Environmental and Social policies, procedures and guidelines

   -   Review and discussion of Mozambique's national environmental policies, procedures,
       and legislation;
   -   Review and discussion of the Bank's safeguards policies;
   -   Strategies for consultation, participation and social inclusion; and
   -   Collaboration with institutions and stakeholders at all levels (local, provincial, national)

Selected topics on environmental protection

   -   Hygiene and security during the works;
   -   Maintenance of school and training infrastructures; and
   -   Safe disposal of asbestos.

In Mozambique, there is a number of consultant firms specialised in EIA issues. These
independent consultants or firms could be contracted to design short courses that are tailored to
environmental conditions and problems specific to the scope of work conceptualised for each of
the four provinces.

Training Cost Estimates

The Training program is to be implemented by the DPLAC-CEE in collaboration with MICOA
services. The costs estimates, including travel expenses, and training modalities will be prepared
by the EFP of DIPLAC-CEE (with the support of MICOA services).

Qualified trainers will be recruited by DIPLAC-CEE. For planning purpose, a national workshop
(for 5 days), including the technicians from DIPLAC-CEE (EFP of DIPLAC-CEE and other
technical agents); Techmcal services of municipalities (about 10 agents) and if necessary, the
Provincial Directors of MICOA (about 10 agents), should be organized during the
implementation of the project. Training activities and capacity building activities will be planned
annualy and a budget of 30000 US$ is allocatedper year..

9.3.2 Other capacity building activities

The others capacity building activities scheduled for the implementation of the ESMF will
concern:

Provision for EIA

EIAs could be required for FASE activities relating to the building/restoration of schools to
ensure they are environmentally and socially sound. So, the project should contract with a
consultant or firm to carry out EIAs for the teaching facilities requiring an EIA. In this order, the
cost could be estimated at 30000 US$.

Drafting the environmental section of a manual for the maintenance of schools
infrastructures

The technical document will help ensure better monitoring of the infrastructures built of restored,
in order to guarantee the sustainability of the project. This manual refers to all aspects of
building maintenance, including the environmental aspects;. This manual will be prepared by
national Consultants, and this support is estimated at 50000 US$.



Monitoring Plan and Monitoring indicators

The objective for monitoring is two fold: (i) to alert project authorities and to provide timely
information about the effectiveness of the Environmental and Social Management process
outlined in the ESMF in such a manner that changes can be made as required to ensure
continuous improvement to the process; (ii) to make a final evaluation in order to determine
whether the mitigation measures designed into the training facilities rehabilitation activities have
been successful in such a way that the pre- program environmental and social condition have
been restored, improved upon or worst than before and to determine what further mitigation
measures may be required.

A number of indicators would be used in order to determine the status of affected environment.
Therefore, the projects Environmental and Social Management process will set two major
socioeconomic goals by which to evaluate its success: (i) has the pre -project environmental state
human and natural environment been maintained or improved upon at training facilities sites, and
(ii) the effectiveness of the ESMF technical assistance, review, approval and monitoring process.
In order to assess whether these goals are met, the project (EFP of DIPLAC-CEE) will indicate
parameters to be monitored and provide necessary supply for technical services of municipalities
to carry out the monitoring activities.

The following are some pertinent parameters and verifiable indicators to be used to measure the
ESMF process, mitigation plans and performance:

Environmental indicators:
Maintenance of improved sanitation systems at the teaching facilities; Water quality at the
teaching facilities meets local standards; Compliance with the Environmental Guidelines for
Contractors; Safe disposal of asbestos.

Social indicators:
Number of people provided with environmentaltraining to implement the ESMF; The number of
local workers used during of the works.

These monitoring indicators will be included in the FASE Project Monitoring Manual.


10. RECOMMENDATIONS

The FASE is a programme that contributes to the improvement process of the education system,
particularly the technical and vocational education. In this respect, it is a social programme, and
its beneficial aspects take over compared to adverse effects. According to the World Bank
operational policies, FASE has been classified as a category B project because the environmental
adverse effects generated by the FASE projects are low. However, the rehabilitation activities of
the teaching infrastructures and related water supply and sanitation systems can have moderate
adverse impacts, particularly in terms of public and private space occupation, disturbance and
nuisances and waste generation during the works. This ESMF takes account of these
environmental and social requirements. The aspects relating to the displacement and resettlement
of the populations are tackled in a separate document, namely the Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF).

For a better inclusion of the environmental and social requirements in the preparation and
implementation of the FASE activities, the followingrecommendations are necessary before the
identificationof the sites intended to receive the FASE programmes:


(i)     Identify good environmental practice measures (environmental and social clauses) to be
        included in the terms of references of construction andlor renovation works to be
        achieved;


(ii)    Organize frequent environmental supervision (overseeing) missions of the FASE project
        and ensure that the mitigation measures of the FASE project recommended by the EIA
        are complied with. During the project implementation, evaluation missions will include
        environmental experts (Environment Focal Point of DIPLAC-CEE and municipal
        technical services) who will produce a report on the implementationof the environmental
        and social managementplan.

More specifically, the project will have to focus on the followingrecommendations:

    -   Nomination of an environmental focal point at the level of the Planning and Monitoring
        Unit of the DIPLAC-CEE;

    -   Recruitment of national consultants for the drafting of the environmental section of the
        maintenance manual. (The EFP will prepare of terms of reference and propose the most
        qualified consultant to the approval of the Project CoordinationUnit of DIPLAC-CEE);

   -   Organization of meetings with the MICOA's national and provincial departments but also
       with municipal technical services in the areas concerned by the works in order to provide
       some information on the project and define with them the collaboration conditions in the
       frameworkof the implementationmonitoring; and

   -   Require national expertise in EIA (specialized firms in EIA) in environmental training
       sessions.

In addition, the followingrecommendationsneed to be followed:

A. The Proponent (DIPLAC-CEE)

The proponent should undertake to manage operations in a manner that protects the environment
and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public. To this effect,he:

    -  Has overall responsibility for ensuring that the EMPs for the rehabilitation activities are
       prepared and implemented, and that they comply with all legislative and contractual
       requirements;

    -  Ensures that all EIA activities related to the construction 1 rehabilitation phase are
       incorporated in the contractor's and consultant's contracts; this requires the inclusion of
       these activities (including any guidelines) in the tender documents in order to let aware
       the contractors and consultants of the need to comply with EIA activities;

    -  Ensures that non-conformities are corrected;

    -  Ensures that subcontractors hlfill their environmentalobligations;

    -  Ensure that the RPF is being implemented,as required,by qualifiedpersonnel;

    -  Advises managers, supervisors and employees of safety, health and environmental
       requirements, and holds .themaccountable for their performance;

    -  Monitors, evaluates and reports on performance in safety, health and environmental
       protection;

    -  Provides training when needed on topics pertaining to environmentalprotection; and

    -  Informs personnel that failure to report incidents and willhl non-compliance will result
       in disciplinary action in accordancewith internal disciplinary guidelines.

In addition, the Coordinator of the Project Coordination Unit (DIPLAC-CEE) should recruit EIA
Consultants and contractors.

B. The contractor

The Contractor should:

   -   Comply with the environmental guidelines described in Annex 5;

   -   Comply with all of the requirements of the EA and EMP and shall, in accordance with
       accepted standards, employ techniques, practices and methods of construction that will
       ensure compliance with this standard and, in general, minimise environmental damage,
       control waste, avoid pollution, prevent loss or damage to natural resources, and minimize
       effects on surrounding landowners, occupants and the general public;

   -   Such agreed remedial measures shall be undertaken immediately to prevent further
       damage and to repair any damage that may have occurred;

   -   Organise labor, plant, transport and equipment to perform the work in accordance with
       the environmental requirements; if he is so required, employ specialized firms in EIA
       issues to plan and monitor all EIA activities during construction;

   -   Ensure the project is implemented in accordance with the environmental standards
       specified in the EMP;

   -   Implement agreed actions resulting from routine monitoring, or inspections;

   -   In addition the contractor shall implement their own audits to ensure conformance with
       the requirements of .theEMP.

Members of the Technical Services of the relevant municipalities will monitor the compliance
with these guidelines, in coordination with the Project Coordination Unit (DIPLAC-CEE).

11.2. Annex 2: Environmental and Social Screening Form (ESSF) proposed

The MICOA screening form seems incomplete and doesn't permit to appreciate the adverse effects of
projects activities. To complete this gap, the precise Environmental and Social Screening Form has been
designed to assist in the evaluation of planned construction and rehabilitation activities under FASE, The
form is designed to place information in the hands of implementers and reviewers so that impacts and
their mitigation measures, if any, can be identified andlor that requirements for further environmental
impact assessment be determined.

The ESSF contains information that will allow reviewers to determine the characterization of the
prevailing local bio-physical and social environment with the aim to assess the potential impacts of
construction and rehabilitation activities on this environment. The ESSF will also identify potential
socioeconomic impacts that will require mitigation measures andlorresettlement and compensation.
