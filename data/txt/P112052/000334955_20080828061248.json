implementation of the Strategic\n            Plan for Education and Culture 2006-2010/11 (SPEC) approved\n            by the Council of Ministers, in particular focusing on\n            primary and secondary education while ensuring capacity\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Education and culture and\n            its provincial and district departments in policy\n            development, administration and implementation, monitoring,\n            and evaluation. Some of the negative impacts of the project\n            are: acquisition of land; production systems are dismantled,\n            people face impoverishment if their productive assets, or\n            income sources are lost; people are relocated to\n            environments where their community institutions and social\n            networks are weakened; and kin groups are dispersed and\n            cultural identity, traditional authority, and the potential\n            for mutual help are diminished or lost. Mitigation measures\n            of the project are: 1) Avoiding or minimizing involuntary\n            land acquisition and resettlement, where feasible and\n            exploring all viable alternatives before resorting to\n            involuntary resettlement. 2) Where involuntary resettlement\n            and land acquisition is unavoidable, assistance and\n            sufficient resources should be provided to the project\n            affected persons with the view to maintaining and/or\n            improving their standards of living, earning capacities, and\n            production levels. 3) Encouraging community participation in\n            planning and implementing and acquisition, compensation\n            and/or resettlement, and provision of assistance to affected\n            people regardless of the legality of their land rights or\n            their title to land."}, "docdt": "2008-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
