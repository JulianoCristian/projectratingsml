PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This report covers the First Telecommunications Project in Zambia
supported by Loan 1131-ZA. The loan for US$32.0 million to the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) was approved in May 1975, became
effective in December 1975 and was closed in December 1983, two years after
the original closing date. The inal disbursement was made on October 25,
1984.
2.        Apart from the Bank, cofinancing for the project at appraisal was
expected from the African Development Bank (AfDB) for 5.20 million, and the
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) for $2.50 million. At
project completion, cofinancing from AfDB was reduced to $4.19 and the SIDA
contribution increased to $4.04 million. Besides the above, the Norwegian
Development Agency (NORAD) contributed S7.58 million and the Japanese
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECr) contributed $14.29 million (para.
3.07).
3.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in the Industry
Department of the World Bank on the basis of the information supplied by
PTC, Zambia.
4.        In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not aud'ted by OED staff.
5.        Following standard procedures, GED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government, -he Borrower (PTC) and to the cofinancing agencies for
their comments.  Comments received from the Posts and Telecommunications
2orporation have been reproduced as Annex 13 to the report.

HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Government of Zambia requested Bank assistance in financing
its telecommunications sector development in 1972. The Bank's review of
the sector pointed out the need to reorganize the General Post Office (GPO)
to provide a greater degree of fiscal and administrative autonomy (para
2.01). The Government agreed and established the Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) in 1975, to be responsible for the
posts and telecommunications sector in Zambia (para 6.01).
2.        The First Telecommunications Project supported the program of
expansion of services during 1975-80. The objectives of the program were
to expand, extend, and improve eprvices to meet demand and to provide
quality international communications (para 2.04). The project provided
institutional measures to: (a) establish an accounting system separating
the postal and telecommunications account.; and (b) sustain an adequate
recruitment and staffing plan. As a result of review of traffic and
demand, the scope of the project was amended in October 1977 and the
quantity of the telephone switching equipment and the capacities of the
long distance microwave systems were increased (para 3.03).
3.        The PTC did not achieve the physical targets on time and could
not overcome the staff shortages. The project is expected to be completed
in December 1986 six years behind the original schedule (para 3.04).
Delays were due to:
(a) shortage of local tunds due to insufficient internal
cash generation by PTC and insufficient Government
funding causing delayed completion of civil works;
(b) shortage of technical staff delaying the cable plant
construction;
(c) problems with the poor performance of the telephone
switching systems installed in 1980 (para 3.04); and
(d) the process of getting cofinancing for the increased
quantity of telephone switching equipment and the
expanded long distance systems. Project costs are
estimated to exceed appraisal estimates by nearly 21%
due to increase in scope and domestic inflation.

4.        The financial performance of PTC was satisfactory (para 5.07).
Althlough covenants or rate of return and debt service coverage were not met
before 1980, thereafter, performance improved significantly. The economic
rate of return for the project has been estimated at 13%, compared to the
appraisal estimate of 17% (para 7.04).
3.        There have been institutional improvements in PTC's accounting
and financial areas (para 6.07). The establishing of a corporate planning
unit has facilitated preparation of a follow-up development plan for the
period 1983-88. Some progress was achieved in recruitment and training and
Zambianization, but there are serious staff shortages in the technical
cadres which need attention (para 6.06).
6.        The lessons to be learned are: (a) The Bank could have insisted
on appropriate initial tariff adjustments, as a condition for Board
presentation, to ensure sufficient revenue generation; this would have
avoided the need for government local cost support, which in the event was
only partially forthcoming and resulted in significant implementation
delays. (b) The Bank should have insisted on field proveness as a
necessary criterion in the exchange equipment specifications. Currently
this is being insisted upon in all telecommunications projects. This could
have prevented the difficulties that arose with the telephone exchange
equipment. Nevertheless, PTC has developed experience and is better
equipped to deal with its operational problems and undertake expansion to
meet the country's needs in the sector (paras 9.01 and 9.02).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAMBIA: FIRST T'ELECOIQIUNICATOMS PROJECT
(LOAN 1131-ZA)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Posts and Telecommunications Corporatton (PTC) of Zambia, a
statutory corporation established under the Posts and Telecommunications
Act No. 4 of 1975, provides all the public telecommunications and postal
services 'n Zambia.  PTC beca-e a subsidiary of the Za:ibia Industrial and
Mining Corporation (ZIMCO) in 1979. The Bank Loan 1131-ZA for $32 million
was the first loan to the telecommunications sector in Zambia.
II. PROJECT P2EPARATI0N AND APPRAISAL
Preparation Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      The telecomunications consultants employed by the Government of
Zambia prepared a five year telecommunications development plan (1975-80).
The Government asked the Bank to finc'ace this plan and Bank identification
missions visited Zambia in January and November 1972. The Bank advised the
Government of the sector constraints and the need to give PTC fiscal and
administrative autonomy. The need to have commercial accounting was also
pointed out. Assurances were obtained on these issues and appraisal took
place in October 1973. The amount of the loan proposed at appraisal was
$25 million.
2.02      Negotiations started on October 7, 1974 for the proposed loan of
$25 million but were interrupted on October 10, 1974, as the Government
required more time to prepare project legislation. PTC also proposed
changes to the project and in January 1975 a Bank mission reviewed the
program and the project. Negotiations started again on March 17, 1975, and
concluded on March 19, 1975. The Loan amount increased from $25.0 to
$32.0 million due to new project items and increased foreign costs. The
Bank's Board approved the loan on May 27, 1975. The loan agreement was
signed on June 24, 1975 and became effective on December 10, 1975 (para
3.02).
Project Objective
2.03      The project had the follewing objective:  to expand, extend and
improve telecommunications services.
The Project
2.04      The project comprised part of PTC's 1975-80 program and consisted
of the following:
(a) installing local excharge equipment of 31,000 lines
including replacement of 7,900 lines;
(b) expanding cable networks to provide 31,000 telephone
connections, providing PABXs and subscribers' apparatus;



- 2 -
(c)  expanding long distance network including new microwave
links between Lusaka, Kasauma and Nakinde on the Tanzania
border, between Lusaka and Chipata on the Malawi border
and hetween Livings,tone and Mongu; constructing 2,500 km
of VHF/UHF radio links, adding multiplex equipment for
2,200 long distance circuits; installing new trunk
exchanges in Lusaka, Kitwe, N'dola and Livingston;
(d)  extending the gentex service to 25 towns; and
(e)  installing an international telephone switching center in
Lusaka.
Covenants
2.05       The Loan Agreement provided that the Borrower, PTC, shall:
(a)  employ consultants to assist in planning, engineering,
preparing bid documents and evaluating bids for project
equipment and in supervising installation and
commissioning of equipment (Section 3.02);
(b)  maintain separate accounts for postal and
telecommunications operations (Section 5.01b);
(c)  have its accounts audited and furnish the auditor's
report within eight months after the end of each fiscal
year (Section 5.02);
(d) ensure that telecomtmunications operations revenues are
sufficient to produce for 1976 and thereafter an annual
rate of return of not less than 11% (Section 5.04);
(e)  not incur debt for telecommrunications operations unless
current net revenues cover maximum future debt service
requirements at least 1.4 times (Section 5.05);
(f)  that the study by accounting consultants is completed by
September 1975, and implement the recommendations
acceptable to the Borrower and Bank (Section 5.06);
(g)  for telecommunication operations, Implemeent clhanges to
depreciation rates to ensure that depreciatton charges
are related to the economic lives of the assets and that
depreclatton reserves reflect the revIsed rates (Sert ion
5 .n7) ; and

requirements including maintaining adequate reserves for
its trlecommunications operations (Section 5.08).
Compliance with these covenants is at Annex 1. The Borrower (PTC) complied
with the covenants in paras (a), (b), (f) and (g) above. The requirements
under para (c) were not met from 1975 to 1977; the requirements under para
(d) were not met until 1980; the requirements under para (e) were not met
until 1978 and the requirements for para (h) were not met until 1980.
2.06      The Guarantee Agreement provided that the Government shall:
(a) when there is cause to believe that funds available to
the Borrower will be inadequate to meet project
expenditures make arrangements to provide such funds
(Section 2.02);
(b) ensure that short term financing for any shortage of
funds required by the Borrower during the construction
period of the project shall be available on reasonable
terms (section 2.03); and
(c) make arrangements to cover cash deficits of the Borrower
for its nontelecommunicatlons (postal) operations
(Section 2.04).
The Government did not comply with the above covenants until 1980. By then
PTC's financial position had improved (para 5.11).
2.07      In a supplemental letter, the Borrower also confirmed to the Bank
that it would complete the study of manpower and training requirements for
its telecommunications operations by end 1975 or such later date as agreed
to by the Bank, and would furnish to the Bank the results to comment on
befoce implementing them.  The study was completed in 1976 and sent to the
Bank in September 1977. PTC has followed its recommendations but the
results have not been fully effective (paras 6.04 to 6.06).
III. PROJECT TMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3e01      Loan effectiveness date was set for September 22, 1975.
Conditions for effectiveness were:
(a) effectiveness of ADB and SIDA loans to Government and
relending to the Borrower;
(b) Agreement between the Government and the Borrower for the
Government to make available to the Borrower funds to
cover the financing gap for project execution; and



- 4 -
(c) Preparation and timetable of action by Government of
recommendations for capitalizat4an of Borrower acceptable
to the Bank.
3.02      The loan became effective on December 10, 1975 after these
conditions were met. By then PTC had invited bids for the Zambia-Tanzania
microwave radio system, the domestic trunk switching centers and the Lusaka
international telephone switching center. PTC had also prepared the
specifications and invitations to bid for the automatic telephone
exchanges. Corsultants for survey of the main microwave and VEF radio
routes had also been appointed.
3.03      Project Revision:  On September 9, 1977, the PTC requested
reallocation of loan proceeds. This was because of an increase in
switching equipment and regrouping of exchanges after reviewing demand
forecast. In October 1977, the Bank agreed to increase the number of lines
Df switching equipment to 33,550; in July, 1978, the Bank agreed to delete
a 1000 lIne PABX rrovided for Government. There were also changes in the
capacities and routing of long distance systems (Annex 2).
3.04      Implementation Schedule:  The completion date of the project at
appraisal was December 31, 1980. There was a six year slippage due to:
(a) lack of local funds to complete civil works and towers
for transmission systems (para 5.11);
(b) lack of staff, transport and jointing materials for cable
distributIon networks;
(c)  problems in the workAng of the Lusaka main automatic
exchange equipment (paras 3.06 and 3.17) installed by the
contractor; and
(d) protracted process to get cofinancing to cover the
expanded scope of the northwestern and northern microwave
systems.
The implementation schedule at appraisal and actually achieved is in
Annex 2.
Procurement
3,05      Procurement of Bank financed items presented no major problems.
Initially, bid documents were processed through Ministry of Power,
Transport and Works, causing minor delays. This procedure was subsequently
changed by early 1978, $23 million had been committed.
3.06      Due to shortage of funds resulting from revised project scope,
PTC approached KfW of Federal Republic of Germany and OECF of Japan to
finance the Northwest and Northern Province microwave systems
respectively. After international bidding, PTC recommended award to the



lowest evaluated bidder but the GRZ Tender Board decided to award the bMd
to the next lowest bidder, due to poor performance of recommended bidder
on the switching equipment contract (para 3.17)4 KfW withdrew its offer.
The cost of equipment was then financed by NORAD.
Cofinancing Arrangements
3.07      The original  .nd actual. foreign financing is shown below.

52.20          65.68
At appraisal Bank's contribution was 60% of foreign cost and 42% of total
cost. After revision of project scope Bank's contribution became 48% of
foreign costs and 34% of total costs.
3.08      At appraisal, support from NORAD and OECF was not anticipated.
As the funds for the expanded microwave systems (para 3.03) could not be
financed from the Bank loan, NORAD financed this system. For the expanded
Northern, Eastern and Laupuala -'crowave systems financing was obtained
from OECF in December 1983, The process of getting this financing took
time and delayed project execution.
Project Costs
3.09      A comparison of the original appraised cost and that of the
revised project is given below:

Total Project Cost          26.01   52.17   78.18    28.79   65.68   94.47
Due to the devaluation of the Zambian Kwacha the comparison is made in
equivalent US dollars. The annual project costs, actual and estimated, are
in Annex 4. Parts of the transmission systems, particularly the Northern,
Eastern and Laupuala microwave systems will be completed in 1986. Their
costs are estimated. The expected cost overrun on the project is 20.8% at
$16.3 million.
3.10       The local costs on completion are expected to be about $ 29
million as against $ 26 million at appraisal, equivalent to a 11% overrun.
This increase was due to the changed scope of the project (para 3.03)
particularly for civil works and transmission tower foundations, and high
inflation. The increase in foreign costs amounting to about q14 million
(26%) is due to the increase in the scope of the project (para 3.03). The
increase on the cost per subscriber is about 15%, which is reasonable
considerng the increased scope in the long distance transmission.
Disbursements
3.11      The estimated and actual annual cumulative disbursements of the
loan are as follows:

I/ The final disbursement was made on October 25, 1984 by which time,
$31.85 million had been disbursed.  The   remaining amount of the
loan of $0.15 million has been canceled.
The slow disbursement of the loan was caused by delays in implementation
(para 3.04).

1/ In the revised allocation this was introduced as Category 6 and the Consultancy and
Unallocated Categories revised at 7 and 8 respectively.
3.13       In 1977/78 PTC requested the following changes:
(a)  increase under switching category due to cost overrun
(Category 2);
(b)  increase of $3 million for long distance systems due to
expanded systems (Category 4); and
(c)  reduction of $3.5 million under Category 1 as the cables
were procured locally.
In July 1978, the Bank approved the revised allocation and the change in
the scope of the project (para 3.03). In January 1983, PTC requested a
final allocation to the actual values of contracts made under the
categories. In May 1983, the Bank agreed to the allocation shown in Column
4 of Table 3.4.



-9-
Operations
3.14      Except for switching equipment for the main exchanges, PTC is
satisfied with the performance of the equipment supplied. The 15,000 line
electronic exchange at Lusaka supplied by the contractor and commissioned
in November 1980 faced serious problems and failed acceptance due to
circuit design faults, faulty software programs, interface with existing
exchanges, and defective recording of local and long distance calls.
Recause of the importance of the Lusaka exchange in the network, this
seriously affected operations of the entire national network. The other
exchanges were also delayed pending revision of software programs expected
in 1983. They were finally brought into service in early 1985. The
developments covering the installation and operation of the systems are in
Annex 3. Due to delays in completing the long distance transmission
systems in the Northern and Northwestern Provinces, adequate long distance
service from rural exchanges in these areas was delayed. Overall
maintenance is satisfactory.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.15      At appraisal, it was agreed that PTC would retain financial
consultants in the introduction of a commercial accounting system. A firm
was employed with UNDP funding.
3.16      UNDP also financed, through ITU, the survey and design of the
main microwave systems. PTC also employed technical consultants to help in
the detailed engineering and project supervision. In 1983, PTC appointed
the same consultants to assist in the final acceptance testing of the
exchanges. Performance of consultants was satisfactory.
3.17      The performance of suppliers was satisfactory except for the
switching contract (para 3.14 and Annex 3). PTC got compensation of $1
million from the contractor for delays in delivery and installation of the
exchanges. Further compensation, if r -, will be decided after the final
acceptance. The contractor did make etrorts to overcome the problems in
the software supplied by them. FTC also could not connect new subscribers
in some exchanges due to delays in construction of the cable distribution
networks (para 3.04), PTC submitted regular progress reports to the Bank.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      In January 1975, PTC had an installed capacity of 34,600 lines of
automatic and 900 lines of manual equipment, totalling 35,500 lines. By
end 1980, the original completion date, the network was 57,000 lines
(Annex 5). At appraisal subscribers were 26,600 and were forecast to be
53,100 at the end of the project.  By 1980 only 3,600 had been added,  By



- 10 -
end 1984 installed capacity increased to 75,300 lines and connections to
41,000. The exchange fill was low at 53%. This lowfill was caused partly
by the problems with the NX-1E exchangee and by delays in cable network
execution (para 3.04). The estimated and actual completion dates of the
exchanges and networks are in Annex 2.
4.02      At end 1973 telex subscribers were 400 and reached 1,380 by end
1983. International telephone and telex traffic grew at the rate
anticipated at appraisal. The growth of domestic long distance telephone
traffic has not kept pace with the appraisal estimates due to the smaller
number of telephone connections.

5.02      From 1975 to 1978, operating revenues were the same as those
projected at appraisal despite implementation and connection delays. After
1979, revenues were higher, due partly to a tariff increase. The appraisal
anticipated a revenue increase of 33% over the period. Tariff increases in



- 11 -
1976, 1979 and 1983 raised tariff levels over the project period on average
as follows: rentals 300%, installation 250%, call charges 260%.
5.03       Except for 1915 and 1976, the operating ratio was higher than
anticipated at appraisal. This is because of under-estimation at appraisal
of maintenance and operating expenses. The rate of return was lower than
anticipated over 1975-1980 due to lower operating income than expected.
Performance was satisfactory in 1981 and after. The covenanted rate of
return (after tax) of 11% was met in 1981 and after.
5.04       Operating costs (before interest anA depreciation) and cPerating
revenue per DEL have been calculated at constant prices to measure the
efficiency of PTC.

5.05       Increases in revenue per DEL in 1976 and in 1979 are due to
tariff increases.  The fall in 1980 is due to falling traffic due largely
to weakening economic conditions.  Operating cost per DEL was on a slight
upward trend up to 1980. The fall in 1983 should continue in future years
as subscriber connections increase.

5007      PTC's financial position has been satisfactory.  Net fixed assets
per DEL are higher due to implementation delays and cost increases of
certain assets. On current ratio, the performance was less than expected
at appraisal, though the actual figures understate PTC's performance (they
include the current portion due on long term debt as a current liability
which is not the case with the appraisal figure). The diap in PTC's long-
term debt to debt and equity ratio in FY81 to 40% from 75% in FY80 is due
to the capitalizing K 24 million of Government loans on January 1, 1982.
K 10 million also was capitalized in FY83. The capitalization was in
response to the Bank's insistence for the adequate capitalization of PTC
(Section 7.01 e of the Loan 'egreement).
5.08      The appraisal estimate of 65 days of receivables appears in
retrospect unrealistic in comparison to experience in Zambia and in similar
countries. Actual performance has averaged 130 days. Despite efforts to
improve collectX.on, the position worsened in FY83 due to weakening economic
conditions in Zambia.

5.09      PTC's sources and application of funds is at Annex 8.

5.10      Appraisal and actual performance is not comparable due to program
revision and implementing delays. PTC was covenanted to maintain a debt
service coverage ratio of 1.4. The actual rate averaged between 1975-1983
was 1.9. A proportion of the program was financed by PTC running down its
own working capital.   PTC did not meet appraisal expectations of financing
33% of the investment program from net internally genetated resources.
Actual performance was 18%.
5.11      While Section 2.04 of the Guarantee Agreement provided for the
Government to cover cash deficits of PTC for operations other than
telecommunications, and Section 5.08 of the Loan Agreement provided that
PTC should not apply funds arising from its telecommunications operations
for purposes other than telecommunications, PTC persisted in making
transfers to cover deficits of the postal service branch since 1975. This
would have been acceptable after 1980 when sufficient resources were being
generated. However, this was not so in the period 1975-80. Section 2.02
of the Guarantee Agreement provided that Government provide funds necessary
for project execution and Section 2.03 provided that the government provide
the short term funds anticipated as shortfall for PTC construction
program. These provisions were not respected in 1975-80. This had serious
implications as inadequate financing was a factor in project delays. The
appraisal anticipated a transfer of K 17 million from the Government to PTC
[para 3.01(2)1: by 1979 only K 6.7 million was approved. The Bank
assisted ir. getting approval of a tariff revision in August 1979 which



- 14 -
improved PTC's ability to finance the project. The Bank should have
ensured through a covenant on cash generation the setting of tariffs so
that PTC would have had the resources for financing the project.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01 1   In 1975, PTC was organized as a corporation with three divisions
covering:  Telecommunications, Posts and Corporate Services.  On December
16, 1978, PTC was placed under the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation
(ZIMCO) which acts as a holding company for a number of other parastatal
companies. This step was taken to improve PTC's efficiency. Although PTC
continues to be governed by the Posts and Telecommunications Act of 1975
the Corporation has gained considerably from operating under ZIMCO as this
has reduced the direct involvement of the government in the day to day
running of the PTC. ZIMCO can appoint the chairman and Board of Directors
and this has greatly enhanced the operations of the Corporation. PTC
recently has adopted ZIMCO's better conditions of service to attract and
retain technical personnel (para 6.04).
6.02      In January 1981, PTC's Board of Directors created a new corporate
planning unit under the Director General to deal with long term planning.
Because of this step PTC was able to prepare a five-year capital
development program for 1983-88.
6.03 1/   PTC's management had continuity at top level for a long period.
The Director General of the then Post Office was appointed in 1977 and
continued as Director General when the PTC was formed in 1975, until 1984.
The Director of Telecommunications was replaced in 1975 by a Zambian
national who still holds that post to date. When the contracts of the
Assistant Director Maintenance and other expatriates at principal Engineer
level finished, the positions remained vacant as neither exptratiate staff
nor qualified Zambian staff were available at that time. These posts have
been filled since then. The shortage of technical personnel at engineer
and technician levels still exist despite the Corporation's efforts to
train local personnel.
Staffing Recruitment and Training
6.04      At the end of 1974, PTC had 1,735 employees in telecommuni-
cations, giving a ratio of 35 per 1,000 telephones, which was good. Among
them were 200 expatriate staff. The need for Zambianization of PTC had
been realized and at negotiations it was agreed that a study on manpower
and training requirements would be carried out. The manpower study was
completed at end 1976 and outlined a recruitment and training program for a
planned Zambianization of the PTC. The need for continued support from
expatriate staff was realized. In 1983, the Bank offered to finance
expatriate staff previously financed by ODA of UK. GRZ preferred, however,

- 15 -
to rely on bilateral aid to meet their needs. PTC also started to sponsor
students in technical colleges who, after training in PVC's school, could
be employed in the PTC as engineers. PTC also got some staff from South
Asian countriEs. By end 1984 expatriate staff had been reduced to 40 and
the overall staff ratio was 33 per 1,000 telephones (Annex 9).
6.05 1/   The PTC training school in Ndola assisted by UNDP was equipped to
train the technicians based on the City and Guilds London Curriculum. This
training, taking four years, was consiuered too long and shorter courses
tied to Job requirements were considered. In October 1977 the University
of Zambia opened a facility for telecommunications engineering and PTC
started to sponsor students in technical colleges abroad. The Corporation
has made tremendous effort to imvrove the calibre of staff. In 1975 there
were only two graduate angineers while in 1984 there were 15. This number
now stands at 32.
6.06 I/   Despite these efforts shortage of engineering staff was a problem
throughout the project period.  The Bank stressed the need for efforts to
fill vacancies at higher levels through expatriates until trained Zambians
were available. Until a few years ago, telecommunications engineers and
technicians in Zambia had a good market with competing entities and
industry. The position has now changed. Industry cannot absorb all the
technicians and university graduates in telecommunications and there is
competition to join PTC because of improved conditions and stability of
employment.
Accounting System
6.07      Consultants were retained before loan approval to study and set
up a proper accovnting system. At negotiations, PTC agreed to have the
consultants' study completed by September 1975 and implement
recommendations acceptable to the PTC and Bank according to a time
schedule. The study was completed in August 1975 and was accAptable to the
Bank. Implementation provided for introduction, of a commercial accounting
system by end FY 1977. This was achieved. PTC produces semi-annual
accounts presenting separately the position of Posts and
Telecommunications. The quality is satisfactory. PTC has acquired
computer facilities for budgetary control and management information. PTC
set its depreciation rates at acceptable levels for telecommunications
assets (Loan Agreement Section 5.07).
Audit
6.08      PTC appointed an aaditing firm in 1975 to audit PTC's accounts.
Except for 1975 to 1977 when the new accounting system was being introduced
(para 6.07) PTC has submitted the audited statements within eight months of
the end of the fiscal year as stipulated in the Loan Agreement (Section
5.02). In addition to the statutory audit PTC has its own internal audit.

lariffs
6.09      PTC's telecommunications tariffs for 1983-84 are in Annex 10.
Since appraisal, tariffs were increased in 1976, 1979 and 1983. The first
tariff revision was not adequate to meet the covenanted rate of return of
11%. Tariff action was then delayed causing negative rates in 1977 and
1978. The situation was not corrected until 1979 when tariffs were again
increased. The last revision was in 1983, whict. contributed to a good rate
of return in 1983-84 of 25%. By 1983-84, the operating revenue per DEL was
K 1,467 as compared to K 513 in 1975, (K 524 and K 513 respectively in
constant prices).
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievement
7.01 1/   The project did not achieve all the objectives set at appraisal.
The targets for expanding and improving service were not achieved due to
delays and defective performance of the switching equipment (para 3.14).
Annex 11 compares performance indicators anticipated at appraisal with
actuals. Organizationally, the PTC did fairly well. Nevertheless the
pr(,blema of under-staffing (particularly engineers and technicians), slow
expansion andunder utilization of exchange capacity were not solved.
Despite this, PTC has created a sound financial base and developed a
capability to plan effectively for further expansion.
Proiect Spin-off
7.02      There was no special spin-off from the project.  The project gave
support to the local cable industry ZAMEFA which got orders for cables.
The establishment of a facility for telecommunications in the University of
Zambia was heiped by PTC's telecommunications activities.
Least Cost Solution
7.03      PTC adopted the design of systems and components which provide
least costs as determined during project preparation. Specific actions
include adoption of microwave systems in preference to coaxial cables for
long distance systems, the use of stored program control for switching and
application of modern practices for outside plant.
Rate of Return
7.04      The reestimated rate of return for the project (investment
program 1975-80) as executed over 1975-86 is 13% (Annex 12). This is based
on official exchange rates, excluding taxes, duties, interest and other
transfer payments, and putting all cost and benefit streams at 1975
prices. The rate at appraisal was 16.7%. The rate of return is a fair
estimate of measurable economic benefits. The rate of return does not
capture all project externalities and understates the overall economic
benefits of the project such as the consumer surplus.

VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall and Specific Performance
8.01      Before appraisal, the Bank identified the need for basic change
in the organization of the telecommunication services and Government
changed the Department of GPO into PTC in 1975. The Bank played a
significant role in the introduction of commercial accounting. The
agreement by Government with PTC made prior to effectiveness were not
honored as it took time for Government to provide funding and adequate
capitalization of PTC. The Bank should have required PTC's tariffs to be
appropriately adjusted at the start to ensure that PTC had sufficient cash
flow to finance local costs, rather than to rely on Government budgetary
support.
8.02 1/   The Bank dealt with the processing of bid documents promptly.
The Bank could have performed better in procurement and evaluation of
switching equipment. It should have insisted upon field provenness of
equipment as a criterion for evaluation. This might have avoided the
problem that arose with the switching equipment supplied by the contractor
(para 3.14) which had not been field proven before it was approved by PTC.
Nevertheless, the Bank helped in the resolution of the measures to be
undertaken by the contractor to bring about improvements. The lessons
learnt from the problems of the NX-IE have prompted PTC to include in all
tenders a stipulation relating to field-proveness of equipment. The Bank
pointed out the need for action to keep the entity financially sound and to
overcome staff shortages. The Bank did offer to finance expatriate support
to overcome the staff shortage (para 6.04) but the offer was not accepted
by the Government.
Supervision
8.03      The Bank's supervision was generally adequate; PTC sent regular
quarterly reports which helped supervision.
Working Relationship
8.04      The relationships between Government, PTC and the Bank were
reasonable. PTC were disappointed because they thought the Bank should
have played a more active role in speeding up the solution to the problem
of bad performance of the switching equipment.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The major problems encountered in this project were:
(a) lack of local and foreign funding;
1/ Suitably amended to reflect comments from the borrower. (See Annex 13).



- 18 -
(b) poor performance of telephone exchanges; and
(c) lack of adequate staff.
On lack of local funding, though the conditions for loan effectiveness
stipulated that the government would provide the funds, it could not honor
the agreement because of shortage of funds arising from a sharp drop of
copper prices, This problem should have been addressed by insisting, right
at the start, on an appropriate initial adjustment of tariffs as a possible
condition for Board presentation which would have obviated the need for an
injection of local funds by the government; an appropriate cash generation
covenant might alsc have proved to be a more effective system to ensure
early action on tariffs rather than sole reliance on the rate of return
condition, which in the event resulted in a belated review and action in
these issues. A study of the tariff structure and levels should also have
been incorporated in the project (para 5.11). On lack of foreign funding,
the Bank should have considered either cutting down the project to reflect
available funds, or ensured that cofinanciers could bridge the financing
gap. On performance problem of telephone exchanges, the Bank should have
included proveness of equipment as a criterion for evaluation. Currently
this is being insisted upon in all telecommunications projects. On lack of
adequate staff, the problem remains unsolved. This is a nationwide problem
and the Bank is currently addressing it in that context. The Bank could
continue its role of defining appropriate institution building to ensure a
long-term solution to the manpower problem.
9.02      Despite all these problems the project made a positive impact.
The PTC has a clearer perspective of the needs and priorities in
telecommunications development as a result of this project.

PERFORMANCE OF ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE EXCHANGES
1.        PTC prepared tender documents for telephone switching equipment
(exchanges) which were approved by the Bank in March 1975. After-bid
evaluation PTC recommended award of contract. The Bank approved the
recommendation. The contract, for the supply installation and
commissioning of 28 exchanges, was signed on July 27, 1977. The
installation and commissioning of the exchanges was scheduled to be
completed by end of 1978. The eight exchanges for use in urban centres
employed the latest electronic technology while the rest employed the
conventional mechanical technology. The eight exchanges gave a series of
problems.
2.        Due to delays in establishing letters of credit, the completion
date was changed to February 1979. The contractor changed the completion
date to November 1979 and then to August 1980, without giving specific
reasons.
3.        The first exchange was commissioned in Lusaka in November 1980.
At commissioning the 8000 line exchatzge failed to carry the normal traffic
load though only about 4,000 lines were connected. The exchange had
serious software and hardware faults in the interface and billing
equipment. The commissioning of the other seven exchanges was postponed
pending solution of the Lusaka problems.
4.        On March 31, 1981 PTC filed a claim for US$1,034,572.90 as
liquidated damages against the contractor for delays in commissioning of
the contracted exchanges. In June 1981 the contractor agreed to the
settlement of just over US$1 million.
5.        The problems were brought to the attention of the Bank through a
supervision mission in April 1981. The Bank raised the issue with the
contractor management, through its letter of April 1981, highlighting the
serious effects on the national telecommunications network that would
result if the exchanges were not put into service as scheduled. The Bank
urged the contractor to rectify the faults immediately.

6.        The contractor's management responded to the Bank's letter and
promised remedial action and by July 1981 some improvements had been
noticed. However, some major problems continued to psrsist.
7.        A report was received from PTC in January 1982 indicating that
the exchange performance was still not satisfactory and the contractor was
unable to maintain its revised schedule of having all the exchanges in
satisfactory operation by end of I9-1. In mid 1982 the date for acceptance
testing of the exchanges was postponed to March 1984. Meanwhile, with a
revised software program, PTC commissioned the following exchanges on an
experimental basis:
(a) 2,000 lines exchange at Kafue with 180 subscribers
connected and
(b) 4,000 lines exchange at Kabve with 1,690 subscribers
connected.
8.        In early 1983, a Bank financed consultant was engaged to assist
in acceptance testing of the exchanges with revised software program. The
consultant produced a report in August 1983 indicating that the problems
had not been cleared.
9.        In September 1983 PTC reported slow progress.
10.       In March 1984, PTC reported that the final revisions were
introduced in Jusaka in February 1984 and final acceptance was scheduled
for early April 1984.
11.       During superva.s.on in June 1984 the Bank learned that
commissioning of Lusaka exchange had been postponed to September 1984.
12.       The exchange was eventually comissioned at the end of 1984 but
the 15,000 lines exchange can only handle 8,000 subscribers without
degrading the service. There are also other technical problems
unresolved. However, the number of call attempts and the traffic carried
have exceeded the figures specified in the bid documents. PTC has decided
to utilize the spare capacity for low traffic subscribers, mainly in
residential areas. PTC has also reorganized exchange boundaries in the
Lusaka area to distribute the load wore evenly.
13.       PTC has lost considerable revenue due to the delay
in commissioning these exchanges.

Return on Investment
1.        Analysis is performed on the capital and recurrent cost streams
Of the project (that is the new works in PTC's 1975-80 telecommunications
development program) and on the benefits to be derived, as expected at
appraisal and as reestimated for the PCR.
2.        All cost and benefit streams have been expressed in 1975 prices.
Reestimated streams have been deflated using inflation rates actually
recorded in Zambia to 1983 and as projected thereafter.
3.        Actual capital cost streams are based on the project as actually
implemented 1975-84 and as expected to be implemented and completed
1985-86.
4.        Actual operating cost streams are calculated; firstly, by
multiplying new subscribers, due to the project, by the average cost per
connected subscriber. Connections were projected over the period 1977-81,
at appraisal but actually have occurred, or are expected to occur, over the
period 1980-86. Secondly, the additional operating cost of new investments
that came into service before 1981 to the benefit of existing subscribers
have been added.
5.        Reestimated benefits are calculated as the product of two streams,
with (a) the revenues derived from additional subscribers measured by the
number of such subscribers multiplied by the average revenue per subscriber
and (b) the additional revenue earned from existing subscribers which could
not have been obtained in the absence of the project.

represents directly measurable benefits and costs, i.e., excluding
externalities of the project.

Dear Mr Watanabe
1.  I thank you for your setter of January 17, 1986 In which
you enclosed a project completion report on Zambia for the
flrst telecommunications project (Loan 1131-ZA). We have
gone through the report and we agree, in the maln, with
the contents of the report as these are based on the draft
report which was submitted by the Corporation in January
1985.
2.  For completeness of the report we have the following observations
to make:
2.1  Paragraph 6.01:
The completion report states that the Corporation has
five divisions. This is not strictly true In our set
up here as the Corporation has only got three divisions,
namely: Telecommunications, Postal and Corporate.
In keeping with the covenants of the agreement which
require the separation of flnances between the Telecommunications
and Postal services. Two operating divisions have
thus been set up and common services have been lumped
together under the Corporate division. The TelecommunicatIons
and Postal divisions have, In addition, departments
responsible for personnel administration and finance
and accounts. Common services such as training, transport,
estates and properties are covered under the Corporate
division.
2.1.2 In December 1978 the PTC was placed under
ZIMCO which acts as a holding company for a
number of other parastatal companies. This

step was taken in order to improve the operations
of PTC. The report states that there has been
ro particular effect of this change. Even though
the Act which set up the PTC has not been
changed, the Corporation has gained a lot from
Its operations under ZIMCO as this has reduced
the direct involvement of the Government in
the day-to-day running of the PTC and the
appointment of the Chairman of the Board of
Directors by ZIMCO has enhanced the operations
of the Corporation.
2.2  Paragraph 6.03.
2.2.1 The Director General of the PTC took over the
running of the then Post Offlce In 1972 and
continued as Director General when the Corporation
was formed in 1975 until 1984.
2.2.2 The report states that the Director of Telecommunications
was replaced In 1977 by a Zambian national.
The post of Director of Telecommunications was
Zamblanised from the start of the PTC in 1975.
He was appointed In May 1975 and still holds
that post-to-date. Similarly, the Assistant Director
who was then responsible for planning and construction
was a Zambian but left the employment of the
Corporation In 1978. The post was later filled
by another Zambian and it was regraded to the
Deputy Director of Telecommunications level.
Other posts of Assistant Director Maintenance
and at Principal Engineer levels remained vacant
when contracts of the expatriates finished. The
pen ultimate sentence In the paragraph and
the last sentence should read "Shortage of technical
personnel at Engineer and Technician levels
still exist despite the Corporation's efforts to
train local personnel." The posts of Assistant
Director and Principal Engineer levels in the
telecommunications div sion stand filled at present.
2.3  Paragraph 6. 05:
It is suggested that this paragraph shoufd include
information to show that the Corporation had made
tremendous effort to improve the calibre of staff recognising
the fact that in 1975 when the Corporation was born,
there were only two graduate engineers. There were
15 graduate engineers in 1984 at various responsibility
levels In the hierarchy of the Corporation. This number
now stands at 32 graduate engineers.

2.4  Faragraph 6.06:
The market for jobs in telecommunications engineering
in the country is very restricted. The position has
now changed In that graduate engineers would like
to join the Corporation because of better conditions
of employment and the stability of employment that
the Corporation can offer. Industry cannot absorb
all the technicians and university graduates In telecommunications
field and hence the competetion for manpower which
was true in the seventies does no longer exist.
2.5  Paragraph 7.01:
The project objectives were to expand and improve
the services to meet the bulk of demand in areas being
served and extend services to areas where telecommunications
services were sparse or non-existent. It would also
provide high quality telecommunications to other countries
with the Installation of microwave links to Tanzania
and Malawi and the construction of an international
transit centre for improving the operation of international
circuits. The project objectives for expanding the existing
network and extending the services to the District
Centres by installing rural exchanges and the related
long distance transmission links were achieved in full
although there were delays in completion of projects.
International services also improved with the construction
of PANAFTEL microwave links to Tanzania and Malawi
and the transit switching centre in Lusaka. The local
telephone network in the areas covered by NX-le exchanges
remained unexpanded mainly due to unsatisfactory performance
of these exchanges and delayed cable reticulation.
Due to the above facts it is felt that the first sentence
of paragraph 7.01 should read "The project did not
achieve all the objectives set at appraisal" instead of
"the project did not achieve most of the objectives
set at appraisal".
2.6  Paragraph 8.02:
Despite the difficulties that the PTC had with the NX-
IE exchanges It has always been the Corporation's policy
to procure equipment which is fleld-proven especially
under similar conditions prevailing in developed nations.

At the time of the tender for the NX-IE the equipment
had only been used In the United States. The international
switch  which was eventually delivered to Zambia was
new only to the extent that it was the first time the
contractor was designing their equipment to CCITT
standards. The lessons learnt on the problems of the
NX-IE have prompted the Corporation to include in
all tenders a stipulation relating to field-proveness
of equipment.
3. As we come to the close of the first telecommunications project,
I would like to take this opportunity to extend to the Bank
the Corporation's gratitude for the guidance and advice that
the Bank rendered to this Corporation during the implementation
of the project. The Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
had other teething 3roblems at the time that it was required
to supervise and implement this big project and without the
assistance of the Bank this effort would have been to no
avail.
4. It is my hope that the Corporation will find other avenues
of cooperation with the Bank in our efforts to Improve
telecommunications services in the country.
Yours sincerely
