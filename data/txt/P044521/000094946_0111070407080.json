Given\n            Bosnia and Herzegovina's transitional stage, it was\n            necessary that two entity level employment, and training\n            foundations (ETF) be created, so as to focus attention on\n            implementation issues; likewise, the creation of the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) was also necessary, since the\n            employment bureaus were still not ready to provide\n            demand-driven redeployment services, nor to provide the\n            environment to promote social dialogue. For the long-run it\n            is thus suggested that the PIUs be permanently integrated so\n            as to institutionalize the management experience gained from\n            active labor programs, and ETFs. However, ETF programs still\n            require considerable reform, to administer unemployment\n            benefits, and a range of active labor programs, including\n            new labor redeployment mechanisms. Moreover, it has been\n            puzzling (given the funding capacity of the project, not\n            only from the Bank loan itself, but from donations from the\n            Dutch, and Swedish Governments), why those shorter term\n            activities, i.e., public works and small credits, were so\n            much more successful in locking in additional donor support,\n            a fact worth investigating further. Thus, lessons suggest a\n            simpler project scope; relevancy of procurement rules in\n            accordance to country circumstances; greater private sector,\n            and local nongovernmental organizations' involvement;\n            and, stronger technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
