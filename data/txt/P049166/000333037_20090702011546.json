The project became effective January 25,\n            1999. It was formally restructured, with approval by the\n            Board in 2002. Since the restructuring the project has been\n            implementing activities in accordance with the restructuring\n            plan; the project is focused on the project description as\n            delineated at the time of the restructuring. The Project\n            Development Objectives (PDO) and related targets remain\n            unchanged. The project scope, activities and projected\n            outcomes have not changed. In recent years, the project has\n            been implementing at a good pace, making good progress\n            towards reaching its targets, and PDO. International\n            Development Association (IDA) is committed to assisting the\n            Government of Egypt (GoE) with completion of its project\n            until the credit closing date and to this end the closing\n            date has recently been extended on an exceptional basis\n            until December 31, 2009 in order to complete several\n            remaining infrastructure contracts. The project is expected\n            to be completed by the revised closing date and it is\n            expected that any loan funds will be cancelled at completion."}, "docdt": "2009-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
