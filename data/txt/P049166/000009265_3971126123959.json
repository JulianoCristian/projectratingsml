agricultural\n            production of about 26,000 farm families on 130,000 feddans\n            of newly developed lands in the East Delta, leading to\n            increased farm incomes and laying the basis for the\n            development of a viable rural economy in the East Delta\n            area. The project has five components: 1) Agricultural\n            support services, extension and adaptive research service,\n            provided to smallholders, graduates, and cooperative\n            members; and supporting the development of water users\n            associations and service cooperatives; 2) The financing of\n            on-farm infrastructure, tertiary irrigation and drainage\n            works; 3) Installing drinking water supplies in the two\n            sub-schemes of North and South Hussainia; 4) Financial\n            support services, including a line of credit for short-,\n            medium-, and long-term credit for purchasing agricultural\n            inputs, livestock, farm machinery, and equipment for\n            agro-processing; and supporting the establishment of four\n            new village banks; and 5) Financing project management,\n            monitoring, and evaluation, including environmental monitoring."}, "docdt": "1997-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
