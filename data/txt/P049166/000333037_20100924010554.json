EAST DELTA PROJECT,TF092773-EMPOWERING YOUTH COOPERATIVES\n            IN RECLAIMED AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN EGYPT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the East Delta Agriculture\n            Services Project for Egypt were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. A key lesson learned from this\n            project is the importance of combining social and community\n            services components with infrastructural components,\n            particularly in the context of land reclamation and\n            Irrigation and Drainage (I&D) projects. The project\n            shows that basic social infrastructure (drinking water\n            supply, sanitation, electricity, health facilities, etc.)\n            can be as important as the availability of I&D\n            infrastructure in attracting people to newly reclaimed\n            areas. The project also illustrates the important\n            contribution of community development support activities.\n            Although they generally account for only a small fraction of\n            project overall costs, such activities are crucial elements\n            for creating and developing social cohesion in a context\n            where families from different regions and backgrounds have\n            come together. The project clearly illustrates the critical\n            importance of the project formulation and design phase, and\n            their underlying assumptions. The project preparation team\n            failed to recognize the risk in the Government of Egypt\n            (GOE) not complying with its commitment of having all\n            I&D operating properly. The team also failed to\n            recognize the constraints imposed by Principal Bank for\n            Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) collateral\n            requirements for farmers to have access to credit, which led\n            to the failure of the largest component in the original\n            design. On the positive side, the project showed that major\n            restructuring could provide the needed corrective measures\n            to compensate for weak project design."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
