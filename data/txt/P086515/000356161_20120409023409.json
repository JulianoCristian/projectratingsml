{"cdata!": "The development objective of the Third\n            National Railway Project is to assist China in expanding the\n            capacity of its railway system to meet the growing demand\n            for transport of people and goods between Guizhou and Yunnan\n            provinces. The closing date of the project will be extended\n            by one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The\n            extension is needed to complete the remaining civil works\n            contract and complete related contract expenditures. As the\n            loan is approaching closure, it is requested that a\n            reallocation of funds between categories be undertaken to\n            move remaining funds in categories where expenditures are\n            complete or nearing completion to the works category where\n            the civil works is still under construction. Nonetheless,\n            the request to reallocate between loan categories and extend\n            the closing date does constitute a level two restructuring\n            in accordance with the Bank's operational memoranda."}, "docdt": "2012-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
