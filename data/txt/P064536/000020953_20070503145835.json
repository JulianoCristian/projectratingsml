the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned included: 1)\n            The NGOs become more and more a reliable partner in both the\n            design and provision of social services. However, their\n            capacity is not always equally well developed across the\n            country. Thus, before outsourcing these services to the\n            NGOs, thorough assessment of their capacity and\n            effectiveness has to be conducted, and if training needs are\n            identified, they should be provided with; 2) When new\n            institutions are created at both national and local levels,\n            a particular attention has to be paid to a clear definition\n            of responsibilities between the new ones and the already\n            existing one in the institutional landscape, to avoid\n            possible institutional clashes that could hamper the reform\n            process; 3) The sustained commitment of the local\n            authorities (municipalities) is a pre-requisite for the\n            successful implementation of the sub-projects in the local\n            communities. This commitment has to be built up and secured\n            well before their selection as partners in the project\n            implementation is done; 4) The up-front acknowledgment of\n            the project complexity, in the preparation process, has to\n            be accompanied by a realistic implementation timeframe, to\n            allow the proper achievement of the project objectives. In\n            most of such cases, three year implementation period is not enough."}, "docdt": "2007-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
