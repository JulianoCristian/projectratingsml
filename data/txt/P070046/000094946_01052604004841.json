           long-term plans, for the economically efficient\n            reconstruction, rehabilitation, and restructuring of the\n            power, lignite, and district heating, in addition to the\n            petroleum sectors, and the development of a natural gas\n            sector. The project consists of a technical assistance (TA)\n            component to prepare an energy sector study. The study would\n            have thirteen modules as follows: 1) develop a household\n            energy survey to evaluate feasibility, and costs of\n            alternative energy sources; 2) determine production\n            capability of existing power generating facilities, and\n            identify options for future power generating capacity; 3)\n            prepare alternative programs for rehabilitation, and\n            expansion of the power transmission system, and analyze\n            least-cost power generation investments to determine\n            expansion plans; 4) analyze technical losses in power\n            transmission, and distribution, to propose immediate\n            long-term measures on loss reduction targets, and costs; 5)\n            evaluate the feasibility of a new System Control and Data\n            Acquisition (SCADA), and associated telecommunications\n            facilities for power system dispatching; 6) prioritize\n            investment requirements in distribution capacity; 7) propose\n            a lignite mine development strategy for supply to existing\n            thermal power stations; 8) evaluate the current state of\n            district heating facilities, and compare competitiveness\n            with other heating options; 9) investigate the technical,\n            and economic feasibility of importing natural gas to Kosovo,\n            estimating gas demand, and required pipeline infrastructure;\n            10) estimate future demand for petroleum products; 11) based\n            on the above modules, prepare recommendations on investment\n            plans for power and energy sub-sectors; 12) estimate\n            economic costs of electricity, and tariff structures, based\n            on least-cost generation/transmission programs; and, 13)\n            examine the organizational, and operational structure of\n            energy companies, including recommendations towards company\n            autonomy, corporatization, commercialization, competition,\n            and privatization."}, "docdt": "2001-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
