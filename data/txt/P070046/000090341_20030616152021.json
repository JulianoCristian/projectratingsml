The lessons learned\n            indicate that the project's successful outcome can be\n            attributed to the following facts: The Term of Reference\n            (TORs) were comprehensive and clear. The Consultants carried\n            out all their work in Kosovo. The Consultants fielded a\n            competent team and they were assisted by effective local\n            participation. Detailed and multiple reviews were carried\n            out by professional staff having the requisite expertise on\n            behalf of the Bank, United Nations Interim Administration\n            Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), The Power Company of Kosovo\n            (KEK), and the district heating companies, greatly\n            contributed to the quality of the output. The timeframe for\n            the study was realistic given the comprehensive nature of\n            the study and the iterative approach required; sufficient\n            time was available for regular exchange of views, and\n            multiple reviews. The Consultants provided on-the-job\n            training and transferred relevant software packages. The\n            results of the Study were presented to a wide audience and\n            feedback received was incorporated into the Final Report."}, "docdt": "2003-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
