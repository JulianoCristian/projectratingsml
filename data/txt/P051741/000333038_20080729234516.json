Some lessons\n            learned included: the project was able to reach its goals\n            despite all obstacles thanks to the flexibility used by the\n            World Bank and Government's team in its implementation.\n            This flexibility helped to respond to the cyclones and to\n            evolving needs. This flexibility also allowed quick\n            reallocations of resources from activities funded by other\n            sources to others that were not. The decentralization of the\n            activities financed by the project, and particularly the\n            technical assistance offered to the deconcentrated levels of\n            the ministry also allowed a smoother implementation of\n            activities and the achievement of the project development\n            objective (PDO). However, technical assistance to the\n            central level is also needed to ensure a sustainable\n            development of the health system. Public-private\n            partnerships in the health sector can be a useful tool to\n            provide quality health services; however, enough resources\n            need to be provided to ensure that the cost of this\n            provision is covered. To increase service utilization it is\n            important to make sure that all causes of non-utilization\n            are dealt with. This project only aimed at improving\n            geographical access by trying to build new facilities.\n            However, the main cause of non-utilization of health\n            services has always been their cost."}, "docdt": "2008-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
