 PROPOSEDSUPPLEMENTALCREDIT TO THE REPUBLICOFMADAGASCARFOR
                          THE SECONDHEALTHSUPPORT PROJECT

A. Introduction


 1.      The following is a proposed supplemental credit of SDR 12.3 million (US$ 18.0 million
equivalent) to Development Credit No. 3302-MAG (Second Health Sector Support Project) to
cover the increased costs o f meeting the project's development targets following a series o f
unforeseen circumstances including natural disasters and socio-economic upheaval as well as
political conflict andreform.

B. Background

2.       Project Obiectives and Description. The Second Health Sector Support Project was
approved onDecember 2,1999 (withthe DCA signed onFebruary3,2000) andbecame effective
on August 25, 2000. The closing date i s December 31, 2006. The total project cost i s US$44.4
milliono fwhich US$40million IDAcredit, andUS$4.4 million Government funds.

3.       The project's overall development objective is to contribute to the improvement of the
health status o f the population through more accessible and better quality health services.
Specific project activities seek to: (i) improve the access to and quality o f primary health care
services with a focus on rural areas; (ii)   support priority health programs with emphasis on
endemic infectious diseases, reproductive health (including family planning, sexually transmitted
diseases and HN/AIDS) and nutrition; and (iii)strengthen sector management and
administrative capacity within the Ministry o f Health, and at provincial and district levels, to
enable successfuldecentralization and sector reform

4.       Context. After project effectiveness, a series o f natural disasters and unforeseen political
events occurred, which led to deteriorating health and poverty indicators that in turn put in
jeopardy the project's achievement o fits development objectives.

5.       First, in late 2000, Madagascar was struck by three cyclones over a three month period;
more than a million people were directly affected, and the Bank responded by usingproject funds
to provide immediate emergency assistance to some 300,000 persons inneed and to organize the
rehabilitation o f some 315 severely damaged health facilities in two o f the six provinces. The
initial objective of rehabilitating and re-equipping 250 health centers and 15 district level health
facilities was partiallymet when the Project agreedto rehabilitate and equip 208 health centers and
40 district levelhealth facilities damagedbythe cyclones. While the actual cost for the civil works
was lower thanestimated during appraisal, the actual cost of the equipment for the first 115 health
centers was higher; as a result the Project was able to avoid a cost overrun but was unable to
achievethe originalobjectives.

6,       Subsequently, in December 2001, a political crisis triggered by contested first round
presidential elections produced severe economic and social consequences. Many public social

services were discontinued in2002, causingwidespread social suffering andincreasingthe poverty
rate (according to simulations based on the actual welfare changes in the different sectors) to 73
percent o f the population and the extreme poverty rate to 62 percent of,the population. The
average availability o f basic medicines inrural health centers fell from 91 percent to 69 percent,
while availability o f the immunization service was down 10 percent. Health service utilization
declined from 50 percent to 36 percent countrywide. Especially worrisome was the decline in
assistedbirths (minus 19 percent) and prenatal care for pregnant women (minus 11percent). Both
urban andrural families reported decreasedfood consumption, especially the intake o f meat (up to
two thirds less thanbefore for the extremely poor). Again, the project respondedto the emergency
needs o f the country, but on this occasion, the project was unable to absorb the costs; rather the
project incurredadditional costs by:

    o Supporting the GoM's decision to suspend the existing cost recovery system for health
       services and drugs thereby helpingto mitigate the impact o f the crisis on the population, in
       particular, children and pregnant women. The Health project was mobilized to share the
       GoM's cost burden and to ensure the availability o f all necessary drugs at the hospital and
       health center level, an activity within the scope o f the project but one that could not have
       been envisaged at the time ofproject preparation. Inthe new circumstances, this assistance
        also included the purchase of anti-tuberculosis drugs that the pre-crisis GoM had initially
       committed itself to subsidizing and o f contraceptives within the framework o f the
       contraceptive security program. Additional costs stemming from these increasedinputs are
        estimated at more thanUS$1.0 million.
    o Combating the impact of decreased food consumption on the nutritionalcondition of the
       population resulting from soaring (30-100%) price increases for basic food products (salt,
        sugar, vegetable oil, and rice). Complementing the expansion o f nutritional community
        centers inurban areas under SEECALINE (the Second Community Nutrition Project), the
        Healthproject supported the creation o f 36 rehabilitationcenters for severelymalnourished
        children(CREW subcontractedto 19NGOs. Within a year, the admissionrate o f severely
        malnourished children more than doubled while the mortality rate was halved.              The
        additional cost for nutritionrehabilitation i s approximately $1.7 million.
    o Implementingthe GoM's strategy for decentralizing health services delivery at the district
        and community levels. Given the difficulties in reaching the poor and maintaining drug
        supply at the periphery during the crisis, the Bank respondedby strengthening the district
        decentralization during the IDA portfolio review in December 2002 which resulted in
        enhanced availability o f drugs, consumables, medical equipment andvehicles, andrelevant
        specialized personnel and money directly to the district level to support their activities and
       programs. The project has also sub-contracted NGOs to provide technical assistance to the
        districts because o f their weak capacity in planning and budgeting as well as in financial
        management. The total cost for the district decentralization amounts to about US$13.6
        million o f which US$5.9 million for financial support to the districts, US$4.2 million for
        goods, and US$3.5 million for technical assistance. More than half (i.e.; the financial
        support to the districts and the technical assistance) o f this amount constitutes an overrun
        vis-&vis the initialprojectionfor this component.




                                                  2

7.      Finally, after the resolution of the political crisis which followed the 2001 presidential
elections, the entire IDA portfolio was revised in December 2002 to increase the flexibility of
projects inthe portfolio inorder to support the Government's efforts to respond to existing needs
and to implement proposed reforms. The Health Project DCA was amended accordingly in
January 2003. In line with this policy and CAS support o f the GoM's ambitious reform program
(to recover the ground lost duringthe political crisis and to achievebroad-basedgrowth rates well
above those experienced before the crisis), the project providedadditional support for a number o f
reforms in the health sector, including strengthening decentralization at district level, re-
introducingmore equitable cost recoverymechanisms, etc.

8.     The project has made important progress in meeting its development objective of
contributingto the improvement o fthe healthstatus o fthe population through more accessible and
better quality health services. The publicationo fthe results o fthe recent Demographic andHealth
Survey provide some interim results o f the project's efforts to support priority health programs
with emphasis on endemic transmissible diseases, reproductive health(including familyplanning,
sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS) and nutrition. Except for its performance on
maternal mortality, Madagascar would seem to be on track for achieving its objectives within the
framework o fthe MDGs.

    e  Infant mortality: The mortality rate has been considerably reduced from 96 per 1000
       (1997) to 58 (2003) and would seem to be on track to achieve the MDG objective o f 34
       perthousandby2015.
    e  Under-five mortality: The mortality rate has been significantly reduced fkom 159 per
       thousand (1997) to 94 per thousand (2003) and would seem to be on track to achieve its
       objective o f 56 per thousand (or atwo-thirds reduction) by2015.
    e  Maternalmortality: The mortalityrate hasbarely beenreduced from 488 per 100,000 live
       births (1997) to 469 per 100,000 (2003) which is far from the interim objective of 245
       (in2005) inorder to achievetheMDGof 123by2015.
    e  HrV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis: reliable quantifiedindicators for these diseases do
       not exist for 1997 andonly now are beingdeveloped to measureprogress. However there
       i s m p l e evidence that progress has been made for example in reducing malaria hospital
       mortalityor inincreasingthe number o fpatients cured for tuberculosis (see below).

C. ProposedSupplementalCredit

9.     The proposed supplemental credit is necessary to ensure that the project's overall
development obiectives will be met and that specific progress made to date will not be
jeopardized. The credit willbeusedto

    e  continue current financing to the 111 health districts for the development o f health
       services ($7.0 million) and to extend support to the 22 newly created regional health
       directorates (which replace the existing6 provincial healthdirectorates)($l .5 million);

       to provide surgical andanesthetist specialists($1.5 million);
       increase the accessibility o f the poor to quality health services at hospital level through
       theprocurement ofadditional drugs ($2.5 million);
   0   ensure adequate funding for ongoing activities to: (i) infectious diseases and
                                                                  control
       STI/HIV/AIDS ($0.5 million); (ii) strengthenfamily planning ($3.0 million); and (iii)
                                           to
       to maintainthe 36 nutritionalrehabilitation centers($1.0 million); and
   0   promote ongoing sectoral reforms infacility planning, humanresources, healthfinancing,
       managementinformation, etc. ($1.O million).

10,    Rationale for Supplemental Credit.        The proposed supplemental credit meets the
requirements o f OP 13.20 on Supplemental Financing as follows:

       (a)   The cost overrun is due to exceptional circumstances beyond the borrower's
       control.   Confronted by deteriorating health indicators, resulting from both natural
       disasters and political strife, the project initiated a series o f innovative, short-term
       measures to attenuate the effects o f these successive shocks on the delivery o f health
       services. The implementation o f these measureshas succeeded inreversing the negative
       trends (and dramatically improving some indicators) but over a longer period and at
       significantlyhigher costs thanoriginally estimated.

       (b) The existing credit is being implemented in compliance with all covenants. The
       overall project performance has been satisfactory during implementation, including
       duringthe crisis. Project andfinancial management, compliance withagreedprocurement
       schedules, and compliance with safeguards has been satisfactory throughout
       implementation. Monitoring and evaluation have been rated highly satisfactory inrecent
       project status reports.

       (c)   It is not possible to reduce the scope of the project at this point. Since January
       2003, after most post-crisis interventions were prepared and implemented, the
       disbursement rate o f the Second Health Sector project has increased significantly. The
       credit i s presently 88.6 percent disbursed to date and i s expected to be nearly fully
       disbursedbyJuly 2005. A reduction inthe scope or the elimination of ongoing initiatives
       (such as district hospital nutritional services for severely malnourished children;
       increasedsupplies o f drugs, contraceptives, and other consumables; procurement o f long
       lasting impregnated bed nets; and financial and technical assistanceto strengthen district
       level planningandmanagement o fhealth services) wouldjeopardize current progress and
       severely compromise achievement o fthe development objectives.

       (d) The borrower is unable to$nance the additional costs and to obtain additional
       fundsfiom other lenders on reasonable terms or reasonable time. The GoM managedto
       find complementary funding for certain project activities, but not at the level required.
       Additional fbnding for HIV/AIDS (through PMPS and the Global Fund) and for malaria
       and tuberculosis have been obtained fiom the Global Fund. Most traditional donors,
       however, continue to focus on selected levels (e.g., USAID which is focusing on central


                                                 4

andcommune levels) or a limitednumber ofdistricts (e.g., GTZ) or on specific activities
(e.g., UNICEF and UNFPA), while others (including the European Union and the Bank)
are shifting financial aid to direct budget support, which makes protection o f proven
interventions through earmarkedfunds difficult. Only the current IDA credit has (i)    the
capacity to support the project's demonstrably successfid interventions during the
transition to PRSC financing and (ii)      the flexibility to intervene rapidly to support
immediate needs or potentiallyinnovative solutions.

(e)   The time available is too short to process afurther freestanding Bank loan. Given
the immediate needs arid current level o f disbursement, the time required to prepare a
freestanding loan, and the fact that any new credit would be virtually identical to the
existing one in its design and objectives, the required time and additional financial
resources to prepare such a project would be neither practical nor desirable. Further,
preparinga,fleestanding   health project within the context o f the PRSC process would be
far less acceptable than providing a form o f bridge financing for targeted services while
ensuring that the MoHhas masteredthe methods for effectivelyimplementing the budget
support.

(r) The borrower is committed to the project, and the implementing agencies have
demonstrated competence in carrying it out. As indicated in the 1999 Letter o f Sector
Policy, confirmed in the Business Plan 2002-2005, and reconfirmed in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper, the GoM is committed to increasing the pace of reforms and
strengthening service delivery at all levels. The mainhealth objectives ofthe PRSP are to
improve maternal and childhood health and to reduce transmissible diseases. Wlvle
public sector spending on health has increased in nominal terms (with a very large
increase for 2005), it has remained virtually unchanged in real terms over the past four
years. Current efforts to cany out a national health accounts exercise, to update the
national healthpolicy, to introduce a medium-term expenditure framework, andto usethe
marginal budgeting for bottlenecks approach should contribute to a more sustained
growth in the health budget over the period 2006-2008. The proposed supplemental
would cover important sectoral expensesduringthis period.

The project implementation unit has demonstrated its capacity both to manage IDA'S
procurement and disbursement procedures and to innovate effectively at all levels of the
health care system to improve the accessibility and quality o f health services.        In
particular, to ease the administrative burden o f procurement, the project has increasingly
relied on UN suppliers (UNICEF, IAPSO, etc.).          Previous supervision missions have
determined that: (a) an acceptable accounting system has worked efficiently during
project implementation and will be maintained; (b) appropriate accounting staff is in
place and able to produce timely financial reports for managing and monitoring project
activities as defined inthe project implementation manuals; and (c) independent auditors
acceptable to IDA will continue to audit the use o f all funds available under the
Supplemental Credit with annual audit reports to be submitted to IDA no later than six
months after the end o f the fiscal year.

I).Implementationconsiderations

11.      SafeguardsIssues. Inlight o f a recent reassessmento f the environmental impact because
o f the Project's use o f pesticides for malaria and plague control as well o f the increasing
importance of disposing medical waste in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the
environmental classification category has been revised to B. The most significant safeguards
issue i s ensuring safe disposal o fmedical waste. The Medical Waste Management Planthat was
preparedin March 2002 for the Madagascar PMPS (Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project) has proven
satisfactory and will be applied to the supplemental project. It has been re-disclosed inMarch 7,
2005 for this purpose. Furthermore, although the M O H abandonedDDT infavor of pyrethroids
for indoor sprayings, the insecticides and impregnatedbednets will be strictly handledaccording
to WHO guidelines.

12.      Sustainabilitv: After providing for free drug distributionduringthe post-crisis period, the
GoM recently reinstated a modest cost-recovery system for drugs at the periphery, At the same
time, to prevent financial shocks to poor households in case o f catastrophic illness, the GoM
continues to provide free health care services and accommodation at hospital level. Inaddition,
the M o H is starting piloting initiatives such as mutual insurance schemes and equity funds to
support the indigent population.

13.      Risks.   Key risks that were identified at the outset o f the project and, although still
relevant, have been substantially attenuated by the recent political developments: (i)     political
stability and ownership of the project were much improved and should improve favorably; (ii)
future economic performance i s promising in view o f the resolute GoM orientation on tax and
trade policy; (iii) capacity will no doubt improve given MoH's willingness to rely on
                    sector
technical assistance to strengthen district capacity as well as to contract out specific
responsibilities to NGO or private firms where there i s an added value; and (iv) donor support
has quickly resumed since the crisis and should significantly increase in view o f improving
governance.

14.      Effectiveness conditions and agreements. Inaddition to the submission o f a satisfactory
legal opinion on the Agreement Amending the Development Credit Agreement, several
substantive changes inthe DCA are proposedbecause o f the increasingly decentralized nature of
project funding. First, given (i) amount o f money to be allocated to the regions and districts
                                   the
and (ii) time required to spend, to collect andsubmit receipts, andto control expenditures by
         the
districts prior to submitting the withdrawal application, an increase inthe amount o f the special
account will be needed. Second, a new category will be requestedto fund implementationo f the
annual program plans o fthe health regions anddistricts (administrative subdivisions). Insupport
o f this proposedmodification, the project has prepared an implementation manual indicating the
amounts to be allocated, the use o f the funds, and the modalities for managing and reporting on
their use. The addition of the region anddistrict operating costs will be reflected inthe amended
project implementation manual to ensure the compliance with the existing procedures and
arrangements. Third, the Medical Waste Management Plan dated March 2002 will be explicitly
referred to in the DCA in order to ensure the safe disposal of medical waste under the Project.
