There are five project\n            components. The first finances civil works for health\n            centers and district hospitals, re-equipping newly\n            constructed or rehabilitated health facilities; and carries\n            out studies, trains personnel, provides medicines; supports\n            supervision activities, decentralized health\n            administrations, sanitation activities; and helps maintain\n            buildings, equipment, and vehicles. The second component\n            finances transport and other logistical expenditures, drugs\n            and insecticides, equipment, studies, and training to\n            diagnose, prevent, treat, and monitor malaria, tuberculosis,\n            plague, and schistosomiasis. The third component funds\n            information, education, and communication efforts to improve\n            reproductive health service delivery; training to raise\n            standards in health interventions like child survival and\n            safe motherhood; and prevention campaigns to improve\n            STD/HIV/AIDS services, particularly among prostitutes and\n            other groups at risk. The fourth component provides a\n            package of institutional strengthening and child treatment\n            support to enable the health ministry to enhance the\n            effectiveness of nutrition programs and to develop a\n            multi-sectoral operational nutrition information system. The\n            fifth component finances reform by improving sector\n            coordination; increasing service coverage, financial access,\n            and equity; and enhancing efficiency."}, "docdt": "1999-11-04T00:00:00Z"}
