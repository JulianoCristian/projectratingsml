The\n            project has achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            capacity is being strengthened, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            there is a need to integrate and mainstream financing\n            arrangements for monitoring and evaluation in order to\n            demonstrate the conviction of the Borrower and donors that\n            it is a mainline activity, while paying sufficient attention\n            to the design of the M&E program. Second, there is a\n            need to clearly define benchmarks for measuring interim\n            outcomes and assessing potential impacts for projects with\n            long implementation periods, so that there is no need to\n            wait until completion in order to determine likely outcomes.\n            Third, explicit performance indicators should be set.\n            Fourth, careful consideration should be given to the\n            technical and political feasibility, and financial\n            justification of financing dams and reservoirs if they\n            involve resettlement. Lastly, there is a need to ensure the\n            capacity of implementing agencies to carry out the\n            resettlement program as mandated by Bank policy."}, "docdt": "1998-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
