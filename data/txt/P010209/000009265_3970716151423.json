caused\n            by waterlogging and salinity.  Integrated irrigation,\n            drainage, and water management measures will permit\n            increased cropping intensities and a reduction in abandoned\n            land in an area of more than 0.5 million ha. Principal\n            project components include:  (a) completion of a 300 km\n            outfall drain and remodelling of existing drains to dispose\n            of saline effluent to the Arabian Sea; (b) installation of a\n            surface and subsurface drainage network in the three\n            subareas; and (c) installation of a power distribution\n            system to supply the drainage tubewells and drain pumps.\n            The project further provides for:  (d) introduction of\n            on-farm water management practices including renovation of\n            about 920 watercourses and precision land levelling; (e)\n            remodelling of the Nara and Jamrao Canals, as well as\n            construction of the Chotiari Reservoir, to provide\n            supplemental irrigation water for the project area.\n            Finally, the project includes; (f) technical assistance for\n            project design and implementation."}, "docdt": "1984-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
