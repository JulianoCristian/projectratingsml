                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The bank with Government engagement has restructured the project and extended it for another one year. This extension will enable completion of key activities in land reform
                         including the completion of the high priority and critical Land Information System (LIS) contract to enable the project achieve its project development objective.
