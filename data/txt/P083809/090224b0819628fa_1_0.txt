                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the last ISR filed for the Uganda Private Sector Competitiveness Project II (PSCP II) which is closing on February 28, 2013. The PSCP II was approved on September 2, 2004
                         in the amount of US$70 million (SDR47.9 million), the Credit Agreement was signed on February 23, 2005 and the project became effective on June 22, 2005. The project was
                         restructured twice, in February 2009 and February 2012. An amount of US$21.5 million (SDR14.8 million) for the Infrastructure Services sub-component was canceled in early 2012
                         due to governance issues in the construction of the Kampala Industrial Business Park (KIBP). This brought the credit amount down to US$48 million (SDR 33.03 million).

                         RELEVANCE

                         The private sector is important to create jobs and also be competitive. Through this project, the World Bank supported the development of land reform which is crucial to provide
                         access to land for all investments, improving financial services, enhancement of enterprise competitiveness, and improving the business environment, all in all to support the
                         development of a vibrant private sector.

                         Overall progress towards Project Development Objectives and Implementation Progress have both been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory from Moderately Satisfactory in
                         the previous ISR due to a weak Results Framework (making progress difficult to evaluate) and an unresolved misprocurement case involving US$944,914 for which the Government
                         has yet to make a refund to the Bank.
