                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project's development objective is to create sustainable conditions for enterprise creation and growth that responds to local and export markets. The
                         project, which will reduce the cost of doing business and encourage investment, will enable the private sector to be better positioned to respond to
                         opportunities in specific categories of the market. The project will increase the number of formal enterprises, the number of people employed and the number
                         of skilled employees leading to an increase in output per worker.
