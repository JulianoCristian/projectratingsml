The closing\n            date for the project will be extended from December 31, 2010\n            until December 31, 2011. The project implementation has been\n            satisfactory. As of the end of November 2010, the program\n            had covered 2.72 million families. The project objectives\n            continue to be achievable. The program has met its targets\n            of expansion into indigenous communities. Recently, the\n            program has made more efforts to improve coordination with\n            the education and health sectors, particularly at the local\n            levels. The program has also made significant advances in\n            opening bank accounts for beneficiaries and making payments\n            to those accounts. Compliance rates for health conditions\n            remain high at 86 percent. On the other hand, compliance\n            rates for education conditions have dropped somewhat to 62\n            percent, primarily because of results in urban areas."}, "docdt": "2010-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
