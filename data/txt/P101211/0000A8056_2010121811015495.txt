                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The proposed project would finance Colombia's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Familias, which was expanded during 2007 to cover about 1.7 million
                         poor families (including about 250,000 displaced families). The principal project development objectives are:

                          - Complement the income of poor families with minors under 18 (SISBEN level 1 and the displaced)
                          - Promote human capital formation of poor children by increasing regular check-ups, including growth monitoring, and vaccinations and by increasing
                         enrollment and school attendance (basic and/or secondary education)
                          - Strengthen program quality
