The loan was\n            extended for the first time until December 31, 2011, due to\n            delays in the implementation of the impact evaluation of the\n            program in urban areas and to allow time to expense the\n            small amount of remaining resources under the Grants\n            Category. As of the end of November 2010, the Program\n            covered 2.72 million families. The project objectives\n            continue to be achievable. The Program has met its targets\n            of expansion into indigenous communities. Recently, the\n            program has made more efforts to improve coordination with\n            the education and health sectors, particularly at the local\n            levels. The Program has also made significant advances in\n            opening bank accounts for beneficiaries and making payments\n            to those accounts."}, "docdt": "2011-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
