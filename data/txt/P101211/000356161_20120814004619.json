as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the results of\n            the systems audit were available during the first year of\n            project implementation. Its results were important in\n            confirming the overall acceptable functioning of the\n            Management Information System (MIS), and also in identifying\n            several areas where improvement was needed. Some of the\n            problems that were encountered in procurement of banking\n            services might have been avoided if more discussions had\n            been held with the banking sector prior to preparing the\n            bidding documents and launching the process. Public\n            information strategies should have been stronger and the\n            program should have taken actions to ensure that a larger\n            share of beneficiaries understood the structure that applied\n            to them. The experience of this project is that\n            administrative data bases should be considered for the\n            purposes of monitoring and evaluation. The impact evaluation\n            carried out under the project was limited by the fact that\n            the size of the sample was not sufficient to measure several\n            of the outcomes which were of particular interest in education."}, "docdt": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
