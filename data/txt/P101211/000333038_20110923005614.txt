7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The proposed project would finance Colombia's conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Familias, which
was expanded during 2007 to cover about 1.7 million poor families (including about 250,000 displaced
families). The principal project development objectives are: - Complement the income of poor families
with minors under 18 (SISBEN level 1 and the displaced) - Promote human capital formation of poor
children by increasing regular check-ups, including growth monitoring, and vaccinations and by increasing
enrollment and school attendance (basic and/or secondary education) - Strengthen program quality
