COLOMBIA -- SUPPORT FOR THE SECOND PHASE OF THE EXPANSION OF
 THE PROGRAM OF CONDITIONAL TRANSFERS-FAMILIAS EN ACCIÓN
                           PROJECT
                            P101211
                         LOAN 7619-CO

                                  Restructuring Paper



1.      The closing date for Colombia, Support for The Second Phase of The Expansion
of the Program of Conditional Transfers-Familias en Acción Project, Loan No. 7619-CO,
P101211 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2011.

2.     Project implementation has been satisfactory. The project objectives are:
complement the income of poor families with minors under 18 years of age; promote
human capital formation of poor children; and strengthen Program quality. As of the end
of November 2010, the Program had covered 2.72 million families. Project objectives
continue to be achievable. The Program has met its targets of expansion into indigenous
communities. Recently, the program has made more efforts to improve coordination with
the education and health sectors, particularly at the local levels. The Program has also
made significant advances in opening bank accounts for beneficiaries and making
payments to those accounts. Compliance rates for health conditions remain high at 86
percent. On the other hand, compliance rates for education conditions have dropped
somewhat to 62 percent, primarily because of results in urban areas.

3.       The Borrower is requesting the extension for two reasons. One, because of a
slightly lower than expected number of beneficiary payments, there is a small amount of
resources remaining in the Grants Category which can only be expensed next year. Two,
there have been delays in the implementation of the impact evaluation of the program in
urban areas. The data collection is now expected to be completed only in May 2011, and
additional time is needed thereafter to complete the analysis and prepare the final report.
The Borrower has in place an action plan satisfactory to the Bank to complete these two
activities by the end of 2011.

4.     This will be the first extension of the Loan closing date of the project.
