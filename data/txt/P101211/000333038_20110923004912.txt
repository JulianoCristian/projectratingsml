1.   Proceeds for Colombia, Support for THE SECOND PHASE OF THE
EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM OF CONDITIONAL TRANSFERS-FAMILIAS EN
ACCIÓN PROJECT, Ln. 7619.-CO, P101211 will be reallocated as follow:

    Category of Expenditure                   Allocation (US$)                  % of Financing
        Current         Revised            Current         Revised            Current    Revised

    TOTAL                              636,500,000.00 636,500,000.00


2.      Project implementation has been satisfactory. The Loan is fully disbursed and
only US$752,585 remains to be documented for the Designated Account. There are no
significant changes in project objectives or activities. The amount being reallocated to
grants is negligible relative to the total size of Category 1. The project objectives are:
complement the income of poor families with minors under 18 years of age; promote
human capital formation of poor children; and strengthen Program quality. The loan was
extended for the first time until December 31, 2011, due to delays in the implementation
of the impact evaluation of the program in urban areas and to allow time to expense the
small amount of remaining resources under the Grants Category. As of the end of
November 2010, the Program covered 2.72 million families. Project objectives continue
to be achievable. The Program has met its targets of expansion into indigenous
communities. Recently, the program has made more efforts to improve coordination with
the education and health sectors, particularly at the local levels. The Program has also
made significant advances in opening bank accounts for beneficiaries and making
payments to those accounts.

3.       Since no additional consultant’s contracts for studies are expected under Category
2, Consultant’s services under Part 1(b) of the Project, the proposed reallocation is being
requested to use fully the resources available in the loan. Part of the reason for the lack
of utilization of the amount initially allocated for Category 2 was the availability of other
sources of financing, including from grant and budgetary resources mobilized by both the
World         Bank       and       the       Inter-American        Development         Bank.
