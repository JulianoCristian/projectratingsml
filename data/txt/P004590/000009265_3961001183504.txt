MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A RURAL ELECTRIFICATION REVITALIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the National Electrification Administration (NEA),
with the guarantee of the Republic of the Philippines, for the equivalent of
US$91.3 million to help finance a Rural Electrification Revitalization
Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The Government of
the Philippines would charge NEA a guarantee fee of one percent per annum on
the outstanding amount of the Bank loan. The proceeds of the loan would be
onlent to about 54 Rural Electric Cooperatives (REC) on terms and conditions
to be established periodically for the sector (currently, 20 years maturity
including three years of grace with a 12X interest rate that is subject to
review and adjustment annually). The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) is providing US$9 million of parallel financing to support
facilities, technical assistance and training under the proposed project.
2.        Background.  In 1969, NEA was established to serve as the sector's
core agency. By 1971, when the first REC was energized, about 170,000 con-
sumers outside the major cities were being served; by 1990, some 120 RECs were
serving about 3 million consumers, or about 50X of potential connections.
About 90% of them are residential consumers, paying about P 100/month for
about 40 kWh/month (US 9g/kWh). In 1990, about 1,296 cities and towns and
21,051 barangays (931 and 60% of the totals) were electrified. As of 1988,
only 46 of the RECa were considered to be financially viable or were withir
reach of viability. REC distribution losses averaged 251, but were in some
cases as high as 45-501. The Government's past emphasis on expansion of
networks without adequate regard for cost saddled most of the RECs with debts
they could not repay; and some 25 RECs might never attain viability because of
franchis' areas inherently too costly to serve. NEA had in the past performed
poorly as a lender and a provider of technical support to the RECs. Its small
technical staff had been spread too thin.   In 1987-89, its collection rate
averaged only 36%. Overall, NEA has poor prospects for meeting P 9.6 billion
(about US$350 million) of past loans from foreign lenders and the Government.
3.        In February 1989, the Bank conducted a detailed review of the rural
*         electrification sector.  The findings are given in a report entitled &h
Integrated Program to Revitalize the Sector (Report No. 8016-PH; November 9,
1989). Essentially, the Sector Study made the following recommendations:
(a) Operational Efficiency. The RECs need to implement integrated mea-
sures to remedy excessive system losses, itadequate maintenance, and
unsatisfactory commercial practices.
(b)  Investment Strategy.  NEA and the RECs needed a strategy that
focused on investments for rehabilitation with infill connections,
and expansion aimed at capturing high revenue producing loads.
(c)  Pricing.  NEA should adjust the RECc' pricing formula to include
incentives to control operating costs, funds for future investments,
and incentives for efficient patterns of consumption.



-2-
(d)  getrucKung of the RECs.  NEA should encourage RECs willing to im-
plement operating, investment, and pricing reforms by rescheduling
delinquent loans, and by financing new, justifiable investments.
(e)  Restruct=URg of NA.  NEA needs (i) relief from past loans that it
cannot repay; (it) a strategy for financing the RECs that includes
adequate pricing for new loans and the application of conditionali-
ty; and ('ii) a contraction of its activities to manageable levels.
4.        Since late 1989, the Government and NEA have been taking steps to
implement the Sector Study's recommendations:
(a) The Government agreed in January 1991 to restructure NEA financial-
ly, and thereby relieve NEA of responsibility for some P 11.4 bil-
lion (US$407 million) in questionable loans over an e,ght year span.
(b) NEA has adopted a Statement of Operating Policy (SOP) to address
many of the policy issues identified by the Sector Study. The SOP
indicates inter alia that NEA will confine its activities to lending
and technical services, and use conditionality as the primary means
of developing discipline among the RECs. The SOP includes: (i) a
financing strategy for the sector; (ii) a Loan Policy Manual to
govern its lending operations; (iii) Performance Improvement Pro-
grams (PIP) to be applied to future REC loans; (iv) Guidelines for
REC investments; and (v) a schedule of fees for NEA's ancillary ser-
vices. As an adjunct to the SOP, NEA is developing a tariff policy
manual, which '8 expected to be presented to NEA's Board in 1992.
(c) NEA has (i) adopted an electricity pricing formula that includes a
provision for self financing of investment, and (ii) arranged for
substantial tariff increases at about 100 RECs.
(d) NEA developed an acceptable investment program for 1991-95.
(a) The RECs have improved their performance. By end-1990, 71 were
within reach of financial viability. Average system losses were
down to about 22%, and collection efficiency increased to about 90Q.
5.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank's only
previous loan to NEA (Loan 1547-PH; US$60 million; 1978) financed electricity
distribution investments that were initiated during 1980-82. The project was
completed in 1983, and an audit prepared (PPAR No. P-5372; June 1985). The
project largely met its objectives; however, (i) some start up difficulties in
procurement were encountered, and (il) the RECs' financial performance was un-
even. These problems have been addressed through (i) the systematic prepa-
ration of procurement, and (ii) conditionality being attached to NEA's onlend-
ing to the RECs. In 1989, a US$22.2 million component of the Energy Sector
Project (Loan 3165-PH) was allocated to NEA to support rural electrification
investments. NEA has performed well so far. In conjunction with the revital-
ization program, NEA and the RECs urgently needed resources for institutional
development, including equipment, fixtures and training. About US$4.3 million
for institutional development was provided under the Energy Sector Project,
and USAID has also provided about US$4.5 million for technical assistance.



3-
6.        kationale for Bank Involvement.  Through the Rura'l Electrification
Sector Study, the Bank developed an integrated program to address the sector's
issues. Moreover, when the study's findings were discussed with the relevant
agencies of the Government in September 1989, the Bank helped develop a con-
sensus that the program needs to be implemented comprehensively for it to
succeed in revitalizing the sector. The proposed project affords the Bank the
opportunity to continue its close involvement with implementation of the pro-
gram by supporting it financially. Moreover, because of the Bank's unique
understanding of the issues, it is positioned to strike a balance between the
divergent interests of the Government's electric power, planning and finance
establishments.
7.        Proiect Objectives.  The project aims at (i) enhancing NEA's effec-
tiveness as the sector's core agency through its use of sound processes for
prioritizing investments, supervising the implementatiou of schemes, and fi-
nancing the RECs; (ii) encouraging needed reforms of the RECs through the
application of conditionality; (iii) improving the reliability of electric
service in rural areas by financing part of NEA's 1992-95 investment program;
and (iv) providing technical assistance and training for NEA and the RECs.
8.        Project Description.  The proposed project consists of (a) an insti-
tutional development component that includes: technical assistance and train-
ing (to be parallel financed by USAID), and NEA's application of discipline
through (i) the use of systematic investment and financing strategies, and
(ii) conditionality attached to future loans to the RECs; and (b) an invest-
me-nt component consisting of schemes from the 1992-95 investment program for
about 54 of the RECs, including investments in: (i) core system rehabilita-
tion, (ii) system extensions to capture productive as well as residential
loads, and (iii) system improvements to increase the reliability of service.
For schemes to qualify, construction must begin before the end of 1994.
9.        Project Lmnlementatio .  The proposed project would be executed by
NEA. The project cost is estimated at US$111.9 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$95.2 million equivalent (85X) and taxes and
duties estimated at US$4.3 million equivalent. The total financing required,
including interest during construction, is US$118.5 million; the Bank would
finance US$91.3 million equivalent (92X of the foreign exchange and 771 of the
total). A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are summarized in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 9810-PH dated December 23, 1991, is being distributed separately.
10.       Project Sustainability.  NEA will develop for each participating REC
an Evaluation Report that details the (i) technical and economic parameters of
the investments; (ii) financial and operating projections for the REC; and
(iii) the PIP and other conditionality being required by NEA (ten of these
reports have already been provided for the Bank's review and comment).  NEA
now uses an acceptable, rigorous methodology for formulating all its invest-
ments, regardless of the source of finance; and it will apply loan terms and
conditionality on a source neutral basis.



-4-
11.                         Thead Actlons    The Government agreed to (a) make timely budgetary
provisions for the financial restructuring of NEA, and (b) provide NEA forward
cover against foreign exchange risk for a market-based variable fee. NEA has
agreed to: ,a) refrain from amending the SOP or its annexes without prior con-
sultation with the Bank; (b) furnish audited financial statements by September
30 of each year; (c) furnish all Evaluation Reports to the Bank for review and
comment; (d) furnish copies of onlending agreements with the RECs, within 30
days of their signature; and (e) conduct with the Bank an annual review of its
investment program for the next five years; and (f) arrange a satisfactory
parallel financing Agreement with USAID. Also, the SOP includes provisions
for NEA to (a) adopt financial policies enabling it to realize (i) collections
of at least 70X in 1992, 75X in 1993, 80X in 1994, and 85X in 1995 and there-
after; (ii) a return on total assets that is positive through 1994, and at
least 2.5X there4fter; (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of 2.0; and (iv) a
debt:equity of less than 60:40; (b) seek REC adoption of the following long
term financial objectives: (i) a current ratio of at least 1.0; (ii) a self-
financing ratio of 20X; and (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of at least
1.1; and (c) seek the RECs' agreement to implement PIPs as conditions of their
borrowing from NEA. The proposed loan also has the following conditions of
effectiveness: (a) NEA's retention of consultants to develop and implement
procedures for (i) materials handling, and (ii) loan programming and adminis-
tration; and (b) NEA Board adoption of the tariff policy manual (para. 4 [b]).
12.       Environment.  The proposed project is not expected to pose environ-
mental problems. The rehabilitation and system reliability components involve
adjustments to systems already in place. The system extension components do
envision some new works that would follow existing infrastructure in thinly
populated areas. Where substations are to be upgraded, NEA has indicated that
transformers containing PCB will be disposed of safely.
13.       Agnefits.  The main benefits of the project are (a) stimulation of
economic activity in provincial areas through the improved supply of reason-
ably priced, reliable energy; (b) poverty alleviation through the facilitation
of employment opportunities primarily in agriculture and small scale industry;
and (c) improvement in the quality of life in rural areas, especially for
women, through the wider availability of home lighting and refrigeration.
14.       Risks.  The proposed project is ambitious, and may exceed the capac-
ity of the RECs to meet implementation schedules or furnish counterpart funds.
The project was designed to enable the dropping of subprojects in the event
that any REC9s absorptive capacity is exceeded.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.

plement, to cover NEA's materials handling costs, equal to 5X of the
principle amount, for twenty years (including three years of grace) at
an interest rate of 121. The portion corresponding to the Bank's inter-
est rate (7.73X less a 0.25% prompt payment rebate) is allocated as for-
eign cost, while the remainder is allocated as local cost. NEA would
finance the foreign component of interest during construction from in-
ternal resources. The RECs wculd finance the local component from their
internal resources.
