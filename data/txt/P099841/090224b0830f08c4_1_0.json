In 2005,\n            a series of avian flu outbreaks near Moldova's western\n            border resulted in the culling of thousands of birds.\n            Moldova's laboratory equipment was outdated. Its\n            medical and veterinary personnel had little training and\n            experience detecting the virus, and the public was poorly\n            aware of risk associated with avian flu and other infectious\n            diseases. What's more, there was little compensation\n            for farmers whose chickens had to be culled. All of this\n            presented a big challenge to an effective government\n            response. At the request of the Government of Moldova, the\n            World Bank stepped in to coordinate a multi-donor effort to\n            strengthen Moldova's capacity to respond and mitigate\n            outbreaks of avian influenza and other infections, and\n            increase the country's preparedness for possible\n            pandemics. On the human health side, the renovation of an\n            intensive care unit within the premises of the National\n            Infectious Diseases Hospital has meant that every Moldovan\n            infected with a deadly strain of influenza virus has a\n            better chance of survival. The project's lasting effect\n            is that it has also managed to change people's\n            attitudes and behavior when it comes to prevention of\n            infectious diseases. Extensive communication and public\n            awareness campaigns targeted all age groups and stimulated a\n            high level of social awareness."}, "docdt": "2012-01-30T06:49:00Z"}
