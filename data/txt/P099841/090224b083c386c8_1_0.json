When avian flu outbreaks in 2005 hit Central and\n            Eastern Europe governments, healthcare and veterinary\n            institutions went on high alert. Avian Influenza Project\n            strengthened Moldova's capacity to respond and mitigate\n            outbreaks of avian influenza and other infections, and\n            increase the country's preparedness for possible\n            pandemics. A full-fledged rehabilitation of Moldova's\n            main human and animal virology labs was done to diagnose\n            viruses in people and animals. The World Bank joined with\n            the government to establish streamlined and transparent\n            compensation mechanisms to assist farmers whose chickens had\n            to be culled. The project's lasting effect was that it\n            had also managed to change people's attitudes and\n            behavior when it comes to prevention of infectious diseases."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T06:48:01Z"}
