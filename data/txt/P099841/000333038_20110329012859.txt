Restructuring Paper 
 
1. 
The closing date for the MOLDOVA, AVIAN INFLUENZA CONTROL & 
HUMAN PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS & RESPONSE PROJECT
,
Credit 4188-
MD/Grant H233-MD, P099841 
will be extended from March 31, 2011 until May 15, 
2011. 
2.  The Project’s implementation status is satisfactory. All planned activities with the 
exception of one are already completed. The Project is soundly on course to achieve 
its Development Objective. The Project is current on all audit requirements with no 
outstanding fiduciary issues. 
 
3.  The proposed extension is necessary to allow more time for the completion of supply 
and installation of IT equipment for an epidemiological surveillance system devised 
under the Project’s Human Health Component. The basic design and 
operationalization of the system occurred in 2009, but some further adjustments and 
physical expansion where necessary to enhance its ability to cover not just avian 
influenza but a broad spectrum of viral infections.  Furthermore, a push was made to 
pilot the system in one district not just at preventive medicine entities, but at all 
public health institutions. Unfortunately, the failure of one supplier to deliver on time 
the necessary IT equipment for the physical expansion of the system resulted in a 
highly-probable risk of incompletion of this important activity before closing. This 
would result in an unfortunate penalization of the Beneficiary, which has throughout 
implementation has demonstrated a strong commitment to the Project’s objectives. 
The Beneficary does not have own resources to finance the procurement of the IT 
equipment in question. The extension would allow for the supply and installation of 
goods to be completed with financing from the Project, while enabling the client to 
successfully achieve the system’s necessary operating expansion.  
 
4.  This will be the second extension of the Project. The cumulative duration of the 
Project’s extensions will be 16.5 months.
