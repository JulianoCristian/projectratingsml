3.     The Project is solidly on course to achieve its development objective, and
implementation progress is satisfactory. All planned activities will be completed before
the closing date of March 31, 2011. As of January 15, 2011, the Project has disbursed
US$8.85 million of its overall financing envelope, including US$7.4 million of IDA grant
and credit (88%), and is expected to disburse 100% of proceeds by closing. The Project
has consistently received unqualified audits and is in compliance with all legal covenants. The
latest ratings on procurement and financial management are satisfactory as well.


4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance a few final activities aimed at
strengthening the Project's development impact. The proposed activities are:

         ·   Expansion of the epidemiological surveillance system for infectious diseases
             and related user training;
         ·   Procurement of server software licenses for the system above;
         ·   Procurement of a sampling truck for the Republican Veterinary Diagnostic
             Center;
         ·   Implementation of a Knowledge and Practices Survey amongst the public and
             health and veterinary professionals on matters related to avian, pandemic and
             seasonal influenza.
