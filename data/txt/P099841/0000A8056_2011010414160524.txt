                         The overall objective of the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and other infectious diseases that
                         originate in animals.

                         well ahead of most others in the region. The Moldovan response to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/10 was also among the best in the region. The disease was effectively contained and
                         human casualties were minimized. To a considerable extent this can be attributed to the investments in institutional and human capacity made under the Project.
