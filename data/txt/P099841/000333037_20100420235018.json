The\n            reallocation is necessary to continue the support under the\n            project's animal health component for activities aimed\n            at strengthening the diagnosis capacity of the Republican\n            Center for Veterinary Diagnostics (RCVD). The reallocation\n            will allow for the financing of one significant additional\n            output, the refurbishment of the Central Veterinary\n            Laboratory (CVL) of the RCVD. This important work was\n            supposed to be completed till 2007 with funding from the\n            Government's own budget in order to complement the\n            project's focus on strengthening the country's\n            capacity for animal health diagnosis. However, the\n            Government was unable to fund the refurbishment of the CVL\n            due to severe budget spending constraints in recent years.\n            The civil works and equipment involved, costing an estimated\n            US$1.5 million, comprise the installation of new utilities\n            (water, gas, heating, electricity) in the entire building\n            and of an elevator, as well as the refurbishment of interior\n            walls and floors to ensure essential hygiene in the\n            laboratory. In addition, the project will support the\n            installation of a medium capacity incinerator to ensure the\n            secure disposal of biological waste. Completing these works\n            and acquiring the necessary equipment will ensure that the\n            building of the CVL is structurally sound and all its\n            sections are up to date with respect to basic laboratory\n            sanitary, safety and utility requirements, efficient\n            workflows, and effective provision of enabling conditions\n            for the diagnosis of highly pathogenic avian influenza. In\n            addition, these activities will ensure that all prior\n            support provided by the project and other donors for\n            strengthening CVL's diagnosis capacity will be\n            safeguarded against possible physical deterioration of the building."}, "docdt": "2010-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
