The closing\n            date for the project will be extended from March 31, 2011\n            until May 15, 2011. The extension is necessary to allow more\n            time for the completion of supply and installation of IT\n            equipment for an epidemiological surveillance system devised\n            under the project's human health component. The basic\n            design and operationalization of the system occurred in\n            2009, but some further adjustments and physical expansion\n            where necessary to enhance its ability to cover not just\n            avian influenza but a broad spectrum of viral infections.\n            Furthermore, a push was made to pilot the system in one\n            district not just at preventive medicine entities, but at\n            all public health institutions. Unfortunately, the failure\n            of one supplier to deliver on time the necessary IT\n            equipment for the physical expansion of the system resulted\n            in a highly-probable risk of incompletion of this important\n            activity before closing. This will result in an unfortunate\n            penalization of the Beneficiary, which has throughout\n            implementation has demonstrated a strong commitment to the\n            project's objectives. The Beneficiary does not have own\n            resources to finance the procurement of the IT equipment in\n            question. The extension will allow for the supply and\n            installation of goods to be completed with financing from\n            the Project, while enabling the client to successfully\n            achieve the system's necessary operating expansion."}, "docdt": "2011-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
