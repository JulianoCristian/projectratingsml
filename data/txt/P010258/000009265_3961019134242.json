Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, it is of critical importance to\n            have stable, strong, and capable leadership on a continuing\n            basis. Second, institution building is a slow process.\n            Third, it is preferable to have agricultural banks that are\n            closely integrated into a country's financial system\n            rather than institutions given such a specialized position\n            as ADBP. Fourth, the Bank should take a firmer position\n            regarding the financial performance of the banks, insisting\n            on satisfactory results as a precondition for (continued)\n            lending. Fifth, in designing repeater projects like the\n            Agricultural Credit Project, it would have been desirable to\n            avoid the overlap with the preceding sixth project. Finally,\n            poor profitability of agricultural banks in general, and\n            ADBP in particular, is the result of administered,\n            subsidized interest rates to borrowers which do not pass on\n            the full cost of lending."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
