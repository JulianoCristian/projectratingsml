                         The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs. This will be achieved by: (i) building an integrated market access and
                         trade facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the
                         capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing
                         selected business constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade
                         promotion, and trade facilitation infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and
                         implementation roles of the Government

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The project has been restructured, including cancellation of a portion of the original allocation, extension of the closing date for selected components and discontinuation of a
                         number of activities which were yet to start, faced ownership challenges and had unclear links to the Project's Development objectives. For the the remainder of its implementation
                         period, in order to fully focus support under the project and increase the pace of implementation, assistance to the Access to Finance, ICT Park construction and Matching Grant

                         scheme for Business Development Services targeting SMEs, business associations and financial institutions with departments focusing on SME Credit components will be the main
                         beneficiaries.
                         2. The revisions to the project include (a) Cancellation of USD Ten Million (US$10.0 million) from the un-disbursed and uncommitted Credit proceeds and transfer of same to
                         government's budget support allocation.; (b) selective extension of the closing date for 18 months, from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013; (c) changes to the Results Framework
                         to better reflect revisions to the project's components and to further enhance the links between the inputs, deliverables and project impacts desired.
                         3. Implementation of one of the key activities under the Access to Finance (A2F) component has suffered a setback. After several months of discussions, appraisal of, and
                         agreements with a financial institution (FI) that had expressed interest in taking up the Partial Credit Guarantee facility, the FI has at the last minute written to the IFC of their
                         unwillingness to consummate the deal. That makes it two financial institutions that have, during the project implementation period, abrogated access to finance arrangements which
                         were on the verge of being consummated; nevertheless, two other key FIs have also indicated their interest in the both the Line of Credit facility, and the Guarantee facility, and have
                         been issued terms letters. IFC is in discussions with the said FIs and plan to have a clear view of whether there's scope for carrying on with these banks by mid-January 2012; In
                         addition, a number of FIs have applied to utilize the technical assistance to financial institutions to strengthen their SME departments. The IDA-IFC team is working with another bank
                         and a firm that specializes in out-grower schemes to institute a performance-based on-lending scheme, and technical assistance support that would improve entrepreneurs operating
                         in the selected value chain's ability to access credit, and markets.
                         4. The recently selected Fund Manager for the Business Development Service (BDS) Matching Grant Fund has re-started operations of the fund which seeks to extend market
                         development support to SMEs, business associations, BDS service providers, and key players in the priority value chains identified to be supported under the project.
                         5. Support for business environment improvements (business facilitating infrastructure) is ongoing - enhancement of water supply to firms operating in the Tema EPZ has delayed as
                         a result of access to land difficulties; Resolution of flooding problems within the Tema EPZ is showing satisfactory progress.; the bid documents for the construction of and ICT facility,
                         that would among others incubate SMEs in the ICT sector has been cleared; Stabilization of power supply to the Adjabeng SMEs Garment Cluster is almost complete, and most
                         SMEs located and operating in the cluster have benefited under the BDS support. The process to create electronic market sites for products of Ghanaian SMEs is almost complete.
                         We anticipate these web sites will go live in early 2012. Support to SMEs in the Creative Industries sector and SMEs operating in the Tourism sector - CEDECOM have however
                         faced implementation difficulties.
                         6. While project implementation and progress towards achieving the development objectives continues to be rated generally satisfactory, disbursement performance is unsatisfactory,
                         however, it must be noted that the project has submitted at least sixty (60) Credit proceeds withdrawal applications over its implementation period, which under normal circumstances
                         would imply a higher disbursement performance. In this instance, it is not the case, the reason being that the costs of the numerous activities/reforms supported with Credit proceed s
                         have been relatively small due to among other things, the competitive selection process. Some of the major activities that would have led to big-ticket disbursement numbers, have
                         fallen through at the last minute due to issues beyond the project's control, e.g.(i) Line of Credit stopped as selected bank embarked on a merger that is yet to be concluded, (ii) bank
                         that had signed on for Guarantee facility also dropping out and another shopping for better terms from an IFI.
                         The other major disbursement activity (ICT Park for SMEs) is now underway and CY12 disbursement numbers would reflect the improvements. It must also be noted that support to
                         the Business environment (BE) component was eventually cost shared with other donors who provided additional funds during the implementation of the BE reforms leading to a
                         lesser amount contributed from the Credit, thus also affecting amounts disbursed.
