                         The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs. This will be achieved by: (i) building an integrated market access and trade
                         facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the capacity of local
                         intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing selected business
                         constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade promotion, and trade facilitation
                         infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and implementation roles of the Government

                         1. Project has been restructured for a second time. The reason for the restructuring is to allow sufficient time for the completion of two (2) key activities which were delayed as a result
                         of tardiness in making decisions. The closing date has been extended for an additional five (5) months, therefore the new closing date is November 29, 2013. The issues that were
                         contributing to the delays have now been resolved and the activities (construction of additional drainage system within the Tema Export Processing Zone (TEPZ) and installation of a
                         water pumping system to enhance water supply to enterprises operating in the TEPZ).
