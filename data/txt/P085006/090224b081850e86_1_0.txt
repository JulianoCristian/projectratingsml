                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs. This will be achieved by: (i) building an integrated market access and trade
                         facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the capacity of local
                         intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing selected business
                         constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade promotion, and trade facilitation
                         infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and implementation roles of the Government

                         1. Implementation progress generally continues to be satisfactory since project was restructured. However, in the past few months, two (2) key activities which are also on the critical
                         path and would assist make SMEs more competitive have stalled. This is on account of delayed decision making on the client side. Th overall IP is therefore downgraded to
                         Moderately Satisfactory, but will be subject to an upgrade once resolved.

                         2. Under the Access to Finance component, in view of the difficulties encountered signing up additional qualified and interested banks for the Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) facility
                         and/or Line of Credit (LOC) facility, the Government has requested re-allocation of the remaining PCG and LOC funds to other project activities. The on-going PCG facility agreement
                         entered into with a participating bank will be continued through project closing, however, remaining funds will no longer be used to finance any new PCG/LOC arrangement but will be
                         re-allocated to finance additional construction costs of the ICT Park and associated works.

                         3. Under the Access to Markets, Entrepreneurship Development and Trade Facilitation component, the website for Made-in-Ghana goods produced by Ghanaian SMEs is now
                         operational; construction of the ICT Park is over 40% complete and is on schedule to be completed by project end. Marketing of the facility is in its early stages.

                         4. Award of contract for the construction of drains in the Tema EPZ to forestall future flooding and consequent destruction of the operations and facilities of enterprises located in the
                         zone was done in October 2012 and the contractor has delivered their performance guarantee to the project unit. The Ministry of Trade is yet to sign the contract, and for an
                         assignment noted as being critical and on the critical path, any further delays will affect the likelihood of achieving the PDOs. In view of the delayed initiation of this assignment and
                         the potential impact of its non-implementation on the competitiveness of SMEs located in Tema EPZ, the rating of the PDO has been downgraded.

                         5. Progress on the establishment of the Rural Technology Facilities (3 locations) to assist in making MSMEs in the rural sector competitive is satisfactory. GRATIS and the District
                         Assemblies which are charged with technical management and administration of the facilities and the Ministry of Trade are finalizing the transfer processes.

                         6. In view of funds committed to the delivery of civil works, disbursement rates still look relatively low, however, 90% of undisbursed funds have been committed and once the
                         contract for the drainage system is signed, committed and disbursed will be approaching 100%.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Access to land difficulties continue to are hamper efforts to improve water supply to the TEPZ enclave, and the December elections have also contributed to delays in key decision
                         making. These difficulties have no relation to safeguards issues, but rather Govt agencies taking decisive action.

                         Construction of ICT incubation center for SMEs is underway, and progress is significant and satisfactory.

                         Funds allocated for the signing up of commercial banks in partnership with WBG on Credit Guarantees and Lines of Credit have been re-allocated for the completion of the ICT Park
                         and associated facilities. This is as a result of low to no interest on the part of the targeted commercial banks.

                         Continued delay in the signing of contract awarded for constructing drains within the Tema EPZ may lead to loss of funds as project is scheduled to close June 2013.
