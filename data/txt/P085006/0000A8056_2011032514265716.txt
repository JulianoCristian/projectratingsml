                         The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs. This will be achieved by: (i) building an integrated market access and
                         trade facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the
                         capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing
                         selected business constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade
                         promotion, and trade facilitation infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and
                         implementation roles of the Government

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. A second bank will soon sign on to one of the Access to Finance (A2F) Facilities. The facility seeks to improve Ghanaian SMEs' access to finance. Fifty six (56) SMEs have

                         benefited from the facility provided to the first local bank, one year into signing up. 2. The Matching Grant scheme that supports SMEs seeking business development services to
                         grow their businesses, will re-start operations March 9, 2011 under a new Fund Manager, after the initial firm's contract expired. In the first half of 2010, SMEs supported under the
                         credit have subsequently seen improvements in their operations and are reporting new contracts amounting to US$ 3.3 Million. 3. Sub-contracting Exchange sub-activity being
                         implemented by the AGI has developed customized training modules to enhance the capacity of SMEs operating in the Construction, Oil & Gas sectors. The training is expected to
                         facilitate enterprises' access to new contracts. The reported total value of contracts signed between SMEs supported under this sub-activity and larger firms is the equivalent of
                         approx. US$ 2.9 Million. 4. Design of the proposed ICT Park is underway and construction of the Park is scheduled to begin by the fourth quarter of this year. 5. Improvements to the
                         water supply at the Tema Export Processing Zone is ongoing and similarly, stabilization of power supply in the Adjabeng Garments Enclave. 6. Project Coordination Unit has its full
                         complement of staff as agreed during the project's Mid-term review. 7. Project Steering and Implementation Committees to provide policy guidance and ensure adherence to
                         implementation schedules are yet to be re-constituted as agreed, and this situation must be rectified in the shortest possible time to ensure implementation progress is further
                         improved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         In view of the project's slow disbursement, Government has requested that US$10.0 Million of the project's original allocation amount be canceled and re-committed to other priority
                         programs of Government. The cancellation is effective November 9, 2010. This will result in a number of project activities being streamlined, and those that are yet to start canceled
                         to ensure adequate resources are available to fund those remaining activities which are also deemed to have the highest likelihood of contributing to the achievement of the project's
                         developmental objectives when implemented.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
