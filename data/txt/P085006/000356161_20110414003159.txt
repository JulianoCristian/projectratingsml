The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs.  This will be 
achieved by:  (i) building an integrated market access and trade facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively 
supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the 
capacity of local intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to 
make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing selected business constraints, including technical 
barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade 
promotion, and trade facilitation infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) 
enhancing the facilitation, project development, and implementation roles of the Government
