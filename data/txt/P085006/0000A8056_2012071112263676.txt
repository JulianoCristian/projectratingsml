                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims to enhance the competitive and employment levels of Ghanaian MSMEs. This will be achieved by: (i) building an integrated market access and trade
                         facilitation infrastructure; (ii) proactively supporting entrepreneurship development; (iii) developing and strengthening, on a sustainable basis, the capacity of local
                         intermediaries to deliver financial and non-financial services to MSMEs, and MSMEs to make productive use of these services; (iv) reducing selected business
                         constraints, including technical barriers to trade, faced by MSMEs; (v) providing an enabling environment (access to finance, trade promotion, and trade facilitation
                         infrastructure) to boost increased investments I the MSME sector; and (vi) enhancing the facilitation, project development, and implementation roles of the Government

                         1. Since the project was restructured one year ago, implementation progress has picked up considerably. The re-constituted Project Steering Committee has been meeting regularly
                         and has ensured all issues constraining progress have been or are resolved in a timelymanner. The project coordination unit has been strengthened and significant improvement in
                         performance has been noted, however, supervision of the PCU and hence noted activities must be continued.

                         2. Under the Access to Finance component, efforts to sign up commercial banks under the PCG and LoC continue. In view of this, Govt proposes to request a restructuring of
                         project, if by June 30, no new commercial banks have signed on. Under the on-going PCG facility, which has been in place for over 2 years, over Five Hundred and eighty (580)
                         SMEs have gained accessed to otherwise hard to get and high cost short to medium term loans, amounting to over Seven Million US Dollars
                         (US$ 7.0 M). Under a different transaction not supported under this Credit, IFC have signed up an SME Bank to a LOC, equity participation and Technical Assistance. The Diaspora
                         equity funds initiative which sought to develop a new financial product for SMEs would be discontinued, as the legal framework now exists for private fund managers to pursue.

                         3. Under the Access to Markets, Entrepreneurship Development and Trade Facilitation component, the second phase of the Matching Grant Facility that supports Business
                         Development Services for MSMEs has received significant amounts of inquiries and subsequent applications. In view of the reductions in the amounts allocated for this activity on
                         account of delayed disbursements, the project will not be able to finance all applications. We currently estimate the total amount required to support pending applications is at least
                         Four Million US Dollars (sub-component's allocation amount is just over One Million USD).

                         4. Construction of the ICT Park that would among others, incubate SMEs in the ICT sector is now on-going. We estimate construction and handover will be done by end June 2013.
                         Ministry of Communication is currently also working on ensuring the site is populated and under professional management and would soon embark on a marketing scheme aimed at
                         engaging investors and tenants. Given the reduction in the total Credit amount, financing the total initial cost of public investments cannot be met. IDA will work with Government to
                         ensure the facility is fully equipped to support firms that locate there.

                         5. Support for the establishment Rural Technology Facilities (3 locations) to assist in making MSMEs in the rural sector competitive have been launched; (ii) Technical assistance to
                         support SMEs operating in the Tourism sector in the Central Region is underway; (iii) websites showcasing Ghanaian MSMEs' products have been completed and are running; and
                         (iv) and technical assistance to support the Creative Industries is now under implementation as a result of the timely intervention of the Steering Committee in resolving some difficult
                         project issues. PSC supervision and guidance will be crucial during the remainder of the project period to assure satisfactory progress.

                         6. By way of results, the cotton industry has attracted investments of about US$100 Million due in part to technical assistance provided in addressing equitable pricing for seed cotton;
                         HACCP certification, organic produce certification, product traceability scheme have assisted to increase access to global markets contributing to jumps in the levels of NTEs.
                         7. With all these activities underway, the project expects to disburse significant amounts of the Credit during the next six (6) months.
