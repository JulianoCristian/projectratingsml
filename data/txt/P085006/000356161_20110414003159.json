Credit proceeds\n            will be re-allocated to reflect the newly agreed scope of\n            the project.

The partial\n            cancellation amount will be re-committed to the general\n            International Development Association (IDA) pool for Ghana\n            and towards support for fast moving projects. Project\n            outcomes are unchanged; however, the outcome indicators are\n            being modified to better reflect the revised scope of the\n            project.
