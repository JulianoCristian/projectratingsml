objectives are\n            to: (a) assist in the development of the Morava region, one\n            of the less developed rural areas of Yugoslavia, through\n            increases in productivity, employment, and income of the\n            individual farm sector which is the poorest and the least\n            developed sector of the project area; (b) increase\n            production of meat, milk, fruits and processed food products\n            primarily for the domestic market; (c) increase exports of\n            processed food products based on primary agricultural\n            production in the project area; (d) contribute to\n            institution building by strengthening the organizational and\n            project preparation capacities of the regional development\n            institutions in the project area; and (e) strengthen the\n            appraisal and supervision capacity of Investbanka, the\n            proposed borrower. The project objectives will be achieved\n            by providing finance for: (a) livestock and horticultural\n            production primarily on individual farms; (b) strengthening\n            of technical support services; and (c) increasing processing\n            capacities to ensure adequate and steady markets for\n            agricultural products from the project area."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
