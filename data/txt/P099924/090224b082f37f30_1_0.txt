Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The mission team concluded that overall project implementation had continued to improve. The status of activities was observed as follows:
 1.       Continuing progress was observed in the deployment of the accounting system (FARABI) with implementation of originally and additionally
          contracted modules in 99 pilot sites. Overall, the implementation was completed at 92 sites out of 99. It is expected that the implementation of
          the system in remaining 7 sites will be completed by the end of the project.
 2.       Preparation of the national accounting qualification and accreditation for the ACCA and CIPFA programs is in process;
 3.       Progress has been made to enhance the financial sustainability of the Finance and Science Training Center, including progress on launching
          commercial courses and expansion into a regional Accounting and Audit Training Hub. However, the Center will need to continue growing its
          commercial courses in the next year and following years to assure sustainability.

         1. SDP of CoA consists of 4 components similar to four existing contracts implemented within CAPSAP. All activities under component 1, 2
         and 4 are completed so they are valued as 100% implementation. In case of component 3 comprising legislation and standards related
         items in terms of legislation works are not fully completed. The amendments to the Chamber of Accounts law are drafted and now COA
         plans to start necessary proceeding toward its approval in the Parliament. Since it could take some time to finalize the progress for all 4
         components in total is valued as 80% for 2014 and 100% for the next year.
         2. The state budget expenditures consist of three parts: current expenditures, capital investments, expenditures related to the public debt.
         For 2015 the total budgeted expenditure equals 21,080 mln. AZN, where 10, 928.50 mln. AZN are the current expenditures. Budget of
         institutions connected to FARABI system constitues 3,804 mln. AZN.

 of a new Law on Chamber which will set the legislative framework for using a new methodology. Currently, the law in force prevents the COA to
 implement a new methodology in full its capacity.
 However, despite of restrictions in the law the COA is continuing to conduct pilot performance and financial audits as set up by the project.

               Comments
               The project did not envisage translation of IFRS standards, as MoF has done such translations itself starting from 2006. However, given
               that MoF did not envisage translation of IFRS for SMEs and there was a need for that, the project translated all IFRS for SMEs (issued
               2009).

               SDP of CoA consists of 4 components similar to four existing contracts implemented within CAPSAP. All activities under component 1, 2
               and 4 are completed so they are valued as 100% implementation. In case of component 3 comprising legislation and standards related
               items in terms of legislation works are not fully completed. The amendments to the Chamber of Accounts law are drafted and now COA
               plans to start necessary proceeding toward its approval in the Parliament. Since it could take some time to finalize the progress for all 4
               components in total is valued as 80% for 2014 and 100% for the next year.
               Cumulative target values by December are for 2012 – 0, for 2013 – 0, 2014 – 0, 2015 – 0. The reason is that progress in using the new
               methodology of audit depends largely upon approval of the Law in the new variant described above. So depending on exact date of
               approval, the situation in 2015 could change significantly.

               11 textbooks were either translated or developed within the framework of the project. 9 of them are audit, accounting and tax related,
               remaining 2 – MIS and Economics. The textbooks which FSTC uses for its programs are those used by ACCA for professional education.
               They are not intended for higher education institutes, as the latter use different syllabuses and approaches to study process (e.g. more
               lecture hours, practical hours, etc.). However, these books are distributed to higher education institutions and used by them as a
               recommended literature.
