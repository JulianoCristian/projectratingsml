                                 Executive Summary

The Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project (CAPSAP) was approved by the
Bank on March 27, 2008. The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to strengthen
accountability and transparency in public and corporate sector financial reporting in
accordance with international best practices, and to support ongoing institutional
strengthening. The project aimed to support the Government of Azerbaijan’s (GOA)
implementation of the 2004 Accounting Law, which mandated the use of accounting
standards based on international best practices. At the time, GOA lacked capacity to
comply with the law. The Bank’s support was in line with the Country Partnership Strategy
for 2007-2010.

The project involved four components, including: corporate sector accountability; public
sector accountability; stronger accounting, auditing and financial management capacity;
and project management. Two modifications were made to activities within the
components, but not to the PDO. Other notable changes arising from the restructurings
included a change in IDA contribution to 100 percent from 60 percent; changes to the
results framework and monitoring indicators; and two extensions of the closing date from
December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013, then to June 30, 2015.

After a slow and problematic start, the project began yielding positive results subsequent
to the first restructuring. The development outcome risk was assessed as moderate, while
both Bank and borrower performance have been assessed as satisfactory. A beneficiary
survey by an independent consultant and stakeholders’ workshop were conducted,
indicating the project produced a positive outcome. The co-financier State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs (SECO) of Switzerland rated the project as satisfactory. The
Government of Azerbaijan also submitted its Implementation and Completion Results
Report (ICR), which reflected a satisfactory performance of the project. The GOA noted
in its evaluation of the Bank’s performance that the Bank provided full support to the
implementation of the project and was receptive to the government’s priorities, which
contributed greatly to the achievement of the PDO. Following project closure, the GOA
will continue implementing all activities related to this project using its own resources.

One of the achievements of the project was the roll out of Financial and Accountability
Reporting Application for Budgetary Institutions (FARABI) system to 99 ministries and
budget organizations. This has enhanced financial control and is being scaled up to an
additional 900 institutions. FARABI has received very strong backing from the President
and has a user satisfaction rate of 85% based on the beneficiary survey findings.

Another achievement is the training program by the Financial Science and Training Center
(FSTC) which has trained 4,843 students in three courses that target both the public and
corporate sectors. The professional accounting program is in accordance with International
Education Standards that will enhance students’ skills to comply with international
accounting and auditing standards.

The Chamber of Accounts (CoA) has improved its external audit function through
strengthening its skills in financial and performance audits adhering to the International
Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI). Pilot audits undertaken under the project
                                            xvi
will be scaled up when Parliament passes the revised Chambers of Accounts law, providing
the CoA the mandate to conduct the audits.

Transparency and self-governance of the accounting profession is expected to improve
following the establishment of the Accounting and Risk Professional Association of
Azerbaijan (ARPA) that is now registered with the Ministry of Justice. The association is
professionalizing will professionalize the accounting profession in the country by
providing quality assurance to ensure its members comply with international accounting
and auditing standards, setting international ethical standards, and disciplining and
investigating accountants where the need arises. The association is working towards
complying with international requirements as a member of the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC). It plans to become an IFAC member in 2017, funded via membership
fees.

This has been a unique project combining activities to strengthen both corporate and public
sector accountability and transparency based on international best practices. While the
project achieved a satisfactory outcome, it demonstrated that both corporate and public
sectors could benefit from synergies in training and accountancy oversight. The project
also indicated that the flexibility in project design, particularly a gradual and incremental
approach to implementing FARABI, the commitment of the beneficiaries, and openness to
dialogue, are critical to project success.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context: The Republic of Azerbaijan got its independence from the former
Soviet Union in 1991. Discoveries of new oil fields were made in the 1990s and a pipeline
to the port in Turkey completed in 2005. GDP growth rate moved from an average of 4%
between 1995-2000 to 17% between 2001-2008. The poverty rate was reduced from 49%
in 2001 to 13.2% in 2008. Revenues increased due to the oil boom and the challenge at
the time was how to grow the non-oil sectors in order to have a diversified, sustainable,
middle-income economy. Diversification of the non-oil economy required improvements
in the supply of utilities, better infrastructure services (especially transportation),
continued investment in human capital, a supportive business environment, strengthened
public sector management, and expansion of the financial sector.

Sector Context: The Republic of Azerbaijan previously had little experience with
international best practices in accounting, auditing and financial management. The
government enacted the Accounting Law in November 2004 to enhance transparency and
accountability in the corporate and public sectors with the use of international accounting
standards.7 However, it lacked the capacity to comply with these standards. Meanwhile,
ad hoc curriculum development and non-compliance with international accounting and
auditing standards constrained the quality of higher education in accounting and auditing.
Accountancy professionals also lacked access to continuing education opportunities.
Increasing use of the Azerbaijani language posed a further challenge due to the absence of
local language textbooks and other teaching materials.

Rationale for Bank Assistance: The Bank aimed to support the government’s reform
effort to align the Azerbaijani accounting and auditing arrangements with international
practices, bringing them closer to the needs of a market economy. Bank assistance
supported the first pillar of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2007-2010, namely,
to: (i) improve the quality and transparency of public sector governance by maintaining a
stable macroeconomic framework that makes prudent use of oil revenues; (ii) improve
public expenditure planning and management; (iii) strengthen financial management and
procurement systems; (iv) establish proper public sector and corporate governance,
accounting and auditing frameworks; and (v) create an administrative and regulatory
environment conducive to growth.

The Bank’s findings in the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)
and the 2006 ROSC for Accounting and Auditing suggested a need for reforms to build
capable and accountable state and public interest institutions to manage public resources
and improve accountability and transparency in financial reporting. A September 2009,

  These are the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for Public Interest Entities and National
Accounting Standards for Budgetary Organizations (NASBO) that are in line with IPSAS.



                                                     1
Corporate Governance ROSC also observed that SOEs controlled 15 percent to 25 percent
of GDP. The Bank was well placed to support the government in implementing such
reforms given its knowledge, previous engagement in the country, and broader experience
in the Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA) region, including the European Union (EU)
accession countries.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to strengthen accountability and
transparency in financial reporting for the public and corporate sectors in line with
international best practices, and to support institutional strengthening to sustain reforms.

The PDO in the Financing Agreement was the same as that reflected in the results
monitoring framework of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) under Annex 3 but
differed from that presented in the main text of the PAD. The main text of the PAD read:
The Project Development Objective was to strengthen accountability and transparency in
financial reporting for the public and corporate sectors in line with international best
practices. This report used the PDO presented in the Financing Agreement.

The project outcome indicators were:

     a. Transparency in the corporate and public sectors increased through publishing
        annual financial statements according to international standards.
     b. Accountability within Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Chamber of Accounts
        (CoA) to enforce Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC).
     c. Updated legislative framework for accounting and auditing standards established.
     d. Accounting and auditing profession strengthened through the establishment of
        training and certification programs and education standards in line with
        international standards.

Arrangements for results monitoring as presented in the PAD did not include the indicator
on an updated legislative framework for accounting and auditing standards.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Justification

The PDO was not revised during the project. The results and indicators were revised under
the second restructuring to reflect modifications that were introduced to the project.
Modifications were referred to as PDO Level Results Indicators, and include:

    a. Transparency, self-governance and education in the accounting and audit
       profession improved with the establishment of an Association of Professional
       Accountants that follows international standards.
    b. Accountability in management of public funds strengthened through
       improvements in the external audit and internal controls environments.



                                             2
    c. Accounting and auditing profession strengthened through the establishment of
       training and certification programs and education standards at Azerbaijan Center
       for Professional Accounting and Audit Training, Education and Research
       (ACPATER) in line with international standards.

This Implementation and Completion Results Report (ICR) uses the Results Framework
and Monitoring table approved under the second restructuring.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The original beneficiaries comprised public interest entities, including state-owned
enterprises, the CoA (the country's supreme audit institution), the Chamber of Auditors
(CoAA), the MOF, and accounting and auditing professionals and stakeholders in
Azerbaijan.

The beneficiaries were modified following the first and second restructuring of the project.
This involved dropping the Chamber of Auditors and adding the Financial Science and
Training Center, Accounting and Risk Professionals Association of Azerbaijan (ARPA)
and budget organizations using FARABI.

1.5 Original and Revised Components (as approved)

The project originally comprised four components, two of which were revised in the first
restructuring in September 2011 and three in the November 2013 second restructuring.

 Original Components                                   Revised Components
 (PMU) at the MOF. The PMU conducted
 project management, procurement, financial
 management and monitoring and evaluation
 of the project.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

Change in IDA Contribution: After the first restructuring, IDA increased its funding
contribution to the project from 60 percent to 100 percent mainly because it agreed to fund
sub-component 2.3, pertaining to the unified automated accounting system for line
ministries and budgetary organizations.

Closing Date Extensions: Initial project implementation delays as well as modifications
to project components that required time to implement resulted in project extensions. The
first restructuring extended the project’s closing date for 12 months from December 31,
2012 to December 31, 2013. The second restructuring extended the closing date by 18
months to June 30, 2015 for IDA (Credit 44050) and Japan PHRD (TF 57849), while SECO
(TF 98323) was extended by 12 months to December 31, 2014, as the parent Trust Fund
was due to close by June 30, 2015.

Results Framework and Monitoring Indicators: The PDO level and intermediate results
and indicators were revised during the second restructuring to reflect modifications
introduced to the project after it had begun. The ICR is using these indicators to assess
results.

Cancellations: At project closure, US$17,438.43 related to SECO funding (TF 98323) was
cancelled since it was not utilized.

Government Co-financing: The Government of Azerbaijan committed to fund US$8
million, but disbursed only US$7,154,957.88 by the project’s end. The Government ICR
notes that the balance of US$845,042.12 is attributable to US$644,437.70 related to
exchange rate losses as well as US$200,604.42 that was on the project bank account but
fully committed to be utilized under the project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis: The project was prepared primarily to support
MOF’s implementation of the 2004 Accountancy Law 11 given that that it lacked the



11
  These included compliance with international accountant standards, that is, IFRS and NASBOs that mirror
IPSAS.



                                                   6
capacity to do so, and to support extensive state ownership of the corporate sector. SOEs
controlled 15 percent to 25 percent12 of GDP, and need to comply with IFRS in line with
market economy international practices. To prepare the project, the Bank leveraged its
experience in implementing similar projects in other regions, as well as its extensive
diagnostic work in other ECA countries to address similar challenges. The Bank’s
experience includes improving corporate and public sector accountability in countries that
had transitioned from a command- to market-driven economy. The Bank also drew from
relevant recommendations in the Azerbaijan 2003 CFAA and 2006 ROSC Accounting and
Auditing reports.

Assessment of the project design: The PDO was ample and allowed flexibility in
including requirements from the government during the first and second restructuring. The
components were sufficient to cover aspects of the 2004 Accountancy Law that the
government was targeting. One issue to note is that the project design should have
prioritized Component Two on Public Sector Accountability, to have an Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), rather than Component One on
Corporate Sector Accountability, to strengthen the financial management capacity
(including computerizing the accounting system) of three SOEs that were PIEs so they
would comply with IFRS. SOEs tend to fund these capacity-building activities using their
own resources. However, it was noted during project preparation that the three SOEs did
not have the required resources.

Implementation arrangements: The Project Management Unit (PMU) was responsible
for implementing the project but had to coordinate with a number of beneficiary
implementing entities (CoA, CoAA, FSTC, ARPA, ministries and budget organizations).
Each of these beneficiaries had a dedicated management team to implement their respective
components. At appraisal, the MOF assessed the PMU’s capacity as limited, and it
consequently strengthened the PMU to be able to coordinate beneficiaries’ implementation
of the project by recruitment of experienced and qualified staff. Japan’s PHRD Grant (TF
56724) financed project preparation, including PMU operational expenses. The PHRD
Grant of US$895,000 was approved and made effective on December 8, 2006. It closed on
March 26, 2008 after utilizing US$881,274.65, with US$13,725.35 cancelled. The
objective of the grant was to prepare the project, supporting consultancy services that
included project implementation staff, purchase of goods, training and operating costs.

Adequacy of government commitment: Government commitment was sufficient since
the project directly supported the operationalization of the 2004 Accountancy Law. The
government committed to co-finance the project with US $8 million. The Minister of
Finance demonstrated commitment to the project, and established a Project Steering
Committee (PSC), chaired by the Deputy Ministry of Finance, to provide oversight.

Assessment of risks: At appraisal, project risk was assessed as moderate. Critical risks and
mitigation measures were identified adequately. The Ministry of Finance’s (MOF) capacity

     The percentage is based on the Corporate Governance ROSC for Azerbaijan dated September 2009.



                                                    7
to implement the project was assessed as high risk, but this was appropriately mitigated as
the PMU of MOF satisfactorily implemented the project. Reluctance to address perceived
corruption in the country contributed to a high-risk country and sector assessment, but this
did not impact project implementation.

2.2 Implementation

Delay in implementation of the project: Two issues delayed project implementation for
a total of 2.75 years, and caused the project to have a slow disbursement flag and be
categorized as a problem. Initially, the project struggled since the PMU was disbanded
when Japan’s PHRD Grant (TF 56724) closed on March 26, 2008. MOF subsequently
made a commitment to fund the PMU, and advertised to attract experienced candidates to
key project positions, including the Director, Procurement Specialist and Finance Manager.
The PMU was fully staffed by December 2009. Further delay ensued when the government
changed its priorities and engaged the Bank to harmonize its new strategy with the project.
The major change was that the GOA wanted to have an IFMIS for ministries and budget
organizations, instead of building capacity for three selected PIEs (mainly SOEs) to comply
with IFRS, which required computerizing their accounting systems. GOA argued that PIEs
could use their own resources to apply IFRS, which they did, with 27 PIEs applying the
standards at project closure. The Bank also helped to synchronize GOA’s new strategy
after the first restructuring in September 2011, and thereafter project implementation
significantly scaled up.

Restructuring: Project operations scaled up significantly after the first restructuring, with
disbursements increasing from zero to 10.5 percent for IDA 44050, as documented in the
aide memoire for the mission on November 14-18, 2011. The second restructuring
solidified the government’s implementation strategy and further scaled up project
operations and results.

SECO financing: The Bank’s Board approved the project on March 27, 2008, but co-
financing from SECO Grant TF 98323 was not signed until June 14, 2011, delaying
implementation of sub-component 2.2 on external audit reforms with the CoAs. This was
one of the reasons cited for extending the closing date during the second restructuring.

Chamber of Auditors (CoAA): MOF wanted to engage the CoAA to become an
independent regulatory body providing oversight of external auditors of PIEs. However,
the CoAA wanted to remain a self-regulatory audit body comprised of individual auditors
and audit firms. Related activities were dropped from the project as a result, costing the
government an opportunity to strengthen oversight of PIE external auditors. This issue can
be reassessed under the World Bank’s program on Strengthening Auditing and Reporting
in the Countries of the Eastern Partnership (STAREP), 13 under its two components on
Accounting and Auditing Standards and Financial Regulators Practice Forum.

  The STAREP program aims to assist participating countries, including Azerbaijan, to build capacity in the
accounting and auditing profession, including regulators, students and other stakeholders, and to develop and

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design: Baseline indicators started at zero, based on Advisory Services and
Analytics conducted in Azerbaijan, including the 2003 CFAA, 2006 ROSC Accounting
and Auditing, 2008 PEFA reports, and MOF institutional knowledge. The indicators were
in line with the PDO and were revised during the second restructuring after changes were
made to activities within the components. The indicators were simple and easy to ascertain
amongst the beneficiaries by a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) Specialist working with
the PMU. A status update on the M&E indicators was included in the project’s quarterly
progress reports.

M&E Implementation: The PMU collected appropriate data from the beneficiaries. The
data proved reliable when validated. The indicators were simple, and the information was
easy to acquire.

M&E Utilization: The project had up-to-date M&E data that the PMU evaluated and used
to assess the speed of implementation, particularly to achieve targets that were lagging
behind. Following project closure, the MOF arranged to have M&E data as follows: FSTC
will continue using the current indicators for the training program; the Accounting Policy
Division will also continue using the current indicators to monitor the conversion of
accounting standards into Azerbaijani; and the Modern Technology and Automation
Information Systems Department will expand on the current indicators used for FARABI,
by using periodic beneficiary surveys to identify problem areas. Other beneficiaries,
including the CoA and APRA, will continue to maintain M&E data.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: Procurement was rated as satisfactory despite a slow start. After the
project’s restructuring, a revised procurement plan was implemented quickly and
effectively. The project complied with the Bank’s procurement guidelines. Comprehensive
procurement plans were prepared and submitted to the Bank for approval. Approved
procurement plans were published on a regular basis and updated as needed. The Bank
staff carried out ex ante and ex post previews of the procurement process, reviewed and
cleared procurement documents, contract awards, and amendments as per the provisions
of the Financing Agreements. The PMU completed three procurement post reviews and
identified and resolved minor procurement discrepancies. Recommendations were also
made that strengthened the PMU’s procurement capacity.

Financial Management (FM): Financial management was rated as satisfactory. All FM
financial covenants were complied with in accordance with the Financing Agreement. All
audit reports were received and all had unqualified (clean) audit opinions. There were no




practice an institutional framework for corporate financial reporting that adheres to international accounting,
auditing and accounting education standards.



                                                      9
major issues raised in the audit reports. Management was also responsive in addressing FM
issues.

Safeguards: At appraisal, the project raised no safeguard issues and there were none during
implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Institutional arrangements: Institutional arrangements have been integrated into existing
country systems. MOF will continue to implement FARABI; FSTC will provide
accountancy training, and CoA will conduct financial and performance audits upon the
passing of the CoA law by Parliament. ARPA, a non-governmental organization, will
continue overseeing accountants in line with IFAC requirements.

Financial sustainability: The MOF has allocated funding to scale up the roll out of
FARABI to about 1000 ministries and budget organizations, starting with a target of 303
institutions by the end of 2017. The MOF will also absorb the FARABI Maintenance and
Support Center support staff who are currently under the management of SINAM14 within
the ministry. MOF plans to raise support fees from each budget organization and ministry
using FARABI to meet the costs of the maintenance and support center. In the last two
years of implementation, the Bank has proactively engaged the GOA on financial
sustainability, including insisting on having a business plan. Consequently, the FSTC is
charging fees for the NAQ course, and has earned US$56,000 to date. Revenues are
expected to grow alongside awareness campaigns to increase student numbers. Since the
FSTC is part of MOF, it will receive ministry funding to meet administrative costs related
to its accountancy training programs, including lecturer fees and curricula development.
FSTC also plans to charge license fees to training institutions, such as the Azerbaijan State
Economic University, interested in delivering the NAQ course. MOF will also continue to
support ARPA’s execution of its mandate. ARPA will be collecting membership fees from
accountants and exam fees for the professional accountancy students to sustain its
operational costs. The CoA has an updated SDP for 2015-2017 and plans to start
conducting financial and performance audits of ministries and budget organizations. The
CoA has requested funding support from the Bank and other donors to continue with this
reform program.

Human capital: MOF has acquired the technical capacity to continue the rollout of
FARABI. FSTC has also built capacity by hiring certified lecturers to continue training
accountancy courses. ARPA currently has a team of seven experts. CoA has trained its
staff to conduct financial and performance audits. They are waiting for the passing of the
CoA law by Parliament to commence these audits.

Marketing: MOF plans to market FARABI and the accounting certification program, and
aims to scale up both programs.


14
     SINAM is the company that developed FARABI and is rolling it out to ministries and budget organizations.



                                                      10
Sustainability of monitoring performance indicators: As noted, MOF and all
beneficiaries plan to continue using the project’s indicators as guidance for M&E indicators.
There are also plans to increase the indicators, particularly for FARABI, to tackle common
challenges. Periodic beneficiary surveys will inform indicator development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives: High
The project’s objectives are highly relevant as they adhere to the 2016-2020 Country
Partnership Framework (CPF), which supports the priorities in Azerbaijan’s Vision 2020.
The CPF’s focus area on Public Sector Management and Service Delivery is particularly
relevant to the PDO since the CPF program will continue to support the government to
enhance transparency and accountability in public sector management and service delivery.
The GOA is committed to continue implementing the activities that will strengthen public
and corporate sector accountability and transparency, bringing them in line with
international best practices. For example, the President of Azerbaijan has endorsed the
rollout of FARABI as one of MOF’s key reforms, aiming to improve internal control
systems and ensure ministries and budget organizations produce financial statements that
comply with IPSAS. The MOF’s strong focus on the education of accountants in
Azerbaijani will strengthen the accounting skills of the public sector civil servants and
provide affordable training of professional accountancy courses for the corporate sector.
The efforts of CoA to comply with ISSAIs and make arrangements to start financial and
performance audits will strengthen accountability. Plans for a professional accountancy
body that will monitor accountants in line with IFAC membership requirements will create
professionalism, as ARPA will provide quality assurance, ensure accountants comply with
their code of ethics and discipline, and investigate accountants whenever required. The role
of ARPA in translating or interpreting international accounting standards working in
coordination with MOF will also remain relevant going forward.

Relevance of Design: Substantial
The project’s design became more relevant after the restructuring, despite the cancellation
of some activities within the project, since the GOA continued to implement the cancelled
activities using its own resources. For example, activities related to “Assisting the PIEs in
Embedding IFRS” were cancelled but GOA focused on how it could support all the PIEs
in the country through continuing with activities such as the translation of IFRS into
Azerbaijani and training of corporate accountants under the project and the outcome has
been positive. Twenty-seven PIEs are now applying IFRS, instead of only three that were
targeted to be supported at appraisal. The implementation of the PIFC was canceled, but




                                             11
the GOA implemented the PIFC since it improved related PEFA15 ratings. The GOA plans
to scale up the implementation of project-related components and activities as part of its
Vision 2020 effort, demonstrating the relevance of project design in the post completion
phase. The results framework will also remain relevant since it will be used as a basis to
set new revised targets and set relevant related indicators, for example, to address
challenges in the implementation of FARABI based on findings of beneficiary surveys that
MOF plans to do going forward.

The implementation arrangements have been satisfactory and they will remain. Outsourced
activities, such as the FARABI Maintenance and Support Center, that SINAM is currently
managing, will be integrated within the structures of the MOF.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Objective One: Strengthen accountability and transparency in financial reporting for
the public sector in line with international best practices
Rating: Substantial

The achievements were met under the following PDO indicators:

PDO indicator one: Transparency, self-governance and education in the accounting and
audit profession improved with the establishment of an Association of Professional
Accountants of Azerbaijan (APAA) that follows international standards.

This outcome indicator has benefitted both the public and corporate sector. The Accounting
and Risk Professional Association (ARPA) of Azerbaijan was established and registered
with the Ministry of Justice on December 16, 2014. The indicator was partially achieved
because the association is still working on becoming a member of IFAC and following
international standards that require meeting the SMOs.16 However, APRA aims to become
an IFAC a member by the second quarter of 2017. It has met seven of the 47 actions on
IFAC’s Compliance Self-Assessment Questionnaire, and is working on completing the rest
of the actions. Completed actions include: adoption of the International Ethics Standards
Board of Accountants Code; provision of a group of experts to provide technical advice on
compliance with the SMOs; provision of a contract with CIPFA to provide Cert. IPSAS
course in Azerbaijan and the translation of the course materials into Azerbaijani; and
holding a training and trainers for Cert. IPSAS course. ARPA will use funds generated
from membership fees to achieve the remaining actions.




15
  PEFA indictors related to effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure improved from D+
in 2008 to B+ in 2014. The indicator on effectiveness of internal audit improved from a D in 2008 to C+ in
2014.

16
   There are seven SMOs: IES, IPSAS, ISA, IFRS, Quality Assurance, International Code of Ethics and
Discipline and Investigations.



                                                   12
Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved): The indicator, “Charter and other
legal documents for the establishment of the Association of Professional Accountants of
Azerbaijan (APAA) are prepared and registered with the Ministry of Justice,” was fully
achieved. The project contributed to APAA’s establishment by transforming an existing
association, the Azerbaijan Risk Professional Association, into the Accounting and Risk
Professional Association (ARPA). The 2009 Charter of the Azerbaijan Risk Professional
Association was revised to recognize ARPA’s new role with respect to accountants. It
registered as ARPA’s charter with the Ministry of Justice on December 16, 2014. The
association’s tax identification also changed to ARPA.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved): The indicator, “APAA is capable of
preparing new and revised accounting and audit standards when necessary and fully
responsible for marking exams written by students under National Accounting
Qualification Program,” was fully achieved. ARPA has a group of experts comprised of 5
ACCA members plus 2 ACCA students at the final level of study to prepare and revise
accounting and audit standards. ARPA will be responsible for exam marking. Twenty
accounting professionals received trainings on Marking and Exam Questions Composition
from Ernst & Young 17 Academy of Business on May 15-17, 2015. The accounting
professionals will form a roster of exam markers for ARPA. Thirty-six accounting
professionals who attended the CIPFA18 Training of Trainers’ course for Cert IPSAS on
June          8-12,         2015,          will       also        mark          exams.

ARPA will oversee both public and corporate sector accountants by providing quality
assurance over compliance with international accounting standards; ensuring accountants
abide by ethical standards; and disciplining and investigating accountants if the situation
warrants. This will professionalize accounting in the country and enhance public trust by
strengthening accountability and transparency in financial reporting.

PDO Indicator Two: Accountability in management of public funds strengthened through
improvements in the external audit and internal controls environments. This has two
indicators:

Percentage of state budget processed through FARABI (Fully Achieved-Target
Exceeded): The FARABI system was rolled out to ministries and budget organizations that
together covered 40 percent of the total budget expenditure, versus a target of 30 percent
coverage. This represents a target achievement of 133 percent. Total budget expenditure
was 10,928.50 million manat, out of which institutions connected to FARABI had a total
budget expenditure of 4,352 million manat. FARABI was implemented as a pilot, adopting
an incremental and modular approach in budget organizations that included, for example
educational institutions, where unique modules were developed in the area of student


17
  Ernst & Young is a “big four” global audit firm that trains accounting professionals in international best
practices.

18
  CIPFA is the world’s only professional accountancy body specializing in bringing public finance in line
with international best practices.



                                                    13
management. FARABI was implemented in 99 institutions compared to the target of 59,
achieving a success rate of 168 percent. The system has gained ownership at both political
and technical levels of government in addition to support from the country’s President.
According to the beneficiary survey, the system’s user satisfaction stands at 85 percent,
while user friendliness is 92 percent. GOA now plans to roll out FARABI to an additional
900 major budget organizations and ministries. Institutions using FARABI have improved
their internal control systems and produced timely financial statements that are compliant
with IPSAS. According to the Open Budget Survey 2015, Azerbaijan now publicly makes
available its in-year reports, year-end reports and audit reports, versus 2008, when it did
not publicize this information.

Percentage of state budget audited by CoA using new methodology (Partially
Achieved): The CoA did not audit any budget expenditure using the new methodology,
since the financial and performance audits depend on the CoA revised draft law being
passed by Parliament. This explains the zero achievement compared to the target of 10
percent. However, CoA developed capacity to conduct financial and performance audits
based on international standards and performed two pilot audits for each type of audit.
Financial audits pilots related to the following entities: (i) Central Railway Hospital under
Medical Service of Azerbaijan Railways; and (ii) Local Branch of the Remuneration
Agency (Samur-Absheron Channel Operational Unit). CoA conducted two pilot
performance audits related to the following entities: (i) Azerbaijan State Oil Academy’s
Activities in Education Sphere; and (ii) Provision of Occupational Safety by the State
Labor Inspectorate Service under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population.
It is highly likely that the revised accounting law will be passed, particularly since it
complements the 2004 Accounting Law requiring entities to conduct financial audits to
complete financial statements using international standards. Performance audits are also
critical to GOA’s Vision 2020 goal to improve management of state resources.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Significantly Achieved): The indicator to issue 41
NASBOs based on IPSAS and explanatory notes was nearly achieved. A total of 38
NASBOs were issued following the translation of IPSAS versions for 2006, 2011 and 2015,
into Azerbaijani. The 2011 translation of IPSAS in Azerbaijani is on the IFAC website.
The target was 41 NASBOs was based on the forecast of the number of standards in place
by project close. To date, IFAC’s IPSAS Board has issued 39 standards (38 standards based
on an accrual accounting system and one standard for cash basis of accounting). This means
that a maximum of 39 standards could have been translated into NASBOs at project closure,
and implies that the translation of IPSAS into NASBOs reached a 97 percent achievement.
The remaining standard of cash basis of accounting also is highly likely to be translated.
The translated standards will enable public sector institutions to comply with financial
reporting international standards, thus strengthening accountability and transparency.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved): The indicator to achieve 100 percent
completion of items in the Strategic Development Plan (SDP) of the Chamber of Accounts
has been met. The 2012-2014 SDP accomplished four themes under the project, including:
improving financial audits; introduction of performance audit capabilities; enhancement of
legal and standards framework; and upgrading the human resource and training systems.
The outputs achieved under each of these themes are documented under Annex 2.


                                            14
PDO Indicator Three (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): The achievement of Indicator
Three, that accounting and auditing profession strengthened through the establishment of
training and certification programs and education standards in line with international
standards, is particularly significant since no such training existed before the project. As
Azerbaijan moves towards adoption of international standards in accounting and auditing,
it is critical to ensure high quality and relevant education in professional accounting. FSTC
trained a total of 4,843 students by project closure, compared to the target of 3,500,
exceeding the target by 138 percent. Out of 4,843 students, 967 trained in NASBOs, which
mirror IPSAS and therefore benefits public sector accountants; the remaining 117 students
trained in the NAQ course that mirrors ACCA; 3,759 students trained in a Bookkeepers
course. The NASBOs and IPSAS courses’ curricula benefit both the public and corporate
sector by enhancing accountability and transparency.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved): The indicator to achieve four
accredited training programs has been met. Out of the four programs, three relate to public
sector courses that will strengthen accountability and transparency of financial reporting in
line with international standards: NASBO Certification for Public Accountants modeled
from aspects of CIPFA; Bookkeepers course modeled from International Association of
Bookkeepers; and CIPFA’s Certificate in International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (Cert. IPSAS).

 Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): The indicator to
have 35 accredited trainers reached 103 percent, with 36 trainers accredited. Two
accreditation programs gave trainers the skills to teach students to comply with financial
reporting standards in both the corporate and public sectors. Ernst & Young Academy of
Business for Marking and Exam Questions Composition held the first accredited training
on May 15-17, 2015 for 20 accounting professionals. The CIPFA Training of Trainers
Course on Cert IPSAS for 36 accounting professionals held on June 8-12, 2015, benefited
trainers for only the public sector courses.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): The indicator was
to produce seven new accounting and audit, tax related textbooks introduced at higher
education institutes was 186 percent, with 13 new textbooks produced. Three textbooks19
pertain to the Cert CIPFA Course benefiting the public sector, and 1020 ACCA-related
textbooks will mainly benefit the corporate sector. The textbooks will strengthen students’




19
  The three textbooks included IPSAS Solutions, Workbooks and Progress Tests (Workbooks and Marking
Schemes).

20
  The 10 textbooks are: Fundamentals of Economics, Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting,
Management Information Systems, Business Law and Taxation, Financial Reporting for Corporate Sector,
Financial Management, Audit and Assurance, Management, Risk and Ethics and Corporate Reporting.
Additional study materials, such as notes and question banks (revision kits), were also translated and
published to complement the textbooks.



                                                 15
skills in accountability and transparency on financial reporting in line with international
standards.

Objective Two: Strengthen accountability and transparency in financial reporting for
the corporate sector in line with international best practices
Rating: High

The achievements were met under the following PDO indicators One and Three:

PDO Indicator One (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): The establishment of an
Association of Professional Accountants of Azerbaijan (APAA – which is now known as
ARPA) that follows international standards improved transparency, self-governance and
education in the accounting and audit profession.

ARPA’s establishment will also strengthen accountability and transparency in financial
reporting of the corporate sector. An additional intermediate outcome indicator related to
the translation of IFRS and explanatory notes into Azerbaijani specifically relates to the
corporate sector. This indicator has been fully achieved and the target exceeded, with 41
IFRS in line with the 2015 version of the standards translated into Azerbaijani, compared
to the target of 40 IFRS. IFRS represent the international accounting standards for the
corporate sector, particularly for PIEs. The translated IFRS are freely available on MOF’s
website, and have enabled 27 PIEs approved by the Azerbaijan’s Cabinet Minister to apply
the standards and submit their accounts to the MOF to comply with the 2004 Accountancy
Law. The IFRS for Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) was also translated into
Azerbaijani. These are important achievements that will strengthen financial reporting to
comply with international accounting standards thus strengthening accountability and
transparency in the corporate sector. At appraisal, the target was to provide financial
support to three SOEs and advise another six SOEs to comply with IFRS. Although a
number of activities to support these SOEs under Component One (except for translating
IFRS) were dropped from the project, since GOA opted to use its resources to support the
SOEs, more institutions are applying IFRS than initially anticipated. The GOA’s focus on
implementing activities under the project that benefit all corporations aiming to comply
with IFRS, as opposed to a selected few, helped produce this outcome.

PDO Indicator Three (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): The accounting and auditing
profession strengthened through the establishment of training and certification programs
and education standards in line with international standards.

As noted, this outcome indicator benefits both the corporate and public sector and was fully
achieved, with the target exceeded. FSTC trained a total of 4,843 students by project
closure compared to the target of 3,500, representing an achievement of 138 percent of
target. The number of students trained in corporate sector courses teaching accountability
and transparency in financial reporting in line with international standards included 117
students trained in NAQ, and 3,759 in Bookkeepers. As noted, both courses contain
curricula benefiting both public and corporate sector.




                                            16
Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved): As noted, FSTC introduced four
accredited training programs, meeting the target. Out of the four programs, two relate to
corporate sector courses that will strengthen accountability and transparency of financial
reporting in line with international standards. They include: NAQ, which is the professional
accountancy program modeled on the ACCA course and meets IFAC’s International
Education Standards (IES); and Bookkeepers course, which is modeled on International
Association of Bookkeepers.

 Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): As noted, the
number of accredited trainers totaled 36 compared to a target of 35, representing 103
percent of target. The Ernst & Young Academy of Business for Marking and Exam
Questions Composition, held on May 15-17, 2015, qualified trainers to teach students to
comply with corporate sector financial reporting standards.

Intermediate Outcome Indicator (Fully Achieved-Target Exceeded): As noted, a total
of 13 new accounting, audit, and tax related textbooks were introduced at higher education
institutes out of a target of 7, achieving 186 percent of target. Ten of the textbooks relate
to ACCA and will train students to comply with IFRS, thereby strengthening their skills in
accountability and transparency on financial reporting in line with international standards
for the corporate sector.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

Although a financial and economic analysis was conducted at appraisal, most of the
analysis is not relevant at project completion since it made calculations based on activities
that were cancelled in the restructurings, such as the automation of PIE accounting systems.
Details of this analysis are included under Annex 3. The cost-benefit analysis of CAPSAP
is difficult to quantify, as acknowledged at appraisal. Despite these challenges, there is an
efficiency analysis of the project with respect to training accountants, FARABI,
strengthening the CoA and establishing ARPA, below.

Training of accountants: The project instilled FSTC with the capacity to professionally
train accountants within the country. Previously, students had to travel abroad for training.
Annex 3 illustrates the significant potential cost savings achieved by training students
locally – estimated at US$15.9 million for 4,843 students due to FSTC’s low fees per
course and avoidance of travel and accommodation costs. These savings will accrue as
student numbers grow, with an expected saving per student of US$3,280. By creating a
domestic training program, the FSTC also avoided uneven education standards. Students
also benefited from training in their native language. In addition, the project modernized
FSTC and its eleven regional centers at MOF offices by providing all necessary furniture
and equipment, including modern teaching tools such as smart boards; developing a web-
portal to provide information on courses and an education tool for distance learners; and
developing video lessons to support distance learning. The resulting program attracted
students all over the country who will improve on compliance of IPSAS and IFRS in the
public and private sectors, respectively.



                                             17
FARABI: The project’s restructuring resulted in the rollout of FARABI to ministries and
budget organizations, and strengthened their internal control systems and financial
reporting to comply with IPSAS. FARABI is a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning
System that supports core Financial Management Information System (FMIS) and
administrative functions. The system integrates all facets of financial and administrative
operations, including the recording of daily accounting transactions, payroll, maintenance
of records on fixed assets and inventory, employee lifecycle and automatic generation of
financial reports required by MOF. The ministry plans to synchronize FARABI with the
Treasury Information Management System (TIMS) so that all financial transactions can be
made online, thereby enhancing efficiency. FARABI acquired 4,000 perpetual licenses21
at an average cost of US$ 395 per license, which is within the normal range for similar
applications funded by the Bank. The perpetual licenses will free MOF from paying annual
license fees associated with a number of off-the-shelf FMIS. According to a study22 done
on FMIS for governments based on the compilation of experiences in World Bank-financed
projects, license fees can be a significant recurrent cost, forming 20 percent to 22 percent
of the initial license fees per annum for an off-the-shelf FMIS.

FARABI is now in Azerbaijani, with local capacity to support its maintenance. These are
key success factors that most off-the-shelf accounting systems lack. The beneficiary survey
indicates that 92 percent of the users find FARABI user-friendly. The cost of the software,
hardware and installation of FARABI for 99 institutions was US $11 million. As part of
Azerbaijan’s Public Financial Management reforms, there are plans to continue rolling out
FARABI using government’s own resources to about 1,000 ministries and budget
organizations, starting with a target of 303 institutions by the end of December 2017. The
additional cost for this rollout is US$20,000 to US$30,000 per budget organization. These
costs are modest compared to other IFMIS given the FARABI’s functionality and unique
advantages.

The project has also resulted in improvements to Azerbaijan’s PEFA indicators. The PEFA
indicator on quality and timeliness of annual financial statements was rated C+ in both
2008 and 2014 but the quality and coverage of information included in the annual financial
report improved from a C to B.

Strengthening the CoA: The CoA has developed the capacity to conduct financial and
performance audits in line with ISSAIs. Audits should commence when the CoA law is
passed by Parliament, strengthening accountability in Azerbaijan. At the moment,
compliance audits for ministries and budget institutions are conducted annually on a
sample basis, whereas financial audits will require annual audits to be conducted for all



21
  Perpetual licenses are paid upon purchase of the software and there are no annual fees
during the useful life of the software.

institutions. The PEFA indicator on the scope, nature and follow-up of external audit was
rated a D in 2008 and D+ in 2014,23 mainly due to improvements in audit follow-up and in
performance through implementation of pilot audits using ISSAI. Stronger audits will
improve transparency and accountability in the country.

Establishment of ARPA: MOF’s establishment of ARPA produced cost savings and
efficiency gains, since local experts would stand in for a team of international experts to
interpret accounting and auditing international standards. Local experts speaking
Azerbaijani can communicate directly and effectively with the majority of the public and
corporate sectors stakeholders, impacting compliance with the international accounting and
auditing standards. ARPA will also oversee accountants to ensure that they comply with
accounting and auditing standards as well as a code of ethics, and also investigate and
discipline any accountant where necessary, leading to greater professionalism in local
accountancy.

An explanation of the variances of the project costs determined at appraisal and eventually
incurred, for each component is shown under Annex 1.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of ‘Satisfactory’ is based on the individual ratings for relevance,
efficacy and efficiency, as showed in Table 2, below. All ratings were either ‘Substantial’
or higher, with a ‘High’ rating for relevance of objectives and the achievement of one of
two objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

No poverty impact, gender or social development study was conducted in relation to this
project as it focused on institutions as beneficiaries. However, under Component Three,

     See http://www.maliyye.gov.az/sites/default/files/PEFA_ENG%20FINAL.protected.pdf



                                                  19
the gender impact was monitored. As a result, FSTC trained 1,54724 women in accounting
out of a total of 4,843 students. This represents 32 percent of the total number of students
as of June 30, 2015.

(b) Institutional change/strengthening

The project focused on strengthening existing public institutions to improve corporate and
public sector accountability and transparency. The CoA 2012-2014 SDP was implemented,
and it included building capacity to conduct financial and performance audits and
legislation to strengthen the country’s audit function to comply with ISSAIs, including
conducting financial and performance audits. FSTC’s training capacity and facilities were
enhanced to train students in four courses using accredited lecturers and textbooks
translated in Azerbaijani. MOF capacity to continue rolling out FARABI, monitoring
compliance with NASBOs, and translating IPSAS and IFRS was enhanced. ARPA was
established to oversee accountants, and its capacity strengthened with a group of local
experts hired to interpret standards and set and mark professional accountancy
examinations. ARPA is following an action plan to become a member of IFAC in 2017.

(c) Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)

According to the GOA ICR, the project has contributed to the achievement of the objectives
of the National Strategy for Increasing Transparency and Combating Corruption (2007-
2011) by enhancing accountability and transparency. The Republic of Azerbaijan joined
the Open Government Partnership in 2012 and the project is also contributing to the quality
of the information it displays as part of the program.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Beneficiary survey

A beneficiary survey was conducted to obtain the following information: (i) the benefits of
the FARABI system to relevant budget institutions; (ii) the quality of accountancy training
at the FSTC; and (iii) the ability of FSTC-trained students to produce financial statements
in their organizations that comply with IFRS and IPSAS. Details of the survey results are
included in Annex 5.

The survey regarding FARABI covered 26 randomly selected institutions out of 99 using
the system. Users totaled 133, out of which 69.2 percent were female and 30.8 percent were
male. Eight-five percent of users were satisfied with FARABI. Sixty-nine percent said
FARABI positively influenced their work, while 3.9 percent said FARABI made their work
more difficult. Ninety-two percent found FARABI user friendly. At the time of the survey,



24
  The 1,547 women accounting students comprise 482 (50%) women out of a total of 967 financial
accounting, taxation and NASBO students; 1,023 (27%) women of a total of 3,759 Bookkeeping students;
and 42 (36%) women out of a total of 117 professional accountancy students.



                                                20
73 percent of users were not using FARABI’s financial reporting system as this required
additional training that MOF and SINAM were going to provide. Seventy-two percent
stated that FARABI had reduced the time spent on processing supplier payments, payroll
and bank reconciliations. Users noted FARABI’s additional benefits, including enhanced
data storage and security, reduction of technical errors, increased quality of bookkeeping,
and increased internal control. The SINAM-managed Maintenance Support Center was
able to increase usage of FARABI’s various modules via training and timely support. The
MOF found the beneficiary survey useful in identifying key issues with FARABI’s
implementation. The MOF plans to address issues in the report such as increasing the usage
of financial reports in order to increase FARABI usage. MOF also intends to continue
carrying out beneficiary surveys to address challenges faced by the users.

The survey asked 27 students of FSTC whether they are producing financial statements
that comply with IPSAS and IFRS. Fifty-two percent of the students responded that they
are applying the standards in their organizations, but none could provide financial
statements for review mainly due to challenges of obtaining their management’s approval
within the beneficiary survey timeline.

Responses from nearly 4,000 students addressed the quality of accountancy training at
FSTC. Seventy-eight percent rated the courses as excellent, 19 percent rated the course as
good, and three percent rated the course as average. Most (81.5 percent) rated trainers as
excellent, 16.3 percent rated them as good, and 2.2 percent rated trainers as average.

Stakeholders workshop

Results from the stakeholders’ workshop resembled the findings documented under the
beneficiary survey. The only new issue that arose was that of international recognition of
the NAQ course, and it was clarified that the NAQ course that mirrors the ACCA course
currently meets the internationally recognized IES of IFAC and will continue to do so.
Details of the stakeholders’ workshop can be found under Annex 6.
 
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk of MOF not rolling out FARABI to about 1,000 ministries and budget
organizations is low, since funding from government is secured and the President of
Azerbaijan supports the project. In order to ensure that MOF improves on the usage of
FARABI – an issue identified when the beneficiary survey was conducted – the MOF will
create and maintain a user-friendly web portal for continuous learning and education. The
MOF will absorb the maintenance and support center managed by SINAM, which has
acquired technical staff with accounting knowledge who will provide timely support to
system users. MOF will also continue conducting the beneficiary surveys and addressing
issues arising.

There is low risk that the accountancy training will be discontinued. MOF has committed
to funding the administrative costs of FSTC, and revenues from the professional
accountancy course (NAQ) will continue to grow as student numbers increase. The only


                                            21
risk as expressed during the stakeholders’ workshop is that students prefer the course to be
internationally accredited. Students should be reassured that the course meets IFAC’s IES.
Since the current NAQ course is based on the ACCA qualification that already meets
IFAC’s IES, it is likely to receive IFAC’s endorsement.

There is a moderate risk that ARPA will not become a member of IFAC, since membership
is contingent on ARPA receiving endorsement from an existing IFAC member in
Azerbaijan, which is the CoAA. If this recommendation is not provided, IFAC may still
grant ARPA membership if ARPA gives sufficient reason for not receiving CoAA’s
recommendation. However, since ARPA has established good relations with CoAA, it is
likely to receive the endorsement initially to become an IFAC associate member, and later,
a full member. Since ARPA is a non-governmental organization, it depends on members
and exam fees for the professional accountancy course for revenues. These revenues should
be match administrative costs. It is important to note that MOF supports ARPA.

There is a moderate risk that the CoA will not perform financial and performance audits.
CoA audits depend on passing of the revised law of the CoA, which is expected in 2016.
MOF did not support the law until it understood that the law will strengthen auditing to
comply with ISSAI, particularly financial and performance auditing, and will complement
the 2004 Accounting Law that requires financial statements to be produced with financial
audits. Performance audits are also essential to Vision 2020’s aim of improving the
management of state resources. The MOF has reviewed the law and supports it. The law is
now at the Office of the President for review and its first reading in Parliament expected in
early 2016.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank provided an experienced team to facilitate Azerbaijan’s implementation of
international accounting and auditing standards to comply with the 2004 Accounting Law.
The team facilitated the preparation of the project with a PHRD Grant, and appraised the
operation to achieve the planned development outcomes by appropriately determining the
risks and mitigation measures, implementing entity, and beneficiaries, as well as taking
into consideration the Bank’s fiduciary measures. Regarding project design, the team could
have provided more resources to Component Two (Public Sector Accountability) to
computerize FMIS in the public sector, rather than to Component One (Corporate Sector
Accountability), which aimed to facilitate the implementation of IFRS in three SOEs. This
is because SOEs that are PIEs tend to use their own resources to computerize FMIS. This
issue was addressed during the first restructuring and FARABI was included as part of the
project. Plans for FMIS computerization in three SOEs were dropped when government
opted to fund the SOEs using its own resources. This is not a major issue, but worth noting
as a lesson going forward. Significant achievement in relation to the PDO was seen both
on the installation of FARABI in 99 public sector institutions (ministries and budget


                                             22
organizations) and 27 PIEs applying IFRS despite dropping the subcomponent of assisting
the PIEs in embedding IFRS. The GOA supported corporate sector compliance with IFRS
with activities that would benefit all the PIEs and included translating IFRS into
Azerbaijani and training corporate sector accountants in professional accountancy course
at the FSTC under Component Three.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank supervision took place on a regular basis, providing appropriate and targeted advice
and observations. The aide memoires provide evidence of regular and professional advice
given by the Bank’s experts throughout the project. The Bank responded adequately to the
two restructuring requests made by the government, which contributed to the project’s
development outcome. Fiduciary policies were well managed and reported.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance was adequate to the tasks and facilitated the success of the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government of Azerbaijan supported the project throughout its preparation, appraisal
and implementation. At project closure, GOA remained committed to the project’s
objectives and activities. The stakeholders’ workshop and beneficiary survey provided
positive feedback in relation to this project. GOA’s coordination with the Bank and SECO
was adequate. However, there was a delay in GOA setting up the PMU as the Project
Director was not appointed until December 2009, about one year after project effectiveness.
This delayed the implementation of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

All key staff of the PMU were appointed by MOF, although there were delays in setting
up the PMU as noted above. The PMU timely resolved implementation issues related to
the project, especially after the first restructuring when the GOA harmonized its strategy
with the project. Fiduciary aspects struggled at the beginning as implementation
arrangements were still in flux, but became satisfactory over time. M&E arrangements
were established with all beneficiary institutions. PMU implemented a coordination
mechanism. Stakeholders relied on reports for decision making. The PMU coordinated well
with the Bank, SECO and all its beneficiary institutions. At project closure, the PMU closed,
and key staff have been integrated into the MOF to sustain PDO achievements. All
beneficiary institutions will continue to implement activities in line with the project’s
objectives after project closure.



                                            23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As noted, except for the delay in setting up the PMU, the borrower’s performance was
adequate to the tasks, significantly contributing to project’s success.

6. Lessons Learned
Lessons learned from the project include:

Flexibility in the project design is essential to a project’s success: Project design should
allow adjustments to respond to a government’s evolving priorities within the PDO, since
these may change significantly during implementation. Project design should
accommodate new activities without changing the PDO, and therefore allow a Level Two
restructuring that requires management approval, as opposed to a lengthy Level One
restructuring process that requires Board approval.

Commitment from beneficiaries is crucial: Introduction of new systems, processes and
practices requires full commitment and sustainability of ownership by the beneficiary
agencies. FARABI has been established in 99 institutions; however, full commitment from
all beneficiaries (ministries and budget organizations) is essential to ensure data
maintenance and system functioning. Feedback from beneficiaries through MOF’s planned
periodic surveys will help to identify and resolve issues to ensure system functionality.

Openness to dialogue and proactivity towards sustainability: Open dialogue between
the Bank and the GOA was crucial to successful implementation and sustenance of the
project. The Bank provided continuous guidance and actively engaged with government
counterparts to collaboratively seek solutions to challenges as they arose, which
contributed to the success of the project. For example, the Bank’s insisted on FSTC
producing a sustainable business plan for the accountancy training program to increase its
cost recovery ratio. This made them have commercial courses for the corporate sector. The
FSTC is now generating and growing revenues to sustain the program.

Strong government commitment: The Ministry of Finance considered it a flagship
project of the Minister of Finance and monitored its progress accordingly. The GOA
broadly demonstrated a strong commitment to the project, contributing to its success.

Use of country systems: Country institutions including the MOF, CoA and FSTC
benefited directly from the project. Their capacity and systems were strengthened and they
have been able to continue implement project-related activities using government resources
since project closure.  
 
Restructuring the project: Project restructuring was critical in resolving problems at the
project’s start. It harmonized the government’s evolving demands with the project’s
objectives and allowed for the project’s expansion and success. The project has
demonstrated sustainability, exemplified government plans to scale up project activities,
specifically the rollout of FARABI to about 1,000 budget organizations, to continue FSTC


                                            24
training programs, and to improve on CoA’s coverage and quality of audits with the
introduction of financial and performance audits when Parliament passes the CoA law.

Benefits of having a project strengthening both corporate and public sector
accountability and transparency: The project incorporated an accountancy training
component that has trained both public and corporate sector accountants to comply with
international accounting standards. The project also facilitated the establishment of
professional accountancy organization, ARPA, which will oversee accountants by
providing quality assurance, setting ethical standards and disciplining and investigating
accountants where the need arises. This will professionalize accountants in both the public
and corporate sectors. The Bank should aim to produce similar benefits in future projects
to strengthen public financial management and corporate financial reporting.

Phased implementation of FMIS can be successful: FARABI started as a pilot with
rollout to 39 budget organizations and ministries. This was eventually scaled up to 99
institutions at project closure, and therefore covered 40 percent of state budget expenditure.
The beneficiary survey indicated that 85 percent of users rated FARABI satisfactorily, and
92 percent, as user friendly. The President also recognized the system’s effectiveness. As
a result, the GOA plans to rollout FARABI to an additional 900 budget organizations and
ministries using its own resources after project closure. The key lesson is that FARABI
was implemented as a fit-for-purpose solution in the Azerbaijan context in an incremental
and modular approach. The result is ownership of the system at the political and technical
levels of the executive government.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

In its ICR report, GOA stated that the PDO was fully achieved. However, this statement
seems to refer to aspects of the project that MOF was implementing, since the CoA cannot
conduct financial and performance audits until Parliament passes the CoA law. In its
evaluation of the Bank’s performance, GOA noted that the Bank provided full support for
the project’s implementation and was receptive to their ideas and priorities. Regarding
continuation of project components, GOA plans to continue rolling out FARABI and the
accountancy training program. However, as noted above, CoA and ARPA also have plans
to continue implementing activities related to the project. GOA submitted comments in
agreement with the ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers

SECO rated the project as satisfactory. Annex 8 contains details of SECO’s comments. No
comments were received from the Japan PHRD Grant.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders

No comments were received.

The major reason for the variances in component costs are:

Component one (Corporate Sector Accountability): After the first restructuring,
activities related to the CoAA on improving the statutory framework and building capacity


25 Grants exempted from VAT.



                                                    26
to regulate and oversee the audit function under sub-component 1.3 were cancelled. In
addition, under the second restructuring, sub-component 1.1 on assisting the PIEs in
embedding IFRS was also cancelled. These led to a significant drop in the expenditure
under component one although the establishment of ARPA was added under the
component.

Component two (Public Sector Accountability): After the first restructuring, a new sub-
component 2.3 was added on unified automated accounting system for line ministries and
budgetary organizations (FARABI). Under the second restructuring, the establishment of
a maintenance and support center for FARABI was added to sub-component 2.3. This
significantly increased the cost of the component.

Component 3 (Strengthening Accounting, Auditing and Financial Management
Capacity): This reduced because under the second restructuring, financial assistance in the
form of part-payment or subsidies of the costs of professional qualifications in accounting
and auditing for private sector accountants was cancelled. In addition, the establishment of
an international advisory panel of experts in accounting and auditing was cancelled in favor
of APAA conducting this activity using local experts.

Component four (Project Management): This increased due to the extension of the
closing dates from originally 12/31/2012 to 06/30/2015.

                                       It is important to note that though the second
                                       restructuring referred to the establishment of APAA
                                       which would have been the case if a new association
                                       was set up, the MOF decided not to start from scratch
                                       and therefore select and strengthen an established
                                       institution which started as the Azerbaijan Risk
                                       Professional Association and ended up as ARPA

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
At appraisal, a financial and economic analysis was conducted. Some of the analysis with
respect to strengthening corporate financial reporting for PIEs was no longer part of this
project following the restructuring. This meant that at project closure, it would not be
possible to compare the NPV’s that took into consideration costs and benefits associated
with the investment on PIEs. These NPVs included: (i) USD 27.34 million related to
perceived direct financial savings by participating PIEs; (ii) USD 67.3 million related to
stakeholder impact assessment; and (iii) USD 43 million related to CAPSAP. In addition,
due to the same reason, it is not possible to confirm the benefit-cost ratio of 3.0 times
determined at appraisal. However, the government did support the PIEs using its own
resources to comply with IFRS and this could have contributed to increased tax revenues,
mainly due to additional disclosures associated with financial reporting in compliance with
IFRS. These disclosures lower tax evasion and avoidance which increases tax compliance.

It was also determined at appraisal that the real GDP growth rate of CAPSAP was positive
but the assumptions used were based on experiences in other countries and not related to
Azerbaijan so it has not been taken into consideration. Other benefits determined at
appraisal but which were concluded as insignificant included the improvement of the credit
ratings of the PIEs which would reduce their borrowing costs due to compliance with IFRS
and VAT arising from the project. We agree with this observation.

The cost-benefit analysis of CAPSAP as acknowledged at appraisal is difficult to quantify.
However, below is an efficiency analysis of the project with respect to training accountants,
FARABI, strengthening the CoA and establishing ARPA.

Training of accountants: The project did build the capacity of FSTC to provide
professional accountancy training in the country as previously, students had to travel
abroad to get this training. The cost saving arising from training identified at appraisal, is
one of the major achievements of the project. At appraisal it was determined that the cost
of training Level 1 ACCA course in the ECA region was US$2,000. Given that most of
this training was being done at training centers in Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine, it
involved travel costs of US$400 to US$800 per person per trip and accommodation costs
of US$800 to US$2000 per person per trip. While these costs seem modest at this point in
time given that student fees, text books and tuition have been annually increasing, FSTC
is offering the cost of training that includes text books, revision kits and pass cards at
US$380 per subject. The equivalent amount to a Level 1 ACCA course with 4 subjects
would be US$1,520 compared to US$2,000. Additional costs savings are on travel and
accommodation, as an Azerbaijan student can now learn the professional accountancy
course from FSTC or any of its 11 regional centers. The total cost of training each student
abroad based on the above is put at US$4,800 compared to US$1,520 at FSTC, thus a
saving of US$3,280 per student. With 4843 students undergoing training this represents
potential cost savings of US$15.9 million, which is expected to grow as students trained
increase. In addition, having FSTC avoided training abroad based on education standards
that were likely to be uneven and not complying with international education standards.
The other issues is that the training is conducted in Azerbaijani and the reading materials


                                             40
have also been translated to the local language, therefore significantly contributing to the
attraction of many students who when they graduate, will improve on compliance with
IPSAS and IFRS in the public and private sectors respectively.

FARABI: A benefit that arose after the restructuring of the project was on the rollout of
FARABI to ministries and budget organizations, as it strengthened internal control systems
and financial reporting to comply with IPSAS. FARABI is a cloud based Enterprise
Resource Planning System that supports core Financial Management Information System
(FMIS) and administrative functions. The system integrates all facets of financial and
administrative operations that include the recording of daily accounting transactions,
payroll, maintenance of records on fixed assets and inventory, employee life-cycle and
automatic generation of financial reports required by MOF. FARABI is planned to be
synchronized with the TIMS so that all financial transactions can be made online and
therefore enhance efficiency. FARABI acquired 4,000 perpetual licenses at an average cost
of USD 395 per license which is within the normal range for similar applications funded
by the Bank. The perpetual licenses mean that GOA will not be paying annual license fees
associated with a number of off-the-shelf FMIS. According to a study29 done on FMIS for
Governments based on the compilation of experiences in World Bank-financed projects,
license fees can be a significant recurrent cost, forming 20 percent to 22 percent of the
initial license fees per annum for an off-the-shelf FMIS. This is a cost MOF will avoid.

The other benefit of FARABI is that it is in Azerbaijani, with local capacity to support its
maintenance. These are key success ingredients that most off-the-shelf accounting systems
would not have, and as seen in the beneficiary survey, 92 percent of the users find FARABI
user friendly. The cost of the software, hardware and installation of FARABI for 99
institutions was US$11 million. As part of Azerbaijan Public Financial Management
reforms, there are plans to continue rolling out FARABI using government’s own resources
to about 1,000 ministries and budget organizations, starting with a target of 303 institutions
by the end of December 2017. The additional cost for this rollout is between US$20,000
and US$30,000 per budget organization. These costs are very modest compared to other
IFMIS given the functionality FARABI has and its unique advantages as noted above.

There are benefits that have been seen with respect to improvements in the country’s PEFA
indicators. The PEFA indicator on quality and timeliness of annual financial statements
was rated C+ in both 2008 and 2014 but the quality and coverage of information included
in the annual financial report improved from a C to B while the timeliness of submission
of the government consolidated annual accounts to the CoA within 6 months was
maintained with an A rating and the presentation of annual financial statements that comply
with national or international standards maintained a C rating which is expected to improve
when FARABI is rolled out to more budget organizations given that at the time of
conducting the PEFA report, FARABI was being rolled out under the first phase to only


29 The study is derived from Ali Hashim’s “A Handbook on Financial Management Information Systems
for Government, A Practitioners Guide for Setting Reform Priorities, System Design and Implementation”
(based on a compilation of experiences in World Bank-financed projects).



                                                 41
39 budget organizations. The indicator on timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation was also maintained with an A rating between 2008 and 2014 while the
indicator on availability of information of in-year budget reports improved from D in 2008
to A in 2014. The indicator on quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports was
maintained as C+ in both 2008 and 2014 but its sub indicators on data accuracy in the
monthly and quarterly budget execution reports improved from B to A while timeliness of
reporting was maintained with an A rating and the sub indicator on information on
expenditure commitments remained limited thus maintaining a C rating which is expected
to improve when FARABI is rolled out to more budget organizations. Going forward,
FARABI will effectively control expenditure and generate quality budgets and financial
statements based on international best practices which will improve decision making.

Strengthening the CoA: The CoA has developed its human capacity to conduct financial
and performance audits in line with ISSAIs, which should commence when the CoA law
is passed by Parliament. This will strengthen accountability in Azerbaijani given that at the
moment, compliance audits for ministries and budget institutions are conducted annually
on a sample basis while financial audits will require annual audits to be conducted for
100% of these institutions. The PEFA indicator on the scope, nature and follow-up of
external audit was rated a D in 2008 and D+ in 2014 mainly due to having less than 50%
audit coverage of central government expenditure and conducting compliance audits.
Improvements were noted with respect to the adoption of ISSAIs and conducting pilot
financial audits which slightly improved the rating. Going forward with the passing of the
CoA law by Parliament, this indicator will significantly improve as more financial and
performance audits will be done by the CoA in line with ISSAIs and the coverage as noted
above will increase with annual financial audits being done for budget organizations and
ministries. The strengthening of audits will improve on transparency and accountability in
the country.

Establishment of ARPA: The MOF established ARPA, and one of its cost savings was to
substitute a team of international experts with local experts that would be involved in the
interpretation of accounting and auditing international standards. The local experts also do
have the additional benefit of speaking Azerbaijani and therefore can easily communicate
to the majority of the public and corporate sectors stakeholders, thus making a bigger
impact with respect to compliance with the international accounting and auditing standards.
The major benefit of ARPA is that it will oversee accountants to ensure that they comply
with accounting and auditing standards as well as a code of ethics and also investigate and
discipline any accountant where necessary. This will lead to more professionalism of
accountants in Azerbaijan.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Result
A beneficiary survey was conducted to confirm the following:

      To confirm and determine the benefits of the roll out of the FARABI system to the
       budget institutions.
      To assess the quality of accountancy training at the FSTC.
      To determine whether the students trained at the FSTC are producing financial
       statements in their organizations that comply with IFRS and IPSAS.

FARABI

The first survey was conducted among twenty six (26) institutions selected randomly out
of the 99 institutions FARABI was rolled out to. These institutions had on average used
FARABI for twenty (20) months with the shortest usage period of six (6) months and
longest of forty-three (43) months. User group for this sample constituted 133 staff, 69.2%
of which were female and 30.8% male. A dominant majority of users (91.8%) had
undergraduate and above education level attainment. 73.7% of users were accountants or
accounting assistants and 26.3% were senior approvers/accountants or accounting officers.

The results were the following:

      84.6% of users expressed satisfaction with FARABI in general with the rest
       remaining neural.
      69.2% of users noted a positive influence on their work (26.9% did not report any
       significant change and 3.9% reported that it worsened their work).
      92% reported satisfaction with user-friendliness of the system while 8% were
       somewhat satisfied. The users were satisfied with quality of support and business
       continuity management (recovery point and time, timeliness of responses to
       queries, desk-based hand-holding, accounts manuals and user guides).
      In response to how time spent has changed to process supplier payments, payroll
       and bank reconciliations, 71.8% of users on average reported reduction of time,
       3.8% reported increase, 6.4% did not report any change. 18% of users did not use
       all of these features simultaneously.
      73% of users did not use management reports or annual statutory reports.
      The other key benefits reported from FARABI were enhanced data storage and
       security, reduction of technical errors, time saving, increased quality of book-
       keeping and increased control.

Despite the satisfactory results above, effective usage of all FARABI’s modules remains a
challenge mainly due to allegiance to legacy systems and budget organizations using
FARABI having to comply with old reporting formats demanded by their parent ministries
for consolidation because they are not yet using FARABI. This issue can be effectively
addressed through training, timely support from the Maintenance Support Center managed
by SINAM and ensuring that ministries are prioritized in the rollout of FARABI such that
they use NASBO compliant financial statements for consolidation.


                                            45
The survey results were shared with the MOF and SINAM. They stated that they would
address the issues arising out of this survey. MOF found the survey useful and plans to
continue undertaking it for all the institutions on FARABI such that they can get useful
feedback to address challenges identified.

Compliance with IFRS and IPSAS

The second survey was conducted among a sample of 27 students at FSTC who had studied
financial accounting, tax accounting, NASBOs/IPSAS and IFRS. Each of this student was
from a different organization. The purpose of the survey was to determine whether they are
applying the standards they are learning in their organizations. The result was that 52% of
the students stated that they are applying the standards in their organizations.
Unfortunately, none of these students could provide the financial statements of their
organization for review mainly due to challenges of getting management’s approval.

Quality of FSTC Accountancy training

The third survey was conducted by FSTC among close to 4000 students. The results were:

      78% rated the course as excellent, while 19% rated the course as good and 3% rated
       the course as average.
      The students also rated highly the quality of their trainers. In response to questions
       on effectiveness of trainers, their coverage of full issues, their preparation level,
       ability to conduct effective discussions and create conditions for learning, on an
       average 81.5% rated trainers as excellent, 16.3% rated as good and 2.2% rated as
       average.




                                            46
Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
A stakeholder workshop was organized by the MOF on November 5, 2015. In attendance
were representatives from ministries and budget organizations that use FARABI; FSTC
management, lecturers and students; ARPA representatives; SINAM representatives, the
MOF and the Bank. The findings of the beneficiary survey were presented and there was
feedback from the participants. MOF eventually summed up the key issues arising and
closed the workshop. The issues arising were:

      There was general agreement on the findings of the survey.
      SINAM responded to some of the usage challenges associated with FARABI and
       it stated that it has put in place web portal for continued learning and education that
       was user friendly such that FARABI users would be able to learn more about the
       system. This however, would not take away their responsibility to respond to issues
       in a timely manner.
      There was a discussion on the issue identified in the beneficiary survey with respect
       to budget organizations not using FARABI for reporting purposes because the
       parent ministry would request for the report in a format based on the legacy system
       in order to consolidate its financial report. MOF pointed out that they will follow
       recommendations in the beneficiary report to ensure that FARABI is rolled out to
       groups of organizations under the same consolidation such that financial reporting
       consolidation can be done using FARABI.
      Head of ARPA laid out his vision for preparations for the accountant certification
       program and noted that international experience was being studied and that the
       local-language certification would be based on ACCA standards.
      Students were concerned about the international certification of the NAQ course
       and one issue that was pointed out is that the NAQ is currently complying with the
       IES of IFAC and will continue to do so. This was one way of getting international
       acceptability.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR
Project context and development objective

Corporate and Public Sector Accountability Project (CAPSAP) has been mutually
developed by the World Bank and the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The
project supports the overarching goal of governance by improving the accounting standards
in both the private and public sectors in order to comply with the 2004 Accounting Law.
The quality of higher education in accounting and auditing was also strengthened under the
project as it was constrained by ad hoc curriculum development and a general lack of
continuing education for accountancy professionals. The increased use of the Azeri
language posed further challenges, because of the absence of textbooks and other teaching
materials.

Project Development Objective

The overall Project Development Objective (PDO) for CAPSAP is to strengthen
accountability and transparency in financial reporting for the public and corporate sectors
in line with international best practices.

Main Beneficiaries and Target Groups

The key beneficiaries are the Public Interest Entities including State-Owned Enterprises,
the Chamber of Accounts (Supreme Audit Institution), the Ministry of Finance, the
Chamber of Auditors (the country’s auditing services regulator and standard-setter),
accounting and auditing professionals (includes ARPA and FSTC), other stakeholders
benefitting from FARABI such as ministries and budget organizations.

Project Restructuring

The project was restructured in 2011 and 2013 after its launch in 2009. The first
restructuring was based the evolving political agenda which needed reprioritization to
address specific technological and human capacity constraints, particularly within the
public sector. The second restructuring cancelled activities associated with project sub-
components that were inactive since project inception, and those that were no longer
relevant given the direction that government priorities had taken since the first
restructuring; and the inclusion of ongoing initiatives that were not explicitly
acknowledged in the original PAD. The results indicators were also revised during the
second restructuring. The original PDO was not changed but revisions were made to the
intermediate results and indicators.

Benefits from the project

Shift to modern accounting and financial management systems would enable management
to achieve transparency and accountability in financial reporting, improve decision-making,
realize cost saving from improved systems, and minimize business corruption. Azerbaijan


                                            48
will benefit from higher tax collection from improved and efficient enterprises as a result
of the introduction of IFRS and National Accounting Standards for Budgetary
Organizations (NASBO) that are in line with IPSAS and promote transparency and
accountability in financial reporting in both corporate and public sectors. In addition, the
perceived country risks is expected to reduce and therefore lower the costs associated with
sovereign borrowing.

Overall Progress in PDO Achievement

The project made significant progress towards achieving PDOs:

      Within the framework of the project IFRS (for SME), IPSAS, NASBO and
       NASCO standards were translated into Azerbaijani language and adopted.
       Accountability and analytical reporting capacity in budget institutions were
       enhanced through development of Financial and Reporting Application for Budget
       Institutions and its piloting in 99 institutions, including high education institutions
       and government agencies. Capacity of CoA was enhanced through improvement
       of internal procedures, introduction of performance audit and translation of ISSAI
       standards into Azerbaijani. The institutional capacity of CoA was further enhanced
       through development of Information Technology, financial audit, Human
       Resources all under the SDP for 2012-2014. Draft Law on Chamber of Accounts
       was prepared in line with the requirements of Lima and Mexico Declarations
       reflecting the main principals of SAIs and ISSAIs framework.
      To ensure continuing support to organizations in preparation financial reports in
       line with international standards, the project supported establishment of
       association of accounting professionals, which will take advisory role in their
       updating and adopting.
      Strengthening of accounting and audit profession was achieved through
       development of National Accounting Qualification for different groups of
       accounting professionals; provision of training materials for all qualifications
       under NAQ; expanding functions of the Financial Training Centre under the
       Ministry of Finance and transforming it into the Financial and Science Training
       Centre responsible for delivery of trainings on NAQ, certification of tutors and
       training centers on NAQ; delivery of trainings to accounting professionals;
       appropriate study materials were either developed or translated into Azerbaijani;
       and test question banks were developed for ten papers of NAQ.
      Financial and Science Training Centre was established under the Ministry of
       Finance to ensure continuing education of accounting professionals; FSTC was
       equipped with all necessary education materials, furniture and equipment,
       including modern education tools such as smart boards and laptops to facilitate
       education and examination processes. Internal policies for FSTC were developed,
       which includes policies for admitting students, approval and monitoring of
       accredited education providers, organization of examination process, CPD, quality
       assurance. Web-portal for FSTC was developed to provide information on the



                                             49
       courses and serve as an education tool for distant learners; video lessons are being
       developed to support distant learning.
      More than 4843 accountants were trained within 2012-2015, 2643 students have
       successfully passed the exams.
      Negotiations with ACCA were initiated to get ACCA accreditation for NAQ.

Original and revised components

This is similar to what has been included in the main body of the ICR.

Evaluation of the Government of Azerbaijan’s performance in implementing the
project

Government demonstrated full support to implementation of the project. The major
problem was initial delay in implementation. However, the Implementing Agency was
proactive in initiating discussion with the WB aimed at re-designing of the project to adapt
it to the changing needs and priorities of the Government. After revision of the project
design and restructuring of the project, the project progressed with a good pace. The
Government was highly supportive in all aspects of Project implementation. The
counterpart funds were timely provided, as well as approvals for disbursements from the
Credit or for Withdrawal Applications. The project team had good communication with
and access to MOF officials as needed.

Evaluation of the World Bank’s performance in implementing the project

The World Bank’s team collaborated closely with the Government during implementation
of the Project. The Bank provided full support to the project implementation, through
provision of project supervision, advisory support, access to international experience and
expertise. The Bank was receptive to Government’s ideas and priorities, which is
demonstrated by two restructuring processes during the project lifetime. The Bank has
contributed greatly to facilitating the project implementation, and final achievement of
PDO.

Lessons Learned

These have been incorporated in the lessons learned documented in the main body of the
ICR.

Relevance of the Objectives, Design and Implementation to current country and
global priorities

The project was initiated to support implementation of the Accounting Law enacted in
November 2004. Enhancement of transparency and accountability of government
institutions is one of the key tools of the Government in its fight with corruption. In order
to improve the activity of the state institutions in line with the modern standards, National
Strategy for Increasing Transparency and Combating Corruption (2007-2011) has been


                                             50
implemented. The Strategy contained important measures in the area of Open Government.
The Republic of Azerbaijan also joined all international initiatives in the sphere of Good
Governance. The country has also joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in 2012
with a view to improve its activities aimed at increasing transparency and promoting Open
Government; to exchange the international experience; and to contribute to the
international efforts in this domain. In 2012, the President endorsed Open Government
Initiative National Action Plan for 2012-2015.

Project’s Impact

Within the framework of the project almost 4,843 accountants from 418 institutions have
been trained (263 of them passed full trainings in NASBOs, 3,759 were trained in
fundamentals of NASBOs, 534 – accounting, 279 – law and taxation, 8 - IFRS); Financial
Accounting and Reporting system for budget institutions (FARABI) was developed and
implemented in a total of 99 budget institutions and universities, which enhances
transparency in accounting and financial reporting, and helps to maintain accurate and
correct HR and accounting records; NAQ was developed and specialized training center
established, which creates strong ground for continuing education of accounting and audit
professionals. The project has contributed to enhancing account keeping and reporting
capacity both through a) creating capacity for institutions to keep accounting records in a
due manner; b) creating capacity of the CoA to conduct financial and performance audits
when the CoA law is passed by Parliament.

All these measures help to tackle challenges standing in front of the institutions responsible
for financial control, i.e. reveal inappropriate spending, overstaffing, excessive pricing for
assets, incorrect depreciation and early/improper write-off of the assets, etc. It is expected
that the accountants that passed the trainings have got necessary knowledge and skills to
correctly maintain accounting ledgers, calculate depreciation, etc. In a new ERP system
many of these functions are automated, for example, those related to payroll, calculation
of depreciation. The system automatically generates reports required by MOF, and does
not allow data manipulation. Implementation of the system will also help the budget
institutions to free up financial resources and staff time, which can be spent more
effectively.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project contributed to institutional strengthening through building human resource
capacity in the area of accounting and bookkeeping, and creating an institutional
framework for continuing development of these professions.

Financial Science and Training Centre under the Ministry of Finance was restructured to
become a training and certification center responsible for development of accounting
profession in the country. The center was equipped with all necessary furniture and servers,
classrooms were equipped with the state-of-the-art smart boards and laptops to facilitate
education and examination process.




                                             51
National Accounting Qualification was established and four programs were developed for
the National Accounting Qualification: Certification program for accounting professionals,
Certification program for public sector accountants (NASBO and Cert IPSAS) and
Certification program for bookkeepers.

The project has purchased rights for translation and distribution in Azerbaijan of 10 study
texts, along with question banks and key notes. All these were translated into Azerbaijani
and published within the framework of the project. Additionally, study texts for Business
law and taxation were developed and published to support education process in FSTC.

Trainings on financial accounting, NASBOs, fundamentals of NASBOs, business law and
taxation, IFRS were conducted for 4843 accounting professionals. More than 418
institutions can now benefit from the services provided by more knowledgeable and skilled
accountants. Training of Trainers on IPSAS has been conducted by CIPFA for 15 public
sector accountants in Azerbaijan.

Financial Accounting and Reporting system for budget institutions (FARABI) was
developed and implemented in agreed budget institutions and universities receiving
financing from the budget. Appropriate servers and other equipment were purchased and
installed in both MOF HQ and backup center in Yevlakh. The system was introduced in
budget institutions in two phases. During the first phase, the system was introduced in 39
institutions. The second phase covered additional 60 institutions. 99 institutions can now
benefit from the functional capacity of developed financial accounting and reporting
system (FARABI).

Public institutions can benefit from updated IPSAS translated into Azerbaijani, and adapted
NASBOs.

MOF has conducted negotiation with the Azerbaijan State Economic University which is
a flagship university in the area of economics, finance and accounting in Azerbaijan. As
per the agreements reached, the university will cooperate closely with FSTC for
introducing extended program for accountants based on the study books developed within
the framework of the project.

The project contributed to establishment of association of accountants in Azerbaijan by
selecting an existing association of risk professionals and expanding its area of activities
to cover accounting professionals. It is planned that re-designed ARPA will take advisory
role in updating and adopting accounting standards. ARPA will be directly responsible for
exam marking. For this purpose, trainings were conducted by Ernst and Young Academy
to 20 accounting professionals, who will form a roster of exam markers for the association.

Unintended outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

Even though some of the beneficiary institutions showed ambiguous reaction and even
some reluctance to implementation of the new ERP system, successful implementation of
the system in a number of sites and positive word-of-mouth resulted in great interest to the



                                            52
system from the side of budget institutions. A number of budget organizations informally
applied to MOF, requesting installation of the system in their institutions, branch offices
and affiliates. These institutions were partially covered during the second phase of the
introduction of the system in budget institutions. It is planned that other institutions will be
covered by MOF after completion of the project.

The NAQ model has been recognized by the World Bank experts as the best qualification
model in the CIS and Eastern Europe. It is now planned to share experience in this area
with other countries in the region. This outcome also supported the idea to gradually
expand FSTC to become regional training center. For this purpose, the project initiated
negotiations with best practice certification institutions (ACCA, CIPFA, ICAEW etc.) to
mutually recognize certifications and obtain exemptions for similar papers. Active
negotiations were held with ACCA and this process will be held further beyond the
framework of the project.

Monitoring & Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

A monitoring specialist was hired by the project to carry out monitoring of the project
implementation. Additionally, monitoring consultant was hired by the World Bank to
facilitate implementation of the project activities and supervise the specialist.

Achieving PDOs by Components

These are consistent with the Outputs by Component and Results Framework analysis
under Annex 2. However more detail on FARABI is provided below.

Creation of an electronic reporting system for ministries and budget organizations

FARABI is a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning ERP system aimed to automate
back office functions in budget institutions. The system integrates all facets of financial
and administrative operations, including recording of daily accounting transactions, payroll,
maintenance of records on fixed assets and inventory, employee life-cycle, and automatic
generation of reports required by the MOF. FARABI is planned to be synchronized with
the TIMS so that all financial transactions can be made online, which enhance efficiency.
The system represents a powerful tool for analysis of financial and statistical data by the
MOF and enhances transparency and accountability of the budget institutions. Modern
Server Centre equipped with high-performance servers and other equipment, including
security and fire extinguishing systems, was established to serve FARABI. Initially the
system included the following modules: Organization structure; Staff list; Human Resource
cards; Payroll; Stock on hand; Assets in use; Inventories in operation; and
Treasury/banking operations. More modules were later on added in order to meet the
general requirements of budget organizations and specific needs of universities. They
include: Student module; budget planning and implementation; and Submission of
documents to treasury.




                                              53
Advantages of FARABI

   Compliance of procedures and reports to Azerbaijan legislation
   Integration with the systems of the Ministry of Taxes and State Social Protection Fund
    (SSPF)
   Enhanced transparency and accountability in data processing leading to greater
    accuracy of records. The system automatically generates output based on created
    accounting models, calculates salaries based on a monthly timesheet, and calculates
    depreciation based on the in-built schemes complying with the requirements of
    Azerbaijan legislation. All this ensures minimum human intervention and helps to
    avoid human errors and attempts to data falsification.
   Enhanced efficiency in data processing. The system automatically processes input data
    and frees up staff time which can now be spent on more challenging issues. The system
    generates documents necessary for payment and enables automated submission of
    documents to the treasury.
   Business Intelligence application helps to generate various statistical and analytical
    reports, required for decision-making.
   Efficiency in design. Cloud-based solution frees up money required for purchase of
    expensive server equipment and Human Resource required for support of the system at
    the beneficiary’s site.
   Comprehensive and flexible reporting options.
   Integration with other Information Technology systems is possible.
   Universal and convenient user interface.
   Universal search system.
   Multilingual interface - “3 +”.
   Multifunctional customization.
   Export of charts and reports to Microsoft Office applications.
   Video tutorials are in the system which make learning user friendly.

The system was presented to the President of Azerbaijan and commitment was taken to
cover 1000 budget organizations starting with 303 by the end of 2017. This phase will be
implemented using government resources.

The server centers were established in MOF Head Quarters (central server) and Yevlakh
(backup server) to serve the system. The servers were equipped with necessary electricity
backup system, monitoring and fire protection systems. Special monitoring software was
installed in MOF to enable online monitoring of the system and all connections.

The Service Centre is established in the Ministry of Finance and duly equipped within the
framework of the project. Currently, the center is operated by the contractor responsible
for implementation of FARABI system, that is, SINAM. After the project completion, it is
planned that Information Technology staff from the Service Centre will be hired either on
a basis of consulting contracts with MOF or the services will be outsourced to private
companies.




                                           54
Implementation

The project had significant delay in implementation during the first year of effectiveness.
The change of project design to align it with the changed priorities of the government
contributed greatly to progress in achievement of PDO objectives. Within 12 months after
the first restructuring the project showed significant progress in implementation of the
planned activities. The second project restructuring was initiated to further adapt the project
design to the changing priorities, and achieving of 50% of disbursement, as well as
completion of the delivery of equipment for FARABI system was a pre-condition set by
the World Bank for endorsing the second restructuring. PMU did manage to fulfill both
conditions set by the Bank and the second project restructuring was approved.

Both the MOF and WB provided active support to the implementation of the project and
achievement of PDO. The PDO was fully achieved.

The PMU had positive experience with communication within the MOF and the Bank. All
the requests and applications submitted to the Bank were processed and responded within
a shortest period of time, without any delays and reminders. Active collaboration with all
involved stakeholders helped to facilitate implementation of the project and achieve PDO
in an effective and timely manner.

Proposed arrangements for future operations of the project

There are two major activities under the project that need further support of the
Government to ensure sustainability of the achieved results. These are:

Support of FARABI system and roll-out of the system to all budget institutions across the
country; and
Support FSTC in further delivering of NAQ.

Support of FARABI system: The system developed and introduced in 99 institutions
requires financial, technical and operational support to remain fully functional. MOF does
not possess necessary HR capacity to maintain the system alone. The system will need to
be further supported in order to ensure the system is maintained (this involves updating
licenses, hardware upgrades, changes to perform system backups, monitoring of equipment
and software and making necessary changes to keep the system in line with the legislation);
and technical support to system users (responding to questions, connecting new
organizations, train new users, solve technical problems, monitor the system, etc.). It has
been planned that the support fee will be applied to user organizations, which will be
included in the expenditure budget of government organizations. The support fee will be
defined based on the organization type, size, average number and type of operations
performed by the organization. The support of the system will be outsourced to a
commercial entity that will be financed out of the collected fees.

Support of NAQ and FSTC: FSTC is part of the government structure under the MOF
that is partially financed from the state budget. Currently, FSTC receives about 300k



                                              55
MANAT (~290k USD) from the state budget. This amount covers salaries
of FSTC permanent staff, utilities and trainings of public sector accountants. Additional
financial resources are required to continue delivery of trainings for NAQ for corporate
institutions, payment to tutors, relevant operating costs, update of study materials, etc.
These are to be funded through fees paid by students of commercial courses. Another
source of financing to meet these costs, will be licensing fees for training companies which
will be interested in delivery of NAQ trainings. The main revenues are expected to be
obtained from the membership fees, exams and commercial trainings and licensing of
training institutions. The revenue obtained from the commercial courses and licensing of
training companies will be mainly spent on salaries of part-time tutors, training
consumables and updating training materials. Taking into consideration that the project
supplied FSTC with all necessary equipment, study materials and supplies, the
expenditures of FSTC during the first year after project completion will be mainly spent
on salaries of part-time tutors, which FSTC is planning to cover out of the commercial
courses.
