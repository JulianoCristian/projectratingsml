as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: project design should allow\n            adjustments to respond to a government\u2019s evolving priorities\n            within the PDO, since these may change significantly during\n            implementation. Project design should accommodate new\n            activities without changing the PDO, and therefore allow a\n            level two restructuring that requires management approval,\n            as opposed to a lengthy Level One restructuring process that\n            requires Board approval. The Ministry of Finance considered\n            it a flagship project of the Minister of Finance and\n            monitored its progress accordingly. The GOA broadly\n            demonstrated a strong commitment to the project,\n            contributing to its success. The project incorporated\n            accountancy training component that has trained both public\n            and corporate sector accountants to comply with\n            international accounting standards. The project also\n            facilitated the establishment of professional accountancy\n            organization, ARPA, which will oversee accountants by\n            providing quality assurance, setting ethical standards and\n            disciplining and investigating accountants where the need\n            arises. This will professionalize accountants in both the\n            public and corporate sectors. The Bank should aim to produce\n            similar benefits in future projects to strengthen public\n            financial management and corporate financial reporting."}, "docdt": "2015-12-30T01:01:01Z"}
