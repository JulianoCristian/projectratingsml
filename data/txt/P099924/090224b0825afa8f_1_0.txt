                         The mission team concluded that overall project implementation had continued to improve steadily. The status of activities was observed as follows:

                         completed in March 2014. Implementation of additional modules in those sites was progressing steadily with 17 sites so far completed and the remaining 22 sites expected to be
                         completed by May 2015. In addition, the contractor expected to complete installations of the originally agreed modules in an additional 60 sites by May 2015. There was a possibility

                         of completing all installations ahead of this date.
                         b)      Preparation of the national accounting qualification and accreditation for the ACCA and CIPFA programs was not progressing as expected.
