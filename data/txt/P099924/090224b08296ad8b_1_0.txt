Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The mission team concluded that overall project implementation had continued to improve. The status of activities was observed as follows:
 1.       Continuing progress was observed in the deployment of the accounting system (FARABI) with implementation of originally and additionally
          contracted modules in 99 pilot sites. Overall, at 72 sites the implementation of the system is ongoing with various stages of completion.
 2.       Preparation of the national accounting qualification and accreditation for the ACCA and CIPFA programs has incurred additional delays, but
          there may be progress before the end of the calendar year.
 3.       Retraining of public sector accountants was progressing well with a total of 3,500 staff having undergone training.

         Cumulative target values of budget expenditures audited by Chamber of Accounts using new methodology by December 2014 is 0%. The
         Law that envisages new methodology to carry out audits is now not expected to be passed by the parliament by the end of the project, and
         without the law the COA cannot use that new methodology. However, as part of the project, pilot performance and financial audits were
         successfully completed, and the knowledge and expertise gained during the pilot audits will be used in the future once the Law is enacted.

               The MOF started translation of IFRS standards using their own funds starting from 2006, and as of today 37 were translated and adopted,
               without using project funds. Remaining standards are planned to be translated in 2015, again without funding from this project. As part of
               the project it was decided to translate IFRS for SMEs (issued 2009) which is not planned to translate by MOF itself.
               *The actual number of existing IAS and IFRS standards to be translated periodically changes as new standards are added and old ones are
               withdrawn. Although the end target is stated above numerically (at 40), the actual target is simply full translation of all existing and effective
               IAS and IFRS standards. The numerical target above may not reflect the actual number of effective IAS and IFRS standards at project
               completion.

               Comments
               During preparation of project restructuring there was a typographical error in the numerical target number of NASBOs issued based on
               IPSAS and explanatory notes to be adopted. As of today the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board has issued the 32
               final IPSAS and not 41 as in restructuring paper. But the actual number of existing IPSAS standards to be incorporated into NASBOS
               periodically changes as new standards are added and old ones are withdrawn. Although the end target is stated above numerically (at 32),
               the actual target is simply full incorporation of all existing and effective IPSAS standards into NASBOS (currently 32). The numerical target
               above may not reflect the actual number of effective IPSAS at project completion.

               Cumulative target values of budget expenditures audited by Chamber of Accounts using new methodology by December 2014 is 0%. The
               Law that envisages the new methodology to carry out audits is not expected to be passed by the parliament by the end of the project, and
               without the law the COA cannot use that methodology. However, as part of the project, pilot performance and financial audits were
               successfully completed and the knowledge and expertise gained during the pilot audits will be used in the future once the Law is enacted.

               Currently there are 3 programs developed in FSTC:
               •         National Professional Certification (NPC) – 11 levels (with appropriate programs/syllabuses for each level)
               •         National Professional Certification for Public Institutions – 4(+1) levels (appropriate programs/syllabuses for 4 levels are ready; for
               the remaining optional level, negotiations are underway with CIPFA on using their study materials and syllabus for IPSAS. The optional
               level is for those who want to obtain the international certificate issued by CIPFA).
               •         National Certification for junior accounting staff / bookkeepers – 1 level program
               In addition two certification models are planned to be implemented by the end of project:
               •         DipIFR– 1 level program
               •         Certified Accounting Technicians – 3 level program (it is an intermediate qualification for those who passed first three levels of NPC)
               It was planned that the programs of FSTC will be accredited by ACCA, in order to promote more trust and recognition among potential
               students and employers. The accreditation process with ACCA was started in 2013. One of their requirements was for FSTC to be included
               in the listing of the Ministry of Education. For this purpose, FSTC applied to MoE for licensing (even though FSTC does not need it to
               provide education services, as per its Charter). Once the license is received, FSTC will re-apply to ACCA for accreditation.

               *The 2700 number above actually reflects the number of students who had taken (not successfully passed) the various training programs at
               the FSTC in the previous period.
               **As shown on page 7 of this Report, the End Target for the number of students taking the various training programs was 3500, a target that
               has been surpassed. However this same figure was mistakenly included here as the End Target for the numbers successfully passing the
               training program, which would unrealistically assume a 100% pass rate—a figure that could not be achieved if the learning program and
               testing are rigorous and meaningful.

               11 textbooks were either translated or developed within the framework of the project. 9 of them are audit, accounting and tax related, the
               remaining 2 – MIS and Economics. The textbooks which FSTC uses for its programs are those used by ACCA for professional education.
               They are not intended for higher education institutes, as the latter use different syllabuses and approaches to study process (e.g. more
               lecture hours, practical hours, etc.). Nevertheless, considering great interest of a number of higher education institutions and the MoE, the
               textbooks were distributed to education institutions, having main courses in accounting and audit.

               The SDP of CoA consisted of 4 components similar to four existing contracts implemented within CAPSAP. All activities under components
               1, 2 and 4 are completed so they are assessed as 100% implementation. In the case of component 3, comprising legislation and standards-
               related items, not all necessary legislation has been implemented. The amendments to the Chamber of Accounts law are drafted, and now
               the COA plans to start necessary proceedings for its approval in the Parliament. Since it could take some time to finalize, the progress for
               all 4 components in total is valued as 80% for 2014 and 100% for the next year.
