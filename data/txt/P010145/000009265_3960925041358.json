project\n            execution period. Project financing and WDB's financial\n            performance were the Bank's major concerns during\n            project execution. Covenanted rates of return were\n            optimistic and the covenant along with the project financing\n            plan should have been modified especially after Bank's\n            experience with WDB on the First Water Supply Project.\n            Covenanted rates of return were optimistic and the covenant\n            along with the project financing plan should have been\n            modified especially after the Bank's experience with\n            WDB. The Bank continuously pressurized WDB to take\n            appropriate measures to improve WDB's performance on\n            institutional, management, finance, metering, billing and\n            collection and operation and maintenance of water supply\n            systems. The major lesson to be learned is that projects\n            that need financing by the Banks should be selected jointly\n            by the Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka/WDB after\n            carefully considering their merits in regard to priority,\n            needs and viability."}, "docdt": "1988-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
