           is intended to support the next phase of the First\n            Structural Adjustment Operation (SAL I). The main objective\n            of the program is to accelerate sustained economic growth by\n            reorienting the economy towards a path relying more on the\n            private sector, and on improved allocation of public and\n            financial resources. It consolidates the policies already\n            adopted & reinforces the adjustment process by\n            additional measures. Policy performance emphasized by SAL I\n            thus far has been encouraging. The measures to be supported\n            by SAL II will strengthen the ongoing policy reforms,\n            notably those aimed at: (i) continued sound macroeconomic\n            management; (ii) improved development expenditure\n            management; (iii) continued trade liberalization; (iv)\n            improved access of farmers to fertilizers & irrigation\n            water; and (v) improved financial institutions."}, "docdt": "1989-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
