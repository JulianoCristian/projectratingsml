The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can\n            learned from this project. Given the complexities of\n            institution-building in Nepal, it is desirable to: 1) set\n            realistic objectives about how rapidly institutions can be\n            improved; 2) limit the interventions to essential key\n            requirements; and 3) undertake thorough preparation and follow-up."}, "docdt": "1994-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
