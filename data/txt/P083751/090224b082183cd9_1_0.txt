                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         As per the PAD, the overarching Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are, within each participating country, to : (a) Improve Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA)
                         compliance with InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s safety standards; (b) Improve CAA's compliance with ICAO's security standard; and (c) enhance main
                         international airports' compliance with ICAO's security standards. More specifically, in each Financing Agreement, the PDOs are set as follows: For Burkina Faso, the
                         objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of its civil aviation authority and Ouagadougou international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Cameroon, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of
                         its civil aviation sector and its international airports with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. For Guinea, the objective of the
                         Project is to support the Recipient in strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity and Conakry international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Mali, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of the
                         Project Implementing Entity and Bamako international airport with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards.
