                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         As per the PAD, the overarching Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are, within each participating country, to : (a) Improve Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA)
                         compliance with InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s safety standards; (b) Improve CAA's compliance with ICAO's security standard; and (c) enhance main
                         international airports' compliance with ICAO's security standards. More specifically, in each Financing Agreement, the PDOs are set as follows: For Burkina Faso, the
                         objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of its civil aviation authority and Ouagadougou international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Cameroon, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of
                         its civil aviation sector and its international airports with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. For Guinea, the objective of the
                         Project is to support the Recipient in strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity and Conakry international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Mali, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of the
                         Project Implementing Entity and Bamako international airport with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the projectâ€™s last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report before the extended project closing date of June 30, 2014. All the activities to be financed by the project
                         have been completed in the four beneficiary countries, which led to an overall disbursement rate of 99%. Guinea, which benefited from a selective one year project extension to the
                         project closing date, completed the remaining activities which included: (a) acquisition of a new console for the control tower at Conakry international airport; (b) completion of the

                         remaining airport civil works (the construction of an access road to the remote area of the runway and the construction of an aircraft isolation point); and (c) the adoption of a new civil
                         aviation code in November 28, 2013, as completion of part of the agreed institutional reform. However, even though the autonomous civil aviation authority (CAA) has been officially
                         created, the Government plans to continue the reform process until an autonomous CAA is actually set up and operational.
