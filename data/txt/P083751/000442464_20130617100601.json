The restructuring will\n            make it possible for Guinea to catch up with the progresses\n            made by the three other participating countries by fully\n            completing all on-going activities, and hence to continue\n            reaching its objectives of strengthening CAAs' safety\n            and security supervision, as well as to improve the\n            project's outcomes and return its implementation\n            progress to a satisfactory status. The recipient has in\n            place an action plan which is acceptable to the Bank\n            (revised procurement plans and activities completion\n            schedule) to complete the project. The closing date is to be\n            extended by one year, until June 30, 2014. This additional\n            period of one year for the Guinea component is necessary to\n            bring two current on-going activities to completion:\n            delivery and installation of a new air navigation console\n            for the control tower of Conakry, and the completion of\n            drafts civil aviation code with its application texts. With\n            the completion of those two activities, the project can\n            close its financial accounts, but the Government and the\n            Bank need to monitor the effective operationalization of the\n            newly created CAA."}, "docdt": "2013-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
