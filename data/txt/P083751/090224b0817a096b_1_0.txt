                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         As per the PAD, the overarching Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are, within each participating country, to : (a) Improve Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA)
                         compliance with InternationalCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s safety standards; (b) Improve CAA's compliance with ICAO's security standard; and (c) enhance main
                         international airports' compliance with ICAO's security standards. More specifically, in each Financing Agreement, the PDOs are set as follows: For Burkina Faso, the
                         objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of its civil aviation authority and Ouagadougou international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Cameroon, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of
                         its civil aviation sector and its international airports with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. For Guinea, the objective of the
                         Project is to support the Recipient in strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Implementing Entity and Conakry international airport with International Civil
                         Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards. In the case of Mali, the objective of the Project is to support the Recipient in improving compliance of the
                         Project Implementing Entity and Bamako international airport with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety and security standards.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As a result of the project’s closing date extension from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013, the participating countries (especially, Burkina Faso and Cameroon) could significantly
                         improve the project’s activities implementation by completing previous on-going contracts and/or launching previously scheduled activities that wouldn’t have been possible to
                         undertake otherwise (case for Guinea). However, project activities were suspended in Mali from end-March to mid-July and have recently resumed.

                         As of end October 2012, the project has disbursed US$32.4 million (which represents a disbursement rate of about 90%), and the remaining uncommitted funds are US$3.6 million.
                         The disbursement rates for Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Mali are between 96% and 98%; for Guinea, this rate is at 62%.
