Sugar Rehabilitation Project aims to\n            restore efficient agricultural and processing operations at\n            the Kakira Sugar Works (KSW) through (i) the physical\n            rehabilitation of lands, factory and associated\n            infrastructure; and (ii) technical assistance to strengthen\n            KSW management and staff.  The agricultural development\n            aspect of the project includes the rehabilitation of the\n            irrigation system and the reestablishment of an outgrower\n            production scheme to augment can supplies to the factory.\n            The project also intends to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Industry and Technology's (MOI) role in monitoring the\n            performance of the sugar industry and advising the\n            Government on industry policy matters.  The project will,\n            over a six year period:  (i) restore KSW's sugar\n            production from present zero level to historical levels\n            (85,000 tsy) and save foreign exchange used for imports;\n            (ii) strengthen MOI's management of the sugar sector;\n            and (iii) provide a mechanism for liberalizing sugar\n            marketing and pricing."}, "docdt": "1988-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
