objectives of the project were to (i) restore sugar\n            production of Kakira Sugar Works Limitedto historical levels\n            and, by so doing, save Uganda's scarce foreign exchange\n            resources that would otherwise have been utilized to import\n            sugar; (ii) strengthen the role of Ministry of Trade and\n            Industry( MTI) in monitoring the performance of the sugar\n            industry, coordinating industry policy and responding in\n            general to the industry's needf or assistance during\n            the period of rehabilitation;a nd (iii) support the\n            liberalization of sugar marketing and processing in\n            Uganda.The key lessons to be learned from the project are as\n            follows: i) the time frame for importing, transporting and\n            installing the equipment involved in a largeindustrial\n            investment project in a land-locked country needs to be set\n            more realistically and reviewed more closely at the design\n            stage; ii)agricultural research aspects were not fully\n            addressed at project design stage. An agronomic research\n            unit was established towards the end of the project. Cane\n            variety development requires a long lead time for testing\n            and propagating improved adaptivevarieties, and this should\n            have been addressed in the early stages of the\n            project'simplementation; iii) creation of a working\n            partnership between Government and international\n            financinginstitutions with joint venture participation with\n            the private sector in implementation can lead to successful\n            results; and iv)replacement of expatriate staff by Ugandan\n            nationals was envisaged under the project. Despite\n            implementing staffing development and training programs,\n            this was not fullyachieved. Constraints not visualized in\n            this case, included the difficulty in attractingqualified\n            Ugandans from townships or from overseas, to rural areas."}, "docdt": "1996-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
