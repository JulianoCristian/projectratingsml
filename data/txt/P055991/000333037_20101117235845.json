"Ratings for the First Phase of the Land\n            Administration Program Project for Honduras were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            support to legal reforms requires a comprehensive risk\n            assessment and constant monitoring of changes and its\n            implications. To increase effectiveness, the single agency\n            model for land administration should focus on the cadastre\n            and registry functions coupled with institutional and fiscal\n            autonomy. Focusing land regularization activities in\n            priority areas, rather than undertaking a systematic land\n            regularization process can increase the impact and\n            sustainability of land administration projects. Strong focus\n            on municipalities is critical to the sustainability of\n            investments on cadastre and registry modernization. Ensuring\n            broad community support for a project requires attention to\n            representativeness and legitimacy of consultation\n            mechanisms. In-house development of technological platforms\n            may provide additional benefits beyond efficiency and\n            transparency. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements of land\n            administration projects need to be considered more carefully\n            during preparation and implementation. Economic analysis of\n            land administration projects needs to be strengthened\n            through innovative methodologies and better data collection."}, "docdt": "2010-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
