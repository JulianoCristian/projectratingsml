PROJECT,TF040956-HONDURAS: LAND AMINISTRATION", "versiontyp": "Revised buff cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the Land Administration\n            Project for Honduras is to establish and operate (as part of\n            the broader program) an integrated and decentralized land\n            administration system, composed of public and private\n            entities, which provides users in the project area with\n            accurate information on urban and rural land parcels and\n            effective land administration services (e.g., purchases,\n            mortgages, cadastral, and registry certifications) in a\n            timely and cost-effective manner. The main focus of the\n            restructuring is on ensuring that the original project\n            outcome targets are achieved. While maintaining the same\n            Project Development Objective (PDO), the restructuring\n            responds to the urgent need to update project implementation\n            arrangements in order to reflect the current national legal\n            and institutional framework, and to modify selected outputs\n            under component two. Since the project's board\n            approval, the legal and institutional framework regulating\n            land property rights in Honduras has changed substantially.\n            At the time of project preparation, cadastre administration\n            was under the responsibility of the Borrower's\n            executive branch while the Borrower's judicial branch\n            was responsible for the real estate registry. Therefore, the\n            Ministry of Interior (SGJ) was selected as implementing\n            agency and an agreement between SGJ and the Borrower's\n            judicial branch was established. The property law\n            (congressional decree 82-2004), published in the official\n            gazette on June 29, 2004, established a new legal regime for\n            land administration, and created a new entity, the property\n            institute (IP), to oversee land administration in the\n            country in an integrated manner, including cadastre\n            administration and real estate registry. As a result, the\n            Borrower is now requesting that SGJ be replaced with IP as\n            implementing agency for the project."}, "docdt": "2007-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
