F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objective is: To establish and operate an integrated and
decentralized land administration system (composed of public and private entities) which


                                                   ii
provides users in the project area with accurate information on urban and rural parcels
and effective land administration services (e.g., purchases, mortgages, cadastral and
registry certifications) in a timely and cost-effective manner

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Background. Land tenure insecurity has been a critical
issue affecting Honduras' growth and poverty reduction efforts, especially given its
impact on investment, social stability and sustainability of land uses. At appraisal,
property rights were challenged by overlapping claims and unresolved legal issues, and
its enforcement hindered by an inefficient land administration system characterized by an
antiquated property registry and outdated and incomplete cadastre. In particular, the
Property Registry, then under the Judiciary, lacked proper standards and oversight of
regional registries, and adequately trained registrars. The limited cadastral information
available, then under the Ministry of Interior (SGJ), was poorly coordinated with the
legal information of the registry. Moreover, the country faced the increasing need of
regularizing informal settlements, resolving rural land conflicts, and protecting the land
rights of indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities. As in other countries, land
administration reform had not advanced due to difficulty in reaching consensus and
opposition from vested interests.
2.     Government Strategy. Aware of the situation, the Government of Honduras
(GOH) had included land tenure reform in the 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), and reiterated this commitment in the National Plan for 2002-2007. Specifically,
the Government decided to embark on ambitious legal and institutional reform centered
on the modernization of the land administration system. Key to the reform was a
proposed Property Law which would unify the cadastre and registry functions under a
single agency (the Property Institute, IP) and would apply nationally a parcel-based
property registry (folio real), bringing together cadastral information (exact geographical
description of the parcel) and legal information (certainty of legitimate owner).
Importantly, the law would also facilitate the development of a computerized National
System for Property Administration (SINAP), including a module (SURE) for folio real.
3.     Accordingly, the Government requested to the Bank1 priority support for a land
administration program, building on the successful pilot implemented under the Bank-
financed Rural Land Management Project (PAAR, P007398, effective 1997-2004). To
ensure sufficient funding, the government also requested parallel co-financing from the
Nordic Development Fund (NDF).
4.      World Bank Strategy. Responding to Government priorities, the 2003-2006
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), underpinned by the PRSP, listed improving access to
land as one of its objectives. After a long engagement through policy and operational
support, the momentum for land administration reform in the country represented an
opportunity for more substantial Bank assistance. Among development partners, the Bank
was in a unique position to support the Government's proposal. Based on its global
knowledge and experience, the Bank was willing to support this type of complex and
intrinsically risky efforts. In Central America, it had a regional approach to land reform,
supporting pioneering projects in El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama.
1
    As part of the World Bank Group, the International Development Association is referred to as the Bank in this report.


                                                                    1
5.       Considering the magnitude of the planned legal, institutional and technological
changes, the Government and the Bank agreed on a medium term program, of which the
Project would be the initial phase. There was a reasonable level of confidence that the
Property Law would be approved and that implementation of reforms would go forward.
The program was expected to start under the existing legal and institutional framework,
and eventually adapt to and support the evolving policy and regulatory changes. In the
interim, a transitory arrangement was established whereby the executive and the judicial
branches formally agreed to integrate the cadastre and registry and more generally to
coordinate and cooperate in carrying out land regularization and administration
activities.2

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

6.      The Project was the first phase of the Honduras Land Administration Program
(PATH) financed through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The objective of the
Program, to be implemented in a three-phased, 12-year period, is to establish a fully
integrated and decentralized national property rights system (National System for
Property Administration, SINAP).
7.      As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Project Development
Objective (PDO) of Phase I was to establish and operate (as part of a broader program) an
integrated and decentralized land administration system (composed of public and private
entities) that provides users in the project area with accurate information on urban and
rural parcels and effective land administration services (e.g., purchases, mortgages,
cadastral and registry certifications) in a timely and cost-effective manner. The system
would help to increase land tenure security, facilitate land market transactions and
municipal territorial plans, and develop management plans for protected areas, forests,
and indigenous peoples.
8.      The main outcome implied in the PDO is the establishment of a land
administration system that functions institutionally and operationally, which would
be tested initially in the country's most dynamic economic corridor.3 The Project's key
performance indicators in the PAD provide information on the efficiency and
effectiveness of the system. These indicators are:
     ·    System maintains a 96 percent rate of titled lands accurately registered in SINAP;
     ·    Satisfactory rating (third level on a four-level scale) by at least 70 percent of
          SINAP users, including a certain percentage of women;
     ·    Average time to register a land transaction is 7 days or less;
     ·    Average administrative cost of registering a land transaction is US$2.07
          equivalent or less;
     ·    Operating costs of Registry 100 percent covered by registration fees;


2
  The agreement is officially known as the Integrated Registry and Cadastre System or SINREC. In addition to government, the
agreement included civil society representatives.
3
 This corridor includes the departments of Choluteca, Comayagua, Cortés, and Francisco Morazán, and included the two main cities
of the country: Tegucigalpa (the capital city) and San Pedro Sula.



                                                               2
      ·   Conflicts in 60 percent of national lands (forestry and protected areas) in the
          project area are resolved.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      The PDO and its indicators were maintained as established at appraisal, with one
exception. The outcome indicator "Conflicts in 60 percent of national lands (forestry and
protected areas) in the project area are resolved" was removed from the results
framework following the Mid-Term Review (MTR). Resolving land disputes on national
lands was never considered part of the PDO although this may be an important outcome
to demonstrate effectiveness. This indicator would have been relevant if the Project had
conducted regularization activities within forestry and protected areas. Nevertheless,
although this activity was originally considered, it could not be carried out due to the
delay in the approval of a new Forestry Law, the risk posed by the uncertain legal
environment, and limited resources.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.       The PAD identified five types of direct Project beneficiaries:
      (a) Within the project area, over 700,000 urban and rural families (adjusted to
          over 500,000 after restructuring) were expected to benefit directly from
          cadastral and regularization activities.
      (b) Selected Garífuna and Miskito communities in the Caribbean Coast would
          benefit directly from demarcation and titling of their lands, in a manner
          consistent with their culture and social organization.
      (c) Participating Municipalities were expected to benefit directly from capacity
          development, training, and access to improved land administration information,
          including through SINAP. Such benefit was expected to help facilitate territorial
          planning and improve local revenue through increased property tax collection.
      (d) At the national level, land administration agencies would benefit from overall
          modernization of the sector and specifically the development of SINAP. Range
          of benefits went from receiving training to operate SINAP to institutional re-
          engineering with the bulk of benefits supposed to be directed toward the cadastre
          and public registry agencies later subsumed by the Property Institute.
      (e) Banks and other financial institutions would benefit from improved
          enforcement of property rights and access to SURE.
11.    More indirectly, all people living within the project area (approximately 2.98
million or 45 percent of total population) would benefit from having access to improved
land administration services. The property rights of specific social groups were expected
to be better protected, namely those of women and indigenous and Afro-Honduran
communities.

1.5 Original Components


                                                3
12.        The Project had three components:
            Component 1: Policy Framework and Institutional Strengthening (US$10.9
            million, 28.1 percent of total Project cost). The main objective of this
            component was to establish the legal, regulatory, and technical platform
            necessary to streamline the systematic land regularization,4 titling and
            registration process to be supported by the Project and improve land-related
            services at the local level. The component aimed at increasing transparency and
            improving governance in land administration, and its main output was the
            establishment of SINAP through legal, regulatory, and institutional means.
            SINAP was to include the Unified Registries System (SURE), the National
            Territorial Information System (SINIT), and the Registry of Norms (RENOT).
            SINAP was expected to be operated from 60 connection points5 established in
            public and private entities and by at least 600 trained technicians.
            Component 2: Area-based Systematic Land Regularization, Titling, and
            Registration (US$22.7 million, 58.2 percent of total Project cost). This
            component entailed the mapping, regularization, titling, and registration of land
            through both an area-based systematic approach and a priority-based approach
            (for selected indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities). It also included
            activities to delimit macro areas according to administrative divisions and
            protected areas' boundaries. The component's output indicators were: (i)
            745,000 land parcels surveyed and regularized in the project area; (ii) 70 percent
            of these parcels registered in SINAP under folio real; (iii) 70 percent of land
            transactions in the project area registered in SINAP under folio real; (iv) 12,000
            parcels surveyed in forest areas; (v) 12 protected areas demarcated and
            incorporated in SINAP; (vi) 40 municipalities demarcated and 2,800 km of inter-
            municipal boundaries defined; and (vii) the land of 16 ethnic communities
            surveyed and demarcated and of 12 communities titled and registered.
            Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation
            (US$5.3 million, 13.7 percent of total Project cost). This component would
            cover the administration costs of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and
            monitoring and evaluation activities.

1.6 Revised Components

13.     The main components were not formally revised during the life of the Project, but
their scope was slightly changed. Component 1 remained unchanged, although after the
Property Law's approval in 2004 it centered mainly on the IP instead of the agencies
planned at appraisal but which were subsumed by the IP.
14.     Component 2 underwent a change in scope due to the following: (i) adaptive
change resulting from a new regularization approach ­ Public Need-based Property
Regularization (RINP) ­ allowed under the Property Law; and (ii) corrective changes
resulting in reduction of targets for the component's outputs and dropping of preparatory

  In the context of Honduras, regularization refers to the process of analyzing and formalizing a land parcel's physical location and
legal status through document review and on-site verification, including conflict resolution and registry in folio real.
5
  Connection points refer to working stations where trained technicians can view and modify information in SINAP's subsystems.



                                                                 4
activities in the department of Choluteca and of regularization within national lands. Two
main reasons underpin the reduction in output targets. First, the Property Law introduced
requirements for folio real that were far more complex, lengthier, and costlier than those
assumed at appraisal. Second, project design underestimated the amount of resources that
would have to go into the modernization of the property registries in order to reach the
original targets. Although these changes implied a reduction in the level of impacts, the
Bank considered that the PDO was still attainable as it depended on SINAP being
functional (in terms of accuracy, timeliness, cost, sustainability), which could still be
shown with a reduced sample.

1.7 Other significant changes

15.     The Property Institute was created incorporating registry, cadastral, and
regularization functions. IP was created by the Property Law as a de-concentrated entity
under the Presidency of the Republic with technical, administrative and financial
autonomy. IP is governed by a seven-member high-level Board of Directors (Consejo
Directivo), administered by an Executive Secretary. It has three general directorates,
Cadastre, Registry, and Regularization. The Board of Directors provides guidance for
overall policy and strategy, and the Executive Secretary, under said board, is in charge of
the coordination, supervision, and administrative management of the institution.
16.     PCU model went from a multi-project to single project approach. Initially,
the PCU in charge of the Project also oversaw the World Bank-financed Natural Disaster
Mitigation Project (PMDN, P064913, effective 2001-2010) and the Forest and Rural
Productivity Project (PBPR, P064914, effective 2004-2010). The purpose of this "super"
PCU was to improve administrative efficiency and coordination effectiveness across
these related, cross-sectoral projects. The Government administration that took office in
January 2006 disbanded the "super" PCU, and the Project was placed under a dedicated
PCU. Since the implementing agency (SGJ) and basic PCU functions were maintained, a
formal restructuring was not required.
17.     The Project was officially restructured to adapt to the new legal and
institutional framework and adjust selected targets. The Regional Vice President
approved a Project restructuring in September 2007. Main modifications included: (i)
changing implementation arrangements; (ii) reducing the scope of outputs related to
Component 2; (iii) clarifying that no activities requiring resettlement would be financed
under the Credit; (iv) eliminating the procurement agent option; and (v) extending the
Credit closing date. Changes to implementation arrangements included transferring the
Project from SGJ to IP to reflect its insertion as the country's new single land agency.
Transitional arrangements, along with the functions of institutions now subsumed by the
IP, were accordingly replaced in the DCA with references to the IP and its functions
under the Property Law.6 The external procurement agent option (performed by the
United Nations Development Program, UNDP) was eliminated since the PCU had
achieved adequate procurement capacity. The justification for reducing these output

 The institutions subsumed by the IP included the Property Registry (RPIM), the National Cadastre (DEC), and the National
Geographic Institute (IGN).

targets is explained in paragraph 14, resettlement issues are discussed in paragraph 41,
and references to the extension of closing date are below in this section.
18.     Almost three percent of total Credit funds were cancelled as a result of
findings from an investigation conducted by the Department of Institutional
Integrity (INT).7 This corresponds to a total of Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
461,428.86.8 The cancellation, which occurred in March 2008 and represented 20 percent
of undisbursed funds, impacted the new PCU's efforts to achieve Project targets (see
details of the INT investigation in paragraph 28).
19.    The Bank approved two reallocations of credit proceeds during the life of the
Project, first in June 2007, as part of the project restructuring, and then in June 2009.
20.      The Credit was extended twice, adding two years to the implementation
period. The restructuring extended the Credit closing date by 16 months from April 30,
2008 to October 30, 2009 to allow the Project sufficient time to complete regularization
activities whose implementation could not be accelerated due to technical and logistical
reasons. When the Project was scheduled to close, the country was in the midst of a
political crisis. As with other projects, the Bank unilaterally extended the closing date, in
this case to April 30, 2010, to compensate for foregone supervision (missions had been
stopped since the beginning of the crisis in June 2009) and to allow for adequate project
evaluation and reconciling of accounts. The NDF extended the closing date of its credit
three times, from April 30, 2008 first to December 31, 2009, then to December 31, 2010,
and finally December 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.     During the Seventh Quality at Entry Assessment (QE7), the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) considered that overall project preparation had been
satisfactory. Preparatory work was specifically rated "above-average" and Strategic
Relevance and Approach was rated "highly satisfactory." The QAG panel did not identify
any major issues with the design or implementation of the Project (which had been
effective for six months at the time of the review).
22.    Project design reflected the Government's vision, taking into account lessons
from regional and global experience. This experience included similar and successful
Bank-financed projects and programs in countries such as El Salvador, Peru and
Thailand. The pilot experience under PAAR, in particular, provided valuable local
lessons on land regularization methodologies, surveying techniques, cost estimates, and
demarcation and titling of indigenous peoples' lands.9 The need for a long term approach,
with clear commitments for each phase to ensure progress, made supporting the program
through an APL a reasonable choice.

  This amount is equivalent to US$750,500.20 as per the exchange rate effective on the day of the cancellation (March 11, 2008).

  Indigenous peoples' lands are referred in the PAD as "Ethnic Lands."


                                                                 6
23.     The Project was prepared in a dynamic legal and institutional environment.
The Government envisioned an unprecedented reform process that aimed at incorporating
the latest knowledge and best practices in land administration. The Bank's decision to
support the Project without waiting for the approval of the Property Law, or conditioning
the credit to its approval, reflected the view that the Project would be a catalyst for the
expected legal and policy changes. Comprehensive legal and institutional analyses were
carried out to identify transitional arrangements that could ensure smooth project
implementation during the initial period; environmental and social assessments were also
conducted to identify safeguard-related risks. In retrospective, the decision to go ahead
with the Project before the Law's approval seems strategically sound: just within three
months of Board approval the Honduran Congress approved the Property Law. As
discussed below, however, project design did not properly consider some critical
implementation challenges.
24.     Although project preparation advanced well, project design included
unrealistic targets. Project design was too optimistic about the rate at which sector
modernization and regularization activities could take place. In particular, the Project
Results Framework reflected unrealistic goals: (i) targets for PDO outcome indicators
related to time and cost of property transactions were set at levels much higher than those
suggested by international trends; and (ii) targets for regularization outputs under
component 2 were set without a proper assessment of modernization requirements and
without taking into account contingencies due to the uncertainty in the legal framework.
25.    Some critical risks were not identified or were inadequately assessed during
preparation. Overall project risk was rated modest at appraisal, but several major risks
that materialized during implementation were missing. The unidentified risks include:
   (a) Implementation risk related to the potential delay (i) in restructuring the Project in
        a timely fashion to reflect the new legal and institutional framework once the
        Property Law was approved; and (ii) in consolidating a new legal framework,
        particularly considering the comprehensiveness of the Property Law.
   (b) Implementation and reputational risks stemming from the likelihood that the draft
        law would suffer changes during the approval process, and crucially, although
        more difficult to foresee, that these changes could be perceived by some
        stakeholders as a threat to their property rights. This risk materialized in relation
        to the chapter on indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples' land rights, which
        contributed to opposition to the Project by some groups.
   (c) Implementation and reputational risks related to the recognition of indigenous and
        Afro-Honduran peoples' land rights, stemming from the difficulty in determining
        the level of representativeness of their organizations and in managing the internal
        disagreements and diverging interests within and across communities.
   (d) Financial management risks (rated from negligible to moderate) and procurement
       risks (rated as average) at appraisal proved to be substantial during
       implementation. Some of the problems were related to weak internal controls
       within the PCU, which potentially could have been identified in the capacity
       assessments.

2.2 Implementation

26.      PDO was achieved with the establishment of SINAP. As corroborated by key
performance indicators, the Project goal of establishing an operationally and
institutionally functional land administration system was achieved. This result reflects the
effort made to address many implementation challenges, especially after the Project
experienced a difficult period in 2006, when it was under an INT investigation (see
below) and an Inspection Panel investigation (see details in paragraph 41).
27.     Initially, strong Government support to the Project and land administration
reform facilitated rapid implementation. The Property Law was approved in June
2004, a few months after the Bank's Board approval of the Project and before Credit
effectiveness. Subsequent institutional changes to integrate the registry and cadastre were
carried out faster than could have been anticipated. In addition to this enabling
environment, the Project's accelerated start was helped by the progress made on
preparatory activities through PAAR, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$2
million, and retroactive financing. By the end of 2005, the Project had already disbursed
about 60 percent of credit funds.
28.     PCU had weak fiduciary oversight during the initial period of
implementation. The PCU made rapid implementation progress, but fiduciary reviews
determined that some administrative procedures were not in compliance (for details refer
to Section 2.4 on fiduciary compliance). These findings triggered, and were confirmed
by, an INT investigation conducted in 2006; this investigation found evidence of
collusion, contract steering and misrepresentation in the award and implementation of
contracts financed under the Project.10 The Bank and Government agreed on an action
plan to improve fiduciary capacity and accountability within the PCU, which was
implemented satisfactorily.
29.     Implementation capacity during the course of the Project was uneven.
Following the Government transition of January 2006, Project implementation slowed
down significantly because of turf battles over the selection of the Project Coordinator
(which left the PCU without leadership for several months), arbitrary firing of qualified
technical staff, and loss of fiduciary capacity (as some of the shared fiduciary specialists
were not transferred to the Project after the Government's decision to dismantle the
"super" PCU). The Project reached a critical point, and in January 2007 the Bank
considered suspending disbursements. This was avoided as Government stepped up
supervision and met all the required actions, including, inter alia, the appointment of a
qualified Project Coordinator and experienced fiduciary staff, the establishment of the
Council of Governors (as the project's main inter-institutional coordinating body), and
the strengthening of Project oversight.
30.     Project restructuring, made necessary by the approval of the Property Law,
was delayed. Adjustments to implementation arrangements were required by the new
legal and institutional framework established by the Property Law. A central issue was
the transferring of the Project from SGJ to IP, which, as a new agency, needed time for
consolidation. In early 2006, the new Government administration decided it was

10
     In addition the Project, INT investigation included two additional operations (PBPR and PAAR).


                                                                   8
appropriate to transfer the Project to IP. Nonetheless, owing to a large extent to the turf
battle explained above, the official request for restructuring was not sent to the Bank until
March 2007. At this time, the Inspection Panel (IPN) investigation was ongoing, and
Bank management decided to hold the approval of the restructuring until the final report
was issued to ensure that its recommendations would be adequately considered. Bank
management approved the restructuring in September 2007, but it did not take legal effect
until June 2008 as neither SGJ nor IP took decisive actions to move the process forward.
31.      Institutional consolidation of IP has been challenging. Since its creation in
June 2004, the IP has made progress in its consolidation but still faces difficulties in
fulfilling its mandate as the country's main land administration entity. Institutional
strengthening efforts have been hindered by unstable leadership and insufficient attention
to the reengineering of IP's Cadastre and Registry units due to pressure to meet ambitious
land titling targets. After becoming the implementing agency, the IP has had five
Executive Directors while the Board of Directors changed several times, which revealed
weaknesses in the Property Law that make IP highly vulnerable to the political
environment. Coupled with high staff turnover, this has limited the impact of the plan to
gradually transfer staff and selected Project responsibilities from the PCU to the relevant
units of the IP. Regularization processes were delayed at times due to the IP's lack of
institutional capacity and resources. Under these circumstances, the PCU continued to
maintain relative autonomy and found it challenging to strengthen its operational ties
with the IP even after the restructuring.
32.     Delay in the approval of regulations to the Property Law created uncertainty
over some of the regularization procedures. The comprehensiveness of the Law and
opposition to some of its articles by indigenous and Afro-Honduran organizations posed a
challenge to the drafting of regulations. In its absence, the PCU applied ad hoc
procedures to conduct some regularizations activities. In turn, this experience helped test
and systematize regularization methodologies, which contributed to the drafting of the
regulations. Some of the RINP procedures, however, had to be reverted causing
uncertainty among beneficiaries.
33.      Delays in the procurement of technical services under the NDF credit
contributed to underachievement of targets. Major work, funded by NDF, was planned
to start in 2005 but could only be contracted in February 2009. This international contract
(estimated cost of US$7.5 million) was critical for project indicators under Component 2
as it included almost 3,400 sq km of aerial photography and cadastral surveying in
approximately 138,000 ha of rural areas and 240,000 urban parcels. Preparation of the
bidding documents was delayed by the institutional changes brought about by the
Property Law and the leadership crisis affecting the Project in 2006. In addition, the
procurement process had to be carried out twice due to procedural issues. The contract
was ongoing at the time of Project evaluation, and most of its outputs will be used for the
second phase.
34.    Implementation of the pilot effort related to recognition of Indigenous and
Afro-Honduran Peoples' Land Rights was one of the major Project challenges.
Approximately 5 percent of project resources were allocated for this pilot effort, but the
demands on consultation and follow up were high given the complex nature of issues
related to indigenous peoples' lands rights. During the preparation phase, some

                                             9
indigenous and Afro-Honduran organizations had concerns on the potential impact of the
Property Law on their communities' land rights. There were also misconceptions about
the Project's objectives regarding the recognition of those rights. During implementation,
uneven support to the Project and its consultation framework from some of these
organizations (see below) made the task of fostering broad support for the pilot activities
more difficult.
35.     The Project targeted Garífuna and Miskito communities, and during
implementation the consultation framework consisted of a new regional committee (mesa
regional) for each group and several community-level committees (mesas locales). The
Honduran Black Fraternal Organization (OFRANEH) ­ one of the leading Garífuna
organizations ­ opposed, among other things, the establishment of the Mesa Regional
Garífuna. In its request for investigation to the IPN in January 2006, OFRANEH argued,
in this respect, that the members of the Mesa Regional Garífuna were not legitimate
representatives of their communities and as such could not be entrusted with fundamental
decisions regarding the regularization of Garífuna lands (details of the IPN investigation
are in section 2.1). In contrast, the Organization for Ethno-Community Development
(ODECO) ­ another leading Garífuna organization ­ and Unity of Mosquitia (MASTA) ­
the main umbrella organization of the Miskito federations ­ supported the Project and its
consultation framework, as also did the communities that accepted to participate in
project activities.11

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     Design. Overall M&E design identified adequate PDO indicators, although an
indicator related to institutional strengthening outcome should have been included. The
major shortcoming in design was a lack of methodological precision in the measurement
of PDO indicators that led to unreliable baseline values and unrealistic target values. In
addition, there was no methodology or baseline survey to measure some of the key
economic, environmental, and social impacts identified in the PAD.
37.     Implementation and Use. Appropriate data for PDO indicators were not
collected until 2007 when the methodology was defined with the assistance of an
international M&E specialist in preparation for the MTR. Then, there were two
subsequent rounds of data collection in 2009 and 2010 coinciding with the preparation of
Phase II and closing of Phase I respectively. The data generated helped provide a realistic
assessment of Project results used in the design of Phase II. The PCU also conducted
three rounds of performance evaluations with surveys and stakeholder workshops to
measure satisfaction with the Project and identify ways to improve it. Although no
baseline or methodology existed to evaluate impacts rigorously, the PCU carried out
stakeholder workshops and survey amongst beneficiaries that provided useful
information on their perception about Project effects (See details in Annex 5 and 6). The
effect of titling on land prices was not measured, which is one of the reasons why the ex-
post economic analysis had to be conducted with data that may not sufficiently capture
Project benefits (see details in Annex 3).


11
     Seven Garífuna and 20 Miskito communities participated actively in the Project.


                                                                   10
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard Compliance

38.     The Project triggered OP 4.01(Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural
Habitats), OPN 11.03 (Cultural Property), OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), and OD
4.20 (Indigenous Peoples).
39.     Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitats. The Project was classified as
Category B, and an Environmental Analysis was prepared along with an Environmental
Management Plan. An assessment of environmental performance carried out in 2009 did
not find any large-scale, significant or irreversible environmental impacts related to the
Project. The only minor problem detected through Bank supervision, which was
satisfactorily addressed, was the improper disposal of the byproducts of boundary marker
construction in the course of demarcating a protected area. Finally, the legal covenant in
the DCA (Section 3.10) which prohibited the issuance of private titles in areas within or
adjacent to protected areas or critical natural habitats unless they were officially
delineated, was complied with. Considering the above factors, compliance with OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats) is rated satisfactory.
40.    Cultural Property. OPN 11.03 was triggered because the San Fernando de Omoa
National Monument (the second largest colonial fortress in the Americas) was located
within the project area. This historical site was successfully demarcated in collaboration
with the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History contributing to its preservation.
As a result, compliance with OPN 11.03 (Cultural Property) is rated satisfactory.
41.     Involuntary Resettlement. A Process Framework was prepared given that the
demarcation and better enforcement of protected areas' boundaries could potentially lead
to restrictions of people's access to natural resources. The systematic cadastral and
regularization activities fell under the exception set forth in footnote 8 of OP 4.12,
specifically the second part that states that "the policy does not apply to disputes between
private parties in land titling projects." Nevertheless, the DCA included a legal covenant
(Section 3.08(c)) specifying, inter alia, that in the event that any activity under the
Project required the involuntary resettlement of population then prior to the initiation of
any such activity the Borrower had to prepare a resettlement plan for such population.
The restructuring clarified that no activities requiring resettlement would be carried under
the Project. During implementation, Bank safeguard and legal specialists assessed the
new regularization method (RINP) allowed by the Property Law and reconfirmed that
this process fell under the exception set forth in footnote 8. The Process Framework
never applied because economic activity of the local population was not affected by the
delimitation or demarcation of protected areas. Because appropriate due diligence
measures were implemented without the need for formal application of the resettlement
instrument that had been prepared, compliance with OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement)
is rated satisfactory.
42.    Indigenous Peoples. A Social Assessment and an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan (IPDP) were prepared and consulted during preparation in compliance
with OD 4.20. Given the uncertainty at appraisal on the content and approval of the
Property Law, the Project included three provisions with respect to indigenous' land

                                            11
rights: (i) adoption of conflict resolution procedures reflecting the interests of indigenous
peoples; (ii) inclusion of a legal covenant (Section 3.11) that established, inter alia, that
no titling or physical demarcation of land adjacent to indigenous peoples' lands could
take place unless there were adequate procedures to protect the rights of indigenous and
Afro-Honduran peoples and the duly affected parties were consulted; and (iii) adoption of
a legal/regulatory framework to recognize indigenous peoples' land rights as a trigger for
Phase II. Nevertheless, as detailed below, the IPN investigation highlighted shortcomings
during implementation.
43.     In its Investigation Report the IPN concluded that, although the Bank was broadly
in compliance with the policies applicable to the Project, there were instances of non-
compliance related to OD 4.20 and OP/BP 13.05 (Supervision). 12 In its January 2006
request, OFRANEH claimed that the Bank had not taken into consideration the rights and
interests of the Garífuna people in designing and implementing the Project. More
specifically, OFRANEH argued, inter alia, that the Project failed to adequately address
concerns about the potential impact of the Property Law and its relationship with
procedures and actions under the Project and that the Mesa Regional Garífuna was not
representative of the Garífuna population. In this respect, among the main instances of
non-compliance with OD 4.20, the IPN noted that the IPDP had not been updated since
the enactment of the Property Law and that the Mesa Regional Garífuna, while composed
of a broad range of stakeholders, was not supported by leading representative
organizations such as OFRANEH and ODECO. In addition, the IPN considered that the
Bank had not adequately supervised the Project consultation mechanisms.
44.     The above issues were addressed through a Management Action Plan, which was
satisfactorily implemented with Government support and carefully monitored by Bank
safeguard and communication specialists. As part of the Action Plan, the IPDP was
updated, a revised Communication Strategy was implemented, and information about the
Project's conflict resolution mechanisms was clarified and disseminated. Moreover, the
Project consultative framework was strengthened with the activation of the Inter-Sectoral
Commission for Protecting Land Rights of Garífuna and Miskito Communities, which
although created in 2001, was not deemed necessary by stakeholders during preparation
and thus not mentioned in the IPDP. The Commission, acting as a central forum
including government agencies and leading indigenous peoples' organizations, helped
coordinate policy and strategy related to indigenous peoples' land rights, and was
instrumental in the consultation process for the preparation of a Manual for Demarcation
and Titling of Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Peoples' Lands. The Project continued
supporting the mesas regionales. While the Mesa Regional Miskita consolidated its role
as a consultative mechanism, its Garífuna counterpart enjoyed ODECO's support but not
that of OFRANEH.
45.     The events leading to and in the aftermath of the IPN investigation shed light on
the difficulties of ensuring safeguard compliance in the context of recognizing indigenous
peoples' land rights. Some of the lessons learned on representativeness are discussed in
Section 6. Although corrective actions were applied to minimize and mitigate adverse
effects, Project design and implementation had shortcomings that ultimately constrained

12
     All the reports related to the Project's INP Investigation can be found by Request No. 38 at http://www.inspectionpanel.org.


                                                                    12
the Project's ability to deliver additional culturally compatible benefits to the indigenous
and Afro-Honduran peoples involved. Hence, overall compliance with this policy is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

Fiduciary Compliance

46.     Financial Management. For most of the second half of the implementation
period, financial management (FM) performance was rated moderately satisfactory,
although the Project faced several FM issues that affected compliance. Inappropriate FM
practices were identified in 2006 and subsequently FM rating was downgraded to
Unsatisfactory. In particular, the 2004 audit report noted that the PCU had pre-financed
counterpart expenditures from the Special Account (SA) due to delays in the allocation of
counterpart funding.13 The Bank temporarily withheld replenishments to the SA until the
Government complied with three conditions: (i) full reconciliation of the SA; (ii) refund
of SA funds used to finance counterpart funds; and (iii) submission of a satisfactory
financial audit report for 2005. These three requirements were fully met. The full
reconciliation of the SA identified an amount of US$1,090,790.52 that was refunded by
GOH in four installments between 2006 and 2009.
47.     In April 2007, FM rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. As part of the
project restructuring process, new personnel was selected and contracted for FM, and the
Fiduciary Unit of the PCU was reorganized to improve its functioning. In the last
supervision mission before Credit closing, FM rating was downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory, since despite PCU's efforts, several issues were still pending, including:
(i) payable accounts from 2005 and 2006, and the unresolved issue of withheld taxes that
were not sent to the tax authority; (ii) reconciliation of differences between final
estimates and Project accounts; (iii) final reconciliation of the SA, including
identification of the differences found by the auditors; and (iv) resolution of the
weaknesses related to internal controls pointed out by the auditors. Most of these issues,
which were reflected in the qualified audits, were resolved soon after the end of the Grace
Period. Specifically, to deal with the first issue, the National Congress approved a Decree
on September 2, 2010 condoning the Project's pending payable accounts to other
Government agencies and the owed taxes and related fines, as well as providing budget to
settle accounts with private parties.
48.     Procurement. The overall management of procurement processes by the PCU
was Moderately Satisfactory. The Project started its implementation with a PCU staffed
with qualified and experienced procurement consultants. The Project procurement
specialist was selected on a competitive basis for the preceding project, PAAR, and was
retained for the Project. At the same time, as agreed at appraisal, the Government hired
UNDP as a procurement agent for international biddings during the first two years of
implementation. This was the basis for a Satisfactory rating in the first year of
implementation.
49.     Findings of a procurement post review carried out in 2006 brought to the Bank's
attention irregularities that led to the INT investigation, and resulted in a downgrading of

13
     The 2004 audit report was furnished to the Bank with an almost 12-month delay.


                                                                  13
the procurement rating to Unsatisfactory.14 The results of an Independent Procurement
Review (IPR) dated November 2006 also identified some minor observations. In addition
to portfolio-level actions, a Project-specific action plan was agreed with the Government
in January 2007. Such plan was implemented and the procurement rating upgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory. A new IPR carried out in May-June 2008 did not uncover any
major issues. The PCU showed an enhanced performance in procurement management
during the last two years of project implementation and procurement rating was
maintained at moderately satisfactory level until closing.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.     As originally envisaged, the Project was the first of three phases of a 12-year
program to be financed through an APL. During Phase II preparation, the Government
requested to extend Program implementation to 16 years through four phases,
considering: (i) implementation delays during the first phase; (ii) lessons learned during
the first phase, including a more realistic assessment of implementation capacity, land
regularization costs, and institutional strengthening needs; and (iii) International
Development Association (IDA) resource constraints, given that only over half of the
funds initially planned for the second phase were available.15
51.     Three of the triggers agreed to move to Phase II were fully met and one was
partially met:
     ·    Creating a new institutional framework for SINAP and completing an agreed staff
          transition plan from the current structure (Fully Met). The IP was established and
          the staff transition plan completed. The 2003 Territorial Planning Law and the
          2004 Property Law assign clear responsibilities to IP and SGJ for the
          administration of SINAP and its sub-modules.
     ·    Achieving 80 percent or better results of PDO outcome indicators' targets for the
          first phase. (Fully Met).
     ·    Completing baseline data collection for the second phase. (Fully Met). Baseline
          data have been collected for the indicators proposed for Phase II that required
          such data.
     ·    Adoption of a legal / regulatory framework on land rights for indigenous and
          Afro-Honduran peoples (Underway). Honduras has developed a legal framework
          through various laws, more recently the 2004 Property Law and the 2007 Forestry
          Law. Regulations for the Property Law have been approved by the IP's Board of
          Directors, while the draft regulations for the Forestry Law have been completed.
52.    The political crisis of 2009, and subsequently IDA resource constraints, delayed
the approval of Phase II. The new Government confirmed its interest to continue the
Program with Bank support, and rapidly ensured effectiveness of a PPF of US$3.0
million and requested the Bank to consider retroactive financing under the new Credit.


14
   The INT investigation corresponds to a period when the Project was part of the super-PCU and under SGJ. None of the fiduciary
staff were retained by the restructured PCU under the IP.
15
   As initially planned, the second phase would require US$50 million or US$56.4 million in 2007 prices. Phase II will now be
financed by an IDA Credit of US$30 million equivalent.


                                                              14
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

53.     Development Objective. PDO relevance was high at the time of preparation and
remains high today, as corroborated by country strategy documents. The 2007-2010 CAS
listed the goal of "improving equity and security in land access" under the strategic
objective of "accelerating equitable economic growth for employment generation". The
Project was also considered relevant to achieve the strategic goal of `strengthening
governance through state modernization and participation'. The draft FY11 Interim
Strategy also acknowledges the relevance of improving tenure security, and includes the
second phase as part of the country program. Given that weak property rights are a core
problem across sectors, the Project has also been relevant in assisting other Bank and
non-Bank financed interventions and harmonizing land administration modernization
with other projects.16
54.     Project Design. The concept of an integrated land administration system, as
reflected in project design, continues to reflect the best practice at the time of the
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). Project design, however,
underestimated the resources necessary for large scale system modernization and did not
anticipate the delays or additional costs related to the changes introduced by the Property
Law. As a result, the Project was unable to deliver the large scale impacts it promised. In
this respect, it seems more relevant for the initial phase of an institutional development
program to have a solid infrastructure and a sample large enough to test it operationally
than generating large scale impacts. Moreover, the decision to go ahead with the Project
without the approval of the Property Law is also consistent with today's practice in which
land administration projects are considered adequate instruments to foster reforms.
Nonetheless, current practice emphasizes a more comprehensive risk assessment to
anticipate potential changes stemming from policy and legal reforms.
55.      Project Implementation. When the Property Law was approved, the IP followed
the single agency model advocated by good practices. The Project redirected efforts to
assist the new institution by providing technical assistance, financing equipment, and
transferring technology. With the project restructuring, the IP was designated as the
implementing agency, which increased its sense of Project ownership. The Project was
also keen to incorporate the new regularization option (regularization by public need)
after it was approved in the Property Law and its amendments, recognizing the potential
to improve the tenure security of thousands of low-income households in informal
settlements. On the other hand, the mesas regionales created under the Project to function
as the consultation framework may not have been as relevant from a culturally
appropriate and socially sustainable perspective considering that there were viable
structures/organizations already established in the intervention areas.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

16
   The Project has complemented activities supported by other Bank-financed projects such as Corazon Transboundary Biosphere
Reserve (P085488), Forestry and Rural Productivity (P064914), Natural Disaster Mitigation (P064913), and Rural Competitiveness
(P101209). The Project has also coordinated activities with the European Union-financed Pro-Corredor Project (EUR 26.2 million)
and the Inter-American Development Bank-financed Environmental Management Project of the Bay Islands.


                                                             15
56.    The PDO can be broken down into four parts: (a) establishment of an integrated
and decentralized land administration system, allowing (b) provision of accurate
information and effective land administration services in the project area; and (c) timely
and cost effective delivery of these services. Moreover, (d) the system would help to
increase land tenure security, facilitate land markets transactions, and promote territorial
and environmental management planning.
Integrated and decentralized land administration system (Partially achieved):
57.     The Project contributed substantially towards the establishment of a new system
for land administration in the country. It supported the preparation and consultation
process that led to the passing of the 2004 Property Law ­ a landmark development that
placed Honduras ahead of many countries in the region and the world regarding property
rights ­ and helped to strengthen the newly created IP. Integration of the system was
furthered by the Project through the preparation of norms, procedures and guidelines and
standardization of regularization methodologies, but more fundamentally by facilitating
the shift to the parcel-based property registry (folio real) bringing together cadastral
information and legal information. The latter was achieved through the development and
implementation of SINAP, and specifically the unified registries platform (SURE),
coupled with the modernization of six property registries and the provision of accurate
cadastral information for approximately 365,000 parcels.
58.     The Project established 690 connection points to SINAP (well exceeding the
original target of 60). In addition, the general public an access property records
information from any location through the system's webpage. Some concerns remain,
however, over inter-institutional coordination arrangements required to ensure system
integration. For example, there is still some overlap in functions among national land
administration institutions and the municipalities.17 The Project has already helped to
improve coordination through ad hoc mechanisms such as co-execution and municipal
agreements, and the next step should be a protocol for inter-institutional coordination to
manage database access and maintenance.
59.     System decentralization was advanced by making SURE available via web to
participating municipalities and regional property registries of IP. Eleven municipalities
(of an original target of 15) managed to have the infrastructure and technical capacity to
access SURE for cadastral maintenance. More broadly, the IP established agreements
with 22 municipalities laying a framework for the provision of technical assistance and
information. Further attention, however, is still needed to address issues that pose a risk
to cadastral maintenance in the municipalities, such as infrastructure problems that affect
connectivity with SURE and turnover of qualified local staff due to electoral cycles.18
Accurate information and effective land administration services (Achieved):
60.     Information provided by land administration institutions is more accurate in the
project area. At the end of the Project, SURE was maintaining a 94 percent rate of
accurately registered properties.19 Services have also become more effective. The Project
17
   National land administration institutions include the IP, the Institute for Forest Conservation and Development, Protected Areas and
Wildlife (ICF), and the National Agrarian Institute (INA).
18
   Municipal elections are held every 4 years in Honduras, simultaneously with presidential and legislative elections.
19
   This accuracy rate reflects consistency between the field and information in SINAP for deeds registered under folio real and
between the registry books and information in SINAP for deeds registered under deed-based registration.


                                                                 16
incorporated almost 300,000 parcels into SURE (of which about 101,000 are in folio
real). Through the web-enabled SURE platform the general public, lawyers, and notaries
can now make consultations and initiate transactions online.
61.     Although the Project represents the initial step of a long-term Program, its
positive impact on improving the public perception on the system's accuracy is already
evident. This is corroborated by the growth in demand for property registry services. As
the property registries targeted by the Project were modernized (including digitization of
their records), the volume of transactions registered in SURE under folio real grew
steadily, and the 40 percent target rate was successfully reached. This trend may be an
indication that a "registry culture" is already developing in the project area. For example,
the cadastral office in the municipality of Comayagua has already noticed an increase in
the demand for formal registration services, even though recording a deed in the IP is ten
times more expensive than executing a private transaction.
62.      Improved effectiveness is also corroborated by the levels of satisfaction of the
various users of the system, including users of the property registry and users from public
institutions and municipal governments. At the end of the Project, 85 percent of the
property registry users rated SINAP as satisfactory (including an 82 percent rate among
women). All participants in a 2010 focal group of expert users evaluated SURE as
extremely functional.
Timely and cost-effective delivery (Achieved):
63.     Time to register a real estate transaction was significantly reduced in the project
area from 90 to 23 days, which is a remarkable achievement compared to international
trends.20 Project-enabled legal reforms and new technology have streamlined procedures,
but it was not possible for this evaluation to obtain a precise estimate on the reduction of
administrative costs to register land transactions. First, the baseline value of US$6.21
could not be verified. Second, IP's accounting system did not allow isolating the direct
costs of registering land transactions. A very preliminary estimate of the average
transaction cost in 2010 is US$14.96, which would be competitive in the Honduras
context.21 A proxy measure included in the 2010 Doing Business indicators is the cost of
registering a property expressed as percentage of the property value. In this respect, with
a cost of 5.5 percent Honduras compares well with the Latin American average of 5.9
percent, although still behind El Salvador (3.8 percent), which started a similar land
program earlier on. One of the most salient, external factors hampering cost-effectiveness
of services in the country is the cost of notary services (it is estimated that notary fees
represent 69 percent of the total cost of registration).22
64.    Financial self-sufficiency is another indicator of cost-effectiveness in the
provision of land administration services. There is evidence that the public registry
20
   According to the 2010 Doing Business Indicators, the average for the Latin America and Caribbean region is 70.4 days, and for
OECD countries is 25 days. El Salvador, a comparable country, has achieved an average of 31 days. Considering these figures, the
original PDO outcome target of reducing the average time to register a land transaction to 7 days appears unrealistic.
21
   The estimated baseline value was US$6.21. Considering the reforms to streamline registration procedures and the investments in
new technology, it is unrealistic to assume that the average cost increased by a proportion of 340 percent. Again, there is a wide range
among surveyed property registries, with Trujillo having the lowest estimate (US$9.01) and San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa ­ the
main cities in the country ­ the highest estimates (US$26.04 and US$20.78 respectively)
22
   In Honduras, certified notaries are legally required to issue the deed, but notary services are comparatively scarce and fees are high.
Relative to other countries in the Central American region, the number of notaries is low (measured by per capita or by square
kilometer), while notary fees rank as the highest (3 to 5 percent).


                                                                   17
system has the potential to be financially self-sufficient. A March 2009 independent
evaluation concluded that registration fees can cover 167 percent of the system's
operational costs.23 Nonetheless, the range of self-sufficiency varied widely across
regional registry offices: The offices in the medium-sized cities of Siguatepeque and
Comayagua had a self-sufficiency rate of 60 percent and 91 percent respectively, whereas
the office in the larger city of San Pedro Sula generated revenue twice of its operational
costs. Since the IP manages the whole public registry system, it can cross-subsidize lower
performing offices to ensure efficiency and equity in service provision. The main
challenge towards consolidating financial self-sufficiency is fiscal policies that hinder
IP's financial autonomy. For example, in 2008 the Ministry of Finance (SEFIN)
mandated that institutions would receive up to 50 percent of the revenue they generated.
According to the independent evaluation, if this negative transfer is taken into account,
the system's financial self-sufficiency would drop to 83 percent. The continuation of this
practice would constraint IP's ability to make capital investments and pay recurrent
expenditures.

Land tenure security, land markets transactions, and territorial and environmental
management planning (Partially Achieved):
65.     Lack of a baseline and counterfactual makes it difficult to reliably show Project
effects on land tenure security and associated social and economic benefits. However,
there is some evidence that the Project helped increase tenure security directly, especially
as a result of a new regularization option (RINP) included in the Property Law.
Specifically, the Project contributed to the recognition and enforcement of the land rights
of almost 75,000, mainly poor, families living in informal peri-urban areas of
Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. In addition, over 40,000 new property titles have been
generated throughout the life of the Project. Results from the final beneficiary survey
indicate that 90 percent of the property owners interviewed consider that obtaining a title
had reduced land conflicts. Moreover, some progress was made towards the recognition
of indigenous peoples' land rights with the delimitation of the lands of 20 Miskito
communities and the start up of the collective titling process.
66.    Direct evidence on Project impact on land market transactions (i.e., formal sales
or mortgaging of regularized property) was not collected. Results from the beneficiary
survey and workshops provide anecdotal evidence that property values have increased in
the project area and that regularization has removed constraints in land allocation,
exemplified by the many requests to subdivide plots to grant land rights to family
members.
67.     The RENOT platform, although not yet sufficiently implemented, has the
potential of helping to monitor norms and restrictions affecting properties and land uses
in general. Moreover, the SINIT platform contains at least 8,000 digital maps, which can
be overlaid, with information on forestry, land uses, cadastre, and protected areas often
linked to socio-economic data. The Project also produced information at the local level
that could eventually help municipalities improve their territorial planning.

23
   The assessment of financial self-sufficiency was calculated by comparing operational costs and registration fees in the same
property registries surveyed to calculate average time and costs. The analysis included data from Honduras's 2008 fiscal year, and
overall rate is the average weighted by the number of transactions in each property registry.


                                                               18
3.3 Efficiency

68.    The ex-post economic analysis provides indications of positive, albeit modest,
economic efficiency in spite of the Project achieving lower outputs than originally
expected. The analysis applied the same methodology and assumptions used during
appraisal with some minor exceptions detailed below. The incremental benefits
considered were the expected increases in property values due to new titling. Although
the analysis incorporated actual Project outputs and costs, benefits (price premiums for
property values) were estimated from a 2004 dataset.24
69.     At appraisal, net present value (NPV) of net benefits was US$105.9 million with
an economic rate of return (ERR) of 44 percent. At completion, the NPV of net benefits
was estimated at US$1.2 million with an ERR of 12.42 percent. Under an alternative
scenario that also takes into account incremental economic benefits from income
generating investments accruing during the period of the analysis, the NPV of net
benefits was estimated at US$ 8.5 million with an ERR of 15.6 percent.
70.     The economic feasibility indicators at completion are significantly lower than
those at appraisal. While ex-post indicators were expected to be weaker than those of the
ex-ante analysis, as a result of lower than expected outputs, the magnitude of this
difference is largely due to the assumption at appraisal that all properties that were
surveyed and incorporated into SINAP (regardless of whether they received new titles)
were to gain value equivalent to the price premium on titled properties. While there can
be benefits associated with surveying and incorporation into SINAP, it was considered
methodologically unsound for this evaluation to assign the price premium to properties
that did not receive a new title. It was, in any case, unfeasible to estimate incremental
benefits from these other activities due to data constraints. Future evaluations of land
administration programs should strive to collect data on a wider range of benefits.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.      As detailed above, the Project was highly relevant, achieved most of its PDO
indicators, and likely improved the economic situation of poor households. Nonetheless,
it did not reach the targets expected during implementation and the institutional
framework to ensure an integrated and decentralized land administration system still
needs to be strengthened. Efficiency was not as high as expected during appraisal, but
still showed some evidence of positive returns. For these reasons, the Project is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.    Poverty Impacts. The Project was expected to help bring economic benefits in
the form of expanded access to collateral-based credit, increase in real estate value, more

24
   Ideally, the price premium would have been estimated from a dataset collected after Project completion in order to capture any
induced changes in land markets.


                                                                 19
incentives to invest on land-related ventures and home improvements, and increase labor
supply. Poor households were expected to capture a large share of these incremental
benefits as they disproportionally suffered from land tenure insecurity. The results from
the beneficiary workshops and survey conducted in peri-urban areas suggest that titling is
likely to have some effects on poverty reduction through an increase in land values due to
titling but the direct effect of titling on expanding credit access appears to be negligible.
Respondents mentioned that a lack of credit effect is explained by low demand for
mortgage-based loans and the perception that large banks do not accept their titles as
collateral.25
73.      Gender Aspects. The Project incorporated three indicators to measure women's
participation and access to property rights: (i) 82 percent of women rated SINAP as
satisfactory, which is similar to the 85 percent found for the entire sample; (ii) 43 percent
of parcels in SINAP had a woman as the principal owner; and (iii) 47 percent of new
titles adjudicated have a woman as the principal owner. It is noteworthy that the
adjudication of new titles benefited women more than men (47 percent titled to women;
39 percent titled to men; 12 percent titled jointly). Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
larger percentage of titling on behalf of women is due to the higher migration rate among
men. Furthermore, a Gender Audit was conducted in October 2008 to assist in the
preparation of the Gender Strategy for Phase II. This audit reviewed the performance
under Phase I and found no evidence of gaps in titling between women and men as sole
owners. Nevertheless, women have lower rates of finalizing the process than men. Joint-
titling, on the other hand, remained scarce.
74.     Social Development. Workshops participants in peri-urban settlements identified
as a social benefit the reduction in conflict with the alleged owners of the lands on which
they had settled who used to exert pressure (sometimes aggressively) on them to obtain
payment. Participants also mentioned that the support for patronatos (legally recognized
neighborhood associations) increased during the preparation and implementation of
legalization activities but subsequently decreased once families obtained titles. These
observations suggest that while the credibility of patronatos increased as a result of the
regularization process they run the risk of becoming irrelevant if they do not expand their
activities to other areas of neighborhood improvement.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.     The Project has contributed to a comprehensive modernization of the land
administration sector. The establishment and strengthening of the IP and the development
and institutionalization of SINAP are significant milestones in the process to make this
sector more efficient and transparent. As any major institutional restructuring process, the
changes initiated and promoted by the Project were and still remain challenging. Even
though the Project benefited from the initially strong political support and timely
adoption of the Property Law, the implementation of said law, and especially the
integration of cadastral, registry, and regularization functions into the IP ­ though an
important step forward ­ has implied complicated and difficult negotiation processes due
to the magnitude of political, institutional and personal interests involved, and will still

25
     The perception that large banks did not accept the titles as collateral was not crosschecked with the financial institutions.


                                                                      20
take further years to be completed. IP will require substantial institutional support during
the next phase of the program. Nonetheless, the overall impacts of the institutional
changes are already visible (in the improved efficiency and transparency of the land
administration services).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

76.     Workshop results show that landowners in peri-urban settlements and municipal
lands identify as one of the Project's benefits the bequest of their land, in full or part, to
their children. This unintended outcome is relevant to the PDO as it shows that land
administration institutions are more effectively meeting the needs of citizens.
77.    In collaboration with the Bank-financed PBPR and PMDN, the Project helped
develop a wireless metropolitan network (RMI) for Tegucigalpa to facilitate data
transmission and inter-agency communications and to ensure connectivity of SINAP.
This unintended outcome is relevant to the PDO as it contributes to an integrated and
decentralized land administration system.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

78.     The PCU conducted stakeholder workshops and a short survey to learn more
about the effects of land regularization. The workshops were conducted in: (i) peri-urban
neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula where squatters had obtained titles
through RINP; and (ii) a neighborhood near the city of Comayagua where legal
possessors had obtained full title from the municipality. Former squatters in peri-urban
areas identified more Project-induced benefits than the latter group. Some of these
benefits include increases in property values, enhanced incentives to investment in house
improvements, and reduction in conflicts. There are no perceived increases in access to
credit. Lawyer notaries and municipal cadastre technicians mentioned in a separate
workshop that overall they are satisfied with the Project-sponsored activities and
outcomes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

79.     Risk to development outcome is rated as moderate considering that there are two
factors contributing to the sustainability of SINAP: (i) the system is already functional
with well-developed platforms, operational and technical manuals, and institutional
support; and (ii) any upgrades or correctives measures necessary to maintain PDO
outcomes could be done in the context of Phase II. Furthermore, there are measures in
place to mitigate or minimize the impact of some of the risks that could materialize.
80.    Internal Risks. Potential internal risks include degradation, vulnerability, and
underutilization of the land information recorded in SINAP. Although it is unlikely that
the system would become obsolete, cadastral information can be at risk of becoming
outdated if maintenance activities are not conducted regularly. In this respect,
municipalities are the weakest link in the land administration system and technical
capacity and interest in cadastre remains weak across many municipalities. Moreover, it

                                             21
is critical that the property registry offices receive adequate resources to sustain the
impact of system modernization.
81.      Measures are already in place to mitigate these internal risks. The IP has the
capacity to generate sufficient revenue that could be invested in cadastral maintenance,
system upgrades, and adequate operation of modernized regional registry offices. At the
same time, IP's capacity to manage its resources is being improved, inter alia, through an
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant.26 Additionally, municipalities have an
incentive to maintain the cadastre and utilize SINAP in order to improve tax collection
and management. IP has already entered into cooperation agreements with some
municipalities to provide them with data and technical assistance. To ensure that these
measures are effective, the Government needs to either modify the existing fiscal policy
to allow the IP to retain more of its revenue or ensure that the institution receives enough
budget allocation. IP would also need to find a way to deal with the high staff turnover in
municipal cadastral units. Simultaneously, the IP should focus on its main mandate of
overseeing the national cadastre and the property registry, and re-consider the
disproportionate attention given to regularization programs. It should ensure, therefore,
that its cadastre and registry functions receive adequate funding and resource allocation.
82.     External risks. Information recorded in SURE could be at risk of becoming
outdated if users fail to record new transactions in the property registry. In fact, a critical
element for the sustainability of Project results is ensuring that a culture of registry takes
hold, particularly in rural areas. Accessible registry offices, affordable registry
transaction fees and reliable systems are key elements in building this culture. This risk is
likely to be reduced when people further internalize the benefits of registering their
transactions as anecdotal evidence seems to indicate in Comayagua. A reduction in the
cost of notary services would likely help increase the registration of property
transactions. Phase II of the program is expected to have information campaigns and
contribute with proposals to make land administration services further accessible.
83.    Another external risk relates to the completion of the collective titling process for
the twenty Miskito communities whose land was delimited under the Project. The
probability that this process may not be completed is modest, but delays can pose social
and reputational risks. This risk is mitigated by the continuation of the Inter-Sectoral
Commission led by INA, where MASTA, the umbrella organization of the Miskito
peoples, participates actively.
84.     Finally, there is a modest risk that the tenure security in the regularized peri-urban
settlements is not sustained. For example, settlers that default on mortgage payments to
the regularization trust fund (fideicomiso) will not be able to receive titles. There is also
the probability that, once the regulations to the Property Law are issued, some of the
regularization procedures would need to be adjusted; this situation could cause confusion
among beneficiaries. Since the manuals prepared under the Project have been used as
inputs to the drafting of the regulations, the impact of these potential adjustments is
considered moderate. To keep Project beneficiaries well-informed of these changes, the
IP should continue to partner with civil society groups and patronatos to conduct
communication campaigns and training workshops.

                                                                 22
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.      QAG rated quality at entry for the Project as satisfactory. The Project was highly
relevant as stated in the PRSP and CAS, and fully aligned with the land sector reforms
promoted by the GOH at the time. In addition, the Project was the continuation of a
successful pilot effort under PAAR and global Bank experience on land administration
was reflected in Project design. The task manager in charge of preparation and appraisal
was a land administration specialist, and the task team, including Bank staff and
consultants, appeared to have included an adequate mix of expertise. Transitory legal and
institutional arrangements were rightly identified to ensure an early and rapid start of
project activities.
86.     Despite the relatively satisfactory sector analysis and project design, there were
shortcomings in the original assessment of risks, the Project results framework, the M&E
design, compliance with the Indigenous Peoples safeguard policy (OD 4.20), and
economic and financial analysis. As noted earlier, risks were underestimated and
consequently the design lacked mitigation measures for risks that eventually materialized
affecting both the implementation and reputation of the Project. The Project results
framework had ambitious targets for PDO indicators (time and cost of transactions) and
outputs for land regularization, which created unrealistic expectations. The M&E system
lacked a proper methodology to measure PDO indicators and other impacts, which
affected the evaluation of the Project. There was insufficient assessment of consultative
mechanisms and organizational dynamics of indigenous and Afro-Honduran
organizations and federations to ensure an appropriate consultation framework during
implementation. Finally, the ex-ante economic and financial analysis overestimated the
benefits accruing from new titling resulting in a relatively high internal rate of return.
87.   The high relevance and satisfactory elements of design provided a relatively good
framework, but the shortcomings had a significant effect on implementation. As a result,
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.     During the Project's initial period, the Bank did not readily act on the need to
assess the impact of the Property Law and update the Project documents accordingly.
Furthermore, activities related to indigenous peoples, such as the establishment of the
mesas regionales, had little supervision from social specialists. Bank staff also did not
follow-up with the establishment of a baseline nor did it address in a timely manner the
deficiencies of the M&E system.
89.    In spite of these initial shortcomings, Bank supervision addressed problems in
implementation as they arose. In particular, supervision was crucial to help the Project
recover from its crisis in 2006 and move the restructuring forward. The Bank took

                                            23
decisive measures, such as considering a potential suspension of disbursements, to ensure
an adequate response to the main issues affecting the Project. The Bank closely
supervised fiduciary issues and followed up closely in cases such as the reimbursement to
the SA from counterpart pre-financing and strengthening of the PCU's fiduciary capacity.
The Bank, with Government support, satisfactorily implemented the Management Action
Plan prepared in response to the IPN investigation. Among other activities, the Bank
reviewed the new legal and institutional framework, helped update Project documents
(such as the IPDP and specific regularization manuals), and conducted regular
supervision missions with the participation of communication, environmental, and social
specialists. During the supervision missions, the Bank team regularly met with
participating communities and actively engaged leading organizations including
OFRANEH.
90.    Overall, although Bank supervision had some initial shortcomings, it
subsequently responded adequately to the challenges encountered. Therefore, Bank
performance during implementation is rated as moderately satisfactory.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     While Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately
unsatisfactory and quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory, outcome of
PDO is rated in the satisfactory range. Thus, overall Bank performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92.     The Government was committed to the reform program, and spent substantial
political capital in ensuring the approval of the Property Law and the establishment of the
IP. During the Project's initial period, strong Government support resulted in fast
progress towards achievement of the PDO. In general, Government support continued
during the life of the Project, although at times it did not provide sufficient counterpart
funds or oversight to the PCU.
93.     Prior to credit effectiveness, the Government provided its own resources to carry
out Project activities under retroactive financing provisions. After effectiveness, the
Government lagged behind in its allocation of counterpart funds, in part due to the
accelerated implementation pace. Once informed that funds from the SA had been used to
pre-finance counterpart allocations, the Government promptly reimbursed the Bank.
During the critical point of the Project, the Government could have done more to mitigate
the political pressure on staffing issues, including the selection of the permanent Project
Coordinator, and to facilitate an agreement on transferring the Project from SGJ to IP.
Nonetheless, the Government acted on the potential suspension of disbursements and


                                            24
applied pressure on the implementing agency and PCU to resolve the pending issues.
After this situation, the Government increasingly demonstrated its renewed commitment
to the Project. Accordingly, Government performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     The Project had two implementing agencies, first SGJ and then IP. SGJ and IP
roles in the Project were limited by the implementation arrangements that focused on a
relatively autonomous PCU, initially in fact, established as a relatively strong, "super"
PCU. Even though SGJ and IP had limited roles, their performance had a negative impact
on the Project. Internal turf issues delayed project restructuring and both allowed political
interference of the Project to go unmitigated. Neither SGJ nor IP made an effort to get the
Project's Council of Governors, one of the key risk mitigation measures identified during
project design, activated in a timely and effective fashion. Finally, IP did not respond
effectively to the regularization activities related to the Project that fall under its direct
responsibility according to the new legal framework, and did not give adequate attention
to the completion of the Property Law's regulations.
95.      The PCU played an important role in project implementation. It had a strong
technical team that developed the technical platforms, supervised international contracts,
and assisted the co-executing agencies in fieldwork, regularization methodologies, and
process reengineering. The SURE and RENOT subsystems even won international
awards. The PCU team also provided substantial assistance to other land administration
initiatives in the country.
96.     In the early stages of implementation, there were issues with non-compliance in
procurement and financial management procedures and weaknesses in M&E. In the
second half of the Project, PCU management took effective actions to comply with
Bank's requirements. These actions included hiring qualified fiduciary experts and
strengthening internal controls. Subsequent procurement reviews did not find any major
issues. Also, the PCU fully supported the Bank in preparing and implementing the action
plan related to the IPN investigation. By Project closing, procurement rating was
moderately satisfactory and financial management was moderately unsatisfactory due to
some pending issues, most of which were addressed soon after the end of the Credit's
grace period.
97.      The PCU had some critical shortcomings in fiduciary compliance, but operations
improved after corrective actions were implemented. Furthermore, the PCU maintained
its strong technical capacity notwithstanding political pressure on staffing and uncertainty
regarding the implementing agency. Nonetheless, given SGJ's and IP's poor
performance, overall implementing agency rating is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

98.   While Government performance is rated moderately satisfactory and
Implementing Agency performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory, outcome of PDO


                                             25
is rated in the satisfactory range. Thus, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately
satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

99.      Support to legal reforms requires a comprehensive risk assessment and
constant monitoring of changes and its implications. It is not always possible to
separate legal reforms from support to land administration programs, particularly in its
early stages. Support to legal reform is, at the same time, inherently risky since it
involves social and political consultation and negotiation processes which make its final
outcome difficult to forecast. As such, if significant changes in the legal framework are
expected during the course of a land administration project, design should anticipate
these changes, bringing upfront the questions about how to deal with potential adverse
situations; an assessment of the legal changes should be conducted promptly after the
approval of new laws, and Project documents should be modified as early as possible to
reflect these changes. Equally, the Bank's limitations in influencing legal processes need
to be recognized. In addition, Project result frameworks should be more modest about
output targets considering that these legal changes could make the regularization
processes more cumbersome.
100. To increase effectiveness, the single agency model for land administration
should focus on the cadastre and registry functions coupled with institutional and
fiscal autonomy. The Honduras experience suggests that adding regularization functions
into a single cadastre-registry agency may decrease its efficacy and efficiency. While
regularization programs are politically sensitive and subject to policy changes,
institutions guarding cadastre and registry information need to maintain a certain degree
of autonomy to protect property rights and upheld the rule of law. Moreover, the
implementation of regularization programs demands additional resources, which may
come at the detriment of cadastre and registry functions if all these activities are financed
from the same general budget.
101. Even though PCUs can make institutionalization more difficult, they
represent a practical solution to achieve efficiency and efficacy in implementation of
complex projects. In particular, it is unrealistic to expect that newly created or weak
institutions can manage simultaneously institutional strengthening and project
implementation. Nonetheless, accountability systems within PCUs should be reinforced
to ensure compliance with Bank and government policies and procedures. Moreover, to
mitigate the risk of creating a parallel structure under the PCU, coordination with co-
executing agencies should be ensured through effective mechanisms.
102. Focusing land regularization activities in priority areas, rather than
undertaking a systematic land regularization process can increase the impact and
sustainability of land administration projects. By definition, systematic processes
include weak, small municipalities and remote, low productivity rural areas where the
expected benefits from these processes can hardly materialize or last. Due to the
existence of increasing area-specific social and environmental risks coupled with the high
cost of regularization activities, a spatially differentiated approach prioritizing areas of



                                             26
high demographic and economic dynamism and high tenure insecurity could result in
increased impact on these areas and a longer sustainability of project outcomes.
103. Strong focus on municipalities is critical to the sustainability of investments
on cadastre and registry modernization. At the general level, it is critical to integrate
land administration within the long-term vision of the municipalities and to make them
active partners in the implementation of the cadastral system. This requires the
development of a clear strategy for decentralization, outlining plans for the establishment
and strengthening of the national cadastre and an agreed definition of institutional roles at
the central and municipal levels. At the local level, attention should be paid to
infrastructure and connectivity issues, municipal staff capacity and continuity
(particularly after election periods).
104. Ensuring broad community support for a Project requires attention to
representativeness and legitimacy of consultation mechanisms. Locally recognized
groups and organizations as well as informal groups and networks can claim to represent
particular stakeholder interests, and often leadership and/or legitimacy of
representativeness are contested. Social assessments should provide sound analysis of the
organizational structure and dynamics of indigenous peoples' organizations and
federations to assess the feasibility and legitimacy of proposed consultation frameworks.
Whenever possible, the consultation framework should rely on existing structures /
organizations.
105. In-house development of technological platforms may provide additional
benefits beyond efficiency and transparency. These benefits may include building of
local capacity which can be readily institutionalized, and flexibility to meet the evolving
needs of the land administration modernization process. At the same time, in house
development requires a strategic IT approach, close monitoring of software development,
and special attention to future operational costs of the platform. Use and/or transition to
open-source software should also be given consideration.
106. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements of land administration projects
need to be considered more carefully during preparation and implementation.
Systematic evaluation of this type of projects is fundamental as the recent body of
research suggests that the impact of property rights reform largely varies depending on
the type of setting. In order to address issues of causality in the evaluations, baseline data
should ideally be collected during the preparation stage and include strategies to account
for counterfactuals. These evaluations should incorporate indicators to measure
household-level behavioral changes as well as changes at the institutional level.
107. Economic analysis of land administration projects needs to be strengthened
through innovative methodologies and better data collection. Thus far, economic
analysis for this type of projects have not managed to capture all possible value-
enhancing effects of surveying activities or the full range of potential benefits from
regularization activities (such as environmental benefits resulting from improved land
management or social benefits resulting from improved tenure security). A feasible first
step to improve the evaluation of regularization activities would be to carry out stratified
land market surveys.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
108. The Borrower, through the IP, concurred with the draft ICR highlighting the
following issues:
   (a) Legal Reforms and Implementation. Borrower considered the approval and
       implementation of folio real in the registration of more than 100,000 parcels a
       major achievement to strengthen the legal certainty of property rights.
   (b) Land Regularization. Borrower regarded the land regularization process in peri-
       urban areas under RINP as a notable example in Latin America, acknowledging
       that its rapid implementation led to initial errors which were subsequently
       resolved. Borrower noted the strengthening of patronatos during this process and
       their institutional standing as permanent members of the IP's Board of Directors.
   (c) Lessons Learned. Borrower highlighted two lessons: (i) ensure that land
       administration projects provide enough resources to establish and maintain the
       connectivity of local governments with central platforms, such in the case of
       municipalities and SURE in Honduras; and (ii) conduct stratified land market
       surveys to contribute to a rigorous evaluation of this type of interventions.
(b) Cofinanciers (Nordic Development Fund)
109. NDF highlighted that project implementation improved significantly after project
restructuring. The co-financer acknowledged the Bank's support in the supervision of
activities financed by their credit, including the technical review of bidding documents
and monitoring of the cadastral services contract. As a lesson learned, the NDF noted the
importance of stronger coordination and harmonization in procurement procedures
between borrower and donor to improve implementation efficiency.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1. Policy Framework and Institutional Strengthening
Estimated: US$7.8 million
Actual:         US$9.7 million
This component was part of a nationwide Government strategy to modernize a
fragmented institutional framework and streamline a massive land registration process,
while increasing accessibility of land services at the local level. The component's main
output was the establishment (through legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms) of a
National Property Administration System (SINAP) which included a National Territorial
Information System (SINIT), its Registry of Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries
System (SURE) operated by selected public and private entities. There were three
subcomponents: (1) policy and regulatory framework, through which the Project was
expected to finance technical assistance to prepare documents such as policies, norms,
and regulatory decrees, as well as the consultation, dissemination, public awareness
activities, and training related to these policy and regulatory changes; (2) development of
technological platforms, through which the Project was expected to finance the
development of SURE, SINIT and RENOT,27 and (3) institutional strengthening, through
which the Project was expected to finance institutional re-engineering of key co-
executing agencies, particularly the Property and Mercantile Registry (RPIM), the
Executive Directorate of the National Cadastre (DEC), and the National Geographic
Institute (ING), which were subsequently subsumed by the IP after approval of the
Property Law. The output indicators under this component are below in Table 1

       As part of Component 1, the Project successfully developed the National System
for Property Administration (SINAP), including the integrated registry system (SURE),

   The Center for Forestry and Information and Statistics (CIEF) and the National System of Municipal Information (SINIMUN),
which were also planned, where not considered relevant once project implementation started as RENOT and SINIT performed similar
functions.

which has resulted in more efficient, effective, and transparent land administration
services in the project area. SURE, as well as other SINAP platforms, was developed in-
house, mainly by a team of local consultants. In 2004, the Bentley Institute awarded
SURE with special recognition under the category of Environmental Management. In
addition, the approval of the new Property Law, which created the IP and established a
new regulatory framework for land regularization, represented a landmark for land
administration in the country.
        The Project achieved and surpassed two of the most important indicators:
connection points and certified technicians. The establishment of 690 connection points
to SINAP has enabled the availability of updated cadastral and registry information. The
Project has certified 1,260 people to operate SURE systems, out of which 860 users were
certified by the Property Institute, 308 technical specialists were certified by the National
Institute for Professional Training (INFOP), and 92 specialists have been certified jointly
by a private firm (FINNMAP), PCU and INFOP. The National Agrarian Institute (INA),
the IP, and municipalities in the project area have all been trained in the use of SINAP.
        An additional outcome under this component is the Wireless Metropolitan
Network (RMI), which has provided an adequate platform for data transmission and
communication in Tegucigalpa and facilitated the implementation of SURE.
Nevertheless, development of SINAP is uneven and no agency can yet operate it in an
integrated matter. Moreover, SURE in folio real is only available in six of the eight
targeted regional registry offices and SINAP is only available in 11 of the 15 target
municipalities.

Component 2. Area-Based Systematic Land Regularization, Titling, and
Registration
Estimated: US$22.7 million
Actual:        US$15.1 million
        This component focused on the massive regularization and registration of land
assets for populations residing in the project area, which covered different types of rural
and urban land and a diverse cross-section of beneficiaries. The activities were supposed
to be implemented along the most economically dynamic corridor in the country
(including the departments of Cortes, Francisco Morazán, Comayagua, and Choluteca);
and more selectively along the Caribbean coast (in the departments of Atlántida, Colón
and Gracias a Dios). The main output was the incorporation of land parcels in the project
area into SINAP under a computerized parcel-based property registry.
        The component had four sub-components: (1) preparatory activities for field
work, consisting of a review of all existing paper and digital data in the official cadastral
and land records of the co-executing agencies, and technical preparatory activities
including new aerial photography and ortho-photos, purchase of equipment and vehicles,
promotion of public campaigns, preparation of local level entities, and financing of
operating costs; (2) delimitation of macro areas, through which the Project was expected
to finance technical services for desk reviews, field delimitation , and the physical
demarcation of macro areas (inter-municipal boundaries, forest areas, protected areas,
and "ethnic lands"); (3) parcel-level surveying and validation , which included systematic
cadastral surveys of urban and rural areas to complement mapping activities, and
financed activities such as the provision of on-the-ground technical and legal assistance


                                             31
to beneficiaries for conflict resolution during the survey process, technical and legal
analysis and comparison of field surveys with existing old registries' information, and
promotion of public campaigns in project areas prior to field survey; (4) legalization,
titling, and registration, which included titling of parcels by INA (rural lands) and
municipalities (urban lands), legalization of forest and public lands, demarcation of
selected protected areas, recognition of indigenous peoples' land rights, and registration
of these into SINAP.
         In 2007, the project restructuring included adjustments to six output indicators
included under Component 2. Although these changes implied a reduction in the level of
impacts, the Bank considered that the PDO was still attainable as it depended on SINAP
being functional (in terms of accuracy, timeliness, cost, sustainability), which could still
be shown with a reduced sample. The following were the six main changes in the output
indicators:
     1) The output indicator for 70 percent of the land parcels in the project area (745,000
         parcels) to be registered in SINAP under the parcel-based system was adjusted to
         208,423 parcels, or 30 percent of the total estimated initially under the project
         area. The adjustment reflects the implementation potential for land regularization
         activities within the new circumstances established by the 2004 Property Law,
         which was not yet approved at appraisal. The new legal framework under the
         Property Law established a clearer definition of folio real as well as added
         requirements for parcel regularization. Hence, the land regularization process
         turned out more complex, lengthy, and costly than initially assumed.
   2) The target for 70 percent of land transactions in the project area to be registered in
      SINAP under folio real was lowered to 40 percent. During appraisal, the total
      amount of potential transactions was overestimated as a result of the lack of a
      good estimate on the total number of registries that needed to be modernized in
      order to achieve this target.
   3) The target for 745,000 parcels in the project area to be surveyed and regularized
      was reduced to 521,500 parcels. During project preparation, the target was set at
      an unrealistic level not taking into account the existing country capacity. In
      addition, the word "regularized" was removed since the "regularization" of
      parcels was already being accounted for in the indicator that measured
      incorporation into SINAP.
   4) The target for 12 protected areas (an approximate area of 230,000 ha) to be
      demarcated and incorporated into SINAP was reduced to 8 protected areas. This
      target was reduced due to new estimates on the complexity of the logistics and
      human resources required to establish the perimeters and set demarcation
      landmarks in the field. However, the most critical area, Pico Bonito National
      Park, was kept under the revised list.
   5) The original output target for 40 municipalities to be demarcated and 2,800 km of
      inter-municipal boundaries to be defined was reduced to 25 municipalities and
      1,352 km. The new target is based on a better understanding of the process and
      logistics required to determine perimeters and boundaries.




                                            32
    6) The original output target for the land of 16 ethnic communities in the project area
       to be demarcated and surveyed by tenure category and for the land of 12 of these
       16 ethnic communities to be titled and registered in SINAP was reduced to 12 and
       8 communities respectively. The new target was based on a better understanding
       of the social and political challenges faced by the process, which included highly
       participatory consultations in a conflictive environment, support to Mesas
       Regionales, management of community expectations and the promotion of
       conflict resolution mechanisms.

       The following are results for each sub-component:
   ·   Sub-component 2.1. Preparatory activities for fieldwork. The project financed
       aerial photography and ortho-photos for the departments of Comayagua,
       Francisco Morazán, and Cortés.
   ·   Sub-component 2.2. Delimitation of macro areas. The project financed the
       delimitation of 25 municipalities (21 of which were in the Department of
       Comayagua), and was working on 5 additional municipalities in Francisco
       Morazán at the moment of Credit closing. In addition, the Project surpassed its
       goal of surveying 12,000 parcels in forested areas, located in the Departments of
       Francisco Morazán, Comayagua, and Cortés. Due to delays in project
       implementation, the Project only completed the demarcation of 2 protected areas
       (Lancetilla Research Center and San Fernando de Omoa National Monument),
       both of which have approved management plans; however, six additional
       protected areas, including Pico Bonito National Park, were delimited and will be
       demarcated in the near future by the ICF with funding from the European Union.
   ·   Sub-component 2.3. Parcel-level surveying and validation. The project carried
       out systematic cadastral field surveys in the Department of Comayagua, as well as
       in 138 neighborhoods in Cortés and Tegucigalpa, facilitated by the new
       regularization option in the Property Law (RINP). A total of 364,238 land parcels
       were surveyed under the Project, and approximately 101,000 parcels were
       registered in SURE under folio real.
   ·   Sub-component 2.4. Legalization, titling, and registration. As a result of a new
       regularization option included in the Property Law, the Project has contributed to
       solving the tenure situation of almost 75,000, mainly poor families living in
       informal peri-urban areas of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. In addition, 40,237
       new property titles have been generated throughout the life of the Project. The
       pilot effort to demarcate and title the land of selected Garífuna and Miskito

        detailed diagnostic of the tenure situation of the seven participating Garífuna
        communities was carried out, and the land of 20 Miskito communities was
        delimited under the Project, and the titling process for this land was underway at
        the time of this evaluation.

Component 3. Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation
Estimated: US$5.3 million
Actual:       US$8.8 million
       This component covers the administration costs of the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) and the activities related to monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The Project
financed the provision of technical assistance, equipment, training, workshops and
incremental operating costs, as necessary, to operate and strengthen the PCU and to
monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Project.

       The main sources M&E data throughout the Project were: evaluation reports
generated by the PCU, the IP and other co-implementing entities, reports generated by
SURE, field visit reports, reports from user surveys, and beneficiary studies. However,
the Project's M&E system had some initial weaknesses, including the lack of proper
baseline indicators and realistic target values. In addition, there was no baseline and
control group to measure Project impacts on beneficiaries, municipalities, or land
markets.

                               Gross Benefits:   US$ 19.0 Million
                               Project Costs:    US$ 17.8 Million
                               Net Benefits:     US$     1.2 Million
                                     ERR28:               12.42%

        An ex-post economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic efficiency
of the Project, using actual project outputs and costs, and comparing the economic
feasibility indicators (i.e., NPV and ERR) to those obtained at appraisal. The ex-post
analysis applied the same methodology and assumptions used for the ex-ante analysis
with some minor exceptions that are detailed below. Costs included direct expenditures in
the regularization process and development of technological platforms. Economic
benefits considered the expected increases in property value from a sense of enhanced
security of tenure due to titling. The analysis uses data from the 2004 Living Standards
Measurement Survey (ENCOVI) to estimate these increases in property values. At
appraisal, NPV of net benefits was US$105.9 million with an ERR of 44 percent. At
completion, the NPV of net benefits is estimated at US$1.2 million with an ERR of 12.42
percent. The economic feasibility indicators at completion are significantly lower than
those at appraisal. While ex-post indicators were expected to be weaker than those of the
ex-ante analysis, as a result of lower than expected project outputs, the magnitude of this
difference is largely due to the assumption at appraisal that all properties that were
surveyed and regularized would gain value.
        Under an alternative scenario that also takes into account incremental economic
benefits from income generating investments accruing during the period of the analysis,
the NPV of net benefits was estimated at US$ 8.5 million with an ERR of 15.6 percent.

Costs

        Since the ex-ante analysis considered only the costs directly associated with land
regularization and the functioning of the land administration system, only the costs for
components one and two were considered for the ex-post analysis. The ex-ante analysis
yielded an NPV of costs of US$24.79 million over the Project's four-year projected
implementation period, while the ex-post analysis yielded an NPV of costs of US$17.8
million. The difference is largely due to the longer implementation period of 7 years.

Economic Benefits

       The methodology assumes that direct economic benefits are obtained from the
increased value of properties attributable to the enhanced sense of tenure security
provided by the possession of a clear property title. The ex-ante analysis, which used a
2003 dataset prepared by the Center for Design, Architecture and Construction

(CEDAC), compared the values of titled and untitled properties disaggregated by type of
location (urban and rural). An Ordinary Least Squares regression was used to partial-out
the effects of having a property title from other factors that can have an effect on land
values. The ex-post analysis applied the same methodology. The most up-to-date data
source available for the analysis was the 2004 ENCOVI household survey undertaken by
the National Statistical Institute. From this source, only data from the specific
municipalities covered by the Project were used to estimate the likely increase in property
value due to titling.

Urban housing properties

        For urban areas, the data-set was divided into two cohorts according to value;
properties with land values less than L 260,000 (US$13,760), which accounted for about
70 percent of the sample, and properties with land values between L 260,000 - 1,500,000
(US$13,760 - US$79,386), which accounted for the balance. This division is comparable
to the cohorts used in the ex-ante analysis.29 The additional explanatory variables
included in the regression analysis were: construction size, number of rooms, and access
to services (landline phone and public lighting).

   The two cohorts identified in the CEDAC dataset were properties with a value up to L 200,000 (US$11,111), which accounted for
75 percent of the sample, and properties with values from L 200,000-500,000 (US$11,111-US$27,778), which accounted for 25
percent of the sample.

       From the econometric analysis it could be concluded that the likely increase in
value due titling is of L 13,201.59 (US$698.68) for properties valued at less than L.
260,000. This is equivalent to 13 percent of L 102,449 (US$5,421.98), the average
property value for this cohort, which compares to the premium of 20 percent estimated at
appraisal.

      For properties between L. 260,000 and L. 1,500,000, the model yielded a likely
premium for titling of L 33,870 (US$1,792.57). This premium is equivalent to 6.6 percent
of L 513,737.16 (US$27,188.00), the average property value for this cohort, which
compares to the premium of 7.5 percent estimated at appraisal.

      A single premium of US$1,026.85 for land titling in urban areas was estimated by
computing a weighted average for the likely incremental value of both cohorts.

        The value of rural properties was recorded by a unit of area, manzana, in the
ENCOVI sample.30 For this reason, the sample was not divided into cohorts, as done in
the ex-ante analysis. The explanatory variables used in the regression analysis were:
having or not a deed registered in the Public Registry, improvements on the land, and
presence of permanent crops. Dummy variables were also used to indicate the
Departments where properties were located to account for regional differences in land
prices. The model yielded an estimated increase in value due to titling of L 10,894.98
(US$576.60) per manzana.

Urban and rural properties with new titles

        Between 2004 and 2010, the Project assisted with the titling of 71,307 urban
properties and 6,168 rural properties (equivalent to 5,170 manzanas). At the time of ICR
preparation only 31,587 of urban properties had received titles. The remaining 39,720
properties in urban areas were already measured, and were to receive title upon
completion of payments to the regularization trust fund. The ex-post analysis assumes
that all properties in this category incorporated the benefits of the premium. There are
two justifications for this assumption. First, the marketability of these lands has already
improved, as the provision of a title is certain upon completion of the outstanding
payments. Hence, in the event of a sale, the buyer could obtain the property title by
paying the balance of the debt to the trust fund31. Second, since the landowner has
certainty of tenure, it is likely that he or she will respond to the same investment
incentives as landowners with title.
        Incremental Project benefits were estimated by applying the expected premium to
the number of new titles awarded in urban and rural areas. This approach is different,
though more realistic, than the ex-ante methodology that applied the premium to all
properties expected to be surveyed and regularized. As a result the total benefits in the ex-
post analysis, at US$76.2 million, are significantly lower than the US$523.4 million
estimated at appraisal.

30
     Manzana is a common unit to measure land in rural areas; 1 manzana is equivalent to 0.698896 hectares.
31
  This is analogous when a property with a lien is held by a commercial bank and the full title is provided until the mortgage is paid in
full. Normally a landholder in this situation is not inhibited to invest in the property, nor the marketability of the property is affected.



                                                                    39
Net Present Value of Benefits and Costs and Sensitivity Analysis

        In the base scenario of the ex-post analysis, as in the ex-ante analysis, direct
benefits from land price increases are assumed to accrue as an annuity over the course of
twenty years at a zero percent interest rate. The benefits of titling are expected to start
accruing on the fifth year of the Project. The analysis assumed that the opportunity cost
of capital is 11.5 percent. Under these assumptions, the NPV for the Project's net benefits
is US$1.2 million, and the ERR is 12.42 percent. The economic efficiency indicators
although positive are not robust enough to withstand a significant reduction in economic
benefits. For instance, a reduction in benefits of 50 percent yields a negative NPV of
US$8.3 million and an ERR of 3.93 percent.

Discussion of Results

        The ex-post economic analysis shows that investments associated with land
regularization and the functioning of the land administration system provided a
reasonable economic return for Honduran society as a whole. Notwithstanding, the
economic feasibility indicators were significantly lower than those estimated at appraisal
(NPV of US$105.9 million and ERR of 44 percent). This is partly due to the fact that
lower regularization and titling targets were achieved, while actual costs remained
comparable to those projected. As regularization turned-out to be more complex, and
lengthier than expected, mainly due to procedures prescribed in the Property Law that
were unknown at the time of appraisal, the efficiency ratio between benefits and costs
weakened. The fact that costs did not decrease proportionally with the decrease in target
achievement levels, resulted in higher unit costs, and as a result the Project had to be
restructured in 2007 to adjust down the target indicators for land regularization.
        At appraisal the target for surveying and regularization was set at 521,500 from a
universe of 745,000 parcels. The regularization process included incorporating the legal

                                                        40
and geographic information of these properties into SURE under folio real. It was
expected that some of the properties surveyed already had freehold titles; for this type of
properties the regularization process was limited to updating the information and
modifying the format of the land record from deed-based to folio real. New titles could
also be issued as a result of regularization, if the property was eligible for adjudication.
At appraisal, however, the proportions of properties already titled and eligible for new
titling were unknown.
         For calculation of benefits, the ex-ante analysis assumed that the Project was
going to have value-enhancing effects on all 521,500 properties regardless of their land
tenure baseline situation. This premium was calculated as the difference in value between
titled and untitled properties. As a result, the ex-ante analysis could have significantly
overestimated the economic benefits of the Project, given that it applied the titling
premium to all properties regardless of whether they already had a title (i.e. enhanced
tenure security) or were eligible to receive one.
         The ex-post analysis corrects for this initial imprecision by applying the premium
only to those properties that received new titles. As a result, only 77,475 properties,
which is 21 percent of the properties surveyed and 37.5 percent of the properties
registered in SURE under folio real, were taken into account for estimating the economic
benefits.32

        On the other hand, the analysis does not take into account all possible value-
enhancing effects. For example, it may be reasonable to assume that surveying activities
might lead to an increase in the marketability of lands and investment incentives in
situations where the cadastre assisted in the resolution of conflicts and clarification of
boundaries. The ex-post analysis did not attempt to account for these benefits due to the
lack of data to estimate the price differentials between surveyed and non-surveyed
properties.
        In addition, the ex-ante analysis assumed that the benefits of land regularization
accrued over twenty years at a zero percent interest rate. This assumption presumes that
investments by landowners would not generate any other economic benefits during the
period of analysis, than the increased land value due to enhanced security of tenure.
During the course of implementation there was no systematic monitoring of post-titling
investments and returns to investments. Therefore, the assumption of such a lengthy lag
in the internalization of benefits remained unchecked. It could be argued and deemed
reasonable to assume that due to information campaigns during project implementation
that beneficiaries internalized the benefits of land titling without delay and started
capitalizing on the enhanced tenure status by generating new investments that would
yield additional economic benefits within the twenty-year period of analysis. Under an
alternative scenario that takes into account incremental economic benefits from titling,
other than increased land value, accruing during the period of the analysis, the NPV of
net benefits was estimated at US$ 8.5 million with an ERR of 15.6 percent.33
32
   The Project surveyed 364,238 properties in rural and urban areas. Approximately 100,000 properties are registered in SURE under
folio real. The 39,720 urban properties that had been surveyed and expecting title have already been incorporated into SURE but do
not count as folio real because legal ownership cannot be guaranteed until final payment is done. Therefore, the percentage of 37.5 is
calculated from the 31,587 urban and 6,168 rural properties that already have freehold title.
33
   The annual payments are obtained from an annuity formula assuming payments are due at the end of the period, a present value
equal to the total value of benefits, a future value equal to zero, and interest rate of 11.5 percent.



                                                                  41
Conclusion

         The economic analysis provides indications of positive, albeit modest, economic
efficiency in the investments supporting land regularization and the functioning of the
land administration system. This outcome is relevant considering that the Project
achieved lower outputs than originally expected. A main lesson learned is that stratified
land market survey data is needed to appropriately evaluate the effect of regularization
activities. Phase II is expected to incorporate this lesson into the design of the M&E
system.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

       This report presents the results of an independent evaluation carried out to assess
the impact of land titling for beneficiaries of the Public Need-based Property
Regularization process (RINP). In order to complete the evaluation, the Project's
Monitoring and Evaluation Unit supplied all the necessary information for the sample to
be surveyed, which included 4 colonies that benefitted from the regularization program.
A total of 323 surveys were distributed to households in the following neighborhoods:
Flor del Campo and Nueva Danli in Tegucigalpa, and Matamoros and 24 de Abril No. 1
in San Pedro Sula. The results from these surveys provide information on the
beneficiaries' socioeconomic situation, housing, availability of basic services, and
community development. The following are the main findings of the evaluation:
    · 90% of the surveyed property owners consider that obtaining a title reduced
       conflicts with others claiming to be the rightful owners.
      ·   100% of the surveyed property owners consider that the value of their property
          increased as a result of the regularization program.
      ·   96% of the surveyed property owners consider that the Patronato (local
          neighborhood association) and the Local Water Board are important in their

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

        The Project conducted stakeholder workshops and a short survey to learn more
about the effects of land regularization. The workshops were conducted in: (i) peri-urban
neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula where squatters had obtained titles
through RINP; and (ii) a neighborhood near Comayagua where legal possessors had
obtained full title from the municipality. Former squatters in peri-urban areas identified
more Project-induced benefits than the latter group. Lawyer notaries and municipal
cadastre technicians mentioned in a separate workshop that they are overall satisfied with
the Project-sponsored activities and outcomes.
        The workshops were conducted on May 25 and 27, and June 22, 2010. The
workshops were attended by residents, members of patronatos, and members of other
neighborhood associations such as the water board (juntas de agua). A total of 90 people
attended the workshops with an average of 22 participants each.

Results from the Workshops in Peri-Urban Areas

        The peri-urban settlements of Flor de Campo and San Francisco in Tegucigalpa
and 10 de Enero and Brisas del Valle in Cofradía (department of Cortés) were selected to
conduct the focus groups with Project beneficiaries.35 These settlements have similar
characteristics: they were established illegally between 1970s and 1980s in hilly areas
near major urban centers. The population of these settlements had organized in legally-
recognized neighborhood associations called patronatos to defend their occupation and
request the municipality for services. In the case of the two settlements in Tegucigalpa,
the ownership of the land has been contested by various parties, including the
municipality. This situation created major uncertainty over landownership, and
throughout the years multiple parties had approached the squatters to request payment or
rent over the plots. In some cases, some squatters were evicted losing the investments
they had made on the properties. In the case of Brisas del Valle in Cofradía, the National
Agrarian Institute (INA) had already issued a communal title, which provided greater
tenure security than in the two settlements in Tegucigalpa.
        After the approval of the Property Law, the patronatos of these four settlements
partnered with the Project to conduct the regularization. They directly participated in the
communication campaigns, surveying, and land regularization panels. At the time of the
workshops were conducted, most of the residents were in the process of paying their debt
in order obtain their titles. Next, the main findings are discussed.

Economic Benefits

       The Project was expected to bring economic benefits in the form of expanded
access to collateral-based credit, increase in real estate value, and increase labor supply.
With respect to credit, less than a third of participants mentioned to be interested in
obtaining collateral-based loan. In Tegucigalpa, some participants that had tried to obtain

loans mentioned that the commercial banks did not accept their titles. Instead, smaller
financial institutions, such as credit unions, were more willing to accept the titles as
collateral. In Cofradía, some commercial banks accepted the titles as collateral while
others did not. These observations show that the assumption that banks would be willing
to accept the titles of former informal settlements as forms of collateral do not always
hold. This situation shows the need to inform financial institutions about the
regularization process and the legality of the titles. Nonetheless, the majority of the
participants mentioned that they were in a precarious financial situation and did not wish
to risk losing their properties by using them as collateral.
         Some labor supplies effects were identified in the workshops. In Tegucigalpa,
participants mentioned that the title increased their access to formal employment, because
employers consider it as a positive reference. In Cofradía, two respondents mentioned
that the title allowed them to obtain a loan to invest in their family enterprise, thus
contributing to self-employment.
         There was consensus in the workshops that titling increased the property values.
The estimated increase is of 2 to 3 times the value of property in Tegucigalpa and 6.25
times in Cofradía. Participants, however, recognized that the increase in land values was
heterogenous and depended on the location of the plots, as some of them had limitations
for construction. Also, some participants mentioned a profit from the first sale after
obtaining the title given that the prices paid through the trust fund were lower than the
prevailing market prices. Participants also identified benefits in the land rental market as
transactions with a rental value larger than Lps. 2,000 per month have to be formally
registered in a contract.

Human Capital

        Land titling was expected to reduce land-related conflicts and improve the
knowledge of the general population about their rights and land administration services.
In Tegucigalpa, participants recognized that now they experienced greater peace of mind
because they are no longer bothered by the alleged landowners who threatened them with
eviction or collected payments. They also recognized that the regularization process
solved many of the conflicts that existed between neighbors. Participants in Cofradía
mentioned that they did not have conflicts with external parties because they already had
a communal title, but that the regularization process did contribute to conflict resolution
among the neighbors.
        Participants in Cofradía seemed to be better informed about regularization
procedures and land administration services than participants in Tegucigalpa. Some
people in Tegucigalpa seemed to still have questions about the mechanisms of the trust
fund and the titles that the IP was going to issue. These questions were more prominent
among people who had just recently moved into the neighborhoods (e.g. children of title
holders and returning migrants). These results show that the IP needs to continue with the
communication campaigns to offer information and clarify doubts about the trust fund
and other services.

         The Project should have contributed to the strengthening of the patronatos and
improvement of their capacity to promote and manage initiatives in their communities.
Participants in Tegucigalpa mentioned that internal divisions had discredited the
patronatos, but that the regularization process helped them regain their credibility
because they were able to show results. Nevertheless, participants also mentioned that
some residents regard the patronatos as less relevant now that they have obtained their
titles and they have stopped contributing their fees or reporting land transactions. One
perspective is that patronatos have not developed an agenda apart from land
regularization and thus run the risk of become obsolete if they do not evolve. A similar
situation occurred in one of the settlements in Cofradía where the patronato lost the
revenue it generated from issuing occupation certificates. This type of document is now
issued directly by the IP. On the other hand, participants mentioned that other
neighborhood associations and cooperatives are stepping in to manage development
initiatives.
         This situation highlights the need of patronatos and other neighborhood
associations to start thinking about broader issues of land use planning not only to
maintain their relevance but also to improve the life in their communities. There is
anecdotal evidence that with the increase of property values there is a shortage in the
number of plots available for recreational activities. Participants recognized the
importance of continuing to enjoy access to places to conduct social activities, such as
soccer fields.

Land Access

        The formalization of property rights was expected to facilitate land transactions
thus facilitating access of this asset to those who needed it. In fact, many participants in
Tegucigalpa and Cofradía mentioned that one of the main benefits of the regularization
process was the opportunity to subdivide their plots to provide their children with access
to land. In some cases, parents transfer ownership of the entire property to their children.

Mitigation of Natural Disasters

         Land regularization was expected to contribute to mitigation of natural disasters
by improved land use planning. The Project did not provide titles to people who lived in
areas vulnerable to natural disasters as this is against the Property Law. Participants
mentioned that residents of these areas are pressuring the authorities to provide them with
titles, as they consider that the land zoning does not accurately reflect the vulnerability.

Proceedings from the Workshop in a Rural Setting

        An additional workshop was conducted in the settlement of Barrio Guadalupe in
Comayagua to understand Project effects in a more rural setting. In this community, the
Project provided full titles (dominio pleno) to people who were in legal possession of
their housing plots. The process was systematic and free of charge. Participants clarified
that the level of land tenure insecurity was low prior to the Project because they already
had legal possession to their land.



                                            52
         Participants mentioned that titling has not increased their demand for credit, but
that they believed that the banks would accept their land as collateral. If they ask for a
loan, it would be to invest in non-agricultural activities as they perceive agriculture as too
risky. They also mentioned that property values increased approximately 20 percent, but
that this increase reflects the legal costs (notary and lawyer fees) required to register the
conveyance as freehold title.
         Titling did not have an effect on home improvements either. The participants,
however, mentioned that some residents have invested in fences to clarify the perimeter
of their properties. Also, they do not perceive that the Project had any effect on the social
organization or the level of awareness of land administration services in the community
         On the other hand, participants recognized that full titles are a source of peace
(capital tranquilidad), particularly for women who live by themselves. Also, respondents
mentioned that the Project allow them to transfer part of their land to their children.
Overall, the participants recognized as excellent the services offered by the Project.

        A workshop was held with lawyer notaries and staff of municipal cadastral offices
to learn about their perception of the Project. Since the approval of the Property Law in
2004, the PCU has conducted dissemination and training activities with these two types
of users. The participants indicated that the training provided on SURE was useful, but
that this type of activity needs to be recurrent throughout the year to solidify knowledge
and incorporate new participants (for example, law students). The majority of participants
also agreed that SURE is user friendly and secure, but they complained that the
connection sometimes is down causing delays. They also concurred that the service
attention provided by staff in the property registry offices has improved, but they noted
that some of the equipment is obsolete and continues to cause delays in certain
transactions. The cadastre office in the municipality of Comayagua mentioned that
property tax collection has increased twofold since they started to receive updated
information                generated               by             the               Project.

Context, Development Objectives, and Project Design

The World Bank-financed Rural Land Management Project (PAAR) developed
methodologies that facilitated the preparation of the Honduras Land Administration
Project (PATH). At the time of appraisal, the property registry was under the Judiciary
whereas the cadastre was under the Ministry of Interior making the establishment of an
integrated land administration system challenging. The President of the Supreme Court
and the Minister of Interior had the political vision to enter into an agreement to create
the Integrated Registry and Cadastre System (SINREC). This agreement became the first
step in the modernization of the registry. The process culminated with the enactment of
the Property Law in 2004 and the subsequent establishment of the Property Institute. The
Project contributed to the modernization of the sector from the onset of these reform
efforts.

Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The Project faced a series of factors that made implementation challenging. Some of
these factors include:
Factors within the Government's control:
x Delays in the allocation of counterpart funds due to a lack of adequate budgeting.
x The launch of the new Financial Management System (SIAFI) operated by the
   Ministry of Finance, which delayed transactions and payments as many providers
   were not aware of the new requirements.
x Absence of regulations to the Property Law which made the implementation of certain
   provisions in the law challenging.
x Delay in the effectiveness of the restructuring caused in part by the turf battle among
   the institutions involved with the Project.
x Weakening of the PCU due to the lack of job security for its staff.

Factors outside the Government's control:
· The Political Crisis. Since June 28, 2009 a political crisis affected the
   implementation of donor-funded projects.
· Government Transitions. Delayed the selection of the Project Coordinator.
· Inspection Panel. OFRANEH submitted a request for investigation to the World
   Bank's Inspection Panel in 2006. In March 2006, the World Bank's Board of
   Executive Directors approved the investigation related to the Project activities in
   Garifuna communities. Project staff assisted the World Bank in the preparation of an
   Action Plan which was subsequently endorsed by this institution's Board of
   Executive Directors and implemented during the course of twelve months in
   collaboration with the Government.
· Investigation by the Department of Institutional Integrity. Started in January 2006
   and focused on procurement processes that took place between 2004 and 2005 when
   the Project was implemented by the three-project PCU. The investigation affected the


                                           54
    Project's image and resulted in the cancellation of SDR 461,428.86 from the credit
    proceeds used to finance these procedures. When the results of the investigation came
    out in 2008, corrective and preventive actions had already been taken to improve the
    management and transparency of procurement processes.

Lessons Learned

·   Including the broad range of institutions involved in the land sector can foster
    sustainability of Project's achievements through institutional development, capacity
    building, and improved operational effectiveness.
·   Municipalities should develop revenue-generating strategies to cover the costs of
    establishing and maintaining connectivity to SURE and related operations.
·   Municipalities with access to SURE can update their cadastral information and
    consequently improve their tax-revenue collection efforts.
·   Systematic cadastral surveying and registry modernization should be conducted in
    parallel to ensure integrity in the process; institutions in charge of regularization
    activities should lead these efforts with the assistance of project units.
·   Communication campaigns and direct assistance to beneficiaries are crucial in
    regularization activities to ensure broad and informed participation.
