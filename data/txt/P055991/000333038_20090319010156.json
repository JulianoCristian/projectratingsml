This system should increase land tenure\n            security, facilitate land market transactions, develop\n            national and municipal territorial plans, and develop\n            management plans for protected areas, forests, and\n            indigenous peoples lands. Taking into account the context of\n            the country's Agrarian Reform Law, Environmental Law,\n            Cultural Heritage Protection Law, Territorial Land Tenure\n            Law, and international norms, this Indigenous Peoples Plan\n            (IPP), seeks to ensure that indigenous and ethnic groups\n            living within the project area, are informed, meaningfully\n            consulted, and mobilized to participate, and share the\n            economic benefits of the project. The participatory process\n            with local communities has established three levels as\n            grievance mechanisms towards conflict resolution - should it\n            occur - on issues regarding land tenure and transactions,\n            and municipal territorial plans: a) at the national level,\n            the National Indigenous Roundtable shall conduct an open\n            dialogue, by which indigenous and ethnic groups, landowners,\n            and government officials as permanent members, and in the\n            presence of project staff, shall conform to a broad\n            resolution; b) the relevant Council for Departmental\n            Development (one Council per each eighteen departments in\n            the country) will act as the regulatory authority overseeing\n            the appropriate enforcement of the Territorial Land Tenure\n            Law, who shall arbitrate should conflict occur at the local\n            level; and, c) local ethnic community-based organizations\n            shall resolve conflicts at the communal levels."}, "docdt": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
