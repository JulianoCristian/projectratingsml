Specifically among the complaints, the\n            Requestors note that the project is supposed to provide for\n            ancestral lands to be regularized in favor of indigenous and\n            Afro-Honduran populations by recognizing communal or\n            individual land rights, based on the preference of each\n            community, and by registering such rights in the land\n            registry. However, the Requesters fear that the land titling\n            and procedures provided will ultimately cause the demise of\n            collective property in favor of individual property, which\n            is contrary to the land tenure system they prefer, and could\n            give their land, which they consider as their functional\n            habitat, to people outside the Garifuna communities.\n            Furthermore the Requestors assert that Bank staff did not\n            consult with affected people prior to preparing the\n            Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP); that they made a\n            draft property law to which they are firmly opposed the\n            centerpiece of the land titling program, and this law\n            provides for a land titling and conflicts resolution\n            procedure that is different from the one outlined in the\n            project documents; the conflict resolution method in the\n            IPDP-arbitration -- not only is unconstitutional but\n            different from the one provided for in the property law; the\n            applicable procedures for indigenous peoples to file\n            territorial claims is confusing; and the environmental\n            analysis does not provide for the Garifuna people to manage\n            or co-manage their land to restore their control over the\n            functional habitat they preserved for centuries. In response\n            to these complaints, Bank Management focuses on four points:\n            1) When activities are implemented, appropriate safeguards\n            are built into the project to protect indigenous\n            people's lands. 2) Community participation in the\n            project is voluntary and broad participatory mechanisms are\n            operational. 3) The project complies with national\n            legislation as well as with Bank policies. 4) Management has\n            responded to the Requestor's concerns and \"remains\n            committed to ongoing meaningful consultations that include\n            Garifuna stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2006-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
