The system will help increase land\n            tenure security, facilitate land market transactions,\n            develop national and municipal territorial plans, and\n            develop management plans for protected areas, forests, and\n            indigenous peoples lands. The main objective of the first\n            component shall be the establishment of a National Property\n            Administration System (SINAP), through strengthened legal,\n            regulatory, and institutional frameworks. SINAP will include\n            a National Territorial Information System (SINIT), a\n            Registry of Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries System\n            (SURE), which will be operated by public and private\n            entities. Activities under the second component will benefit\n            local populations, through massive regularization and\n            registration of an essential asset: land. The project aims\n            to cover different types of rural and urban land, and a\n            diverse cross-section of Honduran society, including the\n            rich and the poor, men and women, ladino, indigenous, and\n            Afro-Honduran. The main output will be to incorporate land\n            parcels within the project area into SINAP, while the\n            project will finance pre-field work, such as aerial\n            photography, field surveying of macro boundaries such as\n            inter-municipal boundaries, parcel-level surveying and\n            validation, conflict resolution, titling, and mass\n            registration into SINAP. Finally, the third component covers\n            the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) administration costs,\n            specifically to implement monitoring and evaluation activities."}, "docdt": "2004-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
