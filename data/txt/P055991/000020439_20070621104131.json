Of particular relevance\n            to the request, one of the Project components provides for\n            systematic land regularization, titling and registration of\n            lands, including municipal lands, urban and rural areas,\n            forests, protected areas and ethnic lands. The requesters\n            claim that in the design, appraisal and implementation of\n            the Project the Bank did not take the rights and interests\n            of the Garifuna people into consideration and, as a result,\n            violated its own policies and procedures. The requesters\n            fear that as a result of these failures, the land titling\n            and procedures under the Project will ultimately cause the\n            loss of their rights over parts of their Ethnic Lands, and\n            the demise of collective property held by Garifuna\n            communities in favor of individual property. However, the\n            panel finds that the Project may have consequences far\n            different than intended by the Indigenous Peoples\n            Development Plan. The Panel finds merit in the concerns of\n            Requesters that the Project may contribute to the demise of\n            titles and claims to collective lands held by the Garifuna\n            and indigenous peoples. Given the relative economic and\n            political vulnerability of the indigenous peoples, the Panel\n            finds that the safeguards provided under the Project are not\n            adequate to protect the Garifuna rights over their Ethnic\n            Lands in the context of Project implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
