                                      About the Panel

The Inspection Panel was created in September 1993 by the Board of Executive Directors of
the World Bank to serve as an independent mechanism to ensure accountability in Bank
operations with respect to its policies and procedures. The Inspection Panel is an instrument
for groups of two or more private citizens who believe that they or their interests have been
or could be harmed by Bank-financed activities to present their concerns through a Request
for Inspection. In short, the Panel provides a link between the Bank and the people who are
likely to be affected by the projects it finances.


Members of the Panel are selected "on the basis of their ability to deal thoroughly and fairly
with the request brought to them, their integrity and their independence from the Bank's
Management, and their exposure to developmental issues and to living conditions in
developing countries."1 The three-member Panel is empowered, subject to Board approval,
to investigate problems that are alleged to have arisen as a result of the Bank having
ignored its own operating policies and procedures.

Processing Requests

After the Panel receives a Request for Inspection it is processed as follows:

· The Panel decides whether the Request is prima facie not barred from Panel
    consideration.
· The Panel registers the Request--a purely administrative procedure.
· The Panel sends the Request to Bank Management, which has 21 working days to
    respond to the allegations of the Requesters.
· The Panel then conducts a short 21 working-day assessment to determine the eligibility
    of the Requesters and the Request.
· If the Panel recommends an investigation, and the Board approves it, the Panel
    undertakes a full investigation, which is not time-bound.
· If the Panel does not recommend an investigation, the Board of Executive Directors may
    still instruct the Panel to conduct an investigation if warranted.
· Three days after the Board decides on whether or not an investigation should be carried
    out, the Panel's Report (including the Request for Inspection and Management's
    Response) is publicly available through the Panel's website and Secretariat, the Bank's
    Info Shop and the respective Bank Country Office.

                                                 ii

· When the Panel completes an investigation, it sends its findings and conclusions on the
  matters alleged in the Request for Inspection to the Board as well as to Bank
  Management.
· The Bank Management then has six weeks to submit its recommendations to the Board
  on what actions the Bank would take in response to the Panel's findings and
  conclusions.
· The Board then takes the final decision on what should be done based on the Panel's
  findings and the Bank Management's recommendations.
· Three days after the Board's decision, the Panel's Report and Management's
  Recommendation are publicly available through the Panel's website and Secretariat, the
  Bank's Project website, the Bank's Info Shop and the respective Bank Country Office.

                                      Executive Summary

                                           Introduction

On January 3, 2006, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection related to the
Honduras: Land Administration Project ("the Project" ­ in Spanish Programa de
Administración de Tierras de Honduras, PATH).2 The Request alleges that the Bank has
violated several Bank policies, and that as a result the Project will lead to significant
harms to the Garífuna people in Honduras and their claims to their ancestral lands.3

The Project is financed by an IDA Credit of 16,900,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR),
about USD 25 million. The Credit was approved by the IDA Board of Executive
Directors on February 24, 2004, and became effective on December 2, 2004. The closing
date is April 30, 2008. The Project was developed to facilitate implementation of the
Government reform strategy to address insecurity of land tenure throughout the country,
through establishment and operation of an integrated decentralized land administration
system as part of a broader reform program.

Of particular relevance to the Request, one of the Project components provides for
systematic land regularization, titling and registration of lands, including municipal lands,
urban and rural areas, forests, protected areas and Ethnic Lands. According to the PAD,
Ethnic Lands are to be surveyed, regularized, titled and registered in the departments of
Atlántida, Colon and Gracias a Dios. These areas have been given priority because of
their high concentration of settlements of people of ethnic origin, and are home to many
Garífuna communities.

                The Requesters and the Substance of their Claims

The Organización Fraternal Negra Honduras (OFRANEH) submitted the Request on
behalf of the indigenous Garífuna population of Honduras. OFRANEH states that it is a
federation whose members are elected every three years by the Garífuna communities as
their representatives.

The Requesters claim that in the design, appraisal and implementation of the Project the
Bank did not take the rights and interests of the Garífuna people into consideration and,
as a result, violated its own policies and procedures. More specifically, the Requesters
claim that the Bank violated OD 4.20 on Indigenous People, OP/BP 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats.




2In this Report the Spanish acronym PATH will also be used to indicate the Project.
3The Requesters do not contest application of the Project to areas in other parts of Honduras away from
lands occupied or claimed by the Garífuna people.


                                                   ix

                               Land Rights and Collective Title

The Requesters fear that as a result of these failures, the land titling and procedures under
the Project will ultimately cause the loss of their rights over parts of their Ethnic Lands,
and the demise of collective property held by Garífuna communities in favor of
individual property.4 This is contrary to their preferred land tenure and would, they
contend, cause them serious harms and endanger their culture and survival. According to
the Requesters, the Project does not reflect the special legal situation of the Garífuna
people.

                         Consultation, Representation and Disclosure

A major claim of the Request is that the Project has failed properly to consult with and
identify the needs and interests of the affected communities, and has failed to consult
adequately with people who are the legitimate representatives of the affected
communities. The Requesters claim that this failure occurred both in the preparation and
implementation of the Project and express concerns about the consequences of certain
provisions of Honduras' new Property Law.

The Requesters particularly object to the establishment of the Mesa Regional, a
"consultation board" created under the PATH. They state that the Mesa Regional is an
institution not recognized by OFRANEH because it "has been created in spite of the
disagreement of the communities, was not elected by the communities, [and] is not an
organization that represents them." The Requesters believe that the Mesa is composed of
people who cannot be considered Garífuna representatives and that it is alien to their own
institutions

              Indigenous Peoples Development Planand Legal Framework

The Requesters allege that the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) for the
Project fails to meet Bank policies. They claim that the conflict resolution method
provided for in the IPDP, arbitration, not only is unconstitutional but is also different
from the one called for in the new Property Law promulgated a few months after
approval of the IDA Credit. They add that neither set of procedures responds to their
social and political reality.

The Requesters claim that, in preparing the IPDP, the Bank failed to consider adequately
the legal status of the indigenous populations as well as the procedures to issue legal titles
to land. They also claim that the Project failed adequately to address the serious concerns
of communities about the potential impact of the new Property Law, and its relationship
to procedures and actions under the Project.



4 The Request presents an overview of the history of the Garífuna people, which the Requesters believe is
important to understand the magnitude of the damage that the Project implementation may cause to them.

                            Environment and Natural Habitat

According to the Request, the Bank did not comply with OP 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment (EA) because, although the environmental analysis addresses the problems
affecting the Garífuna land, it does not provide that the Garífuna communities may
manage or co-manage their land to restore their control over the "functional habitat" that
they have preserved for centuries. The Requesters are concerned that land which they
consider is the functional habitat of the Garífuna people could be given to people outside
the Garífuna communities, and that Project did not take into account the importance of
natural habitats for the livelihood of the Garífuna communities, as required by OP 4.04
on Natural Habitats.

                               Management Response

On February 9, 2006, Management submitted its Response to the Request. Management
claims, as of the date of the Response, that no implementation activities involving
surveying, demarcation, conflict resolution and titling have taken place in any Garífuna
lands. Management adds that, in any event, when these activities occur, appropriate
safeguards are built into the Project to protect indigenous people's lands.

                            Land Rights and Collective Title

Management asserts that it has analyzed Honduras' legal framework vis-à-vis the issue of
collective versus individual titles. Management states that the Project does not favor
individual titling in the Garífuna communities but establishes procedures that protect the
rights of Garífuna communities. Management emphasizes that community participation
in the Project is voluntary and thus land demarcation and titling will occur only in those
communities willing to participate in the Project.

                     Consultation, Participation and Representation

Management claims that it has held meaningful consultations and open dialogue with all
Garífuna stakeholders, that extensive consultations were held before field activities, and
that a wide range of Garífuna stakeholders was consulted for the preparation of the Social
Assessment and the IPDP. It also claims that proposals made by affected people during
consultation meetings were taken into considerationin Project design.

Management states that the Mesa Regional is a consultation board that includes many
Garífuna stakeholders. Management states that one representative of OFRANEH is part
of the Mesa. It also claims that the leadership of OFRANEH has been under dispute, and
the OFRANEH-Requesters refused to participate in the meeting that created the Mesa
Regional.

             Indigenous Peoples Development Plan and Legal Framework

With regard to the new Property Law, Management emphasizes that the Government
enacted it after the Bank Board of Executive Directors had approved the Credit.
According to Management this explains why the Law is not discussed in the Project
documents. However, Management stresses that the Project design takes it into
consideration and provides mechanisms for a continuous flexible adaptation of the
Project to the new Law.

Management also states that it found the new Property Law acceptable and determined
that the safeguards provisions were not in conflict with the Law. Management notes that
these Project safeguards provide that the Bank must issue its no-objection to any updating
of the IPDP, for example with respect to the land regularization and conflict resolution
procedures, which have to be based on meaningful consultations. Management also states
that the arbitration procedures included in the IPDP are consistent with national law in
force at the time of Project preparation and are in compliance with OD 4.20.

                           Environment and Natural Habitat

The Management Response notes that the Project was assigned environmental Category
B and the EA identified a possible overlap between existing communities and protected
areas. For this reason a "Process Framework" and Environmental Management Plan were
developed, and the demarcation of protected areas will occur only if and when local
communities agree. According to the Process Framework, co-management of protected
areas by agencies, NGOs and communities will be possible, and strict provisions for the
recognition and demarcation of land areas in favor of indigenous communities are
envisaged for the cases of overlap between land claims and protected areas.

Regarding natural habitats, Management states that the Project envisages that only legally
established protected areas are eligible for demarcation; no Project field activities will
take place in or near a proposed protected area; and procedures to protect the interests of
the people must be in place before demarcation or titling occur on lands adjacent Ethnic
Lands.

    The Investigation Report and Applicable Policies and Procedures

This Report concludes the Panel's investigation into the matters alleged in the Request
for Inspection. Panel Chairperson Edith Brown Weiss and Panel Member Tongroj
Onchan served as co-Lead Inspectors for the Panel's investigation. To assist in the
investigation, the Panel retained anthropologist Dr. Nancie Gonzalez, who is an
internationally recognized expert on the history, life and culture of the Garífuna people,
especially of Honduras. The Panel also retained Dr. Edmund Gordon, an anthropologist
and expert on land use issues facing the Garífuna people today, and consulted with
Joseph Berra, Esq., a lawyer with deep knowledge on these issues. The Panel also
benefited from the assistance of a Garífuna consultant from Belize, Ms. Phyllis Cayetano,
who, among other things, interpreted the Garífuna language for the Panel.



                                             xii

The Panel conducted a two-part investigation. The first part involved detailed research
into Bank records related to the Project, interviews with Bank Staff, and a review of
relevant documents and scholarly literature. The second part took the form of two in-
country fact-finding visits.

During its visits, the Panel met with Requesters and other individuals and communities,
local and national authorities, representatives of nongovernmental organizations, relevant
experts and others. The Panel visited a number of Garífuna villages and communities
along the Northern Coast of Honduras. The Panel gathered considerable information and
data with which to evaluate the Requesters claims.

With respect to this Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied with the
following applicable operational policies and procedures:

The Panel recognizes the importance of regularizing land titles for economic
development in Honduras, and the importance of the objectives of the Project in this
regard.

                    The Garífuna People and Collective Titles

                             Origins of the Garífuna People

The Garífuna are descendants of the original Carib and Arawak Indian populations of the
Amazon and Eastern Caribbean who intermarried with enslaved Africans ­ both those
who ran away from Europeans on neighboring islands, and those who had escaped from
shipwrecks and were captured by the Indians themselves.

Succeeding generations retained their own language, culture and religion, and established
a new identity for themselves, which aided in their survival. They became known as
"Black Caribs", and eventually became the most numerous and dominant population on
the island of St. Vincent. Most Europeans did not interfere with them, owing to
successive agreements beginning in 1660, which defined St. Vincent as a neutral island

This situation changed with the formal cession of St. Vincent to Britain in the Treaty of
Paris in 1763. With the arrival of planters, settlers and speculators, and as a result of
colonial battles, the "Black Caribs" were conquered and deported from the Leeward
Island of St. Vincent and exiled to the island of Roatan in 1797 well before the
emergence of the modern Honduran State. The Spanish colonial authority immediately




                                            xiii

transferred most of the group to the mainland, specifically to the town of Trujillo. From
there, they mainly dispersed along the northern coast of Honduras.

In more recent years, the designation of "Black Carib" or "Moreno" has been
increasingly abandoned and replaced with the more historically correct name "Garífuna"
The Garífuna retained a distinctive, non-Western language. It remains as a variant of
Arawak, with many words taken from French, English and Spanish, which they acquired
from their several colonial experiences.

                          Garífuna People and Land Use Patterns

Garífuna people today live primarily on the Caribbean coast of Central America in
Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In Honduras, their 38 communities are
mostly located along the northern coast, in the Departments of Atlántida, Colon, Cortes
and Gracias a Dios.

The Garífuna maintain their ancestral language as well as specific religious beliefs
and festivals which denote their strict connection with their land and territory. They
also maintain traditional communal uses of the land and other patterns of work and
activity that reflect their origins, home along the northern coast of Honduras, and unique
culture.

Ancestral land use patterns, which the Garífuna brought with them from St. Vincent to
Honduras in 1797, involved simple horticulture, primarily of cassava, as well as a few
other roots, some annual vegetables, and plantains and the propagation and harvesting of
tree fruits such as avocados and mangos. These were primarily for subsistence, although
small surpluses were sold locally. The word "Garífuna" means "people who eat cassava."
Garífuna people have used the forest not only for planting, but as the source of protein
and plant foods, of medicines, and of wood to build houses, canoes, and other objects.

Both on St. Vincent and in Central America, the Garífuna subsistence economy has also
depended upon off-shore fishing, the collection of land crabs, and the hunting of small
forest and sea game, such as deer, agouti, turtles, and manatee. The beaches and the sea
have always been important to the Garífunas for fishing. In the past, the sea has also
provided an avenue for them to reach the outside world in areas where land transportation
was difficult or impossible. Beaches have been an important element in religious
ceremonies. The sea is part of the Garífuna ethnic and cultural identity. Garífuna
houses lining the beaches are the very heart of this sea-faring culture.

Garífuna ethnicity depends on their continued presence along the north coast of
Honduras. This is important, not only for Garífuna living in Honduras today, but for
those living in distant countries. Many of these long to relocate one day to their own
original or ancestral village. Others look forward to visiting, both due to their own
nostalgia, and because they wish their children to remain connected to their ancestry and
to learn their history.

                               External Pressures on the Land

The Garífuna have been and are losing lands once occupied and used by their recent
and remote ancestors, as well as by themselves today. Over time, there have been
many important external forces that have significantly affected the land uses, work
patterns and lands of the Garífuna people In particular, tourism and industrialized
export-crop production (such as African palms, pineapples, rambutan, and bananas) are
the two major actual and potential uses which attract land-buyers and "invaders" of
Garífuna ancestral land. Lands once largely unrestricted for those who cared to use them
have become economically valuable and highly sought by outsiders.

Non-Garífuna people have also come to develop vacation homes, cattle ranches and other
land uses and activities, often excluding the Garífuna communities from access to the
lands through fences, walls and gates. Other significant factors that affect Garífuna lands
include: the evolving legal and institutional framework; actions by municipalities to issue
private titles within Garífuna communal land; overlapping claims and unregistered
transfers; and actions by outside entities to obtain land rights and title and subdivide this
land and sell it to outsiders. Another significant concern relates to the designation of
protected areas in lands claimed and traditionally used by the Garífuna people, and the
related question of who has responsibility to manage use of and access to those lands.

In the face of these forces and pressures, traditional Garífuna communal systems
continue to exist. They encompass a range of work, activities and uses of land that
reflect the traditions and origins of the Garífuna people. Depending on the community,
these include artisanal fishing, planting and subsistence agriculture, cattle, hunting,
mining, medicinal plants, small-scale family initiatives of alternative tourism, and sale of
items such as coco bread, cassava, fish, and artisanal products.

                                         Land Titles

During the 1990s, the majority of Garífuna communities in Honduras received a
communal title to part of the land they occupy and that they claim traditionally belongs to
them. However, the titling programs carried out over the past two decades have not
solved the situation of the Garífuna communities. In general, the titled areas do not
include the entire ancestral claim of the Garífuna people, and most titles exclude
important areas of use and resource management of the communities. In some cases, the
titles received were extremely limited, and only covered the so-called "casco urbano"
where their housing is located.

In addition, although many titles given to the Garífuna communities created enforceable
rights, there remain land conflicts and issues of occupation of Garífuna land by outsiders
to the communities. Moreover, some communities were not titled at all; or Garífuna
families were issued individual titles over communal land.

In addition to titling of its lands, the Garífuna are also seeking to recover lands that they
claim belong to them but that have been occupied (invaded, since Garífuna people regard



                                              xv

these occupations as invasions) over the last decades by non-Garífunas.        In many
Garífuna communities, parts of the land over which the community have legal title
have been illegally occupied, at times even with fraud or violence. The Garífuna
people have been pursuing claims to collective title and rights over lands for many
years, and struggling to address problems of illegal and/or unjustified occupation of
lands that they consider belong to the community as a whole.

The Inspection Panel does not pass judgment on these claims. However, the pursuit by
the Garífuna people of their rights over ancestral lands is of central importance to this
investigation, as the Requesters claim that the PATH Project may undercut and harm
their ability to pursue and succeed in these claims.

                             Governance and Representation

The Garífuna people founded several entities in the 1950's to organize themselves
politically, which can be considered the precursors of the main Garífuna organizations
today, in particular OFRANEH and ODECO (Organización de Desarrollo Étnico
Comunitario). In the 1970's and 1980's, the people became increasingly organized and
mobilized around the issue of land rights (among other issues), first through communal
organizations such as the "patronatos" and the Comites de Defensa de la Tierra
(Committee for the Defense of the Land), and then through the broader organization of
OFRANEH.

OFRANEH, the organization which submitted the Request, was founded in 1977. It
began as an organization seeking brotherhood with all Afro Hondurans, but has since
become exclusively concerned with the plight of the Garífunas. In general, OFRANEH
seeks to promote the internal organization and political mobilization of the Garífuna
communities. OFRANEH has remained, over the years, the leading organization
representing the Garífuna people. OFRANEH has been, in particular, at the
forefront of efforts of the Garífuna people to secure their land rights, alongside
ODECO which also has played a key role in this effort, especially during the titling
process of the 1990's. The Panel observes that OFRANEH still plays a leading role
in all Garífuna communities, especially at the grass roots level where it encounters
great support.

The Garífuna people are also organized at the community level. The majority of the
communities have local associations called patronatos, whose members are chosen by
communities' members. In some Garífuna communities there are councils of elders,
which participate in resolution of disputes activities. Many communities have a Comité
de Defensa de la Tierra.

 Consultation, Representation and Participation of the Garífuna People

OD 4.20 provides that the Bank's strategy to address issues related to indigenous people
"must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous peoples themselves."
The policy mandates the identification of "local preferences through direct consultation,


                                             xvi

incorporation of indigenous knowledge into project approaches, and appropriate early
use of experienced specialists . . ."

On the issue of representation, OD 4.20 states that indigenous people's representative
organizations "provide effective channels for communicating local preferences" and
"traditional leaders ... should be brought into the planning process, with due concern for
ensuring genuine representation of the indigenous population." It further notes that ". . .
[m]any of the larger groups of indigenous people have their own representative
organizations that provide effective channels for communicating local preferences." OD
4.20 also calls for the preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for
projects that affect indigenous peoples.

OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment also contains requirements for consultations with
project affected communities. The policy calls for meaningful consultations which may
occur only when people receive relevant information about the project in a timely manner
before consultations take place and in a language and form understandable and accessible
to those consulted.

                        Consultation and Preparation of an IPDP

The Panel notes that an IPDP was prepared for the PATH Project specifically in relation
to issues faced by the Garífuna peoples. The record indicates that substantial efforts were
put into the preparation of this IPDP. While important issues relating to the sufficiency
of the IPDP are addressed in other sections of this Report, and issues relating to
consultation during its preparation are reviewed below, the Panel finds that preparing
an IPDP complied with OD 4.20.

                         Consultation during Project Preparation

The Panel has reviewed the Project records regarding consultations carried out during
Project preparation. The Panel finds that several meetings were conducted during
Project preparation, and that the Requesters and other organizations representing
Garífuna peoples participated and had the opportunity to provide comment and
express their concerns about the Project. This is consistent with OD 4.20.

When the Panel visited various Garífuna communities in June 2006, however, the team
was repeatedly told by Garífuna people who are not part of any organization or group that
little or no PATH information had been made generally available in the communities, that
notice of informational meetings had not been made widely available, and that those
Garífuna consulted were not chosen by the people themselves, but, many believed, by
leaders and organizations selected by the PATH personnel. The Panel saw no evidence
of written materials such as brochures, announcements for posting having been sent
directly to the communities so as to let the ordinary people know what to expect.

The Panel also notes the significant concerns about the Project and its "consultation
process" expressed in early meetings by organizations representing the Garífuna people,



                                            xvii

in particular OFRANEH and ODECO. The Panel considers that these provided an
early indication of potential policy-based problems associated with the consultation
mechanism that was eventually to be established for Project implementation. These
issues are considered below.

                       Consultation during Project Implementation

In line with Bank policies, proper consultations are critical to the implementation of the
PATH's component related to indigenous peoples' land. In particular, the execution of a
number of Project activities, such as demarcation and titling, depends in large part on the
options preferred and the choices made by the indigenous communities.

Under the Project, the Mesa Regional was established as the institutional arrangement for
consultations. The Management Response claims that "under the auspices of the Project,
Government invited representatives of a wide range of Garífuna communities and
organizations, including Ofraneh, to participate in a meeting to establish an inter-
institutional commission to organize the Mesa Regional." In its Response, Management
states that it "endorses the Government's position to respect the decisions made by the
Mesa Regional and individual communities regarding their preferred land tenure
regime."

The Panel reviewed carefully the formation and functioning of the Mesa Regional, in
light of the critical role it is given in the land tenure process under the Project. According
to records reviewed by the Panel, in early 2005 OFRANEH expressed positive interest in
participating, but also stressed that all Garífuna people would have to be consulted about
the formation of the Mesa in a transparent way. However, when the invitation to form
the Mesa Regional was sent to community leaders and various organizations, including
OFRANEH, in February 2005, OFRANEH had decided not to be part of this process
because (according to them) the PIU did not accept that the selection of pilot
communities to participate in the Project should be discussed by each community before
holding a workshop. Subsequently, at a meeting in March 2005, eight communities were
selected to be regularized under the PATH and an agreement was reached to establish the
Mesa Regional of Regularization and Conflict Resolution of Atlantida and Colon.

The Mesa Regional's constitutive act is a complicated document, which is not easily
understood by a non-legal expert. The document states that the Mesa came into existence
on March 17, 2005 in the presence of "leaders of Garífuna communities, Municipal
Authorities, a political governor, representatives of AMHON, MAMUGAH, la
commission diocesana de la Pastoral de La Ceiba, representatives of OFRANEH and
ODECO" and that its stated purpose is to promote the program of the PATH.

During its visits to the Project area, the Panel team met a number of times with members
of the Mesa Regional, attended a Mesa Regional meeting in La Ceiba during its
eligibility visit, and attended, as observers, a general meeting of the Mesa Regional and
the Mesas Locales in Guadalupe on June 23, 2006. Members of the Mesa Regional in
June told the Panel that the Mesa is composed of members of various organizations:



                                               xviii

church, patronatos, sport clubs, dance clubs and others. They stressed that the Mesa is an
open organization that does not discriminate and is not closed to any Garífuna.

The Panel considers that the initial concept of creating an organization like the
Mesa Regional to unite the leaders and representatives of each Garífuna community
was not inconsistent with OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples in the sense that it
represented an effort to establish consultations with and engage the participation of
affected people. However, the Panel considers that a consultation framework for
Garífuna people in which their leading representative body or bodies are not part
and do not give their support and guidance cannot ensure genuine representation of
the Garífuna people, as required by OD 4.20.

In this regard, the Panel notes that Management, in its Response, gives the impression
that there is little distinction between OFRANEH, ODECO and a range of other civil
organizations in terms of representing the Garífuna people. In describing "The Garífuna
People", the Response states that "[a] variety of civil organizations represent the
Garífuna" (emphasis in original). The Response then lists these organizations, including
OFRANEH, ODECO and many others, in chronological order. The leading role of
OFRANEH in representing the interests of the Garífuna people is not recognized; rather,
OFRANEH essentially is grouped as one of a variety of civil organizations that represent
the Garífuna.

The Panel considers this description to be inadequate. As noted above, OFRANEH is
widely recognized as the leading entity representing the Garífuna people, and OFRANEH
and ODECO together may properly be considered the two most important Garífuna
organizations in representing the Garífuna people in protecting rights over their ancestral
lands. In recent years, OFRANEH, in particular, has played a lead role in this effort.
The Panel finds that OFRANEH (and ODECO) are "representative organizations"
within the meaning of OD 4.20 and are in a position to provide an effective channel
for communicating local preferences.

In this context, the Panel finds that the Bank's endorsement of the Mesa Regional as
the basic consultation framework for the PATH Project, without the participation of
OFRANEH and ODECO, is inconsistent with the core provisions of OD 4.20 on
consultation, representation and participation. The Panel is concerned that the
Mesa Regional has put in place a parallel system that is at odds with the way the
Garífuna people have established, over the years, to represent themselves on the
critical issue of securing their rights over land.

The Panel appreciates the difficult situation faced by the Bank in this regard, and
acknowledges the extensive efforts made by Management to seek the engagement of
OFRANEH and ODECO in the consultation process. These efforts do not, however, alter
the risks created by the present situation. The Panel finds that the Mesa system has
divided the community and marginalized the existing representatives. It may potentially
undercut the ability of its leading representatives to work on behalf of the community to
achieve its objective for collective title to ancestral land. It may also make the process of



                                              xix

land demarcation and titling vulnerable to manipulation, contrary to the stated intent,
which may result in the harm the Requesters have described and fear.

The Panel also notes that Bank staff interviewed by the Panel could not provide very
detailed information about the Mesa Regional, especially with respect to its membership.
Rather, they seemed to rely mostly on general information provided by the PIU. Because
of the key role given to the Mesa Regional in the process of land regularization, the
Panel finds that closer supervision of the operation of the Mesa Regional by Bank
staff, including social experts, is required under the Bank policy on Project
supervision, OP/BP 13.05. The Panel finds that supervision of the activities related
to the Mesa Regional does not comply with the applicable Bank policy.

These concerns are illustrated by important developments relevant to the Mesa Regional.
On September 28, 2006, there was a meeting among representatives of OFRANEH and
senior Government officials, including the Director of INA, the Sub-secretary of State for
the Ministry of Governance and Justice, the Secretaries of Environment and of External
Affairs, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) coordinator. The signed Aide
Memoire of the agreement provided for, among other things, the immediate
dissolution of the Mesa Regional. Given that Management claims that the Government
supported the establishment and operation of the Mesa Regional, the Panel asked
Management for clarification. Management seemed to have been unaware of this
development until it received the Panel's request for information.

On January 10, 2007, the Bank sent the Government a Notice of Threatened Suspension
of Disbursement due, inter alia, to lack of due diligence in carrying out the Project. The
Notice specified a number of conditions that had to be met to avoid suspension of
disbursements. Among other things, the Bank requested the Government to:

        "Publicly rescind its repudiation of the Mesa Regional Garífuna Wadabula as
        the Project's participatory consultative framework for Garífuna peoples; or, if the
        Borrower no longer recognizes the Mesa, submit to IDA the rationale for this
        drastic change of strategy and agree with IDA on an alternative transparent and
        non-exclusionary participatory consultative framework for Garífuna peoples in
        the Project areas, which is consistent with the Project's objectives and meets IDA
        safeguard policies." (emphasis added)


The Panel notes that Bank Management, in calling upon the Government to "publicly
rescind" its repudiation of the Mesa Regional, or to develop an alternative framework for
this "drastic" change - - did not call for further consultations with the affected
communities and their leaders to try to better understand the issues and concerns relating
to the Mesa Regional. The Panel observes that the continued controversy regarding the
Mesa Regional, and the recent document calling for its dissolution, provide another
indication of the tensions that have surfaced about the role of the Mesa in representing
the Garífuna people.




                                            xx

In light of the controversy and concerns already associated with the Mesa Regional,
the Panel finds that the failure to seek input and participation by the affected
communities and their leaders is not consistent with Bank policy provisions on
consultation with indigenous peoples and on supervision. The Panel finds that Bank
Management has not adequately adjusted to the many concerns raised with respect
to the existing consultation mechanisms, as required by OD 4.20 and OP 13.05.

                                   Legal Framework

One of the main concerns of the Requesters is that the Project will facilitate the
application of certain provisions of the new Property Law which may be detrimental to
their property rights and interests, because they fear it may ultimately lead to the loss of
their ancestral land and their traditional communal land titles as defined in local
legislation and in international conventions. The Request claims that the IPDP assessment
of the legal framework was inadequate and not consistent with the provisions of OD 4.20
on Indigenous Peoples because it did not consider the Property Law, which was under
discussion in Congress at the time the Project was being developed. In its Response,
Management states that "the Project incorporates appropriate safeguards to fill potential
gaps in Honduran legislation to safeguard the rights of Indigenous Peoples."
Management adds that the content of national laws and regulation is the responsibility of
the Government of Honduras and that mechanisms are available for civil society to raise
their concerns.

At the time of Project appraisal, some Bank staff members raised concerns about going
ahead with the Project before the enactment of the Property Law, and about the
implication of some provisions of the draft Law on the property rights of indigenous
peoples. Regional Management decided, nevertheless, to continue processing the Project,
with two conditions to be implemented: adoption of conflict resolution procedures
reflecting the interests of indigenous peoples; and adoption of a legal/regulatory
framework to regularize indigenous people lands as a trigger for the second phase of the
Land Administration Program.

The Bank conducted an analysis of the legal framework regarding property rights
of the indigenous peoples, including the Garífunas living in the Project area, in
accordance with OD 4.20 during Project preparation. The Legal Analysis raises
concerns about several amendments to the existing legal and institutional framework
provided in the Bill of Law of the new Property Law. It states that these amendments
must be taken into account in the design of training and outreach programs of the Project.
The Legal Analysis also underlines the fact that the proposed Law may provide
legitimate title in favor of people whose only claims to land are either uninterrupted
possession or the fact that their request for title over the land that they possess has not
been opposed by the legitimate owner.

The new Property Law was enacted in June 2004, a few months after the Board approved
the Credit for the Project but before the Development Credit Agreement became
effective. The Panel notes that the new Property Law contains a number of amendments



                                            xxi

to the legal and institutional framework which are consistent with the objective of the
Project and constitutes an essential part of the legal framework within which the Project
is being implemented. However, the Law also contains some controversial provisions
relating to the recognition of the land rights of the indigenous peoples.

OD 4.20 requires that the IPDP contain an assessment of the legal framework in the
country, including legal status of affected groups, as reflected in the constitution, laws
and regulations. "Particular attention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples
to use and develop the lands that they occupy, to be protected against illegal intruders,
and to have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife, and water) vital to their
subsistence and reproduction." (para. 15).

OP 7.00 (Choice of Borrower and Contractual Agreements) provides in paragraph 14 that
when local legislation is of relevance to the project/program financed by the Bank, the
Bank "tries to work within existing law to the extent possible." It adds, however, that
"[i]f the amendment of a particular law would impede the achievement of the project's
objectives, the contractual agreements may provide that such amendment would
constitute an event of suspension." (note 13) This is particularly relevant because a
change in existing legislation, namely the passage of the new Property Law, was being
discussed at the time the DCA was being negotiated and signed, and the Legal Analysis
noted that the new law "will entail a significant change to the existing legal and
institutional framework."

In spite of many concerns about the Law raised by Requesters, Bank staff and Legal
Analysis before and after the enactment of the Law, that is during Project preparation and
after Credit approval, the Panel did not find any record that these changed
circumstances, which are potentially directly relevant for the land rights of
indigenous people, were acted upon by Management, aside from an inconclusive
exchange of communications between the Region and the Legal Department.

The Panel further notes that, as required by OD 4.20, the Project provides for some
measures to protect indigenous peoples' land rights. These include mechanisms for
conflict resolution and the provision of legal advice and training for indigenous peoples,
and a covenant in the DCA that requires that "no titling and physical demarcation of
lands adjacent to Ethnic Lands will take place unless procedures that adequately protect
the rights of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples, duly consulted with affected
parties in a manner satisfactory to the Association and set forth in the Operational
Manual, have been followed" (emphasis added). However, given the relative weakness
of indigenous peoples, acknowledged in the Project documents, and the fact that the
new Property Law gives specific rights to non-indigenous occupants of Ethnic Lands
that cannot be amended or limited by regulations to the Law or by the provisions of
the Project Operational Manual, the Panel finds that these measures are not
sufficient to protect indigenous peoples' land rights that may be affected by Project
implementation, as required by OD 4.20.




                                             xxii

The Panel notes that, in spite of the key importance of the Property Law to the
execution of the Project and the rights of the indigenous peoples, and the concerns of
staff and affected people noted above, Management did not include any references or
remedies relating to possible negative effects of the Property Law in the DCA for
this Project.

This Project is the first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). According to Bank
policy the APL provides for funding of a long term development program, starting with
the first set of activities, based on agreed milestones and benchmarks for realizing the
program's objectives. The Project will have an immediate effect on indigenous peoples'
land rights during this first phase. The adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for
indigenous peoples' lands, however, is only a trigger to process the second phase of the
APL. The Panel finds that this is ineffective in protecting the rights of indigenous
people during the first phase of the APL. If in the Bank's opinion there was not an
appropriate legal/regulatory framework for indigenous peoples' lands, the Panel
fails to understand why titling and regularization of indigenous peoples' lands was
included in the first phase of the APL rather than the second one when such
framework was required to be in place. The Panel notes that to be consistent with
the principles and objectives of the Bank's operational policy on Indigenous
Peoples, the first phase of the APL could have excluded titling on Ethnic Lands and
areas adjacent to Ethnic Lands until the enactment of a suitable regulatory
framework.

Pursuant to the Resolution establishing the Panel, on December 20, 2006, the Panel
requested a legal opinion of the Senior Vice-President and General Counsel as to whether
the provisions of the Development Credit Agreement were sufficient to avoid harm to the
rights of indigenous peoples as a result of Project implementation on Ethnic Lands.
Specifically, the Panel requested a legal opinion on the rights and obligations of the Bank
(and correlative obligations of the Borrower) to find out "whether and to what extent the
safeguards included in the Project and in the legal documents, including specific
provisions of the Operational Manual, effectively protect the indigenous and Afro-
Honduran peoples' rights on their Ethnic Lands from the harm that, in their opinion, will
result from applying the provisions in Chapter III of the Property Law, with regard to
regularization of Ethnic Lands under the Bank-financed Land Administration Project."

According to the General Counsel, because of the separation of roles between the General
Counsel and the Inspection Panel, the question of "whether the Project provides adequate
safeguards (under applicable Bank policies) must be addressed by the Panel through its
review of whether the Project meets the applicable operational policy on indigenous
peoples." The Panel notes and confirms its agreement with the General Counsel's
view of the role of the Panel in this regard.

The General Counsel's response also contains a discussion on the "Relevance of
Honduras Property Law." It states that regulations to the Property Law have not been
issued yet, and, as a result, the Law's chapter on Ethnic Lands has not been used to title
and register land and "has not been tested either domestically or against the provisions



                                           xxiii

set forth in the Project's Development Credit Agreement." For this reason, the General
Counsel believes that a legal opinion on the "outcome of such a test ... would be purely
speculative" and not "determinative."

The Panel notes that the legal context in which a Project is designed and
implemented is very important, as recognized by Bank policies. In this Project, the
legal context is important also because the Requesters claim that the Project will facilitate
the implementation of a Law that they believe is highly detrimental to their rights and
interests. The fact that regulations have not yet been issued and that the alleged harm
feared by the Requesters is, at this stage, potential, does not exempt the Bank from
analyzing the potential implications of the Law as part of the analysis of "legal
framework" as required by OD 4.20. The Panel finds that Bank policy required
Management to carry out this analysis in relation to this Project after the Law was
enacted.

                             Environmental Compliance

                               Environmental Assessment

The Panel reviewed the Environmental Assessment (EA) and related documents to assess
their consideration of the issue of the possible overlap between protected areas and
Garífuna lands, in light of the concerns stated by Requesters. The Panel notes that the
environmental assessment for the Project identifies the possible overlap of protected
areas and Garífuna lands as a potential impact of concern, [Matrix A], and the possibility
that communities would be restricted from these areas. The EA also notes that the
planning process for protected areas was created "without considering the social, cultural
and environmental conditions of the communities" and states the "imperative" to
formulate policies relating to protected areas in an integrated way with communities.

The Panel finds that the identification of the issue of overlap between protected
areas and Ethnic Lands in the EA complies with OP 4.01. The Panel also finds that
the provision of the Process Framework providing for the recognition and
demarcation of land areas in favor of indigenous communities in case of the
mentioned overlap is consistent with the objectives of the OD 4.20 on Indigenous
Peoples.

However, the Panel notes that the implementation of the Process Framework may face
challenging circumstances. An example of this is the particular situation of the Punta
Izopo National Park, which overlaps with land claimed by the community of Triunfo de
la Cruz in the Department of Atlantida. Punto Izopo is a national park of 18,820 ha at the
far eastern end of the Triunfo de la Cruz communal land claim and was formerly an area
utilized by the community for hunting and gathering activities. It is also adjacent to
important community fishing grounds. Punta Izopo was declared protected area in 2000
and is now managed by the Fundación para la Protección de Lancetilla, Punta Sal y
Texiguat (PROLANSATE).




                                            xxiv

The Panel was informed by the local communities, and has found confirmation of these
allegations in the Central American and Caribbean Research Council (CACRC) study,
financed by the Bank, that many parts of this protected area have been fenced off and
access prohibited. The members of the community of Triunfo have no access to this area,
except to the ocean areas, although they claim this is land that belongs to the community.
Many Garífuna residents of Triunfo de la Cruz have not visited this section of their
territory for years because they are afraid of security guards.

The Panel notes that the situation of Punta Izopo is an example of how, in reality,
questions relating to the demarcation of protected areas have been and may be
influenced by economically powerful vested interests. This could have a serious
adverse effect on the ability of these local communities to protect their interests
during this process, and diminish the practical effectiveness of the safeguards
included in the Process Framework.

With respect to other areas claimed by the Garífuna communities, such as the Rio Tinto
Forest Reserve, which has not yet been legally declared as protected area, the Panel notes
that the EA states as follows:

        "The Government of Honduras should regularize the property rights of the
        various ethnic groups in the country, principally through recognition of
        communal property in accordance with ILO Convention 169. Therefore, the
        Government should not designate more protected areas in zones where there are
        autonomous communities until their property rights are clearly defined, thereby
        safeguarding the interests of these communities." (EA, subpart g)

The Panel finds that this statement provides a potentially important response to
address the concerns of Requesters and complies with OD 4.20. The key issue, in
this regard, will rest in its effective implementation.

                  Management or Co-Management of Protected Areas

The Panel considered the Requester's claim that the EA does not address arrangements to
enable the Garífuna communities to manage or co-manage protected areas so as to restore
their control over the "functional habitat" that they have preserved for centuries, and does
not contemplate the involvement of indigenous peoples in management of the protected
areas. The Panel notes that the question of management of protected areas arises under
OP 4.01, as management arrangements and the extent to which local communities are
involved may strongly influence the achievement of environmental and other objectives
within these areas

Management states that the Process Framework and Environmental Management Plan
include provisions for co-management of protected areas by agencies, NGOs, and local
communities. The Panel notes that the Process Framework contemplates situations where
indigenous communities would be engaged in co-administration of protected areas, but




                                             xxv

prefaced by the statement that this is contemplated "[i]n those limited cases there [sic]
the presence of indigenous communities coincides with protected areas . . ."

In addition, the Environmental Assessment generally identifies organizations other than
indigenous communities in relation to management responsibilities. This point is
highlighted in the Request, with reference to the examples of Sierra Rio Tinto and Punta
Izopo. The Panel notes the explanations provided by Management with regard to the
management of these areas and, more generally, the EA table-listings. In light of these
considerations, the Panel finds that the commitments referred to in Project
documents to have indigenous communities maintain or acquire management and
co-management responsibilities over designated protected areas that may include
their lands complies with OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OD 4.20 on
Indigenous Peoples.

The Panel is concerned, however, that local Garífuna communities having claims in
listed areas are not mentioned in the EA as having a role or even a potential role in
their management, even though other organizations (NGOs) are so identified. The
Panel considers that the role of these communities in managing and/or co-managing of
these lands is important under Bank policy because, among other things, it will likely
affect the long-term health and well-being of the habitat in those lands and the people
who depend on them. The Panel notes that OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats provides that the
"Bank expects the borrower to take into account the views, roles, and rights of groups,
including local nongovernmental organizations and local communities, affected by Bank-
financed projects involving natural habitats, and to involve such people in planning,
designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating such projects. " (Paragraph 10)


              Project Implementation: Institutional Structures

The current institutional structure for the titling of lands in Honduras involves a number
of different entities.   The Requesters are concerned that the institutional structure,
supported by the PATH Project, will not protect the interests of the Garífuna people on
Ethnic Lands and in keeping collective titles. They claim, in particular, that Project
implementation is not consistent with the requirements of OP 4.20 and its provisions
regarding the preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).


The 2004 Property Law created a new regulatory framework for legalizing and
registering land titles. Under the new framework, the municipalities, INA and the IP will
play the main roles in regards to legalizing, titling, and registering land titles. The
Property Institute was created under the 2004 Property Law and is housed within the
office of the President. INA is the executor of the agrarian policies of the Government
and is competent with respect to any aspect and issue related to lands destined to be part
of the agrarian reform. It is the agency responsible for issuing titles in rural and ethnic
areas.




                                            xxvi

The municipalities generally demarcate the boundaries of their territory, and regulate the
urban development. Municipalities may also decide whether to enlarge urban boundaries.
As noted, they may grant title over municipal land to third parties. This power has created
conflicts with a number of Garífuna communities, who claim that the municipality has
granted rights to lands that Garífuna claim have communal land rights.

According to the Property Law, the IP maintains, updates, and operates the property
registry and cadastre, administering an integrated system of information on property
rights in Honduras. The IP issues titles for lands that were not registered under the old
Registry of Immovable Property, and registers the titles issued by INA and the
municipalities. According to the Property Law, the IP must also regularize and issue titles
on land parcels on which people have settled before 1999 and for which it is either not
possible to determine who is the legitimate owner among the occupants because of
overlapping titles, or the validity of these titles is under dispute by a third party not living
on that land parcel.

In February 2007, the Project Implementing Unit (PIU) for the PATH was shifted from
the SGJ (Ministry of Justice) to the Property Institute.

The Panel finds that the Requesters do not trust the new system for issuing titles. They
oppose the new regularization process because they believe that, even if they maintain the
full property communal title they were given during the titling policies of the 1990s, no
extension of their titles would be possible (the so-called ampliación they seek). It may
not be possible, in their view, to recover Garífuna land illegally occupied by third parties,
because funds to compensate those now occupying the lands are not available (the
process of "saneamiento", or regularizing title).

The Panel notes that the Government officials with whom the Panel met stated that
no resources have been earmarked and pledged to indemnify third parties who hold
annullable titles in Ethnic lands. The Bank needs to address this issue fully to be
consistent with OP 13.05.

                                Inter-Sectoral Commission

During its investigation, the Panel learned of the existence of the Inter-Sectoral
Commission for Protecting Land Rights of Garífuna and Misquito (also "Miskito")
Communities. The Commission was created in 2001 by Executive Order No. 035-2001
signed by the then President of the Republic of Honduras. This commission is intended to
help guarantee the property rights of the Garífuna and Misquito communities. The
authority extends to the titling, extension, recovery and protection of the lands. This
protection would extend not only to the lands occupied by these communities, but also to
those "that constitute their functional habitat and are regarded as ancestral [lands]
under the ILO Convention No. 169."

The Members of this Commission include key officials of government institutions
responsible for land titling and protection issues relating to the Garífuna and Misquito
communities, and chosen representative entities for those communities. In the case of


                                             xxvii

the Garífuna, these are specified as OFRANEH (the Requesters) and ODECO. The
Requesters called the Panel's attention to the existence of the Inter-Sectoral Commission
because, in their view, it is an important instrument for protecting their rights over the
lands that they traditionally occupy and have been losing over the last decades.


The Panel notes that the Project's IPDP, however, makes no mention of the Inter-Sectoral
Commission. The Commission is mentioned only in the Project's Social Assessment
(SA), in a brief reference which states that the IPDP must define an institutional
mechanism for participation of, and support by, the indigenous communities in Project
implementation. Neither the Legal nor the Institutional Analysis mentions the creation of
the Commission. The failure of the IPDP to mention the Inter-Sectoral Commission
for Protecting Land Rights of Garífuna and Misquito People is of particular
concern given that the IPDP reviews the relevant legal framework and institutions
and, on this foundation, proposes a "Model" approach for community involvement
in the land titling process.

The Panel observes that this omission may have had practical significance. The nature of
consultations and decision-making in relation to Garífuna land rights has become a major
controversy under the PATH.           The Inter-Sectoral Commission was designed
specifically to defend the interests of indigenous peoples, contained provisions for
their adequate representation, and engaged senior, decision-making levels of
Government. As a result, the Commission might have played a significant role in
helping to address the concerns that have been raised, in support of the rights and
interests of Requesters and the people they represent. The Panel finds that the failure
to identify the Commission in the IPDP and to assess its potential importance in the
land titling process under the Project does not comply with OD 4.20

                                    Conflict Resolution

The Garífuna people have pursued varying means to resolve disputes over land titles,
including through the court system in Honduras and petitions to the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights. The Project IPDP sets forth another set of procedures for
resolving disputes, including through arbitration and the use of Mesas at the local and
national levels. The new Property Law, adopted following the approval of financing for
the Project, provides its own special abbreviated procedures for conflict resolution. In
addition, the Project gives the Mesa Regional a role in conflict resolution during Project
implementation.

The Panel notes important positive features in the IPDP, including budget
allocations for capacity building and training of local community leaders on
national laws, and for training of arbitrators and conciliators. This is consistent
with the stated intent of the IPDP to protect indigenous peoples from the results of
depredations and invasions of their territory.

The Panel notes, however, the potential impact of power and/or class divisions in the
resolution of conflicts, both in the past and perhaps more recently. OD 4.20 (paragraph


                                           xxviii

15) requires that the IPDP contain an assessment of the ability of the indigenous peoples
"to obtain access to and effectively use the legal system to defend their rights." The
Panel is concerned that the IPDP does not adequately reflect or address the risks
posed to the Garífuna people by its proposed means of resolving conflicts. These
include, in particular, risks posed by disparities of power in the process.


The use of Mesas (Boards) for conflict resolution is of particular concern in light of
issues relating to representation of the Garífuna people, as described above. The
identification of the real representatives of the indigenous communities is a matter of
great importance for the correct, transparent and fair functioning of these conflict
resolution systems. Substantial and informed supervision by Bank staff, especially
specialists in indigenous peoples matters, to ensure that the process is fair and that
affected communities effectively participate in identifying their leaders and
representatives, is of central importance to ensuring compliance with relevant Bank
policy.

The Panel notes the concerns of Requesters that the existence of multiple conflict
resolution procedures, including those in the IPDP, in the new Property Law, and others
(described in this Report) generates confusion in the communities. Understandably,
these many instances or options have created confusion and anxiety among the
affected communities. The Panel finds that there is a need for clarification and
consultation with the affected communities as to which procedures apply, and a
need for better dissemination of this information

                                Concluding Observations

The Project was intended to advance the titling of lands in Honduras, as an essential step
to advance economic development in the country. The Panel recognizes the importance
of these objectives. While the Project focuses on individual titling, the Project also
includes a component on collective titling, with the proviso that communities can opt out
of participating in the program. This was intended to protect the Garífuna and Misquito
communities.

However, the Panel finds that the Project may have consequences far different than
intended by the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. The Panel finds merit in the
concerns of Requesters that the Project may contribute to the demise of titles and claims
to collective lands held by the Garífuna and indigenous peoples. In this sense, the Project
may not protect the cultural integrity or economic base of some of the poorest
communities along the Caribbean coast.

The Panel found that most members of the Mesas believe they were established to
confirm and expand community titles and to get the saneamiento. In reality, the Mesas
may not be effective in furthering collective titles, and may facilitate the opposite. The
Panel notes concerns that municipalities may expand their urban limits over Ethnic Lands
and grant individual titles to former communal lands and other lands that were formerly
rural. The Panel was informed, for example, that all of the island of Roatán has been


                                           xxix

declared to be municipal or urban land. Once designated as urban lands, the municipality,
not INA, has authority to issue the titles. The Property Institute has responsibility for
registering all titles.

The Panel also notes that the establishment of the Mesa Regional led to a situation where
the already existing Inter-Sectoral Commission for Protecting Land Rights of the
Garífuna and Misquito People was ignored. After the Panel inquired of the Bank about
the status of the Commission late last fall, and after several government officials and
others signed an "Acta" (Minutes) calling for the dissolution of the Mesa, the Bank
responded by pressing strongly for the Mesa to be recognized as the appropriate body for
dealing with Garífuna issues of title to lands. The Bank's position thus reinforced the
power of an entity, (the Mesa), which has operated outside existing institutions and
lacked the participation of the leading representatives of the Garífuna people in
their struggle for land rights over many years.

It is easy to understand why individuals would want to participate in the Mesas. For
participants, it offers an official channel through which to present the interests of the
Garífuna as they see them. Moreover, participants receive payment for travel expenses
and per diem for all meetings, which in the context of the poverty of the Garífuna
communities may constitute a significant benefit.

The Project entails legalizing the standing of the Mesas as community representatives.
There is a danger that the Mesas, as developed during Project implementation, will
become independent organizations that will supplant the traditional patronatos and other
existing civil society groups and may create further divisions within the Garífuna
communities.       Moreover, powerful people who are not members of the Garífuna
communities may be able to exert significant influence.

Among the Garífuna people interviewed by the Panel and its experts, there is broad
consensus favoring communal title of Ethnic Lands. There is a possibility, however, that
the Project as it stands will provide individual titles to families in Garífuna and
indigenous communities, who will sell their land for prices which are attractive to them
but inexpensive to the buyers. Individuals in poor communities may be most tempted.
The Panel notes that it received comments from various quarters that the Project may
have the effect of splitting the Garífuna communities, which could facilitate the eventual
loss of collective titles and the rise of individual titles across the valuable land area
fronting the Caribbean coast in Honduras.

As noted elsewhere in this Report, Management claims that communities are free to
choose whether they want to participate in the Project and "individual communities can
avoid the potential harm alleged by the Requesters by choosing not to participate in the
Project." The Panel doubts, however, whether there is a meaningful option for most
communities not to participate in the demarcation and titling activities provided under the
Project. The new Property Law, enacted after the Credit was approved by the Board,
grants specific rights to non-indigenous peoples who occupy and hold a "valid title"
within Ethnic Lands. As a result, these non-indigenous title holders may trigger title



                                            xxx

regularization activities in Ethnic Lands. Communities may face a choice of participating
in a Project which, as currently structured, they believe does not represent their interests,
or attempt to opt out of the Project and face significant challenges from non-indigenous
people occupying and claiming rights over their Ethnic Lands. Given the relative
economic and political vulnerability of the indigenous peoples, the Panel finds that
the safeguards provided under the Project are not adequate to protect the Garífuna
rights over their Ethnic Lands in the context of Project implementation.

                                      Chapter I: Introduction


    A. Events Leading to the Investigation

    1.      On January 3, 2006, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection5
            (the "Request) related to the Honduras: Land Administration Project ("the
            Project" ­ in Spanish Programa de Administración de Tierras de Honduras,
            PATH).6 The Request refers to alleged negative impacts of the Project on the
            Garífuna people and their land claims. The Request was received in Spanish
            and includes 13 attachments.

    2.      The Organización Fraternal Negra Honduras (OFRANEH) submitted the
            Request on behalf of the indigenous Garífuna population of Honduras.
            OFRANEH states that it is a federation whose members are elected every three
            years by the Garífuna communities as their representatives.

    3.      The Panel registered the Request on January 10, 2006 and notified the World
            Bank Board of Executive Directors ("Board") and the President.

    4.      On February 9, 2006, Management submitted its Response to the Request for
            Inspection.7


    1. The Request

    5.      The following paragraphs summarize the Request. The Requesters' specific
            claims will be addressed in more detail later in the Report.

    6.      The Requesters claim that in the design, appraisal and implementation of the
            Project the Bank did not take the rights and interests of the Garífuna people into
            consideration and, as a result, violated its own policies and procedures.8 More
            specifically, the Requesters claim that the Bank violated OD 4.20 on
            Indigenous People, OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.04
            on Natural Habitats.




5Request for Inspection, received by the Inspection Panel on January 3, 2006.
6In this report, the Spanish acronym "PATH" will also be used to indicate the Project.
7Bank Management Response to request for Inspection Panel review of the Honduras Land Administration
Project (Credit No. 3858-HO), [hereinafter "Management Response"].
8The Request also presents an overview of the history of the Garífuna people, which the Requesters
believe is useful to understand the magnitude of the damage that the Project implementation may cause to
them. Request, p. 9. See also Chapter Two of this Report.


                                                     1

  7.    The Request also refers to the ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous
        and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries. It states that the Convention,
        ratified by Honduras in 1994, recognizes the rights of the peoples with respect
        to the ownership and tenure of the lands they traditionally occupy, as well as
        the special protection of the natural resources of these lands. The Requesters
        state that Bank policies are designed, among other things, to ensure that rules
        and standards under such international agreements are respected.

Land Rights and Collective Title

  8.    The Requesters note that, under the Project, ancestral lands are to be regularized
        in favor of indigenous and Afro-Honduran populations by recognizing
        communal or individual land rights, based on the preference of each
        community, and by registering such rights in the land registry.

  9.    While the Requesters observe that properties and possessions supported by
        ancestral title or certification can be registered as private property and enjoy full
        ownership rights, they fear that the land titling and procedures provided under
        the Project will ultimately cause the demise of collective property in favor of
        individual property, which is contrary to their preferred land tenure system.
        According to the Requesters, the Project does not reflect the special legal
        situation of the Garífuna people.

  10.   The Requesters believe that implementing the Project will endanger the
        survival of the Garífuna people "because they cannot agree to solutions unless
        they are based on a concrete will to resolve the conflicts and recognize the
        rights over the lands that ancestrally belong to them."

Consultation, Representation and Disclosure

  11.   A major claim of the Request is that the Project has failed properly to consult
        with and identify the needs and interests of the affected communities, and has
        failed to consult adequately with people that are the legitimate representatives
        of the affected communities.

  12.   The Requesters claim that few consultative meetings were held, and for these
        few meetings, Management failed to distribute background material in advance.
        The Requesters also assert that their criticisms and proposals made at these
        meetings were not taken into account.

  13.   The Requesters claim that there was a failure of consultation in the preparation
        of the IPDP. They allege that affected people were not consulted prior to
        preparing the plan, and that the text of the plan was disseminated only a short
        time before the single consultative meeting relating to the IPDP took place. In
        that meeting, the Requesters claim, the representatives of all the Garífuna

          communities of Honduras signed a document that presented a firm rejection of
          the IPDP, and proposed several alternatives.

    14.   The Request also refers to a meeting held in 2005 in which pilot communities
          for the Project were selected. They claim that the interested communities did
          not receive information about the Project in advance of the meeting, and that no
          explanatory material was distributed. According to the Requesters, the
          representative of the Patronatos9 of one of the communities refused to sign the
          document related to the pilot activities.

    15.   One of the Requesters' main concerns relates to the issue of representation.
          They claim that consultations did not include people that are the legitimate
          representatives of the Garífuna communities, and they object to the
          establishment of the Mesa Regional, a "consultation board" created by the
          Government under the PATH.                 They state that the Mesa Regional is an
          institution not recognized by OFRANEH because it "has been created in spite
          of the disagreement of the communities, was not elected by the communities,
          [and] is not an organization that represents them." The Requesters believe that
          the Mesa is composed of people who cannot be considered Garífuna
          representatives and that it is alien to their own institutions.

Indigenous Peoples Development Plan and Legal Framework

    16.   The Requesters allege that the IPDP for the Project fails to meet Bank policies.
          They claim that the conflict resolution method provided for in the IPDP,
          arbitration, not only is unconstitutional but is also different from the one called
          for in the Property Law.10 According to the Requesters, neither set of
          procedures responds to their social and political reality.

    17.   The Requesters claim that, in preparing the IPDP, the Bank failed to consider
          the legal status of the indigenous populations as well as the procedures to issue
          collective legal titles. The Requesters also complain that the IPDP, in its legal
          framework section, failed to reference and properly take into account the
          proposed new Property Law of Honduras, which was to be the center piece of
          the land titling program. They claim that the Project failed adequately to
          address the serious concerns of communities about the potential impact of the
          Property Law, and its relationship to procedures and actions under the Project.

    18.   The Requesters also state that the IPDP provides for the issuance of regulations
          to delimit and demarcate indigenous peoples' lands, but these were never
          issued. According to the Request, the IPDP provides for the creation of an
          "Indigenous Affairs Unit" (Unidad de Asuntos Indígenas) which would be in
          charge of carrying out and monitoring the titling procedures for indigenous

9For more details about the patronatos see infra Chapter Two and Three.
10The Property Law was under consideration in Honduras as a proposal at the time of Project appraisal. It
was adopted by the Government in June 2004.


                                                    3

    peoples' lands. It is unclear to the Requesters how this latter institution will
    coordinate its work with National Agrarian Institute (Instituto Nacional Agrario
    ­ INA) and which titling procedures will be applied.

19. The Requesters further claim that, even if these regulations were issued, this
    would only generate more confusion among the people regarding the applicable
    procedures to file territorial claims.

Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitat

20. According to the Request, the Bank did not comply with OP 4.01 on EA
    because, although the environmental analysis addresses the problems affecting
    the Garífuna land, it does not provide that the Garífuna communities may
    manage or co-manage their land to restore their control over the "functional
    habitat" that they have preserved for centuries. Similarly, the Requesters claim
    that the demarcation of the water limits is not being carried out and they are not
    aware of any measures that would support the permanent presence of the
    members of the communities in the protected areas.

21. Additionally, the Requesters, who consider their land as their functional habitat,
    are concerned that it could be given to people outside the Garífuna
    communities. They allege that the Project did not take into account the
    importance of natural habitats for the livelihood of the Garífuna communities,
    as required by OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats. According to the Request, the
    management of these areas is already given to institutions defined in the
    Project's manual, and in particular to NGOs with no participation of indigenous
    communities provided or required.


2. Management Response

22. On February 9, 2006, Management submitted its Response to the Request.
    Management claims, as of the date of the Response, that no implementation
    activities involving surveying, demarcation, conflict resolution and titling have
    taken place in any Garífuna lands. Management adds that, in any event, when
    these activities occur, appropriate safeguards are built into the Project to protect
    indigenous people's lands.

Land Rights and Collective Title

23. In its Response, Management states that the Garífuna communities face various
    and long-standing unresolved land conflicts among community members, with
    third parties, and with national and local authorities. The reason, according to
    Management, is that different types of ownership coexist in the region, and that
    past titling programs have not been satisfactory to the Garífuna people.




                                         4

  24.   As to collective and individual titling, Management asserts that it has analyzed
        Honduras' legal framework vis-à-vis the issue of collective versus individual
        titles. Management states that the Project does not favor individual titling in the
        Garífuna communities but establishes procedures that protect the rights of
        Garífuna communities.

  25.   Management also states that, as of the date of the Response, no implementation
        activities involving surveying, demarcation, conflict resolution and titling have
        taken place in any Garífuna lands. Management emphasizes that community
        participation in the Project is voluntary and thus land demarcation and titling
        will occur only in those communities willing to participate in the Project.

Consultation, Representation and Disclosure

  26.   Management claims that it has held meaningful consultations and open
        dialogue with all Garífuna stakeholders and states that extensive consultations
        are held before field activities.

  27.   According to Management, OFRANEH has participated in several consultation
        events, including during Project preparation and implementation. Management
        specifies that a "wide range of Garífuna stakeholders" was consulted for the
        preparation of the Social Assessment and the IPDP. Management also claims
        that the Requesters did not participate in all the consultation meetings to which
        they were invited. It also claims that proposals made by affected people during
        consultation meetings were taken into consideration in Project design.

  28.   With respect to the IPDP, Management states that OFRANEH participated in
        two consultation events and the participants agreed to consult their
        communities to appoint representatives to form a Mesa Nacional Indígena, a
        consultation board that would facilitate the participation to the Project of the
        affected indigenous communities. The Response states that the Government
        decided, later on, to form two ethnic-based consultation boards ­ in Spanish,
        Mesa Regional ­ one for Garífuna and one for Misquito indigenous peoples.
        Management claims that at the two above-mentioned meetings no major
        objections to the Project were raised.

  29.   Management states that the Mesa Regional is a consultation board that includes
        many Garífuna stakeholders. Management states that in 2005, 112 Garífuna
        people, including representatives of 25 communities, members of patronatos,
        municipalities, the Garífuna church organization and organizations representing
        the Garífuna people, established the Mesa Regional de Regularización y
        Resolución de Conflictos (Regional Board of Regularization and Resolution of
        Conflicts), operating under the principle of non-exclusion.

  30.   Management notes that one representative of OFRANEH is part of the Mesa. It
        also claims that currently the leadership of OFRANEH is under dispute, and the



                                           5

        OFRANEH-Requesters refused to participate in the meeting that created the
        Mesa Regional.

Indigenous Peoples Development Plan and Legal Framework

   31.  Regarding the Property Law that the Request mentions, Management
        emphasizes that the Government passed it after the Bank Board of Directors
        had approved the Project. According to Management this explains why the Law
        is not discussed in the Project documents. However, Management stresses that
        the Project design takes it into consideration and provides mechanisms for a
        continuous flexible adaptation of the Project to the new Law.

   32.  Management also states that it found the new Property Law acceptable and
        determined that the safeguards provisions were not in conflict with the Law.
        Management notes that these Project safeguards provide that the Bank must
        issue its no-objection to any updating of the IPDP, for example with respect to
        the land regularization and conflict resolution procedures, which have to be
        based on meaningful consultations. As to the still un-issued regulations on land
        regularization mentioned by the Requesters, they have yet to be issued because
        a draft document is currently subject to consultations with indigenous
        communities.


   33.  Management states that the arbitration procedures included in the IPDP are
        consistent with national law in force at the time of Project preparation and are
        in compliance with OD 4.20. Management adds that the Project recognized that
        access to justice for Garífuna people is limited, and thus provided for budgetary
        allocations, within the IPDP, to create training programs for local community
        leaders on national law and regulations related to the Project and for
        conciliators and arbitrators. With respect to the territorial claims presented to
        the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Management
        states that it takes no position with respect to these claims before the IACHR.

Environmental Assessment and Natural Habitat

   34.  The Response notes that the Project was assigned environmental Category B
        and the EA identified a possible overlap between existing communities and
        protected areas. For this reason a Process Framework and Environmental
        Management Plan was developed. Under the Project, the demarcation of
        protected areas will occur only if and when local communities agree. According
        to the Process Framework, co-management of protected areas by agencies,
        NGOs and communities will be possible, and strict provisions for the
        recognition and demarcation of land areas in favor of indigenous communities
        are envisaged for the cases of overlap between land claims and protected areas.




                                             6

35.   Regarding natural habitats, Management states that the Project establishes that
      only legally established protected areas are eligible for demarcation; no Project
      field activities will take place in or near a proposed protected area; and
      procedures to protect the interests of the people must be in place before
      demarcation or titling occur on lands adjacent Ethnic Lands. Management also
      asserts that no protected area was "delivered" to NGOs as claimed by the
      Requesters.   Rather,   Management     notes,   the   Project  EA   includes   a
      comprehensive inventory of existing and proposed protected areas as well as
      factual information regarding the organizations involved in the management of
      those areas.

36.   Finally, Management asserts that the Project provides for mitigation activities,
      i.e. exclusion of proposed protected areas from demarcation, and inclusion of
      "chance find procedures in the Process Framework."


3. Eligibility of the Request

37.   To determine the eligibility of the Request and the Requesters, as set forth in
      the 1993 Resolution establishing the Panel and the 1999 Clarifications, the
      Panel reviewed the Request for Inspection and Management Response. The
      Panel Chairperson, Professor Edith Brown Weiss, together with Deputy
      Executive Secretary Peter Lallas and Operations Officer Tatiana Tassoni visited
      Honduras from February 12 to February 17, 2006. During their visit, the Panel
      Members met with the signatories of the Request for Inspection and members
      of Garífuna communities, Bank staff, national and local authorities, and
      members of the project's Mesa Regional. The Panel visited the cities of
      Tegucigalpa, La Ceiba and Trujillo, and also met with Requesters and other
      affected people in the communities of Sambo Creek and Guadalupe.

38.   The Panel determined that the Request fulfilled the eligibility requirements for
      inspection. The Panel recommended an investigation to the Board of Executive
      Directors because the Request and the Management Response contained
      conflicting assertions and interpretations of the issues, facts, compliance with
      Bank policies and procedures, and actual and potential harm.

39.   On March 30, 2006, the Board approved the Panel's recommendation to
      conduct an investigation into the matters alleged in the Request for Inspection.
      The    Request,   Management     Response,    and    the  Panel's   Report  and
      Recommendation were made public shortly after the Board authorized the
      inspection sought by the Requesters.




                                         7

4. The Investigation

40.  The purpose of the investigation was to establish whether the Bank complied
     with its own policies and procedures in the design, appraisal and
     implementation of the Project, and whether, if instances of non-compliance
     were found, they caused, or were likely to cause, harm to the Requesters and
     the people they represent. Panel Chairperson Edith Brown Weiss and Panel
     Member Tongroj Onchan served as co-Lead Inspectors for the Panel's
     investigation.

41.  The Panel conducted a two-part investigation. The first part involved detailed
     research into Bank records related to the Project, interviews with Bank Staff,
     and a review of relevant documents and scholarly literature. The second part
     took the form of two in-country fact-finding visits. To assist in the
     investigation, the Panel retained an anthropologist, Dr. Nancy Gonzalez, who is
     an internationally recognized expert on the history, life and culture of the
     Garífuna people, especially of Honduras. Dr. Edmund T. Gordon, Director of
     the Center for African and African American Studies, in the College of Liberal
     Arts at the University of Texas Austin and member of the Caribbean Central
     American Research Council also provided the Panel with important information
     regarding the history and the social organization of the Garífuna people. The
     Panel further benefited of the assistance of a Garífuna consultant from Belize,
     Ms. Phyllis Cayetano, who, among other things, interpreted the Garífuna
     language for the Panel.

42.  Panel Member Tongroj Onchan, Executive Secretary Eduardo Abbott,
     Operations Officer Tatiana Tassoni, and the expert consultants Nancy Gonzalez
     and Phyllis Cayetano, visited Honduras from June 19-26, 2006. During the
     visit, the Panel met with the Requesters and other people in Project-affected
     communities, Government authorities, Project officials and Bank Staff in
     Tegucigalpa. The Panel visited a number of Garífuna villages, including the
     towns of Guadalupe, Santa Fe, San Antonio, Cristales, and Limón. Panel
     Chairperson Edith Brown Weiss, together with Executive Secretary Eduardo
     Abbott, and Operations Officer Tatiana Tassoni, returned to Tegucigalpa to
     complete the investigation, from October 2-9, 2006. In Tegucigalpa the Panel
     met again with Government authorities, Project officials, Bank staff and the
     Requesters.

43.  The Panel also interviewed Bank Staff in Washington, D.C. before and after
     visiting the Project-affected area, and in the Bank office in Tegucigalpa. In its
     investigation, the Panel identified and carefully reviewed all documents
     relevant to the case that the Requesters, Bank Staff, and other sources provided
     to the Panel. The Panel also analyzed other evidence gathered during the field
     visits or otherwise in its research, including scholarly literature.

    44.    This Report presents the results of the Panel's investigation regarding the social
           and environmental issues the Requesters raised in their submission to the Panel.

    5. Bank Operational Policies and Procedures Applicable to the Project

    45.    With respect to this Project, the Panel assessed whether the Bank complied with
           the following applicable operational policies and procedures:

           OP/BP 4.01                         Environmental Assessment
           OP/BP 4.04                         Natural Habitats
           OD 4.20                            Indigenous Peoples
           OP/BP 13.05                        Project Supervision


    B. The Project


    46.    According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the Government of
           Honduras is implementing major legislative reforms on territorial planning,
           property rights, forestry and sizable public investment, overlapping titles, and
           related issues, to address problems of insecurity of land tenure.11 Insecurity of
           land tenure is a source of social instability and a major constraint to
           investments. Land rights in Honduras are poorly enforced and this results in
           overlapping titles, illegal occupation of land and even violent disputes. The
           PAD also notes that the historical land claims of indigenous and Afro-
           Honduran communities complicate this situation even further. For these
           reasons, the Project was developed as an important instrument to facilitate the
           implementation of the Government reform strategy.           12


    47.    Project Objective: According to the Development Credit Agreement the
           objective of the Project is "to establish and operate (as part of the broader
           Program) an integrated and decentralized land administration system,
           composed of public and private entities, which provides users in the Project
           area with accurate information on urban and rural land parcels and effective
           land administration services (e.g. purchases, mortgages, cadastral and registry
           certifications) in a timely and cost-effective manner."13 The Project is designed
           to address land tenure issues throughout the country.

    48.    Moreover, the PAD refers to "higher level objectives" to which the Project
           contributes and states that "[i]t is hoped that a reliable and widely accessible


11 At the time of Project design, in Honduras, only about 30 percent of the estimated 2.6 million land
parcels were registered in the property registry. See PAD, pp 1, 16.

            land administration system in Honduras, with the power to guarantee a
            national property rights system will ultimately increase economic growth as
            tenure security will stimulate private investment ...". According to the PAD
            "[s]ecure land rights will also feed in to the broad goal of sustainable
            development ..., and improved governance in the country"14

    49.     Project Components: The Project is composed of three parts (A, B and C)
            respectively aimed at developing policy framework and institutional
            strengthening for the creation and operation of a National Property
            Administration        System15       systematizing the regularization, titling and
            registration of lands in the Project area; and carrying out monitoring and
            evaluation activities. The first component aims at the policy framework and
            institutional strengthening; the second component involves areas-based
            systematic land regularization, titling, and registration; and the third component
            includes project management and monitoring as well as evaluation.16

    50.     The Request refers only to specific parts of the Project that involve alleged
            negative impacts on the Garífuna People and their land claims: it does not refer
            to other Project components.

    51.     Particularly relevant to the claims presented in the Request for Inspection is the
            Project's Part B, which provides for systematic land regularization, titling and
            registration of lands in the Project Area. Under this component, the Project will
            carry out field surveying of macro boundaries (e.g. municipal lands), urban and
            rural areas, forests, protected areas and Ethnic Lands.17 Part B further provides
            for parcel-level surveying and validation in the form of systematic cadastral
            field surveys of urban and rural areas to demarcate property boundaries and
            property rights in each parcel. Legalization, titling and registration of these
            lands will then be carried out. The PAD states that this Project component will
            be implemented in seven regional departments of Honduras: Cortes, Francisco
            Morazán, Comayagua, Atlántida, Colon, Gracias a Dios and Choluteca.18
            According to the PAD, Ethnic Lands are to be surveyed, regularized, titled and
            registered in the departments of Atlántida, Colon and Gracias a Dios.

    52.     The Project is the first phase of a three-phase Land Administration Program,
            which provides for establishing a fully integrated and decentralized National
            Property Administration System (SINAP) to increase security and transparency

17PAD p. 2 According to the PAD, "[f]ollowing the ILO 169 Convention, of which Honduras is a
signatory, for the purposes of this project, the term Ethnic Lands means "those lands that have ancestrally
and historically been settled by Amerindian groups and/or Afro-Honduran communities for their use and
that constitute their habitat on which they undertake their traditional productive and cultural practices."
See also, Credit Agreement, Section 1.02 (e). In this Report Ethnic Lands will also be referred to as
ancestral, indigenous or traditional lands.

          in land issues, improve governance and "stimulate the emergence of secondary
          financial markets such as insured bundled mortgages".19

   53.    The PAD states that Phase I of the program ­ the Project subject to the Request
          for Inspection ­ provides for, inter alia, incorporating in the national property
          administration system/SINAP real estate property located in the seven above-
          mentioned departments. More specifically, it integrates geographic data from
          the cadastre with alpha-numeric data from the registry under the so­called
          parcel-based (folio real) registration method, as opposed to the personal
          registry.

   54.    Phase II, to be started in 2008, aims at completing the parcel-based
          regularization and registration initiated under Phase I, expanding these
          activities to seven additional departments, and integrating into SINAP other
          property registries, such as movable assets, intellectual property etc.

   55.    Phase III, set to start in 2012, provides for, among other things, the completion
          of the regularization and registration of all urban and rural land parcels and the
          integration and consolidation of all property registries under SINAP.20

   56.    The Project's development indicators are, inter alia, that the system maintains a
          96 % rate of tiled lands accurately registered in SINAP that at least 70% of the
          SINAP users give a satisfactory rating and that conflicts in 60% of national
          lands are resolved.21

   57.    Project context: The Project builds on a series of previous Bank-financed
          Projects. The first of these Projects is the Rural Land Management Project
          (PAAR)22, which was implemented between 1997 and 2003. One of the
          PAAR's components supported the development of technological platforms,
          such as software designs, training and databases as well as land administration
          procedures with the aim to establish a parcel-based registration system (folio
          real) in the Department of Comayagua. Thirteen Tolupan communities (27,500
          hectares of indigenous lands) were also demarcated and titled under the
          PAAR.23

   58.    Additionally, the Bank has supported other projects that involved research on
          land issues of indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples in Honduras. The Bank
          and Global Environment Facility (GEF)-supported Biodiversity in Priority
          Areas Project (PROBAP)24, which was implemented between 1998 and 2005,

           supported a comprehensive land tenure study among Garífuna and Misquito
           populations in Honduras.25 This land study/diagnostic, which was carried out
           by the Central American and Caribbean Research Council (CACRC), was
           based on a participatory methodology to map territorial claims of 25 Garífuna
           and Misquito communities along the northern coast.26 Moreover, the Bank
           together with the Regional Unit for Technical Assistance (RUTA) sponsored a
           profile of indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples in Honduras.27 Other Bank
           financed activities include the institutional building of Afro-descendant groups
           in Latin America that included the Garífuna communities as well as the
           financing of an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) (together with the
           Central American Commission on Environment and Development ­ CCAD) to
           strengthen the capacities of central American black organizations, including
           Garífuna groups in Honduras.         28


   59.     Financing: The Project is financed by an IDA Credit of 16,900,000 Special
           Drawing Rights (SDR), about USD 25 million. The Credit was approved by the
           IDA Board of Executive Directors on February 24, 2004, and became effective
           on December 2, 2004. The closing date is April 30, 2008.

   60.     The Project is financed through an Adaptable Program Loan (APL), which
           provides phased support for long-term development programs by means of a
           series of loans, which build upon the lessons learned from the previous loans in
           the series. Moving to the next phase(s) of a program depends on satisfactory
           progress in meeting agreed milestones, benchmarks and triggers.29 According to
           Management, agreed triggers to move to Phase II of the Land Administration
           Program include the creation of the SINAP, the achievement of at least 80
           percent of the Project Development objective indicators and the "adoption of
           legal/regulatory framework for Indigenous People's lands."30

   61.     Implementation Arrangements: According to the Credit Agreement, the
           overall implementer of the Project is the Ministry of Justice (SGJ) with the
           assistance of Executing Agencies and applicable municipalities.31 Pursuant to
           the Credit Agreement, the Borrower, through the SGJ, was to enter into a
           Participation Agreement with each Executing Agency and a Municipality
           Agreement with each participating municipality before carrying out any Project
           activities.32 The Agreement also set forth the Borrower's obligation to establish
           a Project coordination unit, a high level Council of Governors composed of

          representatives of each Executing Agencies, and a Technical Steering

   C. The Project in Relation to the Garífuna People

   62.    As noted, the Government of Honduras is implementing major reforms to
          address problems related to land rights and security of titles. The PAD
          recognizes that these reforms cannot be carried out without dealing adequately
          with    the  historical    land     claims    of   indigenous     and     Afro-Honduran
          communities.34

   63.    The Project's Part B provides for systematic land regularization, titling and
          registration of lands. According to the PAD, under the first phase of the PATH,
          Ethnic Lands are to be surveyed, regularized, titled and registered in the
          departments of Atlántida, Colon and Gracias a Dios. These areas have been
          given priority because of their high concentration of settlements of people of
          ethnic origin. The Project is thus intended to recognize their ancestral rights and
          to regularize their land titles. Project documents in fact acknowledge a problem
          of invasions of Ethnic Lands by non-indigenous peoples because of, inter alia,
          a lack of clear recognition of the indigenous people's communal rights.

   64.    Part B of the Project has four sub-components: 1) preparatory activities for field
          work aimed at reviewing existing paper and digital data in the official cadastral
          and land records of the various agencies; 2) delimitation of macro areas, which
          include Ethnic Lands; 3) parcel-level surveying and validation, and 4)
          legalization, titling and registration.

   65.    Under sub-component two, the territorial layout is to be defined according to
          the physical characteristic but also the particular uses given to the land. The
          delimitation of these areas is also to be carried out with the participation of the
          local stakeholders, including local communities and NGOs.35 The fourth sub-
          component provides for the final stage of the land regularization process and it
          is important because, at this stage, conflicts over certain pieces of land are to be
          solved leading to parcels titling and then registering.

   66.    Under the Project, properties and possessions that are supported by ancestral
          certificates or titles are grouped within the category of private property.
          According to the IPDP, indigenous communities will enjoy all rights that are

           applicable to full ownership, once their rights are recognized and recorded in
           the real estate registry.36

   67.     More specifically, the IPDP foresees "the regularization of ancestral lands on
           behalf of the various indigenous and Afro-Honduran groups, which will fully
           guarantee the right of dominion over those lands, through the recognition of the
           communal and/ or individual ownership ..., through the registration of the
           domain in the corresponding registry, with direct participation of the
           communities in the legalization process so that in this way they enjoy the rights
           of full ownership."37

   68.     According to the PAD, the Ethnic Lands to be titled are to be determined
           through "ongoing consultation with indigenous peoples." In light of this, two
           consultation bodies for the Garífuna and Misquito indigenous peoples, the
           Mesas Regionales Garífuna and Misquito, were created under the Project.

   D. Recent Developments


   69.     On January 10, 2007, the Bank sent the Government of Honduras a Notice of
           Threatened Suspension of Disbursements because of lack of due diligence in
           carrying out the Project. According to the Bank's letter, this threat of
           suspension stemmed from the Borrower's non-compliance with its obligations
           under the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and the lack of notification to
           IDA of a number of events causing this non-compliance. Three particular
           instances of non-compliance are indicated in this letter: (1) failure to meet
           implementation performance targets,             (2) "failure to adapt the Project's
           institutional arrangements to conform to the new legal regime for land
           administration established in Honduras by the enactment of the Property Law
           (Ley de Propiedad) after IDA Board approval of the DCA, " and (3) "support
           for the dissolution of the regional Garífuna consultative mechanism" in
           violation of the DCA requiring this type of consultation body.

   70.     February 28, 2007, was the deadline the Bank posed to the Government for
           complying with the conditions described in the Notice and avoiding the
           suspension of further disbursements of the Credit. Such conditions or remedial
           measures included coming to an agreement on which entity was to be the
           Project implementing agency, whether the Ministry of Justice (SGJ) or the
           newly created Instituto de la Propiedad (IP ­ Property Institute), and act
           accordingly; recruiting a permanent Project Coordinator with qualifications
           acceptable to the Bank; revising the draft Participation Agreements with all
           Executing Agencies, consistent with the new institutional arrangements;
           submitting to the Bank revised drafts of the Municipality Agreements with all

    participating Municipalities, consistent with the new institutional arrangements,
    and establishing the Council of Governors and Technical Steering Committee,
    as required by DCA Sections 3.05 (b) and 3.05 (c).

71. One of the measures the Bank expected the Government to complete by the
    deadline related specifically to the above mentioned Mesa Regional Garífuna.
    In this regard, Management requested the Government to:

    "Publicly rescind its repudiation of the Mesa Regional Garífuna Wadabula as
    the Project's participatory consultative framework for Garífuna peoples; or, if
    the Borrower no longer recognizes the Mesa, submit to IDA the rationale for
    this drastic change of strategy and agree with IDA on an alternative
    transparent and non-exclusionary participatory consultative framework for
    Garífuna peoples in the Project areas, which is consistent with the Project's
    objectives and meets IDA safeguard policies."


72. On March 7, 2007, in a letter addressed to the Ministry of Finance, the Bank
    noted the progress made by the Government in implementing the remedial
    actions required to avoid suspension of the Credit's disbursements. The letter
    indicated that six actions had been completed, noting in particular the
    Borrower's confirmation of its support to the Mesa Regional Garífuna,
    confirmation given in writing and through a public meeting held on February
    23 in Trujillo with member of the Mesa. The Bank also noted the Government's
    decision to shift the Project Implementing Agency to the Property Institute
    (from the Ministry of Justice) and the establishment of the Council of
    Governors and the Technical Steering Committee provided under the Credit
    Agreement.

73. According to the Bank's letter, as of February 28, two actions still needed
    completion: recruiting a new Project coordinator and filling a number of vacant
    consultancies in the PIU. The Bank thus set two new deadlines for completion
    of these actions, respectively March 16 and March 28, 2007. On March 30,
    2007, the Government of Honduras was informed that the Bank deemed that the
    two remaining actions had been completed. The Bank also noted that
    restructuring of the Project was undergoing especially in relation to the
    changing Project implementing agency and that, as a result, the Credit
    Agreement is also to be amended.

             Chapter II: The Garífuna People and Collective Titles


    A. Brief History of the Garífuna People

    74.    Estimates vary about total numbers of Garífuna today. While some estimate
           that the number of Garífuna exceeds half a million, the PAD states that the total
           Honduran Garífuna population is about 95,00038. Different sources have
           assessed the number of Garífunas differently.39 The CACRC study estimated
           the number of Garífuna to be 98,000 as of 1993. The 2001 national census
           reported more than 49,000 people who self-identified themselves as Garífunas.
           The Panel has not been able to obtain more current data on the Garífuna
           population in Honduras

    75.    The Requesters are members of OFRANEH (Organización Fraternal Negra
           Honduras), and are ethnically Garífuna. The Requesters state that OFRANEH is
           a federation whose members are elected by the Garífuna people of Honduras,
           on behalf of which they submitted their Request.

    76.    This chapter gives some background information on the origins and history of
           the Garífuna people, including their ancestral land use patterns and the origins
           and importance of collective title to land. This account of the origin and ethno-
           history of the Garífunas is important to understand the issues raised in the
           Request for Inspection. The chapter also provides information about the
           Garífuna people today, with a focus on issues and problems they face relating
           to claims over their ancestral lands.40


    1. Origins

    77.    The Garífuna are descendants of the original Carib and Arawak Indian
           populations of the Amazon and Eastern Caribbean who intermarried with
           enslaved Africans ­ both runaways from Europeans on neighboring islands, and
           those who had escaped from shipwrecks and were captured by the Indians
           themselves.


38PAD, p. 17.
39The CACRC Study provides a table according to which the Garífuna population was estimated in 1993 to
be 98,000 people. According to the Project Appraisal Document of the Bank-financed Honduras: Judicial
Branch Modernization Project (IDA Credit No. 4098-HO approved by the Board of Directors on July 7,
2005) the Garífuna population is estimated between 100,000 and 190,000 people. See PAD for Honduras
Judicial Branch Modernization Project, Annex 10 (Indigenous Peoples and Access to Justice), June 6, 2005
(Honduras, Report. No. 32128 ­ HN), p. 74.

by Dr. Nancie Gonzalez.

    78.    Succeeding generations retained the Amerindian language, culture and religion,
           and established a new identity for themselves, which certainly aided in their
           survival. They became known as "Black Caribs", and eventually became the
           most numerous and dominant population on the island of St. Vincent. Most
           Europeans did not interfere with them, owing to successive agreements
           beginning in 1660, which defined St. Vincent as a neutral island, under the
           jurisdiction of neither the French nor the British. However, a small number of
           French Jesuit missionaries and white subsistence farmers settled clandestinely
           during the 18th centuryin St. Vincent. They treated the Caribs as neighbors and
           friends, introducing Christianity, the French language, and French names, many
           of which survive as surnames today.41

    79.    This situation changed with the formal cession of St. Vincent to Britain in the
           Peace of Paris in 1763. With the arrival of planters, settlers and speculators, and
           as a result of colonial battles, the "Black Caribs" were conquered and deported
           from the Leeward Island of St. Vincent and exiled to the island of Roatán in
           1797 well before the emergence of the modern Honduran nation. The Spanish
           colonial authority immediately transferred most of the group to the mainland,
           specifically to the town of Trujillo. From there, they mainly dispersed along the
           northern coast of Honduras. These events are described in Box 2.1, below.

    Box 2.1 Loss of Lands, Battles and Deportation to Honduras

                              Loss of Lands, Battles and Deportation to Honduras

    Following the formal cession of St. Vincent to Britain in the Peace of Paris in 1763, planters and
    speculators who then quickly descended upon the island soon coveted the lands of the Black Caribs,
    which were some of the most fertile on the island and potentially suitable for sugar plantations. They
    sought to manipulate imperial policy to dispossess the Indigenous people by either relocating them or
    by providing them with what amounted to a reservation occupying a smaller area of the island. The
    Black Caribs' unexpectedly fierce resistance, which included attacks on the lives and property of the
    British settlers, led the latter to seek military reprisals. Thus began the 1770 outbreak of what became
    known as the Carib War in which the Caribs, numbering between 7,000 and 10,000, were aided by
    their French neighbors.42

    A temporary truce was achieved in 1772, but it lasted only one generation because of continued
    invasions of indigenous lands. An even stronger Carib-French guerrilla resistance provoked the British
    to import African slave/mercenary militias in 1795. This time, aided by a virulent epidemic that
    decimated their enemy, the British were finally victorious. They burned over 1000 Carib houses and
    200 of their canoes, destroyed their crops and confiscated their stores of food.43

    Nearly 4500 Caribs were captured in July of 1796 and sent to a nearby small, uninhabited island; there
    they suffered eight months of imprisonment and disease during which nearly half died. In March of



41In 1950s a few Caribs in Central America still spoke some French, and some claimed that their villages
had been founded by French-speaking ancestors

    1797, 2,248 were embarked, and 2,026 landed at Roatán on April 12, 1797. 1,465 were transported to
    the mainland at Trujillo in September of the same year.44

    80.    There is no evidence that those landed at Roatán had any notion of African
           tribal affiliations or antecedents. They had largely refrained from intimate or
           even friendly relations with British slaves on St. Vincent.                     However, the
           presence of other Africans and African descendants - mostly men - on the
           islands and along the Honduran coast,45 suggests that there was great
           opportunity and advantage for some racial and cultural admixture to occur
           among the various African-derived and deprived population segments in the
           area. Yet, the Black Carib sense of peoplehood persisted, even among their
           increasingly mixed-blood descendants.46

    81.    In more recent years, the designation of "Black Carib" or "Moreno" has been
           increasingly abandoned and replaced with the more historically correct name
           "Garífuna" The Garífuna retained a distinctive, non-Western language. It
           remains until today as variant of Arawak, with many loan words from French,
           English and Spanish that they acquired from their several colonial experiences.


    2. The Garífuna People Today

    82.    Garífunas today live primarily on the Caribbean coast of Central America in
           Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In Honduras, their 38
           communities are all located along the northern coast, in the Departments of
           Atlántida, Colon, Cortes and Gracias a Dios. Many Garífuna can also be found
           abroad, in particular in New York and many other cities in the United States.

    83.    The household surveys taken in 2002-2003 reported that the Department of
           Atlántida, Cortés and Colón hold 84 percent of the total Garífuna population of
           Honduras. The remainder are situated in the Departments of Gracias a Dios (3

44Presumably more than 200 died enroute. It is not clear what happened to the 561 who were not taken to
Trujillo. Some 200 remained on Roatán; some may have gone to the mainland later, while others certainly
died. The details of all this are in Gonzalez 1988:15-53.
45Not only had the British established 17 settlements in the Mosquitia, Providence Island and the Bay
Islands to which they brought many slaves, but rebels from Santo Domingo (now Haiti) and members of at
least one British African army unit were freed and deposited near Trujillo and in British Honduras, where
they were given lands to settle. It likely there were both sexual and marital unions with members of these
populations, even though their descendants would have denied it (see Kerns, Virginia 1984 "Past and
Present Evidence of Interethnic Mating." Pp. 95-114 in Current Developments in anthropological Genetics,
Vol. 3: Black Caribs: A Case Study in Biocultural Adaptation. Edited by Crawford, Michael H. New York:
Plenum Press, as well as Gonzalez 1988:56).
46Early 19th century baptismal records of the Catholic Church in Trujillo variously identify babies and their

  84.   Fifty-two percent of the Garífuna live in urban areas, which are generally
        comprised of small villages and communities. Sixty-eight percent have attended
        primary school. Infant mortality is about 12 percent.48 Garífuna households are
        considered to have higher than average living standards compared to the
        national averages in Honduras. In part this is based upon the increasing role that
        remittances play for household incomes, which reflects the intense migration
        process of Garífuna to the United States.49

  85.   The Garífuna maintain their ancestral language as well as specific religious
        beliefs and festivals which denote their strict connection with their land
        and territory. These festivals often mark the planting and harvesting season,
        including of fishing activities. The Garífuna people also maintain traditional
        communal uses of the land and other patterns of work and activity that reflect

          The land use patterns are discussed in more detail in section 3, below.

  86.     Garífuna ethnicity depends on their continued presence along the north
          coast of Honduras. This is important, not only for the Honduran Garífuna, but
          for those in other countries, including the United States. Many of the latter long
          to relocate one day to their own original or ancestral village. Others look
          forward to visiting, both due to their own nostalgia, and because they wish their
          children to maintain their ancestry and learn their history.


  3. Garífuna Land Use Patterns

  87.     Ancestral Garífuna land use patterns, brought with them from St. Vincent to
          Honduras in 1797, involved simple horticulture, primarily of cassava, as well as
          a few other roots, some annual vegetables, plantains and the propagation and
          harvesting of tree fruits such as avocados and mangos. These were all primarily
          for subsistence, although small surpluses were sold locally.                         The word
          "Garífuna" means "people who eat cassava."

  Box 1.2 Importance of Cassava for the Garífuna People
                                 Importance of Cassava for the Garífunas

  Originating with their ancestors in the Amazon area, the Garífuna had until recently a sophisticated
  folk technology for cultivating, harvesting, and preparing cassava for their own consumption. Cassava
  grows easily in nearly every type of soil, ranging from acidic to alkaline, sandy to clay. Planting,
  weeding, harvesting and preparation as food was done mainly by women, men contributing to the
  original clearing and burning of virgin forests, and to the manufacture of basketry, sifters, and the
  ingenious "ruguma," or "snake," used to squeeze the poisonous juice from the grated roots. Like all
  rapidly growing plants yielding carbohydrates, cassava has high nutrient requirements and exhausts the
  soil very rapidly.50 No fertilization is required when the land is freshly cleared or when there is enough
  land to enable the grower to substitute new land for old when yields fall. Formerly Garífunas had no
  problem finding new forest lands to till when their plots became less productive, and no doubt many of
  the smaller communities developed as families sought unused land. But as the coastal populations
  became larger, this became increasingly more difficult to find, and the concept of land ownership or
  territorial rights arose. Semi-systematic or casual fallowing then came into use, and is still carried out
  by those who continue to plant.
  Although cassava is grown throughout the world as a major cash crop, the Garífuna have never
  developed it as such. In the 1970s there were experiments in Honduras fostered by foreign aid workers
  and some local NGOs, to improve the technology for processing cassava into the unleavened "bread"
  known as areba.         Efforts were also made to help them market this in Central America, taking
  advantage of the free trade agreements among the different countries. No efforts were made to process
  the cassava into either tapioca or pure starch ­ both of which have been successfully produced and
  marketed in other countries, such as the Dominican Republic and some other Caribbean countries.

    88.    Garífuna people have used the forest not only for planting, but as the source of
           protein and plant foods, medicines and of wood to build houses, canoes, and
           other objects. Both on St. Vincent and in Central America, the Garífuna
           subsistence economy also has depended upon off-shore fishing, the collection
           of land crabs, and hunting of small forest and sea game, such as deer, agouti,
           turtles, and manatee. Men and boys were largely responsible for all of this,
           although women might help along the shore. Communities have traditional
           fishing banks up to three miles into the sea, for which they claim use rights.

    89.    As noted above, Garífunas have settled along the northern coast of Honduras
           and along the beaches and the sea, which have always been an important value
           for the Garífunas for fishing. In the past, it also provided an avenue for them to
           reach the outside world in areas where land transportation was difficult or
           impossible.

    90.    The men did all the weaving and care of fish nets, the construction of canoes,
           paddles, simple sails, and other paraphernalia; women might help out along the
           shore. Fishing was also done in the rivers using bows and arrows, spears, and
           poisonous plants to stun the fish. Sometimes it was done at night, using torches
           or lanterns to attract their prey. Additionally, due to the Garífuna history,
           beaches are an important element in religious ceremonies. The sea is part
           of the Garífuna ethnic and cultural identity. Garífuna residential sites
           lining the beaches are the very heart of this sea-faring culture.

    91.    The beach is also the major attraction for tourists, and this has led to
           further occupation of Garífuna land, increasing the so called "land
           invasion" problem. For at least twenty years non-Garífuna have built
           seaside vacation houses in Garífuna territory, often putting up fences so as
           to impede access to public land.51

beaches claimed by indigenous peoples as part of their ancestral lands ought to be considered their

    Box 2.2 Historical Background: Garífuna Dependency on the Sea
                     Historical Background: Garífuna Dependency on the Sea

    Folk memories of their inglorious arrival in Central America by sea have made the beaches important
    also in religious ceremonies in honor of their deceased ancestors.52 Funerals in Central America once
    included the building of a canoe with a mast and sail on the beach, which was set on fire to bid the
    spirit on its way ­ perhaps to return to St. Vincent. Some of the foods dedicated to the ancestral spirits
    during other ceremonies are cast upon the waters after having been blessed by the "buiye" and shared
    with the living. The arrival in Central America in 1797 is now commemorated by ceremonies in
    Roatán, Honduras on April 11, and Garífuna arrive there to celebrate from all over that country, as well
    as from other Central American countries and the U.S. In Belize and Guatemala "Settlement Day"
    occurs in November, when they believe the Garífuna first arrived on their shores, and in the former
    country it has been declared a national holiday. It involves a re-enactment of what they believe
    happened at the time, with people in "primitive" garb going out in canoes during the night, and
    returning early in the morning to be met by their fellows, celebrating the fact that regardless of the
    hardships they had endured, they were once again on tierra firme and free. In a sense, it is an
    affirmation of their unique ethnic identity, and of their ability to overcome disasters and hardships.
    Again, the sea is a necessary part of their history and cultural persistence. Garífuna in New York and
    elsewhere in the U.S. have taken to celebrating this Central American arrival as well, but without the
    seashore, it is not so moving.

    92.     It is important to remember that the Garífuna indigenous ancestral communal
            property included lands once used for shifting agriculture, which now could be
            communally rented or planted with cash crops of various kinds, including, but
            not necessarily limited to cassava. With technical and financial assistance in
            agriculture and marketing, this could return considerable profit to the
            community as a whole, as well as to individual entrepreneurs.

    93.     As a consequence, the delimitation of ancestral agricultural lands is a
            major issue that the Project needs to take into consideration, since what
            was once a large, unrestricted forest open for all who cared to use it, has
            now become a valuable and limited resource. As has happened in every case
            where the nature of slash and burn agriculture is misunderstood by colonists,
            the amount of land necessary for indigenous needs is under-estimated. As
            populations grew, non-Garífuna peasants moved into the forests, competing
            with Garífuna for their own slash and burn agricultural needs. This was


property, and so titled. If the Indigenous people then choose to develop tourism facilities, they could be
helped to do so communally.
52 In April, 1997 a monument in honor of a fallen hero in the Caribbean War in St. Vincent was dedicated
in Punta Gorda, Roatán. Although this event may be seen by outsiders as mainly a political statement, it is
significant that their traditional religion, still alive despite their Christianity, honors and reveres their
ancestors.

            followed or accompanied by both corporations and private individuals wanting
            large contiguous areas for export crops or for livestock, a form of agriculture
            less environmentally sustainable than that practiced by the Garífunas.

    94.     Migration abroad has increased in recent years, but became a double-edged
            sword as it stimulated Garífuna people to buy and then become dependent on
            more and more Western goods. At the same time, their absence from Honduras
            led to more land occupation by non-Garífunas, but also to the notion that they
            really didn't need the land, anyway. One of the "goods" that they began to
            value more than they had before was higher education. Some of the better
            educated went to Honduran cities, a few became professional doctors, nurses,
            professors; some found "white-collar" jobs, others became teachers or clerical
            workers. Most of these Garífunas, however, retained their ties with their coastal
            villages or towns, and found ways to increase their financial status and that of
            their entire community, often through tourism or its embedded attractions such
            as musical and dance presentations.53

    95.     Over time, there have been many important external forces that have
            significantly affected the land uses, work patterns and lands of the
            Garífuna people.54 In the late 19th century, foreign agro-industry began to
            arrive and developed inland of the Coastal lowland areas occupied by the
            Garífuna. The Garífuna developed a mixed economy, with many men engaged
            in migrant wage labor in agriculture while families remained in villages
            engaged in a traditional communal subsistence economy.

    96.     As agro-industry began to decline after the 1930's, pressure on the Garífuna
            lands increased. In particular, small-scale peasant agriculture by "Ladinos"
            began to impinge on Garífuna hunting and gathering activities in "forest
            hinterland areas of communities."

    97.     The emergence of upper and upper middle classes in Honduras after the 1940's
            led to pressures to acquire Garífuna beach lands for "Ladino" vacation homes
            and leisure activities. This pressure has escalated in the last 30 years.

    98.     At the same time, the further decline of agro-industry resulted in a new
            emphasis on alternatives sources of revenue and financial base for
            municipalities, including through land sales and taxes. A market-based
            economy penetrated into the Garífuna villages, operating in parallel with the
            traditional communal economic systems, which continue to exist. In this

53Garífuna are renowned throughout Central America and the United States for their very professional and
unusual music and dance. A combination of ancestral "punta" and other, more recent borrowings, has
resulted in a new genre now called "punta rock ," popular both in the U.S. and in Central America.
Throughout their history, the Garífuna have been creative in these arts, and their reputation is well
deserved.

Director of the Center for African and African American Studies, in the College of Liberal Arts at the

        context, some Garífunas increasingly viewed land as a commodity that could be
        sold to others within or outside the community. Many other factors have
        significantly affected Garífuna lands and land claims, as described in more
        detail in other parts of this Report.

   99.  In the face of these forces and pressures, traditional Garífuna communal
        systems continue to exist and encompass a range of work, activities and
        uses of land that reflect the traditions and origins of the Garífuna people.
        Depending on the community, these include artisanal fishing, planting and
        subsistence agriculture, cattle, hunting, mining, medicinal plants, small-scale
        family initiatives of alternative tourism, and sale of items such as coco bread,
        cassava, fish, and artisanproducts.55

B. Issues of Collective Titles to Land


1. General Situation regarding Land Issues

101. As mentioned in Chapter One, the Government of Honduras and the PATH
     Project consider insecurity of land tenure in Honduras as one of the most
     critical constraints to increased investment and also a source of social




                                        27

          instability.56 According to the PAD, insecurities are often a result of
          inadequately enforced land rights through weak land administration institutions.
          Garífuna communities face long-standing unresolved land conflicts.

   102. The PAD mentions problems regarding untitled lands as well as titled lands. It
          notes that while about 84% of the land in rural areas in Honduras is legally
          classified as forest land, and most of this land is not subject to private
          ownership, only 54 percent of the territory is forested. About 35 percent of the
          forests are considered national forests, 35 percent is held by private owners, and
          30 percent are considered municipal lands (ejidales). The PAD notes that, inter
          alia, farmers without titles illegally occupy forest lands and that in rural areas
          lands are occupied illegally because of lack of title.

   103. Problems that invalidate some property claims also exist with regard to
          titled land, such as overlapping private claims and norms restricting
          property use. Land issues are also complicated by unregistered transfers
          and implications of individual rights within communal lands. Only about 30
          percent of the estimated 2.6 million land parcels in Honduras (1.8. million
          urban, 0.8. million rural) are included in the property registry, which means that
          most of the legal titles that could be enforced against third parties are often not
          registered.57


   2. Historical Land Claims of Garífuna, and Land Loss

   104. The PAD refers to historical land claims of Indigenous and Afro-Honduran
          communities and lists the limited recognition of their land rights as a major
          issue.58 The Garífuna today are increasingly divided by social class and other
          interests, the "ancestral lands" in question are now more valuable and in
          demand by many non-Garífuna and even non-Hondurans.

   105. The Garífuna have been and are losing lands that were once occupied and
          used by their recent and remote ancestors, as well as by themselves today.
          In particular tourism and industrialized export-crop production (such as African
          palms, pineapples, rambutan, and bananas) are the two major actual and
          potential uses which attract land-buyers and "invaders" of Garífuna ancestral
          land. As described previously, non-Garífuna people have also come to develop
          vacation homes, cattle ranches and other land uses and activities, often
          excluding the Garífuna communities from access to the lands through fences,
          walls and gates. Other significant factors that affect Garífuna lands contributing
          to land loss by Garífuna people include: the evolving legal and institutional
          framework in Honduras; actions by municipalities to issue private titles over

            land within Garífuna communal land; issues of access to the legal system to
            confirm and protect land rights;59 and actions by outside entities to obtain land
            rights and title and then subdivide this land and sell it to outsiders.60




            Photo 3: Non-Garífuna fences in Garífuna land near Trujillo

    106. Another significant concern relates to the designation of protected areas in
            lands claimed and traditionally used by the Garífuna people, and the related
            question of who has responsibility to manage use of and access to those lands.
            For example, the Punta Izopo protected area near the community of Triunfo de
            la Cruz is on lands traditionally used and taken care of by Garífuna people. The
            Panel has been informed that the people now fear to enter this area, as access is
            restricted by security guards under the control of outsiders to the community.61

    107. As another example, the problems associated with land loss in the town of San
            Juan has been noted and reported in local and international media outlets. There
            is evidence that a good portion of the ancestral lands of San Juan have been
            sold or otherwise granted to the local company dedicated to the development of
            a major tourist enterprise. The community of San Juan is practically enclosed,


59 The Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, for example, recently noted that administrative and
judicial actions pursued by the Garífuna community of Triunfo de la Cruz to protect its right over
collective property "have been fruitless and the conflict has endured over 10 years." Report No. 29/06,

           surrounded by various private tourist developments all of which have restricted
           its territory.

     3. Land Titles Granted to Garífuna

     108. During the 1990s, the majority of Garífuna communities in Honduras have
           received a communal title to part of the land they occupy and claim that
           traditionally belongs to them.62 In 1992, the Honduran Congress passed the
           Agricultural Sector and Development Law (Ley Para la Modernización y
           Desarrollo del Sector Agricola, Decree 31-92),               63  pursuant to which, between
           1993 and 2004, 36 Garífuna communities and 6 Garífuna Associations of
           Farmers (Empresas Asiociativas Campesinas Garífunas) in the Departments of
           Atlantida, Colon, Cortes, Gracias a Dios and in the Bay Islands obtained full
           communal property title.64 In 1999, the so-called enlargement/extension process
           (proceso de ampliación) began and a number of communities that had already
           received full title submitted extension requests and obtained to regularize larger
           amounts of land that their previous title awarded.65

     109. However, the titling programs carried out by the National Agrarian Institute
           (INA) under the Ley Para la Modernización Agricola over the past two decades
           have not solved the situation of the Garífuna communities. In general, the titled
           areas do not include the entire ancestral claim of the Garífuna people, and most
           titles exclude important areas of use and resource management of the
           communities. In some cases, the titles received were extremely limited, and
           really only covered the so-called "casco urbano" where their housing is
           located.66 In addition, although the titles given to the Garífuna communities
           created enforceable rights, there was not attempt to solve the land conflicts and
           issues of occupation of Garífuna land by outsiders to the communities. For
           example, some titles contained provisions according to which the land conflicts
           affecting that particular area, such as overlapping of titles with third parties,
           would be solved later on with the possibility that INA could carve out from the


62Information regarding the history of titling of Garífuna land included in this section of the Report was
provided to the Panel by members of the Central American and Caribbean Research Council (CACRC)
now renamed as Caribbean Central American Research Council (CCARC). In this Report, the former
acronym CACRC will be used. It was also provided by the Garífuna organization Organización de
Desarrollo Étnico Comunitario (ODECO).

64Documents in Panel's files. At the beginning of the 20th century, Garífuna people mobilized to solicit
from the State so-called "titulos ejidales" for their communal lands under the Agrarian Law of 1898. The
amount of land that could be designated as ejido was limited. However, these titles were very imp ortant for
the communities and came to acquire a symbolic significance even though they did not confer fully
enforceable rights nor did they cover the full extent of Garífuna ancestral lands. A 1975 Agrarian Law
prompted another concerted efforts by Garífuna communities to obtain from INA "Garantia de Ocupacion"
(Occupancy Guarantee) over lands beyond the limits of the ejido or for lands previously undesignated.
65 According to ODECO's documents, 9 communities received title expanding their communal property,
while many other communities are still awaiting this type of land regularization.
66As already noted, information included in this and the following paragraphs of this section was provided
to the Panel by members of the Caribbean Central American Research Council (CCARC).

           titled area, and grant to the occupiers, land "invaded" by non-Garífunas. In
           other cases, INA granted the full property titles but did not appropriately
           register them; or a new title was registered in favor of a community, but the
           document did not refer to the title ejidal previously awarded to the same
           community creating a new situation of title overlapping.                   Moreover, some
           communities were not titled at all;67 or Garífuna families were issued individual
           titles over communal land.68




                  Photo 4: Title ejidal granted in 1901 to the community of Cristales

    110. It is also important to note that, along with titling for all communities, and titles
           over larger amounts of land, the Garífuna are also seeking to recover land that
           belong to them but have been occupied (invaded, since Garífuna people regard
           these occupations as invasions) over the last decades by non-Garífunas (in
           Spanish, this process is called saneamiento). As discussed more broadly in
           other parts of this Report, in many Garífuna communities, parts of the
           land over which the community have legal title have been illegally
           occupied, at times even with fraud or violence. While in the late 1990s some
           Garífuna communities were able to obtain an extension of the titles
           (ampliación), thus far their demands for the above-mentioned saneamiento
           have never been met. For this reason, Garífuna organizations, including the
           Requesters, have pursued legal and political avenues to enforce their limited
           titles.69 However, as it is discussed in other parts of this Report, the Panel was

69 Pursuant to an amicable settlement with the Government of Honduras following a petition before the
Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (see Box 6.1. in Chapter Six of this Report) regarding the
Garífuna community of Punta Piedra, OFRANEH obtained from the Government promise of funds for the
saneamiento of the title of the community of Punta Piedra. A further agreement with the a number of


                                                   31

            informed during its visits to the Project area that no funds have been pledged or
            earmarked for the saneamiento neither under the Project nor independently of
            it.

     111. Management Response notes that, according to the 2003 participatory Social
            Assessment that was carried out as part of Project preparation, the coexistence
            of different types of ownership and land use in the region have caused
            confusion and conflict among the community members, between communities
            and third parties as well as between communities and local and national
            authorities.70

     112. Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 above provide visual indications of these issues of title
            and land claims. The figures indicate, in various communities, both the areas of
            actual title (yellow borders) along with much larger areas of where the Garífuna
            people claim rights to collective title and related rights along the north coast of
            Honduras. The figures also show the corresponding land uses of the Garífuna
            people in these areas. The figure referring to San Juan illustrates, for instance,
            how land areas given in title to the Garífuna community do not include all areas
            that Garífunas have traditionally occupied. Instead, the titled area was
            configured to avoid areas settled upon by outsiders to the community.

     113. The Garífuna people have been purs uing these and other claims to
            collective title and rights over lands for many years, and struggling to
            address problems of illegal and/or unjustified occupation of lands that they
            consider belong to the community as a whole. The figures reproduced in this
            Report have been presented to the Inter-American Commission for Human
            Rights as part of the evidence provided by the Garífuna people in support of
            their land claims. Some of these figures also are included in the CACRC
            Report, noted elsewhere in this Report.

     114. It is not within the mandate of the Inspection Panel to pass judgment on these
            claims.    The fact that the Garífuna people are pursuing their rights over
            ancestral lands, however, is of central importance to this investigation, as the
            Requesters claim that the PATH Project may undercut and harm their ability to
            pursue and succeed in these claims. This issue is addressed in subsequent
            chapters of this Report.




Government officials concluded by OFRANEH in September 2006 (Acta de Entendimiento entre la
Organización Fraternal Negra de Honduras OFRANEH y Autoridades del Gobierno, September 28, 2006)
reiterated the Government commitment to assign INA the budget, by the end of December 2006, to begin
the indemnification payments to the occupiers of Garífuna communal land. The Requesters have informed
the Panel that this commitment has yet to be implemented and no action has been carried out thus far.

     C. Governance and Representation

     115. As already mentioned, the Request was submitted by OFRANEH on behalf of
            the Garífuna people in Honduras. Moreover, a key claim in the Request is that
            the Project is failing adequately to consult with OFRANEH as representative of
            the Garífuna people in regard to issues of land titling, in violation of relevant
            Bank policies, and that this failure is divisive and likely to result in serious
            harms to the collective title land claims and other interests of the Garífuna
            people. Thus, it is important to understand the organizational structures of the
            Garífuna, and how they represent themselves as a people.


     1. Garífuna Organizations

     116. In the 1950s the Garífuna founded several organizations (e.g. Sociedad
            Renovación and Sociedad Lincol) to organize themselves politically.                 71  These
            organizations can be considered the precursor of the main Garífuna
            organizations today, in particular OFRANEH and ODECO.

     117. OFRANEH, founded in 197772, began as an organization seeking brotherhood
            with all Afro Hondurans, but has since become exclusively concerned for the
            plight of the Garífunas. It refers to itself as a federation, and has developed
            structures to represent the Garífuna people over the years, including a General
            Assembly and an Executive Committee with various sub-committees addressed
            to issues of concern of the people.73 It also has had formal chapters in many, if
            not all, Garífuna communities.

     118. In general, OFRANEH seeks to promote the internal organization and political
            mobilization of the Garífuna communities.                  Its actions aim at obtaining
            recognition of the Garífunas' rights to land and natural resources, as well as at
            protecting and promoting Garífuna language and culture. OFRANEH has
            remained, over the years, the leading organization representing the
            Garífuna people. It has been, in particular, at the forefront of efforts of
            the Garífuna people to secure their land rights, alongside ODECO which



71See generally CACRC Study, Tomo 2, p. 35. During the 1960s, Ballet Garífuna Nacional and Danzas
Garífunas groups were born within a nationalistic movement of the Garífunas aimed at asserting the
legitimacy of Garífuna culture and its distinction from the national Honduran culture by embracing the
African origins of the Garífunas.
72One of the founders of OFRANEH was Santos Centeno, who, as a child in the 1940s witnessed
government-led murders in San Pedro Sula, a result of racism suffered by Afrohondurans and Garífunas
since the 1920s. In 1954, a young Centeno, became a member of the communist party and a co-founder of
the Sociedad Lincoln in La Ceiba, and participated in the major violent popular protest in Tegucigalpa
known as the Huelga. In 1977 he was a co-founder of OFRANEH.
73Estatuto de la Organización Fraternal Negra Hondureña (Statute of OFRANEH). OFRANEH received
juridical personality with Presidential Resolution No. 120-89 dated July 19, 1989, which also approved
OFRANEH's statute.


                                                      33

             also has played a key role in this effort, especially during the titling process
             of the 1990's.74

     119. The Organización de Desarrollo Étnico Comunitario (ODECO) is a prominent,
             well-organized and managed NGO whose primary concern is to reduce racism
             and to improve the economic and political status of Afro-hondurans in general.
             ODECO was founded by members of OFRANEH in 1992. The appearance of
             groups such as ODECO and OFRANEH reflects Garífuna leaders' increasing
             knowledge of national and international sociopolitical and ideological
             movements, and their interest in accessing the latter's funding and other
             assistance.

     120. The leadership role of these two organizations has its contemporary origins in
             the early1990's. Garífuna communities struggled for their rights to communal
             lands during the 1970's and 80's largely through the communal organizations
             such as patronatos and comites de defense de la tierra of individual villages.
             However, during the 1990's Garífuna mobilization reached new heights. In
             1992 ODECO was founded by OFRANEH members and both organizations
             took on many of the characteristics of the "new social movements" of
             indigenous and Afro-descendents peoples that appeared throughout the
             hemisphere in this epoch. The emergence of these two pan-Garífuna
             organizations at the forefront of the Garífuna movement greatly increased the
             effectiveness of Garífuna efforts to secure their rights to communal lands.

     121. After a series of preliminary demonstrations for their rights to land in the early
             1990's a coalition of Garífuna organizations, the Coordinadora Nacional de
             Organizaciones Negras de Honduras, of which ODECO and OFRANEH were
             the leading members, organized the Marcha de los Tambores. During this
             demonstration, which took place on October 11, 1996, thousands of Garífuna
             marched from La Ceiba on the North Coast of Honduras to Tegucigalpa, the
             nation's capital, to demand their rights to communal lands. They also demanded
             that the Honduran government adhere to the Covenant NO. 169 of the ILO.

     122. As a result of the Marcha de los Tambores, led by ODECO and OFRANEH, the
             Honduran Government made a formal commitment to title Garífuna lands.                        75

             Subsequently, ODECO played a key role in securing the original limited titles
             to the urban centers of most Garífuna villages. In more recent years OFRANEH
             has taken the lead in pushing for the "ampliación" and "saneamiento" of these
             titles and is recognized by the Garífuna people for its leading role in this regard.


74It is also worth noting that at one time OFRANEH seems to have operated as an NGO, seeking and
receiving funds for development and relief efforts.
75 Edmund Gordon, Charles Hale, et.al., 2002, "Indigenous and Black Organizations in Central America:
The Struggle for Resources and Recognition." Research Monograph for Ford Foundation (Mexico Office).
The most successful indigenous and Black social movements in Central America combine organizations
that are grass roots with organizations that are NGO's. It is the authors' opinion that even though their
relations are not always good, ODECO (NGO) and OFRANEH (grass roots) play complementary roles.


                                                    34

          As a result of this history OFRANEH and ODECO must be considered to be
          the primary institutions of Garífuna society concerned with the legalization of
          Garífuna land titles.

   123. The Panel observes that OFRANEH still plays a leading role in all
          Garífuna communities, especially at the grass roots level where it
          encounters great support. The Panel heard direct testimony in support of this
          during its visits. The CACRC study recognizes OFRANEH and ODECO as the
          two major Garífuna organizations, as each Garífuna community has one or
          more representatives in the executive board (Junta Directiva) of the
          organizations. The role of OFRANEH and ODECO in these regards is also
          reflected in a 2001 Presidential Executive Order (035/2001).         The Order
          established an Inter-sectoral Commission to protect the land rights of Garífuna
          and Misquito communities, and specified OFRANEH and ODECO as members
          of the Commission to represent the interests of the Garífuna people.76




                Photo 5: Panel team meeting with Project affected people



   124. There are, as well, other organizations which work for the interests of the
          Garífuna people. The last two decades have seen the creation of other Garífuna
          organizations, aimed mainly at protecting and defending the rights and interests
          of the Garífuna communities. Among these organizations is CEDEC, which,
          like ODECO, is an NGO, but far smaller. Other organizations are CIDH,
          working in small scale projects, FUHDECGAR researching and documenting

        the Garífuna culture, and Enlace de Mujeres Negras (Association of Black
        Women) specialized in education and domestic violence issues.


   2. Garífuna Governance at Communal Level

   125. The Garífuna people are also organized at community level. The majority of the
        communities have patronatos, whose members are chosen by communities'
        members. The patronatos are organized hierarchically and are normally in
        charge of regulating land rights of the communities.77 According to the CARCR
        study, every patronatos should be registered with the Ministry of Justice.
        However, many patronatos lack a formal structure and substantive powers and
        this has generated situations where some communities have more than one
        patronatos; the existing one has been dissolved; or some patronatos have sold
        community land. It is important to note that both OFRANEH and ODECO
        work closely with these community-based patronatos.

   126. In some Garífuna communities there are councils of elders, which participate in
        resolution of disputes activities. Many communities have committee for the
        defense of the land (Comité de Defense de la Tierra).78 In each town there are a
        few "traditional" voluntary associations, such as Sport, Musical or Dance
        Clubs, communal work parties for agriculture or building construction, and
        occasionally for political purposes such as supporting certain candidates or
        parties. Each community will likely have several small groups in each of these
        categories ­ each with exclusive membership and competitive with each other.

   Chapter III: Consultation, Representation and Participation of the
                                          Garífuna People

    127. A major element of the claim by Requesters is that Bank Management has
          failed to comply with provisions of Bank policies and procedures relating to
          consultation with, and participation by, Project-affected communities.
          Requesters contend that Project mechanisms for consultation and participation
          during Project implementation, especially for the legalization, titling and
          registration of Garífuna lands, will not reflect the preferences and interests of
          the Garífuna people, as required by OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples and other
          Bank policies.

    128. The Requesters state that, especially with respect to the "Mesa Regional"
          established under the Project,79 consultations are occurring only with people
          who cannot be considered representatives of the Garífuna communities because
          they were not chosen as such by the communities themselves. They consider,
          moreover, that the Project mechanisms have become divisive for their
          communities, and are likely to undercut their claims to ancestral lands and harm
          them as a people.

    129. In its Response, Management states that the "IPDP includes a broad and
          participatory consultation framework for indigenous communities" including
          "the establishment of a consultation framework through which indigenous
          communities participate in the process of defining land regularization
          procedures [the Mesa Regional]."80 Management states that a number of
          consultation events and meetings have taken place, and describes these in detail
          in their Response.

    130. Management further asserts that OFRANEH, the Requester, participated in a
          number of consultation events during Project preparation. According to the
          Management Response, "participatory mechanisms are an integral element of
          Project design"81 and funds are designated for consultations, dissemination of
          information and legal advice on land issues to the indigenous communities,
          including the Garífunas.

    131. This Chapter examines these issues in light of the relevant provisions of Bank
          policy.




79The "Mesa Regional" and "Mesas Locales" have been established as a consultation framework under the
Project. They are discussed in detail below.

A. Relevant Policy Provisions

132. The provision of full information to Project affected people, and meaningful
     consultation with them to enable their informed participation with respect to
     decisions that stand to affect them, are mainstays of the Bank safeguard
     policies. These core elements of Bank policy are of central importance to
     projects affecting indigenous peoples, as set forth in OD 4.20 on Indigenous
     Peoples.

133. Specifically, OD 4.20 provides that the Bank's strategy to address issues related
     to indigenous people "must be based on the informed participation of the
     indigenous peoples themselves" because "[t]he key step in project design is the
     preparation of a culturally appropriate development plan based on full
     consideration of the options preferred by the indigenous people affected by the
     project." The policy mandates the identification of "local preferences through
     direct consultation, incorporation of indigenous knowledge into project
     approaches, and appropriate early use of experienced specialists . . ." A
     project should provide for mechanisms that allows "participation by indigenous
     people in decision making throughout project planning, implementation, and
     evaluation." (Paragraph 15 (d)

134. OD 4.20 contains provisions on the particularly important question of
     representation of indigenous peoples.        It states that indigenous people's
     representative organizations "provide effective channels for communicating
     local preferences" and "traditional leaders ... should be brought into the
     planning process, with due concern for ensuring genuine representation of the
     indigenous population." (Paragraph 15 (d)

135. OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment also contains requirements for
     consultations with project affected communities more generally, and specifies
     that affected people and local NGOs should be consulted during the EA process
     about the project's environmental impacts and their views should be taken into
     account. The policy calls for meaningful consultations which may occur only
     when people receive relevant material about the project in a timely manner
     before consultations take place and in a language and form understandable and
     accessible to those consulted.


B. Consultation and Representation during Project Preparation

1. Consultation and Preparation of the IPDP

136. The Requesters claim that the Project carried out no consultation program
     before drafting the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP), which was
     allegedly distributed to OFRANEH, along with the Environmental Assessment,
     just a short time before "the only consultation meeting regarding the PATH and



                                        38

           the IPDP." They also claim to have proposed alternatives to the Project design
           during preparation, especially through the Sambo Creek document dated
           December 2003, but that none of their suggestions were taken into account to
           address inconsistencies in the Project's titling procedures and no options
           preferred by the indigenous peoples were considered.




                 Photo 6: Panel meeting with Requesters at Sambo Creek

    137. The Requesters also claim that their serious concerns about the Property Law ­
           still in draft form at the time of Project preparation ­ were not listened,
           although, they add, Bank staff knew that the proposed Law "would be key to the
           future land titling programs." According to the Request, the Garífuna's
           opposition to the draft Property Law was clearly expressed in a workshop held
           in San Juan de Tela in October 2003.

    138. Management states that OFRANEH participated in seven consultation events
           during Project preparation, between January 2003 and February 2004 (when the
           Board of Executive Directors approved the Credit financing the Project.)82
           These events related to the Project design, the IPDP and the draft Property Law.
           In addition, a "wide range of Garífuna stakeholders was consulted as part of
           the participatory Social Assessment and preparation of the IPDP in July-
           August 2003," including Patronato leaders, community leaders, individuals, and




82A footnote to paragraph 30 of Management Response clarifies that the preparation of the Project,
including consultations events, was carried out by staff of the PAAR project during 2003 and 2004. See
Management Response, at note 4.


                                                     39

           "civil society organizations representing the broad spectrum of Garífuna
           stakeholders."83

    139. Management asserts that OFRANEH participated in the two IPDP consultations
           meetings held on November 26 and December 2, 2003. According to the
           minutes of these meetings, in particular the December one, the participants
           were willing to discuss the Project and its documents and agreed "to consult
           with their constituents to appoint representatives to a [national consultation
           board], the Mesa Nacional Indígena."84 According to the Response, during the
           above-mentioned consultation meetings about the IPDP, those who participated
           did not raise major objections to the Project, while their recommendations were
           taken into account in Project design. Management states that "[m]any of the
           proposals mentioned in the December 2003 Sambo Creek document were
           incorporated in Project design and are currently under implementation."85.

    140. With respect to the concerns related to the Property Law, Management
           Response states that, under the earlier PAAR Project, an ad hoc working group
           that included OFRANEH was established in August 2003 to review the draft
           Law, and at an October meeting, to which seven representatives of OFRANEH
           participated, the working group's recommendations were discussed. The
           Response also indicates that on October 25-26 2003 OFRANEH organized a
           workshop in San Juan de Tela sponsored by the PAAR, where 109 Garífuna
           representatives formed seven working groups that presented proposals related
           to various indigenous peoples' issues and focused on the draft Property Law.
           According to Management, many of these proposals were incorporated in
           Project design. Among those, the Response indicates that safeguard measures
           were included to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in the resolution of
           land tenure conflicts; that participation in the Project is strictly voluntary; that
           "prior informed consultation with Garífuna communities is a pre-requisite
           before land regularization methodologies are issued and before field activities
           begin" and that "the Project calls for the issuance of communal titles to
           Garífuna communities."         86


    141. The Panel notes, first of all, that an IPDP was prepared for the PATH Project
           specifically in relation to issues faced by the Garífuna peoples. The record
           indicates that substantial efforts were put into the preparation of this IPDP.
           While important issues relating to the sufficiency of the IPDP are addressed in
           subsequent sections of this Report, and issues relating to consultation during its

83Management Response, ¶s 30, 31. The Response indicates that three focal groups, 15 structured
interviews with key stakeholders, and 30 household questionnaires were conducted in three Garífuna
communities in the Departments of Atlántida (Sambo Creek and Tornabé) and Gracias a Dios (Batalla).
84Management Response, ¶ 34.
85In this context the Response lists 12 land tenure issues that were addressed in Project design as a result of
the Sambo Creek document, including lack of titling and lack of registration of titles in Garífuna lands,
overlapping claims between Garífunas and others such as municipalities, private holders and protected
areas.

           preparation are reviewed below, the Panel finds that preparing an IPDP
           complied with OD 4.20.


    2. Differing Characterizations of Meetings during Project Preparation

    142. The Panel has reviewed the Project records regarding consultations carried out
           during Project preparation. It notes that a number of consultation meetings were
           conducted during Project preparation and that the Requesters and other
           organizations representing Garífuna peoples participated and had the
           opportunity to comment and expressed their concerns with respect to the
           Project and the draft Property Law.

    143. The Panel has reviewed the minutes of the November and December 2003
           meetings at which the Project in general, the IPDP and the EA were presented
           to the people. OFRANEH members as well as members of ODECO were
           present at these meetings. According to the minutes of the meeting held on
           December 2, OFRANEH expressed concerns about insufficient time to analyze
           in depth the documents brought to their attention, and about the Environmental
           Assessment lacking a plan to enhance natural resources.

    144. Similarly, members of ODECO expressed concerns in relation to the IPDP, in
           particular with respect to people's opportunity to participate in activities aimed
           at regularizing land rights and the procedures for regularization. It is also worth
           noting that the actual text of the minutes does not reflect the summary of
           conclusions, according to which the plan was well received by the participants
           who then committed to consult with their constituents with respect to the
           creation of a Mesa Nacional Indígena.

    145. In mid December 2003, representatives of the Garífunas met in the community
           of Sambo Creek to discuss issues related to the proposed PATH and IPDP.
           These issues are addressed in a document presented at the meeting, the Sambo
           Creek document mentioned in both the Request and Management Response.
           While the Requesters state that this document is a firm rejection of the
           Project87, Management objects to this characterization claiming that the
           document rather "praises the diagnosis of Garífuna land tenure issues
           presented in the IPDP."88 In support of its interpretation of the Sambo Creek
           document, Management reports a quotation from page 18 concerning the
           IPDP:

           "The excellent analysis of the issues that affect ethnic communities ... in general
           give hope to the indigenous and Garífuna communities of Honduras that these

87According to the Requesters, at this meeting, which took place on December 17-18, 2003 in the
community of Sambo Creek, Garífuna representatives "signed a document that presented a firm rejection
of everything that was established in the IPDP, while proposing several alternatives."
88Management Response, ¶ 37.


                                                    41

           will be translated into a concrete application of the design by Government and
           the World Bank, , with regards to the territorial planning issue ..."89 (Emphasis
           added)

    146. The Panel wishes to note that page 18 of the Sambo Creek document
           immediately continues as follows:

           "However, said hope is frustrated by a detailed analysis of the plan in which the
           following is to be emphasized:

        1.       the relevant legal framework in which the PATH is moving embraces laws
        and norms (Land Use Law etc.) which created, more than once, prejudices to the
        ethnic populations ...
        2.       In no part of the Plan there is a reference to the obligation of the State of
        Honduras to recognize at normative level the collective rights of the ethnic
        populations, in the absence of which the decent [Note: or, good] protection of the
        indigenous peoples and garifúnas of Honduras can never be obtained."
        (Emphasis added)

        The Panel further observes that subsequent pages of the 2003 Sambo Creek's
        document raise the same issues presented in the 2006 Request for Inspection.


    147. The Panel is concerned that the description by Management of the minutes of
           this important meeting omits reference to the major concerns being expressed
           by the participants, which are similar to those contained in the present Request
           for Inspection.


    3. Availability of Information

    148. When the Panel visited various Garífuna communities in June 2006, the team
           was repeatedly told by Garífuna people who are not part of any organization or
           group that little or no PATH information had been made generally available in
           the communities, that notice of informational meetings had not been made
           widely available, and that those Garífuna consulted were not chosen by the
           people themselves, but, many believed, by leaders and organizations selected
           by the PATH personnel. The Panel saw no evidence of written materials
           such as brochures, announcements for posting having been sent directly to
           the communities so as to let the ordinary people know what to expect.

                                               42

4. Conclusions

149. The Panel finds that several meetings were conducted during Project
     preparation, and that the Requesters and other organizations representing
     Garífuna peoples participated and had the opportunity to provide
     comment and express their concerns about the Project. This is consistent
     with OD 4.20. It is also the Panel's view that it is likely the case that PATH
     personnel and Bank staff thought they had informed the legitimate Garífuna
     representative organizations and leaders. A review of the participants to these
     consultation meetings shows that these participants are knowledgeable,
     articulate people that can nowadays be considered leaders of the Garífunas.

150. The Panel however notes the significant concerns about the Project and its
     "consultation process" expressed in early meetings by organizations
     representing the Garífuna people, in particular OFRANEH and ODECO. The
     Panel considers that these provided an early indication of potential policy-
     based problems associated with the consultation mechanism that was
     eventually to be established for Project implementation. These issues are
     considered below.


C. Consultation and Representation during Project Implementation

151. Consultations are particularly important for the implementation of the PATH's
     component related to indigenous peoples' land, because the execution of a
     number of Project activities, such as demarcation and titling, depends in large
     part on the options preferred and the choices made by the indigenous
     communities.

152. As noted previously, OD 4.20 sets forth specific requirements regarding
     consultation and participation. Among other things, it requires the informed
     participation of indigenous peoples and the identification of local preferences.
     In terms of the "strategy for local participation", it states that: ". . . [m]any of
     the larger groups of indigenous people have their own representative
     organizations that provide effective channels for communicating local
     preferences." These provisions are critical to achieving the basic objectives of
     OD 4.20 for indigenous peoples, including to ensure that "the development
     process fosters full respect for their dignity, human rights, and cultural
     uniqueness . . . and to ensure that indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse
     effects during the development process."

153. The Requesters complain about a lack of genuine participation of the Garífuna
     people in the Project decision-making processes. A focal point of this concern
     is that the Project has created and is relying on the Mesa Regional and Mesas
     Locales, which Requesters argue do not properly or legitimately represent the




                                       43

     Garífuna people. Rather, they contend, the Mesa system is having the effect of
     by-passing the peoples' legitimate representatives.

154. Management Response emphasizes that "community participation in the
     Project is voluntary and individual communities are free to choose whether or
     not to participate in the Project" and which land tenure regime they prefer,
     whether individual or communal. This is a choice that, according to
     Management, communities make "in the context of a participatory and
     informed consultation framework." Should the communities opt for
     regularizing their land under the PATH, according to the IPDP, the Project
     provides for the involvement of these communities in the process of
     regularization and titling of their ancestral lands through a mechanism that
     would allow them to intervene in the delimitation of the lands and in the
     solution of conflicts over their property rights. In this context, a consultation
     board, the Mesa Regional Garífuna, composed of [alleged] representatives of
     the various communities was established, with the main objective to coordinate
     the process of demarcation and titling, and conflict resolution.    Community-
     level consultation boards, the Mesas Locales, were also created under the
     Project to work closely with the Mesa Regional.

155. Management also claims that consultations are a pre-requisite to start field
     activities and issue land regularization methodologies, and maintains that it
     "endorses the Government's position to respect the decisions made by the
     Mesa Regional and individual communities regarding their land preferred
     tenure regime." (Emphasis added)

156. In light of the Mesa responsibility to make decisions on behalf of the
     communities and based on consultation with these communities, the Panel notes
     that the legitimacy of the Mesa and of its members as genuine representatives
     of the Garífuna communities is a key issue to address in order to assess Bank
     compliance with OD 4.20 in the preparation and implementation of the Project.

1. The Mesa Regional: Requesters Claims and Management Response

157. The Requesters have expressed strong objections to the process that established
     the Mesa Regional, its composition and the selection of the eight pilot
     communities were land regularization activities will be implemented. They
     believe that the Mesa Regional "has been created in spite of the disagreement
     of the communities, was not elected by the communities, [and] is not an
     organization that represents them." The Requesters claim that the Mesa is
     composed     of   people   who     cannot  be    considered   "other   Garífuna
     representatives" as stated by the Bank because its members are self-declared
     representatives of the Garífunas and were never elected as such by the
     communities. As a result, in the Requesters' view, the Mesa is an organization
     alien to the Garífuna own institutions and cannot be entrusted with fundamental
     decisions regarding the regularization of Garífuna land.



                                        44

    158. According to Management, the Mesa Regional is a consultation board that
           "includes a broad range of Garífuna stakeholders."90 This Mesa was formed in
           2005 following invitations sent by the Government to "representatives of a
           wide range of Garífuna communities and organizations, including Ofraneh, to
           participate in a meeting to establish an inter-institutional commission to
           organize the Mesa Regional". Management states that at a meeting held in
           Trujillo, Colon, on March 15-17, 2005, 112 Garífuna people, which included
           representatives of 25 communities, members of patronatos91, municipalities,
           the Garífuna church organization and organizations representing the Garífuna
           people, established the Mesa Regional de Regularización y Resolución de
           Conflictos (Regional Board of Regularization and Resolution of Conflicts),
           operating under the principle of non-exclusion so that all interested parties can
           participate and express their views about the Project.

    159. Management claims that one representative of OFRANEH was present at the
           March meeting and is now part of the Mesa. This person, however, is not one of
           the Requesters because, according to Management, the leadership of
           OFRANEH is under dispute, and the OFRANEH-Requesters refused to
           participate in the meeting that created the Mesa Regional.92 Management does
           not believe, as the Requesters do, that the members of the Mesa are "outsiders"
           to the communities or "Garífuna clowns".93 In addition, at the mentioned
           March meeting, the Response notes that "eight communities and twelve
           protected areas were selected by participants as candidates for participation
           and demarcation and titling activities under the Project."94 Management also
           states that Mesas Locales were created specifically for each community to work
           with communities' assemblies so that all members can participate in the
           Project.95

    160. Management states that there is "broad support for the Project", although it
           recognizes that there is also "diversity of opinions among various Garífuna
           stakeholders regarding the role of the Project in addressing their land
           claims."96

    161. The following section of this Report will address the Requesters' claims related
           to the Mesa Regional and, in this context, it reviews the patterns of Garífuna
           social and political organization. This section is based on information gathered

         the Central American Caribbean Research Council under the Bank-financed
         HONDURAS: Biodiversity in Priority Areas, (PROBAP) (GEF TF028367),
         and Management Response.

   2. The Creation of the Mesa Regional

   162. The Panel has carefully reviewed Project records, especially Aide Memoires of
         meetings concerning the formation of the Mesa Regional and has met various
         times during its visits to the Project area with members of the Mesa.

   163. Management Response indicates that "under the auspices of the Project,
         Government invited representatives of a wide range of Garífuna communities
         and organizations, including Ofraneh, to participate in a meeting to establish
         an inter-institutional commission to organize the Mesa Regional."97 According
         to the records reviewed by the Panel, at the onset of this process to form the
         Mesa (around the end of January and beginning of February 2005) OFRANEH
         had expressed positive interest in participating, but had also stressed that all
         Garífuna people would have to be consulted about the formation of the Mesa in
         a transparent way.

   164. However, when the invitation to form the future Mesa Regional was sent to
         community leaders and various organizations (including OFRANEH) by the
         Ministry of Justice on February 22, 2005, OFRANEH had already decided not
         to be part of this process. This invitation also referred to a workshop aimed at
         establishing an inter-institutional commission for the regularization of titling of
         land in Afro-Honduran communities. According to the Requesters, they refused
         to be part of the Mesa Regional and to select the pilot communities that would
         participate in Project activities, because the members of the PIU did not accept
         that these matters be discussed by each community before holding the
         workshop and making any decision.

   165. Despite OFRANEH's refusal, the workshop organization continued. The
         workshop was held on February 24, 2005. A provisional committee was formed
         to organize the first assembly, to be held on March 15-17, 2005, aimed at
         selecting PATH pilot communities.             Present were leaders of Garífuna
         communities,      municipal      authorities,   Governor,      the    Association      of
         Municipalities of Honduras (AMHON), MAMUGA, the Garífuna Catholic
         Pastoral Diocese Commission, and the Community Development Organization
         of Honduras (ODECO).98



97Management Response, ¶ 42.
98Management Response includes a letter (See Annex 2.15) dated June 9, 2005 signed by a significant
number of members of OFRANEH with which OFRANEH agreed not to oppose the Project, to
acknowledge the Mesa Regional and to become part of it. The Requesters told the Panel that all
OFRANEH members but one (a member previously expelled from the organization) only signed an


                                              46

     166. At the March 2005 meeting eight communities were selected to be regularized
           under the PATH and an agreement was reached to establish the Mesa Regional
           of Regularization and Conflict Resolution of Atlantida and Colon. During this
           meeting the principles and function of the Mesa Regional were established. The
           principles included respect for ethnic and cultural diversity, autonomy, will of
           majority, non-exclusion, efficiency, participation, and correction of procedures.
           99

     167. On September 22, 2005, the Mesa Regional met with Bank staff. The Mesa
           members described the steps leading to the formation of the Mesa and to the
           selection of the eight pilot communities. According to the Aide Memoire of the
           meeting, they stated that "the communities were selected following a
           consultation process and prior meetings with the communities." The Panel has
           found not record of these prior meetings with communities. However, members
           of the Mesa informed the Panel during its visits to the Project area that
           meetings were held with the eight communities after these were selected so that
           each community could ratify the selection and could express its willingness to
           participate in the PATH Project. One of the eight communities, Punta Piedra,
           refused the PATH. OFRANEH confirmed that this meeting took place. The
           pilot communities whose lands are to be regularized under the PATH are now
           seven.

     168. Alongside the Mesa Regional, Mesas Locales were created under the Project to
           discuss territorial issues and thereby facilitate the role of the Mesa Regional in
           representing communities' interests. Mesas Locales are also meant to discuss
           the operational aspects of PATH in general and decide whether the community
           even wants to participate at all.100

     3. Membership and Role of the Mesa Regional


     169. The Panel notes that the Mesa Regional's constitutive act as outlined in the
           document, "Reglamiento de La Mesa Regional" or "Wadabula, Mesa Regional
           Garífuna" (Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. 2006) is a complex and wordy document, not
           easily understandable by a non legal expert. The document states that the Mesa
           came into existence on March 17, 2005 in the presence of "leaders of Garífuna


attendance document related to the June 9 meeting; they did not agree to the content of the Aide Memoire
and did not sign it.
99Management Response, Annex 2.12. According to the regulations of the Mesa Regional (Reglamento de
la Mesa Regional. Wadabula: Mesa Regional Garífuna -Tegucigalpa MDC: 2006), the Mesa Regional has
four types of members: founding, contributing, active, and honorary members. Membership, however, is
unlimited. Founding members are those that participated in the March 15-17 meeting when the Mesa was
created. Active members are those that participate on a regular basis while contributing members are
lawyers who provide services, members who contribute monetarily, or those who provide in-kind services
and are approved by the General Assembly. There are a limited number of honorary members, who are
chosen by the General Assembly. Founding and Active members help the General Assembly and have a
full vote.

     communities, Municipal Authorities, a political governor, representatives of
     AMHON, MAMUGAH, la commission diocesana de la Pastoral de La Ceiba,
     representatives of ORANEH and ODECO" and that its stated purpose is to
     promote the program of the PATH.

170. The Panel notes that, according to this constitutive act, the Mesa follows a
     distinctly Western organizational rhetoric, including safeguards against internal
     corruption.   It also includes an "organigrama" of how the Mesa Regional
     would relate to other entities in conflict resolution. It was not understood at all
     by those individual Garífuna with whom the Panel spoke to in Honduras.

171. During its visits to the Project area, the Panel team met a number of times with
     members of the Mesa Regional and attended, as observers, a general meeting of
     the Mesa Regional and the Mesas Locales in Guadalupe on June 23, 2006.
     Although Management Response and the Mesa's constitutive act give general
     information about the Mesa, the Panel gained practical understanding of its
     composition and how it functions through a number of discussions with
     members of the Mesa.




          Photo 7: Meeting of the Mesa Regional and Mesas Locales in Guadalupe

172. Members of the Mesa Regional told the Panel that the Mesa is composed of
     members of various organizations: church, patronatos, sport clubs, dance clubs
     and others. According to the people interviewed by the Panel, the Mesa
     Regional was born in an assembly where all the Garífuna communities were
     represented. When the Panel met the Mesa Regional for the first time, in
     February 2006, some people present at the meeting introduced themselves as
     new members of the Mesa, having joined recently. They stressed with the Panel


                                        48

     that the Mesa Regional is an open organization that does not discriminate or is
     closed to any Garífuna.

173. For each pilot community, selected to participate in the PATH Project, a Mesa
     Local was also formed to be the linkage of each community - "mouth and ears"
     of the Mesa Regional, as their members characterize the Mesas Locales.
     According to the members of the Mesa Regional interviewed by the Panel, each
     Mesa Local is formed by ten or twelve people, four or five of which are also
     members of the Mesa Regional. The Panel was told that each member of the
     Mesa Local represents or speaks on behalf of thirty or forty people in each
     given community. They stated that the organized groups in each community
     select members within the groups to be part of the Mesas.

174. In June 2006, during the second Panel visit to the Project area, Mesa members
     informed the Panel team that they were holding community assemblies where
     leaders of each organization participate to ratify the decisions made with
     respect to the eight communities selected to be part of the PATH.

175. On June 22 the Panel met with a group of members of the Mesa Regional and
     the Mesa Local in Cristales who were preparing for the Mesa Regional Meeting
     to be held the following day in the community of Guadalupe. The Panel team
     noted that they were passionate about their work and sincerely believed that
     they could help in the development of their communities and not depend on the
     big organizations in La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa to come and do things for them.
     They seemed upset that someone had accused them of being paid agents and
     expressed disappointment towards OFRANEH for refusing to participate to the
     process.

    176. The day after, on June 23, the Panel team participated as observers to the
            general meeting of the Mesa Regional and Mesas Locales in Guadalupe. The
            meeting was held outside, under a palm leaves roof, open to anybody from the
            community who wished to attend. Some people present at the meeting to which
            the Panel talk said that they did not belong to any Garífuna organizations.
            Others defined themselves as "concerned citizens" who had known about this
            meeting through fliers distributed in their close-by community of Santa Fe.
            They stated that they attended the meeting because they wanted to be aware of
            the progress of the Project, and added that the flier they received also
            mentioned the visit of the Inspection Panel. They further stated that this was not
            the first Mesa Regional meeting they attended to; they had received other fliers
            before.


    4. Representation of the Garífuna People

    177. The systems of governance and representation that the Garífuna people have
            established for themselves, over many years, are described in Chapter Two.
            OFRANEH, founded in 1977, has developed structures to represent the
            Garífuna people over the years, and seeks to promote the internal organization
            and political mobilization of the Garífuna communities. As noted in Chapter 2,
            the Panel found that OFRANEH has remained, over the years, the leading
            organization representing the Garífuna people and has been, in particular, at the
            forefront of efforts to secure Garífuna land rights, alongside ODECO, which
            also has played a key role, especially during the titling process of the 1990s.101

    178. The Panel notes that Management, in its Response, gives the impression that
            there is little distinction between OFRANEH, ODECO and a range of other
            civil organizations in terms of representing the Garífuna people.                 In its
            description of "The Garífuna People", the Response states that "[a] variety of
            civil organizations represent the Garífuna" (emphasis in original). The
            Response then lists these organizations, including OFRANEH, ODECO, and
            many others, in chronological order. It notes that some of these are considered
            traditional grass-roots organizations (community or Patronato level), others are
            NGOs, while others are "second-tier national federations or confederations."
            The leading role of OFRANEH in representing the interests of the Garífuna
            people is not recognized. Rather, OFRANEH essentially is grouped as one of a
            variety of civil organizations that represent the Garífuna.




101It is also worth noting that at one time OFRANEH seems to have operated as an NGO, seeking and
receiving funds for development and relief efforts.


                                                   50

           Photo 9: Panel meets with Requesters during visit to Project area

179. The Panel considers this description to be inadequate. As noted above, the
     Panel finds that OFRANEH is widely recognized as the leading entity
     representing the Garífuna people, and that OFRANEH and ODECO together
     may properly be considered the two most important Garífuna organizations in
     representing the Garífuna people in gaining rights over their ancestral lands. In
     recent years, OFRANEH, in particular, has played a lead role in this effort.
     The Panel finds that OFRANEH (and ODECO) are "representative
     organizations" within the meaning of OD 4.20 and are in the position to
     provide an effective channel for communicating local preferences. The
     sources and basis for this finding are described in Chapter 2, and include
     information from field visits and testimony of local communities and experts,
     the CACRC study, and Executive Order 35/2001.

180. As noted, the Garífuna people are also organized at community level. With
     respect to land issues, in particular the patronatos and the comités de defense de
     tierra play important roles and are active in dealing with land issues affecting
     each community.


5. Conclusions

181. The Panel finds that the initial concept of creating an organization like the
     Mesa Regional to unite the leaders and representatives of each Garífuna
     community, was not inconsistent with OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples, in
     the sense that it represented an effort to establish consultations and
     participation with affected communities. The Panel notes, in this regard, that



                                         51

            the invitation to a workshop aimed at creating the Mesa Regional was sent to a
            wide variety of Garífuna organizations and actors, including OFRANEH and
            ODECO, the two major Garífuna organizations.

    182. The Panel observes that the membership of an entity established for the purpose
            of carrying out consultations with indigenous peoples is of primary importance
            to ensure that the objectives of OD 4.20, that indigenous people are not
            adversely affected by a Bank-financed project are met. Moreover, the
            significance of how such an entity might relate to existing organizations
            established by the indigenous peoples themselves as their representatives. The
            Panel notes that process like the Mesa that involves any members of a
            community may have the effect of marginalizing the existing representative
            bodies of the community as a whole and at the local level who have worked on
            the issues for many years.

    183. The fact that OFRANEH and ODECO ­ leaders of the communities in land
            rights issues - have chosen not to be part of the Mesa Regional si a serious
            concern. Despite their different views on many issues, both organizations claim
            that the Mesa was formed without properly consulting the communities at large.
            The Panel considers that a consultation framework for Garífuna people in
            which their leading representative body or bodies are not part and do not
            give their support and guidance cannot ensure genuine representation of
            the Garífuna people, as required by OD 4.20.102

    184. The Panel would also like to draw attention to some issues related to the
            formation and the functioning of the Mesa Regional as it currently stands.

    185. While the Panel has seen records of meetings that the Mesa Regional held in
            various communities after it was formed and had selected the pilot communities
            that would participate in the Project, it has found no record of communities
            assemblies held prior to the creation of the Mesa where members of the future
            Mesa Regional were allegedly selected, as claimed by the current Mesa
            members.

    186. In addition, the Panel notes that it is not clear who could become member of the
            Mesa, whether for example it is open only to Garífunas. In view of the Mesa's
            responsibilities (described above) in activities of land demarcation and titling,
            its openness to different people in terms of membership could open it to
            manipulation that may result in the harm the Requesters have described and
            fear.




102It should be noted that the CACRC study recommended the formation of a committee that reunite the
different organizations and other components of the Garífuna society and added that such committee should
secure not only OFRANEH and ODECO's consent, but also their guidance and support. See CACRC
study, Executive Summary, Section 3.7.


                                                   52

    187. The Panel observes that even if the present members of the Mesas are
           enthusiastic and ready to work, it is not clear that the Project plans in their
           entirety have as yet been presented to them. The Panel further notes that the
           Project could have pursued the involvement of OFRANEH and ODECO
           through, for example, the Inter-institutional Commission established by Decree
           in 2001 to protect the land rights of the Garífuna and Misquito people. The
           Decree establishing this Commission identifies OFRANEH and ODECO as the
           entities to speak on behalf of the Garífuna people. This Commission, however,
           has not been activated and is hardly even mentioned in Project preparation.103

    188. In light of the above, the Panel finds that the Bank's endorsement of the
           Mesa Regional as the basic consultation framework for the PATH Project,
           without the participation of OFRANEH and ODECO, is inconsistent with
           the core provisions of OD 4.20 on consultation, representation and
           participation. The Panel is concerned that the Mesa Regional has put in
           place a parallel system that is at odds with the way the Garífuna people
           have established, over the years, to represent themselves on the critical
           issue of securing their rights over land.

    189. The Panel appreciates the difficult situation faced by Bank Management in this
           regard, and acknowledges the extensive efforts made by Management to seek
           the engagement of OFRANEH and ODECO in the consultation process. These
           efforts do not, however, alter the risks created by the present situation. The
           Panel finds that the Mesa system has divided the community and could
           potentially undercut the ability of its leading representatives to work on
           behalf of the community to achieve its objectives for collective title to
           ancestral land.

    190. The Panel considers that this dual-system of representation, and the conflicts
           that it is engendering, has the potential to contribute to larger rifts and
           vulnerabilities for the people as a whole. The Panel notes that a process like the
           Mesa that involves any members of a community can have the effect of
           marginalizing the existing representative bodies of the community as a whole
           and at the local level who have worked on the issues for many years.

    191. The Panel further notes that, when it met with the Mesa Regional the first time,
           a Government official, non-Garífuna, was chairing the meeting, while Bank
           staff interviewed by the Panel stated that this should not happen. Bank staff
           interviewed by the Panel also could not provide very detailed information about
           the Mesa Regional, especially with respect to its membership; they seemed to
           rely mostly on general information provided by the PIU. Because of the key
           role given to the Mesa Regional in the process of land regularization, the
           Panel finds that closer supervision of the Mesa Regional and up-to-date
           knowledge by Bank staff is required under the Bank policy on Project

103The Decree establishing this Commission, and its consideration under the Project, are examined in more
detail in Chapter Six on Institutional Structures.


                                                   53

     supervision, OP/BP 13.05. The Panel finds that supervision of the activities
     related to the Mesa Regional does not comply with the applicable Bank
     policy.

6. Latest Development on the Mesa Regional

192. During its October 2006 visit to Tegucigalpa, the Panel met with the
     Requesters, who called the Panel's attention to the Aide Memoire of a meeting
     held on September 28, 2006, between representatives of OFRANEH and
     several representatives of the Government, including Director of INA, the Sub-
     secretary of State for the Ministry of Governance and Justice and the
     Secretaries of Environment and External Affairs, and the Project PIU
     coordinator.

193. This Aide Memoire contains an agreement (Acta De Entendimiento) between
     the participants covering various issues, including the existence of the Mesa
     Regional created under the PATH. The agreement provides for the immediate
     dissolution of the Mesa Regional. The Panel asked Management for
     clarification about this agreement and its implications for the Project.
     Management seems to have been unaware of this development until it received
     the Panel's request for information.

194. According to the Aide Memoire of the latest supervision mission (December
     2006) Bank staff were not informed of this Acta by the Head of the Project PIU
     who signed the document as well. He allegedly told the Bank that at the time
     the Acta were signed the Mesa did not have juridical personality. The legal
     existence of the Mesa will be determined only when the SGJ decide whether to
     give (or not give) juridical personality to the Mesa. In his view, the other
     representatives of the Government signed the document due to their lack of
     knowledge of the history of the Mesa. Therefore, the agreement to dissolve the
     Mesa had not formal effect and the Mesa continues to operate. The Aide
     Memoire concludes by stating the need for the Government to declare its
     support to the Mesa Regional as integral part of the Project.

195. In this regard it has to be noted that Management recently requested the
     Government to

    "Publicly rescind its repudiation of the Mesa Regional Garífuna Wadabula as
    the Project's participatory consultative framework for Garífuna peoples; or, if
    the Borrower no longer recognizes the Mesa, submit to IDA the rationale for
    this drastic change of strategy and agree with IDA on an alternative
    transparent and non-exclusionary participatory consultative framework for
    Garífuna peoples in the Project areas, which is consistent with the Project's
    objectives and meets IDA safeguard policies."




                                       54

196. The Bank made this request in January 2007 to the Government of Honduras as
     one of the conditions that the Government must comply with, to avoid
     suspension of further disbursements of the Credit financing the PATH Project.
     The Bank sent the Government a Notice of Threatened Suspension of
     Disbursement on January 10, 2007, because of lack of due diligence in carrying
     out the Project. Three particular problems are signaled in this letter: (1) failure
     to meet implementation performance targets, (2)"failure to adapt the Project's
     institutional arrangements to conform to the new legal regime for land
     administration established in Honduras by the enactment of the Property Law
     (Ley de Propiedad) after IDA Board approval of the DCA, " and (3) "support
     for the dissolution of the regional Garífuna consultative mechanism" which is
     required under the DCA and is part of the Project's Operational Manual.
     February 28, 2007 is the deadline for complying with the conditions described
     in the Notice of threatened suspension.

197. The Panel observes that the continued controversy regarding the Mesa
     Regional, and the Acta calling for its dissolution, provide another indication of
     the tensions that have surfaced about the role of the Mesa in representing the
     Garífuna people.

198. The Panel further notes that Bank Management, in calling upon the
     Government to "publicly rescind" its repudiation of the Mesa Regional, or to
     develop an alternative framework for this "drastic" change - - did not call for
     [adequate] consultations with the affected communities and their leaders to try
     to better understand the issues and concerns relating to the Mesa Regional. In
     light of the controversy and concerns already associated with the Mesa
     Regional, the Panel finds that the failure to seek input and participation by
     the affected communities and their leaders is not consistent with Bank
     policy. The Panel finds that Bank Management has not adequately
     adjusted to the many concerns raised with respect to the existing
     consultation mechanisms as required by OD 4.20 and OP/BP 13.05 on
     Project Supervision.

                   Chapter IV: The Project's Legal Framework

    A. Request's Concerns and Management Response

    199. One of the main concerns of the Requesters is that the Project will facilitate the
           application of certain provisions of the new Property Law104 that they believe
           may ultimately lead to the loss of their ancestral land and their traditional
           communal land titles as defined in local legislation and international
           conventions. For this reason, the Request claims that the IPDP assessment of
           the legal framework was inadequate and not consistent with the provisions of
           OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples because it did not consider the Property Law,
           which was under preparation at the time the Project was being developed.

    200. In their Request to the Panel and in other submissions to the Bank, the
           Requesters have raised various objections to the 2004 Property Law. They
           believe it will legitimize the ongoing violations of Garífunas' land rights by
           non-Garífuna people and will legalize the occupation and possession by non-
           Garífunas of land to which the Garífuna communities hold full communal
           property titles or have been occupying for decades. The Requesters also argue
           that the Property Law will push for a dynamic land market that favors elites in
           power, to the detriment of customary indigenous rights and in violation of laws
           that protect them. In the Requesters' view, since the Property Law is the
           essential normative component of the legal framework supporting the PATH,
           the Project will be the instrument through which territorial claims of the
           Garífuna communities will be denied and non-Garífunas will secure their rights
           over Garífuna land.     105


    201. The Requesters believe that the provisions of Chapter III [Article 93-102] of the
           Property Law which provides for the regularization of property for indigenous
           and Afro-Honduran people may be applied under the Project in a way that is
           harmful to their land rights and claims. They state that while Article 93
           recognizes the importance of ancestral land rights, the remaining articles in the
           Chapter are highly detrimental to the fulfillment of these same rights.
           Acknowledging the importance of ancestral land for the culture of indigenous
           peoples, Article 93 recognizes the rights of the indigenous peoples over the land
           that they traditionally possess and the importance of communal land tenure.
           Among the disputed provisions are Articles 97, 98 and 100. Article 97 provides
           that a third party who has valid title of ownership to the lands of indigenous
           peoples, and who has had and possessed the land referred to in such title, has
           the right to continue possessing and exploiting such land. According to Article
           98, a third party who has received title to the communal property of indigenous

           peoples, which may be nullified as a result of these characteristics, shall be
           indemnified for the improvements prior to the return of the lands to the affected
           communities.106 Article 100 provides that indigenous communal land is
           inalienable, not attachable and imprescriptible, but allows the communities
           themselves to terminate such communal tenure system, authorizing the rental of
           lands to third parties or authorizing other contracts that allow the community to
           participate in investments that contribute to their development. The Requesters
           view the latter article as the beginning of the end of their traditional communal
           property rights.

    202. In its Response, Management states that "the Project incorporates appropriate
           safeguards to fill potential gaps in Honduran legislation to safeguard the rights
           of Indigenous Peoples." It adds that the content of national laws and regulation
           is the responsibility of the Government of Honduras and that mechanisms are
           available for civil society to raise their concerns.107

    203. Noting that the Credit financing the PATH was approved in February 2004 and
           became effective in December 2004, while the Property Law became effective
           in June 2004, Management argues that the Project design "anticipated the
           possibility of a new law by providing mechanisms ... for the continuous flexible
           adaptation of the Project to the new law."108 The Response lists such
           mechanisms as:

           o the issuance from the Supreme Court of a Regulatory Decree (Auto
                Acordado) authorizing a parcel-based property registry in Project areas as a
                condition of credit effectiveness;

           o adequate access to legal advice and training before decisions are made
                regarding lands which are in conflict;

           o transparent decision-making mechanisms for conflict resolution on these
                land which include genuine representation of indigenous and Afro-
                Honduras groups;

           o a covenant providing that "no titling and physical demarcation of lands
                adjacent to Ethnic Lands will take place unless procedures that adequately
                protect the rights of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples, duly
                consulted with affected parties in a manner satisfactory to the Association
                and set forth in the Operational Manual, have been followed;"

           o adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for indigenous peoples lands
                as a trigger to phase II of the Land Administration Program.


106Article 98 reads: "El tercero que ha recibido titulo de propiedad en tierras comunales de esos rublos, que
por sus características pudiera ser anulable, previo a la devolución de las tierras a las comunidades
afectadas será indemnizado en sus mejoras."

    204. Management also notes that the regulations to the Property Law have yet to be
            issued and thus that the IPDP and Operational Manual for the Project "have not
            been updated." According to the Response, the Project's safeguards prevent the
            Government from launching field activities until the Bank has issued its non-
            objection to the land regularization and conflict resolution procedures.109
            Management states that if the land regularization procedures under preparation
            are approved as regulations to the Property Law and if they are consistent with
            the Credit Agreement and the Bank safeguard policies, "Management will
            endorse the incorporation of said procedures into the IPDP and Project
            Operational Manual."        110  The Response further states that, in light of the
            Project's objectives and the above-mentioned safeguards, Management "found
            the new law acceptable" and "concluded that the Project's safeguard
            provisions were not in conflict with the new law and the two could be
            harmonized"

    205. A summary of national legislation relevant to indigenous people's land rights
            appears at the end of this chapter.

    1. Issues related to the Legal Framework

    206. The Bank conducted an analysis of the legal framework regarding
            property rights of the indigenous peoples, including the Garífunas living in
            the Project area, in accordance with OD 4.20 during Project preparation.

    207. Issues related to Garífuna lands were raised in the Project documents (including
            a Bank-sponsored Legal Analysis of the Land Administration Project and the
            Project Operational Manual111), which confirm the existence of serious
            conflicts between indigenous communities and non-indigenous peoples, who
            have occupied and taken possession of ancestral lands, at times with fraud
            and/or violence. The Legal Analysis also addresses conflicts that have arisen
            because land considered to be the functional habitat of the indigenous peoples,
            e.g. the northern coast of Honduras, was declared tourist area or because it is
            subject to exploitation by farmers who disregard the ownership rights of the
            indigenous communities.112 The Operational Manual further recognizes that the
            "uncontrolled occupation of Ethnic Lands by people who are not members of
            the   ethnic     communities"       has    generated      harsh    conflicts   with    these
            communities.113

   208. Because of insecurity of land tenure derived from overlapping of titles and
           often illegal occupation of indigenous lands, the analysis of the Project's legal
           framework was particularly relevant during Project preparation. As emphasized
           in the PAD, the Land Administration Program, of which the Project is the first
           phase, was designed to be the "main instrument to implement"114 legal,
           institutional and technological Government reforms aimed at, inter alia,
           formalizing property rights for all Hondurans and facilitating access to land by
           the poor. When the Project was being appraised, a new Property Law was being
           discussed by Congress. The Credit financing the Project was approved in
           February 2004, while the Law was enacted in June 2004.

   209. The Panel notes that, according to Project records, at the Decision Meeting
           before appraisal approval, questions were raised on whether the Bank should
           proceed with the Project before the enactment of a new Property Law. The
           meeting agreed that to go ahead with the Project under the circumstances was
           still the "best course of action" because nothing prevented the Project from
           supporting land titling under the existing legal framework, which was
           considered quite adequate.115

   210. With respect to Ethnic Lands, however, staff agreed that two conditions were to
           be required: a) "insist on procedures for conflict resolution that adequately
           reflect the interests of indigenous peoples reflected in the Operational
           Manual... " (the latter a condition of Credit Effectiveness) and b) to include as a
           trigger for the second phase of the Land Administration Program the "adoption
           of a legal/regulatory framework for regularizing indigenous people lands."
           This latter framework would not "necessarily mean passage of new legislation,
           but may require passage of decrees to make existing laws consistent with ILO
           Convention 169..."116 The Panel notes that although titling and regularization of
           indigenous land will take place under this current first phase of the Project, this
           new legal/regulatory framework is required for the second phase of the Land
           Administration Program. The Panel also notes that staff argued, that "a
           procedure in the Operational Manual, no matter how good and consulted it
           may be, is not the same as a national legal framework ..." In addition, a
           member of the Bank's Legal department specialist in indigenous peoples
           matters was consulted about the specific legal framework covering indigenous
           peoples' rights to land under the proposed Project. The specialist observed that
           "receiving legal advice and having conflict resolution provisions in the
           operational manual based on a dubious legal framework may not help too
           much in a titling process."117

    211. Contrary to Management's statement in its Response that the Honduran Legal
             Framework lacked "legislation specifically addressing indigenous and Afro-
             Honduran land rights, including appropriate consultation frameworks,"                 118 the
             Legal Analysis sponsored by the Bank stated that indigenous rights are
             recognized by Art. 346 of the Constitution of Honduras and by Honduras'
             approval of ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples which
             became part of the "ordenamiento juridico nacional" (domestic law) on May
             10, 1994.119 The Legal Analysis also raises concerns about several amendments
             to the existing legal and institutional framework provided in the Bill of Law of
             the new Property Law.120 It states that these amendments must be taken into
             account in the design of training and outreach programs of the Project. The
             Legal Analysis also underlines the fact that the proposed Law may provide
             legitimate title in favor of people whose only claims to land are either
             uninterrupted possession or the fact that their request for title over the land that
             they possessed has not been opposed by the legitimate owner.

    212. The Garífuna people claim that the enactment of the new Property Law
             substantially changed the legal situation of the indigenous peoples' rights over
             land because it granted specific rights to people occupying Ethnic Lands (See
             paragraph 3 above) The Panel notes that this claim is consistent with the
             observations of the Legal Analysis.

    213. A few months before the Property Law was enacted, a staff member from the
             Latin American and Caribbean Region (LAC) specializing in social issues
             emphasized that although the wording of the draft Law seemed good, it might
             mean and imply different things, and thus an analysis by Bank's lawyers expert
             on ethnic rights was "strongly" suggested.        121However, the Panel's discussions
             with Bank staff during the investigation showed that the Requesters' concerns
             about the Property Law were largely considered by Bank staff only as a matter
             of national law rather than as a factor that could affect the Project and Bank
             compliance with its policy on Indigenous Peoples.

    214. This is consistent with the following statements included in Management
             Response:

           "Management notes that, beyond matters related to the Project, the Request
          raises issues about the Honduran Property Law"122 and "[t]o the extent they [the
          Requesters] disagree with the 2004 Property Law, and not with the Project per se,
          Management notes that the content of national laws and regulations is the
          responsibility of the Government of Honduras, and that the Government has put

      in place mechanisms, such as the Project's consultation framework, for civil
      society to raise their concerns on such matters."123

   215. OD 4.20 requires however that the IPDP contain an assessment of the legal
         framework in the country, including legal status of affected groups, as reflected
         in the constitution, laws and regulations. "Particular attention should be given
         to the rights of indigenous peoples to use and develop the lands that they
         occupy, to be protected against illegal intruders, and to have access to natural
         resources (such as forests, wildlife, and water) vital to their subsistence and
         reproduction." (para. 15)

   216. Garífuna people interviewed by the Panel during the investigation also stated
         that they agree with the Project objectives but only to the extent that it does not
         provide technical and financial support to implement a Law that all Garífunas
         view as highly detrimental to their rights over their ancestral land and
         traditional forms of ownership. In fact, not only did strong opponents of the
         PATH like OFRANEH and ODECO propose to the Honduran Congress to
         amend Chapter III of the Law, but also the Mesa Regional established under the
         Project prepared its own proposal to amend the Property Law, raising the same
         substantive issues as the two other Garífuna organizations.

   217. Notably, the Mesa members informed the Panel that they support the Project
         because they believe that the PATH and the World Bank involvement will help
         them to amend the Property Law and recover their ancestral land that others
         have taken. They believe that the PATH will help where everybody else has
         failed thus far. In their view, before the creation of the Mesa, existing
         organizations, including OFRANEH, who dealt with land issues did not obtain
         any result. They also hope that the PATH will help them in solving land
         conflicts with the invaders so as to obtain titling, extension of their lands and
         regularization of their titles (saneamiento). They added that during Project
         preparation, because PATH people did not mention "saneamiento," they
         doubted that this Project could help them. However, they explained to the Panel
         that the members of the PIU gave them more information about the Project and
         clarified what the PATH really was.

   218. The Panel notes that the new Property Law contains a number of amendments
         to the legal and institutional framework which are consistent with the objective
         of the Project and constitutes an essential part of the legal framework within
         which the Project is being implemented. However, as already noted, the Law
         also contains some controversial provisions relating to the recognition of the
         land rights of the indigenous peoples.

   219. OP 7.00 (Choice of Borrower and Contractual Agreements) provides in
           paragraph 14 that when local legislation is of relevance to the project/program
           financed by the Bank, the Bank "tries to work within existing law to the extent
           possible." It adds, however, that "[i]f the amendment of a particular law would
           impede the achievement of the project's objectives, the contractual agreements
           may provide that such amendment would constitute an event of suspension."
           (note 13) This is particularly relevant because a change in existing legislation,
           namely the passage of the new Property Law, was being discussed at the time
           the DCA was being negotiated and signed.


   220. The Panel also observes that the Requesters as well as other Garífuna
           organizations, including the members of the Mesa Regional created under the
           PATH, told the Panel that they have been very concerned about the content and
           implementation of the Property Law since it was under discussion in Congress;
           the Project files show that Bank staff were also concerned about the Property
           Law as it was under discussion in Congress during Project preparation and
           approval; and that the Legal Analysis states that "if the bill of law [of the
           Property Law] is approved, as it stands in the draft reviewed, it will entail a
           significant change to the existing legal and institutional framework since, in
           addition to creating new legal mechanisms ("figuras"), it eliminates or repeals
           existing legal institutions and norms..."

   221. In spite of these warnings to Management before and after the enactment of the
           Law, that is during Project preparation and after Credit approval, the Panel did
           not find any record that these changed circumstances, which are
           potentially directly relevant for the land rights of indigenous people, were
           acted upon by Management, aside from a inconclusive exchange of
           communications between the Region and the Legal Department.124 To the
           contrary, Management states in its Response to the Request for Inspection that
           during Project design it "anticipated the possibility of a new law by providing
           mechanisms ... for the continuous flexible adaptation of the Project to the new
           Law" and that after the Law was enacted, it "found the law acceptable."
           (emphasis added) For this reason, the Panel requested a legal opinion from the
           Bank's Legal Department to find out to what extent the Development Credit
           Agreement entered into between Honduras and the Bank would avoid any
           eventual harm to the rights of indigenous peoples as a result of the
           implementation of the Project (including the application of the Property Law as
           feared by the Requesters). (See next section of this Chapter)

   222. The Panel observes that the Operational Manual for the Project was approved
           by the Bank as a condition of effectiveness of the Development Credit
           Agreement after the Property Law had been enacted but no regulations on land
           regularization procedures had yet been issued. Management Response however

          states that "[i]f the proposed procedures are also consistent with the relevant
          Credit Agreement provisions and Bank safeguard policies, then Management
          will endorse the incorporation of said procedures into the IPDP and Project
          Operational Manual." Management adds that "[t]hese measures can only occur
          before land regularization activities on the ground affecting Indigenous
          Peoples commence"

   223. The Panel finds that as required by OD 4.20, the Project provides for
          measures to protect indigenous peoples' land rights. These measures
          include certain mechanisms of conflict resolution including conciliation
          and arbitration, the provision of legal advice and training for indigenous
          peoples and a covenant in the DCA that requires that "no titling and
          physical demarcation of lands adjacent to Ethnic Lands will take place unless
          procedures that adequately protect the rights of the indigenous and Afro-
          Honduran peoples, duly consulted with affected parties in a manner
          satisfactory to the Association and set forth in the Operational Manual, have
          been followed" (emphasis added). However, given the relative weakness of
          indigenous peoples, acknowledged in the Project documents, and the fact
          that the new Property Law gives specific rights to non-indigenous
          occupants of Ethnic Lands that cannot be amended or limited by
          regulations to the Law or by the provisions of the Project Operational
          Manual, the Panel finds that these measures are not sufficient to protect
          indigenous people land rights that may be affected by Project
          implementation, as required by OD 4.20.

   224. The Panel notes that, in spite of the key importance of the Property Law in
          the design and execution of the Project and on the rights of the indigenous
          peoples, and the concerns of staff and affected people noted above,
          Management did not include any references or remedies relating to
          possible negative effects of the Property Law in the DCA for this Project.

   225. This Project is the first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan (APL). According
          to Bank policy125 the APL provides for funding of a long term development
          program, starting with the first set of activities, based on agreed milestones and
          benchmarks for realizing the program's objectives. The Project will have an
          immediate effect on indigenous peoples' land rights during this first phase. The
          adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for indigenous peoples' lands,
          however, is only a trigger to process the second phase of the APL. The Panel
          finds that this is ineffective in protecting the rights of indigenous people
          during the first phase of the APL. If in the Bank's opinion there was not
          an appropriate legal/regulatory framework for indigenous peoples' lands,
          the Panel fails to understand why titling and regularization of indigenous
          peoples was included in the first phase of the APL rather than the second
          one when such framework was required to be in place. The Panel notes


125Board Paper on Adaptable Lending ­ New Investment Operations (R97-203), dated August 1997.


                                               63

           that to be consistent with the principles and objectives of the Bank's
           operational policy on Indigenous Peoples, the first phase of the APL could
           have excluded titling on Ethnic Lands and areas adjacent to Ethnic Lands
           until the enactment of a suitable regulatory framework.


    2. Panel's Request for a Legal Opinion and Response from the World Bank
    General Counsel

    226. In light of the concerns about the Property Law noted above, expressed by the
           Requesters and the Garífuna people in general, on December 20, 2006, the
           Panel requested from the World Bank's Senior Vice President and General
           Counsel126 a legal opinion on the rights and obligations of the Bank (and
           correlative obligations of the Borrower) regarding "whether and to what extent
           the safeguards included in the Project and in the legal documents, including
           specific provisions of the Operational Manual, effectively protect the
           indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples' rights on their Ethnic Lands from the
           harm that, in their opinion, will result from applying the provisions in Chapter
           III of the Property Law, with regard to regularization of Ethnic Lands under
           the Bank-financed Land Administration Project."              127


    227. This opinion was requested pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Resolution that
           established the Inspection Panel, which provides that "The Panel shall seek the
           advice of the Bank's Legal Department on matters related to the Bank's rights
           and obligations with respect to the request under consideration."128 The
           General Counsel, however, declined to issue an opinion on the rights and
           obligations of the Bank129 on the grounds that the request does not "form the
           basis for a legal opinion of the General Counsel" because "responding to the
           Request Memo through a Legal Opinion would be to address a question that
           falls within the Panel's own jurisdiction."

    228. The Panel emphasizes that, in order to ascertain Bank compliance with
           applicable Bank policies, it asked the General Counsel whether the safeguards
           mentioned in Management Response are properly set forth in the Project's
           DCA and are binding and enforceable obligations of the Borrower that would
           protect indigenous peoples from possible negative impacts that implementing
           the Project might bring about. In its Response to the Request for Inspection,
           Management states that the Project incorporates appropriate safeguards to fill

         the gaps in Honduran legislation to protect the rights of indigenous peoples. It
         goes on to assert that the Project design, anticipating the possibility of a new
         Property Law, provides for mechanisms to adapt the Project to the new Law in
         a flexible way and that the Project's safeguard provisions are not in conflict
         with the new Law.130

   229. According to the General Counsel, because of the separation of roles between
         the General Counsel and the Inspection Panel, the question of "whether the
         Project provides adequate safeguards (under applicable Bank policies) must be
         addressed by the Panel through its review of whether the Project meets the
         applicable operational policy on indigenous peoples." The General Counsel
         indicated that to provide the legal opinion requested by the Panel, the General
         Counsel would be required "to opine on what protection is effective in terms of
         Bank policy." The Panel notes and confirms its agreement with the General
         Counsel's view of the role of the Panel in this regard.

   230. In a reversal of prior practice, however, the General Counsel claims that the
         Panel requested a review of correlative obligations of the Borrower, and goes
         on to state that "even assuming, arguendo" that such a review is authorized, it
         "should be carried out ­ by the Panel ­ with references to applicable Bank
         policies and procedures." Although this contrasts with opinions issued by
         previous General Counsels, the Panel welcomes this clarification and will
         proceed accordingly.

   231. Although the General Counsel does not provide the Panel with the legal opinion
         requested, she offered certain "reflections" on the issues raised. The paragraphs
         below address the General Counsel's note and the Panel's analysis.

   232. According to the General Counsel, the provision included in the Resolution
         regarding advice from the Legal Department to the Panel "cannot be
         understood to be aimed at altering the respective roles of the Board, the Panel
         and the Legal Vice Presidency that are the cornerstones of the Resolution." In
         support of this view, the General Counsel cites two legal opinions about the
         Panel's operations issued by a former World Bank General Counsel, Mr.
         Ibrahim Shihata, in 1996 and 1997, and her own legal views provided to the
         Board of Executive Directors on October 31, 2006, during the discussion of the
         Panel's Investigation Report and Management Action Plan related to the
         Pakistan: National Drainage Program Project. In the General Counsel's view,
         the October 2006 Board discussion "highlighted the General Counsel's role of
         providing counsel and guidance on the rights and obligations of the Bank,
         separate from the Panel's discharge of its role in investigating the issues of
         Bank compliance with its policies."



130See Management Response at paragraphs 49-57 and Panel's Request at paragraphs 10-12.




                                               65

    233. The Panel respects its role as defined in the Resolution, and respects the role the
           Resolution assigned to the General Counsel in the context of a Request for
           Inspection submitted to the Panel. For this reason, and in the "continuing spirit
           of collaboration between the Panel and the Legal Vice Presidency", the Panel
           has sought a legal opinion to address a legal issue pertaining to the rights and
           obligations of the Bank, namely whether the Borrower's obligations are
           properly set forth in the Credit Agreement, and what are the rights and
           obligations of the Bank if the Borrower did not honor its obligations and the
           fears the Requesters express with respect to the Project materialize.

    234. With regard to the legal opinions referred to by the General Counsel, the Panel
           notes that the 1996 legal opinion given in relation to the Request for Inspection
           about the Bangladesh: Jamuna Bridge Project explains what remedies would be
           available to the International Development Association if, inter alia, certain
           provisions of an Erosion Flood Plan designed to protect Project affected people
           were not applied in accordance with their terms by the Project implementing
           agency or the Borrower. This opinion does not specifically address the distinct
           responsibilities of the Panel, the General Counsel and the Board in the Panel
           process. Neither does the second 1997 legal opinion cited by the General
           Counsel, which deals with the competence of the Panel ratione temporis in
           determining the eligibility of a Request for Inspection. This latter issue has
           already been resolved with respect to the Request for Inspection currently under
           investigation, since the Board of Executive Directors approved the Panel's
           eligibility determination and investigation recommendation on March 20, 2006.
           131


    235.    The Panel notes that when the Panel asked "whether and to what extent the
           safeguards included in the Project and in the legal documents, including
           specific provisions of the Operational Manual, effectively protect the
           indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples' rights on their Ethnic Lands from the
           harm, the term "effectively" refers to whether the safeguards claimed by
           Management were properly set forth in the legal documents and are a binding
           and enforceable obligation of the Borrower. The Panel further notes that this
           Request for a Legal Opinion is consistent with previous requests made by the
           Panel to the Legal Department, for each of which it has received a legal
           opinion, as noted above.



131 The Panel notes that there is an additional legal opinion of 1999 (Second Review of the Inspection Panel
Experience - A commentary) referenced in Ibrahim Shihata "The World Bank Legal Papers" (2000)
Martinus Nijhoff, 601, which although not referenced above, deals with the distinction between the Bank's
failure to observe its policies and the failure of the Borrower to respect its obligations under a loan
agreement. Shihata states that the Borrower's failure to honor its obligations falls outside the Panel's
mandate, unless alleged harm is attributed to the borrower as well as the Bank's actions and omissions, as
for example when harm resulted from the borrower's failure to honor its obligations and the Bank failed to
follow up on the borrower's obligations under a loan agreement. This latter failure is within the Panel's
mandate. (Resolution ¶ 12).

    236. For example, in 2002 in the context of the Uganda: Bujagali Hydropower
           Project investigation. the Panel requested a legal opinion as to whether there a
           was a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Government of Uganda
           to preserve the Kalagala Falls as an environmental and cultural offset in
           perpetuity, as Management had claimed in the Response to the Request for
           Inspection.132 The legal opinion ("Legal Advice in Response to Request by
           Inspection Panel") provided by the then General Counsel, on March 5, 2002,
           disallowed Management's claims and stated that Uganda had no valid, binding
           and enforceable obligation to conserve the Kalagala Falls in perpetuity. The
           Panel notes that the Panel's request for a legal opinion posed to the General
           Counsel in the context of the Uganda Panel's investigation raised a legal issue
           similar to the one presented in the instant Panel's Request.133

    237. The Panel also notes that the Panel's request does not ask the General Counsel
           to assess sovereign law and explicitly excludes this kind of judgment or
           assessment at paragraph 17 (i) where it states "that the issues raised refer not to
           the content or intent of national legislation but rather whether the
           implementation of the Bank-financed project may result in instances of harm to
           the rights of indigenous peoples over their Ethnic Lands as they fear." In other
           words, the Panel specifically asked whether the obligation to avoid harm as a
           consequence of a Bank-financed project was applied in the PATH Project.

    238. The Panel also notes the General Counsel's statement that assessing foreign law
           is not relevant to determining the Bank's compliance with its policies and
           procedures "in the present circumstances". The Panel notes that OD 4.20 on
           Indigenous Peoples requires, inter alia, that:

             "The project component for indigenous peoples development should include
             the following elements, as needed:

             (a) Legal Framework. The plan should contain an assessment of (i) the legal
             status of the groups covered by this OD, as reflected in the country's
             constitution,      legislation,      and      subsidiary       legislation      (regulations,
             administrative orders, etc.); and (ii) the ability of such groups to obtain
             access to and effectively use the legal system to defend their rights. Particular
             attention should be given to the rights of indigenous peoples to use and
             develop the lands that they occupy, to be protected against illegal intruders,


132Uganda Proposed Bujagali Hydropower Project Request for Inspection Legal Opinion on the Kalagala
Offset Agreement, from Edward Ayensu, Acting Chairman, IPN, to Ko-Yung Tung, V.P.& Gen. Counsel,
December 14, 2001, in Uganda: Third Power Project (Credit No. 2268-UG), Fourth Power Project (Credit
No. 3545-UG), and Bujagali Hydropower Project (PRG No. B003-UG) Inspection Panel Investigation
Report, May 23, 2002, Annex 1, ¶ 5 [hereinafter Uganda Request for Legal Opinion].
133The Panel observes that the reference to the "correlative obligations" of the Borrower is included in the
above-mentioned Legal Advice in Response to Request by Inspection Panel, which reads:"The Bank's
rights and obligations here must be analyzed in terms of the correlative rights and obligations of The
Republic of Uganda."


                                                    67

              and to have access to natural resources (such as forests, wildlife, and water)
              vital to their subsistence and reproduction." (emphasis added)

    239. This requirement, related to the content of an Indigenous Peoples Development
            Plan, is applicable whenever indigenous peoples are affected by a Bank-
            financed project. The Panel notes that the fact that regulations to the Property
            Law have yet to be issued does not shield the Bank from analyzing whether the
            application of this Law as part of Project implementation may result in harm to
            indigenous peoples' rights over their Ethnic Lands.

    240. The General Counsel also stated that OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples requires
            that harm to indigenous peoples resulting from a Bank-funded project be
            avoided or mitigated but that the policy "is not prescriptive as to the exact
            substantive and procedural details that local law should contain" to protect
            indigenous peoples. The General Counsel further indicated that OD 4.20 "quite
            clearly indicates that the main mechanism for properly addressing indigenous
            peoples' issues is `the informed participation of the indigenous peoples
            themselves'." (emphasis added) The Panel observes that this may not
            adequately reflect the political, social and economic weakness of the Garífuna
            and indigenous peoples in general, a fact that the Bank acknowledged during
            the preparation and implementation of this Project.134 Indigenous peoples are by
            definition groups "whose social and economic statuses restrict their capacity to
            assert their interests and rights in land and other productive resources."135

    241. The General Counsel's document ends its reflections with a discussion on the
            "Relevance of Honduras Property Law." The Response reiterates that
            regulations to the Property Law have not been issued yet, and, as a result, the
            Law's chapter on Ethnic Lands has not been used to title and register land and
            "has not been tested either domestically or against the provisions set forth in
            the Project's Development Agreement." For this reason, the General Counsel
            believes that a legal opinion on the "outcome of such a test ... would be purely
            speculative" and not "determinative."

    242. The Panel notes that the legal context in which a Project is designed and
            implemented is very important and Bank policies recognize this. In this
            particular Project, the legal context is important also because the Requesters
            claim that the Project will facilitate the implementation of a Law that they
            believe is highly detrimental to their rights and interests. The fact that the
            regulations to the Law have not been issued yet and the alleged harm feared by
            the Requesters is, at this stage, potential, does not exempt the Bank from


134At the Project's Decision Meeting noted above, it was agreed that Development Credit Agreement
(DCA) would include specific provisions "to ensure that Government takes positive steps to address the
land rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-Honduran peoples, in particular to safeguard against the
possibility of other land claimants taking advantage of the traditionally weak bargaining position of these
groups." (emphasis added)

                                                   68

           analyzing to what extent the implementation of the Project will be affected by
           the Law. The Panel finds that Bank policy required Management to carry
           out this analysis after the Law was enacted.


    B. Relevant International Agreements: ILO Convention No. 169

    243. The Requesters refer to a number of international conventions that they deem to
           be relevant for their claims. They state that the Bank policies "have been
           designed and are frequently reviewed so that the Bank, in executing its projects,
           respects the international rules and standards designed to safeguard the rights
           of indigenous peoples ...".136 More specifically, they mention, inter alia, the
           ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which
           recognizes and protects the rights of ownership and possession of indigenous
           and tribal peoples over the lands they traditionally occupy.137 According to the
           Requesters, Chapter III of the Honduras Property Law, which entered into force
           in 2004, violates their rights and interest over their ancestral land and as such is
           in violation of ILO Convention No. 169. The Requesters believe that the
           Project, by supporting the implementation of the above-mentioned Law,
           facilitates non-compliance with the ILO Convention.

    244. In its Response, Management addresses the Requesters concerns regarding the
           ILO Convention No. 169 by stating that "[w]hile this issue may be appropriate
           to raise within the jurisdictional context of other fora, such as Inter-American
           Human Rights tribunals, the World Bank's obligation in this project is to
           ensure compliance with the World Bank's applicable policies, including the
           Operational Directive on Indigenous Peoples."138

    245. The General Counsel's Response states that the Panel "suggests" that the
           Property Law provisions dealing with indigenous land may be inconsistent with
           ILO Convention No. 169 and that "the Project, by operating within the context
           of the Honduras Property Law, therefore contravenes Bank policy." The Panel
           emphasizes that, in its Request for a legal opinion, it did not state that the
           Project contravenes Bank policies, and indeed could not do so.

    246. In 1957 the ILO adopted the Convention on Indigenous and Tribal Populations
           (No. 107), the first international convention for this subject. This Convention
           was revised, and ILO Convention No. 169 ("the Convention") concerning
           Indigenous and Tribal Peoples was adopted in 1989. ILO Convention No. 169

136Request p. 2.
137Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO No. 169),
adopted on June 27, 1989 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation at its
seventy-sixth session, entered into force September 5, 1991. Honduras ratified the Convention in 1995.
The Honduran Congress passed in 1994 the law that approved the ILO Convention No. 169 (Decreto 26 de
Mayo 25 de 1994 que aprueba el Convenio 169 de la OIT sobre Pueblos Indígenas y Tribales en Países
Independientes).

           deals with Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.139 The
           Convention entered into force on September 5, 1991 and, as of March 2007, 18
           countries have ratified it.140 The Honduran Congress approved ILO Convention
           No. 169 in 1994.141 Honduras ratified the Conventionon March 28, 1995.

    247. The Convention affirms indigenous peoples' rights to identity, diversity, and
           differences within the structure of the national state. It is the only international
           legal agreement currently in force that exclusively addresses the rights of
           indigenous and tribal peoples.142 The Convention covers a number of issues,
           including access to natural resources, health, education, vocational training and,
           most importantly, land rights. It provides means by which these peoples can
           take control of their own lives and achieve greater recognition of their distinct
           cultures, traditions and customs and at the same time gain more control over
           their own economic, social and cultural development.

    248. The Convention establishes the duties of Governments to protect and promote
           the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples in their countries. It recognizes
           peoples' rights to retain their customary laws and customs.143 Most importantly,
           with regard to the Requesters' claims, the Convention includes comprehensive
           approaches to consultation and participation as well as to land rights.

    249. The Convention devotes an entire section to land issues, recognizing the special
           relationship of many indigenous and tribal peoples to their land. It requires
           governments to "respect the special importance for the cultures and spiritual
           values of the peoples concerned of their relationship with the lands or
           territories ... which they occupy or otherwise use." Moreover, the Convention
           recognizes the importance of "the collective aspects of this relationship".144

    250. Article 14, which is especially relevant to the Requesters' claims, states that
           indigenous and tribal peoples have rights to the land they traditionally occupy.
           It also provides that "measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard
           the right of the peoples concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by
           them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and
           traditional activities."145

    251. In order to protect these land rights, the Convention requires that
           "[g]overnments shall take steps as necessary to identify the lands which the
           peoples concerned traditionally occupy, and to guarantee effective protection

           of their rights of ownership and possession."146 The Convention also mandates
           that governments make sure that procedures and mechanisms are in place to
           resolve land disputes.147Additionally, the Convention requires Governments to
           safeguard the rights of peoples concerned to the natural resources pertaining to
           their lands.148

   252. With regard to the transmission of land rights, the Convention states that
           procedures for the transmission of land rights have to be respected and that the
           peoples have to be consulted when consideration is given to their capacity to
           transmit their rights outside their own community.149


   253. Bank operational policies applicable to this Project indicate that the Bank must
           ensure that the Project Plan is consistent with the terms of international
           agreements related to a country's environment and the health and well-being of
           its citizens and that the Project does not contravene international environmental
           agreements.150

   254. The General Counsel states that the Operational Manual Statement (OMS) 2.20
           (Project Appraisal) about the Bank's obligations not to finance projects not
           consistent with the Borrower's international obligations, refers only to
           agreements that are "essentially of an environmental nature" adding that
           "considering that the 1999 Operational Policy 4.01 on Environmental
           Assessment states in paragraph 3 that `The Bank does not finance project
           activities that would contravene [...] country obligations, as identified during
           the EIA' under environmental treaties and agreements, paragraph 24 of OMS
           2.20 has been superseded by OP 4.01 of 1999." (emphasis added)

   255. The Panel wishes to record its serious concern about the above statement,
           because it seems to limit, and even amend, existing Bank policies to apply only
           to agreements of "essentially an environmental nature.". The Panel draws
           attention to the following considerations: a) the text of OMS 2.20 does not refer
           only to environmental agreements. Rather it requires more broadly that a
           "project's possible effects on the country's environment and on the health and
           well-being of its people must be considered at an early stage... Should
           international agreements exist that are applicable to the project and area, such
           as those involving the use of international waters, the Bank should be satisfied
           that the project plan is consistent with the terms of the agreements." When it
           refers to international agreements, the policy mentions as an example
           agreements involving the use of international waters, which would normally not
           be characterized as "essentially of an environmental nature;" b) OMS 2.36

            (Environmental Aspects of Bank Work)                151 dated May 1984 and issued after
            OMS 2.20 contains a specific provision, according to which the Bank "will not
            finance projects that contravene any international environmental agreements to
            which the member country concerned is a party." If OMS 2.20 had referred
            only to international environmental agreements there would have been no need
            for a new statement issued a couple of months later to restate the same
            directive; c) the preamble of OP 4.01 on environmental assessment lists
            specifically which operational policies are being replaced by the new OP/BP.
            This list includes OMS 2.36 because of its environmental nature, but does not
            refer to OMS 2.20, which is of a more general nature and refers to Project
            appraisal. The Panel observes that the current table of contents of the
            Operational Manual includes the complete OMS 2.20 as applicable to Bank-
            financed operations.     152


     256. The Panel recognizes that the Bank is responsible for compliance with its own
            policies and procedures. But it also notes that Honduras is a party to ILO
            Convention No. 169. The General Counsel's Response indicates that OD 4.20
            does not require compliance with ILO Convention No. 169.                             The Panel
            observes that OD 4.20 broadly reflects the spirit and provisions of ILO
            Convention No. 169. 153

     257. Some Bank staff raised issues during Project preparation regarding possible
            challenges to land regularization and titling procedures if they were carried out
            in violation of ILO Convention No. 169. Project documents, including the
            Operational Manual and the Environmental Assessment, address the land rights
            of indigenous peoples in the context of the rights and interests over their
            ancestral land as explicitly established in the Convention.

     258. The Panel notes that it is a matter for Honduras to implement the obligations of
            an international agreement to which it is party and does not comment on this
            matter. However, the Panel is concerned that the Bank, consistently with OMS
            2.20, did not adequately consider whether the proposed Project plan and its
            implementation would be consistent with ILO Convention No. 169.




151OMS 2.36 (Environmental Aspects of Bank Work) ¶ 9 (g), which reads: "The Bank ...will not finance
projects which would significantly modify natural areas designated by international conventions as World
Heritage sites or Biosphere Reserves, by national legislation as national parks, wildlife refuges, or other
protected areas...". OMS 2.36 (Environmental Aspects of Bank Work) has been replaced by OP/BP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment) issued in January 1999.
152The Panel notes that both ILO and the World Bank are specialized agencies of the United Nations and
this seems to be an additional reason for the World Bank to refrain from financing activities that will not be
consistent with the provisions of ILO Convention No. 169.
153The Panel was informed that ILO Convention No. 169 was not mentioned in OD 4.20 because at the
time the policy was drafted, the Convention had been ratified only by two countries. As noted in the
Section C of this Chapter, as of March 2007, ILO Convention No. 169 has been ratified by 18 countries,
including Honduras.

    C. National Legislation Relevant to Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples

    259. The 1982 Constitution of Honduras recognizes the special status of indigenous
           peoples in Article 346, which provides that the State must develop measures to
           protect the rights and interests of the indigenous communities, especially with
           respect to the land and forests they occupy.154 Further, Article 107, which
           prohibits foreigners from owning national, municipal or private lands land
           within 40km of international borders and the coastline, is also relevant for the
           land rights of the Garífuna people, whose communities, including those
           selected to participate in Project activities, are mostly located in the northern
           coastal areas of Honduras. However, Art 107 further provides that a special law
           may create exceptions to the constitutional prohibition, for urban lands or areas
           destined for tourist development. Honduras Congress passed a special law
           allowing non-Hondurans to own urban land affected by Art. 107 in 1990
           (Decree 90/1990). The constitutionality of this decree was challenged, but the
           Supreme Court of Honduras decided in 2005 that the law is in fact
           constitutional.

    260. Honduras has adopted international conventions protecting the rights of
           indigenous peoples over their Ethnic Lands, in particular ILO Convention No.
           169. Honduras has ratified ILO Convention No. 169 in 1994 through Decree
           26-94. 155

    261. Management claims that Honduras does not have, to date, a specific law for
           indigenous peoples and that a trigger for the second phase of the Bank-financed
           Land Administration Program, of which the Project under investigation is the
           first phase, is precisely the "adoption of a legal/regulatory framework for
           Indigenous Peoples lands."

    262. In 2004, Congress passed a new Property Law, which in Chapter III provides
           for the regularization of property for indigenous and Afro-Honduran people.
           The Panel notes that during its first visit to Honduras, the Panel met with a
           former Government official who stated that Chapter III of the Property Law
           was meant to implement ILO Convention No. 169.

    263. Other laws relevant to land rights of indigenous people are described below.
           The Agricultural Sector and Development Law, entered into force in 1993,
           served as the legal framework for the massive titling of Garífuna lands that took
           place in the 1990s. (See also supra, Chapter Two). Art. 65, amending Art. 92 of
           the Agrarian Law (Decreto Ley Nº 170 de 1974), establishes that indigenous
           communities that have occupied rural land for a period of at least 3 years


154Honduras, Political Constitution, Decreto Numero Nº 131, January 11, 1982, Article 346 reads, "Es
deber del Estado dictar medidas de protección de los derechos e intereses de las comunidades indígenas
existentes en el país, especialmente de las tierras y bosques donde estuvieren asentadas."

            receive full property title, issued by the INA, free of charge.                   156 This law is
            regulated by Regulation 1093-93 which, at Art. 41, also establishes that the
            tenure of communities who pacifically occupy national forest areas before the
            law entered into force is to be regularized through contracts of usufruct or forest
            management of medium and long term. Contracts of usufruct are contracts
            between the State Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR) and any natural
            or juridical person (beneficiary) to establish conditions, norms and technical
            procedures for the use or usufruct by the beneficiary of national forests for a
            specified period of time.

     264. Additional laws which have provisions affecting indigenous people's lands
            include the following: the law creating the Honduran Corporation for Forest
            Development (COHDEFOR / Law 103-1974); the Environment Law (Ley
            General de Ambiente 104 ­ 1993) which establishes the participation of ethnic
            communities in the process of protection and use of natural resources; and the
            Forest Law (Ley Forestal) which classifies as forests areas, inter alia, lands
            granted in trust to indigenous communities under State supervision.157

     265. Particularly worthy of mention is also the Law of Municipalities, which
            regulates, inter alia, the administration of ejidos. Ejidos are lands owned by a
            municipality for the use and enjoyment of people who live in the municipality.
            Ejidos may be urban or rural. Municipalities administer the ejidos and may title
            urban ejido lands, while INA is responsible for titling rural ejido lands. Article
            70 of the law of municipalities regulates this case. It provides that
            municipalities can title land they own (and which are not destined for forest
            use) in favor of third parties. They may title urban ejido land in full property to
            communities who occupy and possess it, if they request it and for a charge not
            inferior to 10% of the latest cadastral value of the land. However, Article 70
            also establishes that if municipalities request it, INA can title ejido lands in
            favor of the municipality itself, free of charge. This system is particularly
            important for land rights of indigenous peoples, because some communities do



156The Agrarian Law of 1898 legalized the ejido system, through which lands that belonged to the State
were transferred to communities and municipalities for their use and enjoyment, while the State maintained
the property right. The first Garífuna community that asked for a "titolo ejidal" (title for the use of the
ejido) was the community of Iriona; the title was granted in 1915. This ejido system remained substantively
the same with the new Agrarian Law passed in 1924. However, occupations of Garífuna lands had already
started and neither the Agrarian Laws nor the ejido titles were able to restrain this phenomenon. The first
Agrarian Reform was implemented in Honduras in 1962 pursuant to a new Agrarian Law, which
recognized the property rights of the indigenous peoples over land, forests, water bodies and ejidos that the
people were already using, or had title over it or simply had been occupying for unmemorable time.156
Nevertheless, illegal occupation of Garífuna lands continued. A second Agrarian Reform was implemented
several years later, in 1975. The new Agrarian Law however marked a step backwards for indigenous
people and the recognition of the land rights. The customary land rights typical of the Garífuna people did
not find protection in the new law and the rate of invasion of Garífuna land increased dramatically.
157Ley Forestal, Decreto 85 del 1971, Art. 10 reads: "Por su régimen de propiedad, las áreas forestales se
clasifican así: [...] 2) Areas Forestales Privadas: [...] b) Areas Forestales en fideicomiso poseídas por las
comunidades tribales bajo la tutela del Estado."


                                                      74

            not have a full property title, but hold certificate of occupation over lands
            belonging to the municipalities.158

    266. In addition, Article 125 of the Law of Municipality, as amended by Decree 127-
            2000,159 provides that each municipality must demarcate, through a resolution,
            the urban boundaries of all the human settlements or communities within its
            jurisdiction. The fourth paragraph of Art. 125, as amended, also establishes that
            this resolution, to be notified, inter alia, to INA and the Ministry of Justice,
            must respect the provision of the ILO Convention No. 169, approved by Decree
            26-94 of May 10, 1994.

    267. As noted above, Executive Agreement No. 035-2001 provides for establishing a
            "Comision Intersectorial de titulación, ampliación, saneamiento y protección
            de las tierras de las comunidades Garífunas y miskitas de Honduras" (Inter-
            sectoral Commission for titling, extension, recovery and protection of the lands
            of the Garífuna and Mosquito communities of Honduras.)                    160   The Requesters
            called this Agreement and the Commission to the Panel's attention because the
            main objective of this Commission would be to contribute in an effective
            manner to guarantee the property rights of the Garífuna and Misquito
            communities. According to the Agreement, this protection would extend not
            only to the lands occupied by these communities, but also to those "that
            constitute their functional habitat and are regarded as ancestral [lands] under
            the ILO Convention No. 169."161




158According to the Law of Municipalities, Article 70, urban lands are those located within the urban
centre of a municipalities, where people are settled. All others areas are considered rural.

              Chapter V: Compliance with Environmental Policies


   A. Requesters' claims and Management Response

   268. According to the Request, the Bank did not comply with OP 4.01 on
          Environmental Assessment because the environmental assessment for the
          Project, while recognizing the issue of overlap of protected areas and territories
          claimed by Garífuna people, does not provide that the Garífuna communities
          may manage or co-manage their land to restore their control over their
          "functional habitat" that they have preserved for centuries. The claim that they
          are not aware of any measures "designed to eliminate or at least mitigate the
          presence of government institutions in the management of the protected areas
          in favor of the permanent presence of the members of the communities."162

   269. The Request claims that the management of these areas is already given to
          institutions defined in the Project's EA, in particular to NGOs with no
          participation of indigenous communities provided or required. The Request
          notes that almost all of the NGOs and institutions indicated by the PATH'
          Environmental Assessment (EA) as responsible for the management of the
          protected areas do not contemplate the presence of indigenous elements. For
          example, the Request claims that the Project EA provides that the Serra Río
          Tinto Forest Reserve, which is not yet established as protected area, will be
          managed by the NGO known as MOPAWI, a non-Garífuna NGO that does not
          represent the interests of the Garífuna people.163 The Request also states that
          Project documents indicate that part of the Punta Izopo reserve, claimed by the
          community of Triunfo de la Cruz, already has been handed over to an NGO that
          is alien to the community. Similarly, the Request claims that the demarcation of
          the water limits is not being carried out.

   270. In its Response, Management states that the Project was assigned
          environmental Category B and the Environmental Assessment identified among
          the potential impacts "the possible overlap between existing communities (both
          indigenous and non-indigenous) and protected areas."164 Since demarcation
          may result in restriction of access to resources for local communities,
          Management observes that a Process Framework and Environmental
          Management Plan were developed. The Response adds that, according to the
          Process Framework, "protected areas demarcation will proceed only if and
          when local communities agree."165

   271. The Response indicates that co-management of protected areas by agencies,
           NGOs and communities is provided for in the Process Framework. It also
           claims that the listings in EA tables 6 through 11 "in no way constitutes an act
           of `establishing in advance the delivery of territory to outsiders'", as claimed in
           the Request, and "should not be interpreted as a Project proposal or
           endorsement of those organizations." Rather, the list reflects a relationship
           between Government and those organizations.166 Management adds that water
           limits of protected areas will be demarcated on a case by case basis, based on
           specific circumstances.

   272. The Response also claims that "strict provisions for the recognition and
           demarcation of land areas in favor of indigenous communities" are envisaged
           in the Process Framework for cases of overlap between land claims and
           protected areas.167 Management further states that no activities will take place
           within or near Sierra Río Tinto Forest Reserve, as it is a proposed protected
           area and therefore excluded from the Project per Section 3.10 of the Credit
           Agreement. With regard to Punta Izopo, Management reiterates that the Credit
           Agreement contains safeguards for affected communities regarding the
           demarcation and titling of lands "adjacent to Ethnic lands."



   1. Demarcation of Protected Areas and Potential Overlap with Garífuna Lands

   273. OP 4.01 states that an EA, among other things, "evaluates a project's potential
           environmental risks and impacts in its area of influence" and "identifies ways of
           improving project . . . design and implementation by preventing, minimizing,
           mitigating or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing
           positive impacts . . ."

   274. The Panel reviewed the Environmental Assessment and related documents to
           assess their consideration of the issue of the possible overlap between protected
           areas and Garífuna lands, in light of the concerns stated by Requesters. The
           Panel notes that the environmental assessment for the Project identifies the
           possible overlap of protected areas and Garífuna lands as a potential impact of
           concern, [Matrix A], and the possibility that communities would be restricted
           from these areas. The EA also, constructively, notes that the planning process
           for protected areas was created "without considering the social, cultural and
           environmental conditions of the communities" and states the "imperative" to
           formulate policies relating to protected areas in an integrated way with
           communities. 168

275. As noted above, Management Response claims that "protected area
     demarcation will proceed only if and when local communities agree" and refers
     to "page 6, first paragraph of Process Framework", which reads as follows:

     "For communities settled within the limits of a protected area [occupied by
     other recognized communities] or that frequently use natural resources [within
     the area], the PATH together with the competent government authorities (AFE-
     COHDEFOR and INA) will establish lines of actions that will provide for
     pacific and sustainable coexistence between the communities, while the
     situation of the community which is not recognized is solved...the delineation
     and demarcation will occur only if both communities agree. Mechanism of
     conciliation and arbitration in accordance with the related law, as well as
     Mesas Interetnicas and other instances of conciliation, will be provided."

     The Process Framework goes on to say that:

     "For rural communities, composed of ladinos, indigenous peoples or Afro-
     Hondurans who live or frequently use the natural resources within legally
     declared protected areas, the following procedures will be applied:
   - The PATH, after the delineation and demarcation has been completed, will
   conduct the land survey identifying parcels of land and occupants
   - Simultaneously...will present the Management Plan for Protected Areas to
   communities and other relevant parties by means of a participatory process;
   - This process seeks to confirm the commitment for the execution of the activities
   included in the management plan and the annual operational plans. This
   confirmation is done after delivering Occupation Certificates that support the
   rights of the occupier and establishes his consent to participate in the plan
   execution."

276. Management Response's claim that the demarcation of a protected area will
     occur only if and when local communities agree does not seem to find
     confirmation in the Process Framework, which provides for communities to be
     able to consent or not to demarcation only in the specific case involving two
     communities both either living or using resources in the same protected area. In
     this latter case, the delimitation/demarcation will occur only if both
     communities agree and means of conciliation or arbitration can be resorted to
     for this purpose.

277. On the other hand, when one community, indigenous or non-indigenous, lives
     or uses resources in a protected area (and no conflict exists with another
     community), the demarcation will occur anyway, and the community will
     receive a certificate of occupation of the area. In the section of the Process
     Framework headed "Protected Areas and Indigenous Communities" there is no
     statement preventing the demarcation of the protected area should the
     community disagree.




                                       78

   278. However, the Panel notes that the Process Framework also provides that "areas
           where indigenous communities are present will be recognized and delineated,
           even in cases where all or part of a community is within the limits of a
           protected area."169

   279. The Credit Agreement indicates further that only legally established protected
           areas (with a Decree) would be eligible for demarcation under the Project; that
           no private land titles will be issued "in areas within or adjacent (a) Protected
           Areas unless the boundaries of said Protected Areas, have been delineated in a
           manner satisfactory to the Association; and/or (b) other critical natural
           habitats (areas of known high conservation value), unless the Borrower has
           issued a decree establishing new Protected Areas" (Section 3.10 of the Credit
           Agreement); and no titling or physical demarcation on lands adjacent to Ethnic
           Lands would take place unless procedures that adequately protect the interests
           of Indigenous Peoples have been followed (Section 3.11 of the Credit
           Agreement).

   280. In light of the foregoing, although according to the Process Framework the
           demarcation of protected areas that overlap with Ethnic Lands may take place
           regardless of the consent of the communities, the Panel notes that the Process
           Framework establishes a preference for demarcating the land in favor of
           indigenous communities even when the land is within a protected area. The
           Panel also notes the provisions of the Credit Agreement that mean to protect the
           rights of the land indigenous communities (See Chapter 4 for a detailed
           discussion of these provisions.) The Panel finds that the identification of the
           issue of overlap between protected areas and Ethnic Lands in the EA is
           consistent with OP 4.01. The Panel also finds that the provision of the
           Process Framework providing for the recognition and demarcation of land
           areas in favor of indigenous communities in case of the mentioned overlap
           is consistent with the objectives of the OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples.

   281. However, the Panel notes that the implementation of the Process Framework
           may face challenging circumstances. An example of this is the particular
           situation of the Punta Izopo National Park, which overlaps with land claimed by
           the community of Triunfo de la Cruz in the Department of Atlantida. Punto
           Izopo is a national park of 18,820 ha at the far eastern end of the Triunfo de la
           Cruz communal land claim and was formerly an area utilized by the community
           for hunting and gathering activities. It is also adjacent to important community
           fishing grounds. Punta Izopo was declared protected area with Decree 261-2000
           and is now managed by the Fundación para la Protección de Lancetilla, Punta
           Sal y Texiguat (PROLANSATE).170 The Panel was informed by the local
           communities and has found confirmation of these allegations in the CACRC

         study171 that many parts of this protected area have been fenced off and access
         prohibited. The members of the community of Triunfo have no access to this
         area, except to the ocean areas, although they claim this is land that belongs to
         the community. Many Garífuna residents of Triunfo de la Cruz have not visited
         this section of their territory for years because they are afraid of security guards.




               Photo 11: Fencing in Punta Izopo Protected Area
               (Courtesy Dr. Edmund T. Gordon)

   282. The Panel notes that the situation of Punta Izopo is an example of how, in
         reality, questions relating to the demarcation of protected areas have been
         and may be influenced by economically powerful vested interests. This
         could have a serious adverse effect on the ability of these local communities
         to protect their interests during this process, and diminish the practical
         effectiveness of the safeguards included in the Process Framework.

   283. With respect to other areas claimed by the Garífuna communities, such as the
         Rio Tinto Forest Reserve, which has not yet been legally declared as protected
         area, the Panel notes that the EA addressed the concern raised by Requesters
         stating that:

         "The Government of Honduras should regularize the property rights of the
         various ethnic groups in the country, principally through recognition of
         communal property in accordance with ILO Convention 169. Therefore, the
         government should not designate more protected areas in zones where there are

          autonomous communities until their property rights are clearly defined, thereby
          safeguarding the interests of these communities." (EA, subpart g)

    284. The Panel finds that this statement provides a potentially important
           response to address the concerns of Requesters and is in compliance with
           OD 4.20. The key issue will rest in its effective implementation.

    2. Responsibility for Management or Co-Management of Protected Areas

    285. The Panel considered the claim that the EA does not set forth an "hypothesis"
           on the development of management arrangements so that the Garífuna
           communities may manage or co-manage protected areas to restore their control
           over the "functional habitat" that they have preserved for centuries, and does
           not contemplate the involvement of indigenous peoples in management of the
           protected areas.172 The Panel notes that the question of management of
           protected areas arises under OP 4.01, as management arrangements and the
           extent to which local communities are involved may strongly influence the
           achievement of environmental and other objectives within these areas. This
           question also arises under the provisions of OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats).

    286. In Honduras there are 107 protected areas, 57 of which have been declared as
           such by special law. The remainders have been declared protected areas mainly
           through a presidential order (Order 1118-92). These protected areas are grouped
           into nine management categories based on their characteristics: national park,
           biological reserve, marine reserve, wildlife refuge, natural monument, cultural
           monument, anthropological reserve, multi-use area and biosphere reserve. The
           level of protection of these areas depends on their legal status, which can be
           modified only by law.

    287. Protected areas are divided in three zones: buffer zone, cultural zone and core
           zone. Only in the first two zones (buffer and cultural, is economic activity
           allowed, albeit based on an environmental management plan. The Panel was
           informed during its visit to the Project area that buffer zones have been
           suffering an increasing amount of human penetration: in some of the them
           coffee plantations are growing. While, as noted, economic activity is allowed in
           buffer zone under a specific management plan, the Panel was told that in
           practice no supervision has effectively been carried out to avoid damage to
           these areas. In an effort to solve this problem, the Government has entered into
           co-management agreements with NGOs, which are granted the responsibility of
           overseeing the implementation of the environmental management plan, while
           the Government, through AFE-COHDEFOR, maintains the main management
           responsibility.

172Co-management of natural resources refers to "...arrangements whereby local people and their
organizations are given responsibility for decision making about access to and use of natural resources, in
exchange for assured benefits, through agreements with government authorities." See Stephen r. Tyler,
Comanagement of Natural Resources, IDRC, 2006, p. 3.


                                                    81

   288. The Panel was informed that one of the main issues in protected areas is the
          pollution of water sources, especially in areas adjacent to urban or rural areas
          where agricultural activities are conducted with chemical products. Shifting part
          of the managing responsibility to NGOs and to communities living in or around
          protected areas to enforce mechanisms to protect these areas is one solution the
          Government has been trying to implement.

   289. Management states that the Process Framework and Environmental
          Management Plan include provisions for co-management of protected areas by
          agencies, NGOs, and local communities (referring to p. 7 sp. version, last para.
          of Process Framework).

   290. The text of the Process Framework includes the following text:

          "In those limited cases there [sic] the presence of indigenous communities
          coincides with protected areas, the PATH will promote, in conjunction with the
          INA and AFE-COHEDEFOR the signing of co-administration agreements with
          NGOs and with the indigenous communities."

   291. The Process Framework states that "every protected area ...has management
          plans developed through combined effort of DAVS [Departamento de Áreas
          Protegidas y de Vida Silvestre] and the NGOs that co-manage the protected
          areas." For each legally established protected area there are identified co-
          managing NGOs. The PF also states that:                 "signing of co-management
          agreements between NGOs, indigenous communities and AFE-COHDEFOR
          will be supported, to ensure that they are consistent with conservation
          objectives, that they define the rules for managing the protected areas and
          clearly specify the commitments of the parties."

   292.    Co-management of natural resources refers to "...arrangements whereby local
          people and their organizations are given responsibility for decision making
          about access to and use of natural resources, in exchange for assured benefits,
          through agreements with government authorities."173 Co-management is
          therefore about sharing responsibility between local users and governments. To
          be successfully implemented building local capacity so that local people and
          their organizations can effectively carry out their task is required. This is a
          rather new approach for natural resource management, which based on recent
          case studies in some countries has demonstrated how local people can help
          conserve natural resources and at the same time improve their livelihood as
          well.

   293. The Panel considers that above-mentioned provision included in the Process
          Framework contemplates situations where indigenous communities would be
          engaged in co-administration of protected areas with NGOs and the competent
          government authorities.

173See Stephen R. Tyler, Comanagement of Natural Resources, IDRC, 2006, p. 3.


                                                82

   294. As to the listing of specific protected area sites or proposed sites, the
         Environmental Assessment generally identifies organizations other than
         indigenous communities in relation to management responsibilities. This point
         is highlighted in the Request, with reference to the examples of Sierra Rio Tinto
         and Punta Izopo.

   295. The Panel notes the explanations provided by Management with regard to the
         management of these areas and, more generally, the EA table-listings. The
         Panel is concerned, however, that local Garífuna communities having
         claims in listed areas are not mentioned as having a role or even a potential
         role in their management, even though other (NGO) organizations are. The
         Panel considers that the role of these communities in management and/or co-
         management of these lands is important under OP 4.01 because, among other
         things, it will likely affect the long-term health and well-being of the habitat in
         those lands and the people who depend on them.

   296. In light of these considerations, the Panel finds that the commitments
         referred to in Project documents to have indigenous communities maintain
         or acquire management and co-management responsibilities over
         designated protected areas that may include their lands complies with
         OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OD 4.20 on Indigenous
         Peoples.


   B. Natural Habitat: OP/BP 4.04

   297. The Request claims that the Project did not take into account the importance of
         natural habitats for the livelihood of the Garífuna communities, as required by
         OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats.174 In Response, Management notes that the
         Project did, in fact, trigger OP 4.04 and that additional compliance measures
         were needed to mitigate the identified potential impacts.

   298. In this regard, OP 4.04 provides, inter alia, as follows:

         "The Bank expects the borrower to take into account the views, roles, and rights
         of groups, including local nongovernmental organizations and local
         communities [footnote to OP/BP 4.10, Indigenous Peoples, when local
         communities include indigenous peoples], affected by Bank-financed projects
         involving natural habitats, and to involve such people in planning, designing,
         implementing, monitoring, and evaluating such projects.         Involvement may
         include identifying appropriate conservation measures, managing protected
         areas and other natural habitats, and monitoring and evaluating specific



174Request, p. 8.


                                             83

        projects.   The Bank encourages governments to provide such people with
        appropriate information and incentives to protect natural habitats.

   299. As noted above, the Panel observed that Management has identified specific
        steps and safeguards to address issues that local communities might face in
        relation to project activities involving protected areas and natural habitat. These
        include: restrictions that only legally established protected areas, with a decree,
        would be eligible for demarcation under the Project; that no field activities
        would take place in or near proposed protected areas; and that no titling or
        physical demarcation on lands adjacent to Ethnic Lands would take place unless
        procedures that adequately protect the interests of Indigenous Peoples have
        been followed.175 The Process Framework developed under the Project also
        provides that "areas where indigenous peoples are present will be recognized
        and delineated..."

   300. The Panel observes that OP 4.04 states that the Bank expects the Borrower to
        take into account the "role" of local communities affected by Bank-financed
        projects involving natural habitats. This implies gaining an understanding of the
        role of these communities and the entities that represent them, as a foundation
        for efforts to integrate local communities into the planning and decision making
        process, as required by the Policy.

   301. The steps and safeguards in the Project design, noted above, suggest that the
        Project has considered this question. The Panel found little analysis, however,
        of the relationship between the local Garífuna communities and areas of natural
        habitat, and the importance of the natural habitat for the livelihood of the
        Garífuna communities.

   302. As described in Chapter 2, the Garífuna have had an extensive and close
        relationship to their lands and surrounding areas of natural habitat for more than
        two hundred years. The forests, for example, were used not only for planting
        but as the source of protein and plate foods, and of wood to build houses,
        canoes and other objects, including coffins for the dead.            The Garífuna
        subsistence economy also depended upon off-shore fishing, the collection of
        land crabs, and hunting of small forest and sea game, such as deer, turtles, and
        manatee.

   303. The Panel considers that the development of this type of information would
        assist in meeting the provisions of OP 4.04, by providing a more informed basis
        to take into account the role, rights and interests of the local Garifuna
        communities in relation to important areas of natural habitat. This could be
        especially important in light of uncertainties and conflicts on the ground
        relating to natural habitat areas, including issues of access and management
        (e.g., Punta Izopo), as well as in relation to demarcation and titling.

      Chapter VI: Project Implementation: Institutional Structures


   A. Introduction

   304. To understand the current institutional context of the Bank-funded PATH
         Project for land regularization and titling, it is helpful to highlight legal and
         institutional developments in the previous decade.

   305. In the 1990s, there was concern about agrarian reform, land titling, and foreign
         ownership of land within a specified distance from the coast. At the national
         level, INA, which is responsible for issuing titles to rural lands and Ethnic
         Lands176, granted collective titles to land to some Garífuna communities. As
         noted elsewhere in this Report, the Panel understands that the collective titles
         issued in the 1990's do not include the entire ancestral claim of the Garífuna
         people, and that most titles exclude important areas of use and resource
         management of the communities.            In some cases, the titles received were
         extremely limited, and really only covered the so-called "casco urbano" where
         their houses were located.

   306. In 2001, the Government of Honduras established by Executive Order 035/2001
         the Comision Intersectorial de titulación, ampliación, saneamiento y protección
         de las tierras de las comunidades Garífunas y misquitas de Honduras (Inter-
         Sectoral Commission for titling, extension and regularization and protection of
         the lands of the Garífuna and Misquito communities of Honduras) to guarantee
         the property rights of the Garífuna and Misquito communities. As detailed
         below in Section D, the two most important groups representing the Garífuna
         people were members of this Commission.

   307. Shortly thereafter a new Government took office. The Commission was put
         aside and a new institutional framework of Mesas initiated as part of the
         institutional arrangement for the Project. When the current Government came
         into power, it proceeded with the Mesas for the Garífuna and Misquito,
         pursuant to the World Bank financed Project.

   308. The current institutional structure for the titling of lands involves a number of
         different entities: a new Property Institute (Instituto de la Propiedad ­ IP),
         which has responsibility for confirming title to urban lands and registers titles
         for all lands; the INA, which has responsibility for titling rural and Ethnic
         Lands; municipalities, which issue various kinds of titles to land and can
         expand their urban borders to include additional lands to title; regional and
         local mesas for the Garífuna (and for the Misquito), which claim to represent
         the interests of the Garífuna in titling issues and to have authority to resolve

        disputes over claims; and the dormant Inter-Sectoral Commission for Protecting
        Land Rights of Garífuna and Misquito Communities.

   309. The Requesters are concerned that the institutional structure supported by the
        Project will not protect the interests of the Garífuna people in collective titles.
        They claim that Project implementation is not consistent with the requirements
        of the IPDP.       The materials below focus on the IPDP and the current
        arrangements for implementing the Project, on the Inter-Sectoral Commission,
        on the variety of disputes over collective land titles, and on the procedures for
        settling these disputes.


   B. Current Project Implementation Arrangements

   310. As detailed below, the institutional arrangements for implementing the Project
        have evolved since the Project's inception.

   311. The Project Implementing Unit. The Credit Agreement provides that the
        overall implementing agency of the Project is the Secretaria de Gobernación y
        Justicia (SGJ) (the Ministry of Justice), which is to have a designated Project
        Implementing Unit (PIU). This contrasts with the trend towards avoiding the
        establishment of PIUs and instead mainstreaming project implementation
        within the structure of the implementing agency. The PIU coordinates the
        implementation of the PATH as well as two additional Bank-financed projects.
        The PIU is to work with other Government agencies, including the Instituto
        Nacional Agrario (National Agrarian Institute -INA), the Honduran Association
        of Municipalities (AHMON) and AFE-COHDEFOR, the Honduran Agency for
        Forest Development. These bodies entered into participation agreements with
        the SGJ, which in turn concluded participation agreements with each
        municipality where the Project is being implemented.

   312. After the Board of Executive Directors approved the Credit, the implementing
        structure changed.     The new Property Law enacted in 2004 created a new
        agency, the Instituto de la Propiedad (Property Institute - IP), which includes
        the functions and responsibilities of other agencies originally envisaged as the
        Project's co-executing entities, such as the Directorate of the National Cadastre
        (DEC), the National Geographic Institute (IGN), and the Property and
        Mercantile Registry(RPIM).

   313. In May 2006, the Government of Honduras requested the Bank's no-objection
        to changing the implementing agency and shifting the PIU from the SGJ to the
        recently created IP. While preparatory work for the shift was underway, in
        December 2006 the Government apparently decided that the PIU was to remain
        within the SGJ.177 However, on January 10, 2007, as noted in Chapter One, the


177Aide Memoire, December 14-20, 2006.


                                           86

          Bank indicated to the Government that, to avoid suspension of the Bank Credit
          disbursements, one of the conditions that it had to satisfy was to come to a final
          decision on which agency would be in charge of Project implementation. The
          Government decided to change the implementing agency and, as of February
          2007, the PIU moved from the SGJ to the IP.

    C. Requirements of the IPDP

    314. A core element of OD 4.20 concerning the IPDP relates to institutional
          capacity.        Para. 15 (f) notes that "government institutions assigned
          responsibility for indigenous peoples are often weak" and "[a]ssessing the
          track record, capabilities, and needs of those institutions is a fundamental
          requirement."

    315. The IPDP contains a section on Policy and Regulatory Framework, which
          includes a sub-part on "Institutional Strengthening". This section reads, in its
          entirety, as follows:

            a. "Institutional strengthening ­ responsible for improving the institutions
                concerned with SINAP178 through civil engineering work, consulting, re-
                engineering processes, training of SINAP users, and equipping those
                institutions. Creation of registries and document presentation windows
                for the regularization, titling, registration, and cadastre process; as well
                as the training and certification of individuals in conciliation and conflict
                resolution       mechanisms          in   the     indigenous     and     Afro-Honduran
                communities.

            b. Establish processes and systems to strengthen inter-institutional
                coordination and community management (communal regularization
                boards and departmental committees of territorial planning.)"179

    316. Building on these foundations, the IPDP sets forth a "Community Participation
          Model" for the participation of Garífuna communities "in the process for
          regularizing and titling their ancestral lands, implementing mechanisms that
          allow them to intervene in the demarcation of those lands and in the resolution
          of conflicts arising from their ownership and possession . . ."180




178As noted in Chapter One, the Project is the first phase of a three-phase Land Administration Program,
which provides for establishing a fully integrated and decentralized National Property Administration
System (SINAP).

   D. The Inter-Sectoral Commission for Protecting Land Rights of Garífuna and
   Misquito Communities

   317. During its investigation, the Panel learned of the existence of the so-called
          Inter-Sectoral Commission.            The Commission was created in 2001 by
          Executive Order No. 035-2001 signed by the then President of the Republic of
          Honduras. This commission, the original full name of which is Comision
          Intersectorial de titulación, ampliación, saneamiento y protección de las tierras
          de las comunidades Garífunas y misquitas de Honduras is intended to help
          guarantee the property rights of the Garífuna and Misquito communities. The
          authority extends to the titling, extension, regularization and protection of the
          lands. This protection extends not only to the lands occupied by these
          communities, but also to those "that constitute their functional habitat and are
          regarded as ancestral [lands] under the ILO Convention No. 169."181

   318. The Members of this Commission include key government institutions
          responsible for land titling and protection issues relating to the Garífuna and
          Misquito communities.          The Members also include chosen representative
          entities for those communities. In the case of the Garífuna, these are ODECO
          and OFRANEH (the Requesters). The full list of members is as follows:
                National Agrarian Institute
                Secretariat of Government and Justice
                Secretariat of Natural Resources and Environment
                Secretariat of Tourism
                State's Forest Administration (AFE-COHDEFOR)
                Organization of Ethnic-Community Development (Organización de
                Desarrollo Étnico Comunitaria, ODECO)
                Black Honduran Brotherhood Organization (Organización Fraternal
                Negra Hondureña, OFRANEH)
                Mosquitia Asla Takanka (MASTA)

         According to the Executive Order, the representatives of government entities
         will be "at the decision making levels" to ensure the seniority and authority of
         their representatives in the Commission.

   319. The Panel notes that the Project's IPDP, however, makes no mention of an
          Inter-Sectoral Commission, though it had been established in 2001 by
          Presidential Decree. The Commission is mentioned only in the Project's Social
          Assessment (SA) (box at page 50), which states that the IPDP must define an
          institutional mechanism for participation of, and support by, the indigenous
          communities in Project implementation.182 The reference to the Inter-sectoral
          Commission is placed next to the description of the recommended features of

181Acuerdo Ejecutivo Numero 035-2001, published in the Official Gazette on December 11, 2001.
182Evaluación Social y Económica Participativa (Social Assessment), Honduras, August 2003, p. 49.


                                                 88

           the institutional mechanism, and it seems that the SA's authors considered the
           Commission as the possible mechanism.183 Neither the Bank's Legal nor
           Institutional Analysis mentions the creation of the Commission.

   320. The failure of the IPDP to mention the Inter-Sectoral Commission is of
           particular concern given that the IPDP reviews the relevant legal
           framework and institutions and, on this foundation, proposes a "Model"
           approach for community involvement in the land titling process.

   321. During its investigation, the Requesters brought to the Panel's attention the
           existence of this Commission, its importance to them and to their interests in
           protecting their lands, and the fact that it is not being utilized in the land titling
           process. The significance of the Commission to the interests of the Requesters
           is apparent on the face of the instrument creating the document, which
           highlights that its purpose is to protect and guarantee the property rights of the
           Garífuna people in line with ILO Convention No. 169.

   322. As noted above, the Commission includes OFRANEH - - the Requesters - - as
           one of the two selected entities to represent the Garífuna people. This further
           underscores the sense of grievance on the part of the Requesters that the
           potential use and importance of this Commission is not considered in the IPDP
           and in the creation of a Model for involving the local communities.184

   323. Staff informed the Panel (in January 2007) that the Secretariat of Governance
           and Justice, the Project's implementing agency, had sent a note to all the
           participants in the technical team working on the draft land regularization
           procedures for Ethnic Lands notifying them of their decision to transfer the
           chair of that team to the INA. The SGJ's move was reportedly due at least in
           part to the recent recognition of the existence of Decree 035-2001 creating the
           Inter-sectoralCommission.

   324. The Panel observes that the Bank's failure to consider the Inter-Sectoral
           Commission adequately in Project preparation may have had practical
           significance. The nature of consultations and decision-making in relation
           to Garífuna land rights has become a major controversy under the PATH.
           The Inter-Sectoral Commission was designed specifically to defend the
           interests      of    indigenous       peoples,      contained       provisions       for    their
           representation, and engaged senior, decision-making levels of government.
           As a result, the Commission might have played a significant role in helping to
           address the concerns that have been raised, and protecting the rights and


183Social Assessment, p. 50: "El 17 de Diciembre de 2001, el Presidente de la Républica emitió un decreto
mediante el cual establecía una instancia de negociación entre las comunidades indígenas y el Gobierno
para asuntos de tierras y titulación. Esta podría ser una posibilidad, teniendo en cuenta que aún se
encuentra vigente."
184Bank staff recently indicated to the Panel that, during Project preparation, staff had considered this
Commission, but the former Government administration, under which the Project was prepared, did not
seem interested in making it operational.


                                                     89

           interests of Requesters and the people they represent. The Panel finds that the
           failure of the IPDP to identify the Commission and to assess its importance
           in the land titling process under the PATH is not consistent with the
           objectives and spirit of OD 4.20.

    E. The Regulatory Framework for Legalizing and Registering Land Titles

    325. As noted in Chapter Four, the 2004 Property Law created a new regulatory
           framework for legalizing and registering land titles. Component Two of the
           Bank-financed Project involves the legalization, titling and regularization of,
           inter alia, Ethnic Lands. Under the new framework, the municipalities, the INA
           and the IP will play the main roles in regards to legalizing, titling, and
           registering land titles.

    326. The INA is the executor of the agrarian policies of the Government and is
           competent with respect to any aspect and issue related to lands destined to be
           part of the agrarian reform. It is the agency responsible for issuing titles in rural
           and ethnic areas.

    327. The municipalities generally demarcate the boundaries of their territory and
           control and regulate the urban development. Municipalities may also decide
           whether to enlarge municipal boundaries. As noted, they may grant title over
           municipal land to third parties. This has created conflicts with a number of
           Garífuna communities, who claim that the municipality has granted rights to
           lands that Garífuna claim have communal land rights.

    328. According to the Property Law, the IP maintains, updates, and operates the
           property registry and cadastre, administering an integrated system of
           information on property rights in Honduras. According to the Property Law, IP
           issues titles for lands that were not registered under the old Registry of
           Immovable Property, and registers the titles issued by the INA and the
           municipalities.

    1. The IP Role in the Regularization of Land Titles

    329. When the Panel visited Tegucigalpa in October 2006, the Panel met with IP
           officials. The IP officials described to the Panel, in general terms, how the
           regularization process for titling of lands takes place and the IP's role in it.

    330. Art. 69 of the Property Law declares as a national priority the land
           regularization and resolution of all conflicts about tenancy, possession and
           ownership of land, their incorporation into a national cadastre, and titling and
           registration in the land registry of all real estate property in Honduras.185



185The IP officials stated that this process should take place pursuant to the Property Law. However, since
no regulations to the Law had been issued when the Panel spoke with the IP officials, they stated that the


                                                      90

     331. In general, the IP begins the regularization process ex officio or upon a request
            from a party seeking title.186 According to the Project PAD, this process
            includes the creation of Mesas de Regularización (Regularization Boards),
            "with the participation of DEC, INA, municipalities, RPIM, the National
            Personal Identification Registry (RNP), civil society representatives and local
            committees for specific land uses." These Boards would provide "legal advice,
            identify overlapping claims, facilitate resolution of conflicts and handle title
            requests.187" As envisaged in the PAD, the functions and responsibility of DEC
            and RPIM in these Regularization Boards were transferred to the IP.

     332. If ownership of a parcel of land is disputed, various means for resolving
            disputes would be available: conciliation for which the IP is the competent
            authority (see Art. 66 of the Property Law); the judicial procedure established
            in Title VI of the Property Law, or arbitration if the parties agree.

     333. The IP officials stated to the Panel that the Law guarantees communal property
            rights to indigenous peoples, but at the same time non-Garífunas have a right to
            continue owning the land they possess and have been using (if they hold valid
            title over the parcel of land), even if this land is within Garífuna communal
            land.

     334. The officials stated to the Panel that, in a land dispute involving Ethnic Lands
            ­ for example when non-Garífuna third parties occupy Garífuna land ­ if the
            title claimed by the third parties is annulled pursuant to Art. 98 of the Property
            Law188, the third parties are to be compensated for the improvements they made
            to the land over the years. However, the IP officials also indicated that the IP
            does not have the budget to make these payments. The Panel notes that the
            Government officials with whom the Panel met stated that no resources
            have been earmarked or pledged to indemnify third parties who hold
            annullable titles in Ethnic Lands. The Bank needs to address this issue
            fully to be consistent with OP/BP 13.05.

     335. The Requesters object to the regularization process provided in the Property
            Law because they believe that they may lose portions of their land currently
            occupied by others. They also believe that, even if they maintain the full
            property communal title they were given in the 1990s, it will be very difficult
            for them to obtain an extension of that title to adjacent lands that they have

regularization activities were carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Ley de Procedimiento
Administrativo (Administrative Procedure Law).
186Art. 73 of the Property Law.
187PAD, p. 45.
188Art. 98 provides that a third party who has received a title of ownership to the communal property of
indigenous peoples, which may be nullified as a result of the characteristics thereof, shall be indemnified
for the improvements prior to the return of the lands to the affected communities. In Spanish: "El tercero
que ha recibido titulo de propiedad en tierras comunales de esos rublos, que por sus características
pudiera ser anulable, previo a la devolución de las tierras a las comunidades afectadas será indemnizado
en sus mejoras."




                                                     91

         traditionally occupied and/or relied upon for their subsistence (the so-called
         ampliación they seek). Not will it be possible to recover Garífuna land occupied
         by third parties without valid title, because funds are not available to
         compensate them.

   336. The Requesters further complain about the envisaged dispute resolution
         procedures because they believe they are unfair and do not take into
         consideration the real ability of the indigenous peoples to access justice. These
         complaints are addressed below.

   F. Disputes over Titles to Land

   337. As already noted in this Report and also indicated in Management Response,
         "long-standing unresolved land conflicts"189 are currently affecting Garífuna
         communities and their rights over their ancestral land.        Different types of
         conflict resolution procedures, judicial and extra-judicial, are available to solve
         them. However, the Requesters raise serious concerns about the procedures
         proposed under the Project because, in their opinion, these procedures will not
         allow them to obtain justice and to recover the lands that they claim ancestrally
         belong to the Garífuna people. In their view, the measures proposed to resolve
         conflicts over land claims that are proposed in the IPDP and other Project
         documents such as the Operational Manual do not correspond to the needs
         arising from the social and political reality within the communities, with power
         elites on the one hand and indigenous peoples on the other.

   338. In order to address these issues and assess whether the Project complies with
         OD 4.20, it is important to understand the nature and types of conflicts
         involving lands claimed by Garífuna people, whether such claims are based on
         a full property title granted by INA, a certificate of occupancy, or traditional
         occupation for decades, albeit without title. These land conflicts are briefly
         described below. An analysis of the conflict resolution procedures and Bank
         compliance with its own operational policies follows.

   1. Conflicts Involving Indigenous Land

   339. Land conflicts involving Garífuna lands may be grouped in distinct
         categories:190 conflicts with non-Garífuna third parties; conflicts with
         municipalities; conflicts with Government agencies; and conflicts between
         Garífuna areas and protected areas.

   340. Conflicts with third parties are varied. According to the Project Operational
         Manual, in many communities non-indigenous people have occupied Ethnic
         Lands and now claim possession of it. In many Garífuna communities it is land
         over which the community received full property title (titulo pleno). A number

                                            92

     of non-Garífuna people who have settled on ancestral lands are small farmers or
     coffee growers. They live on Garífuna land pacifically and do not threaten
     either the use by Garífunas of their land or their cultural life. In other cases,
     however, occupations of Garífuna land have occurred with violence,
     intimidations and/or fraud. Not only are Garífunas kept from using and
     enjoying their land, but also from accessing it, as plots of land have been fenced
     off.

341. Some of these "invasions", as the Garífunas regard them, have been regularized
     with titles granted by INA, although INA itself issued a title to the same land to
     Garífuna communities, thus creating a situation where there is more than one
     title over the same parcel of land. In some cases titles overlap because
     individual members of the communities sold part of the communal land to non-
     Garífunas or lost it because of debts they incurred.

342. The Panel notes that during its visits to the Project area, all those it met with
     emphasized the gravity of the Garífuna land "invasions" problem. Mesa
     Regional members talked at length about "invasions" of their land by non-
     Garífunas. Like all Garífunas, including the Requesters, they view these
     invasions as their biggest problem, because not only do invasions mean loss of
     their ancestral land but also their source of income as the "invaders" do not
     allow them to work the land.




                                         93

343. In the community of Cristales for example, members of the Mesa Local (who
     are also members of the Mesa Regional) showed the Panel a map of their
     communal land and explained that, although at the beginning of the 1900s they
     received a titulo ejidal for 600 hectares (ha) that they had been occupying for
     almost a century, they now have actual access only to 100ha, because the
     remaining 500ha have been "usurped" by invaders, who are non-Garífuna. They
     also stated that while some of these invaders live on the land they occupy,
     others sell it; a few are dangerous and have threatened the people; some were
     also able to obtain title over the land they occupied. The legal advisor of the
     Mesa Regional informed the Panel that he is reviewing all titles given to the
     Garífuna communities so as to make claims for lands that belong to them.


344. Conflicts with municipalities may occur in several situations. Garífuna
     communities may lose lands that traditionally belonged to them and are
     essential for their economic and cultural survival because the area where they
     live, or part of it, is declared urban. The municipality may claim ownership
     rights as explained below:

       c. As a result of titling programs carried out during the 1990s Garífuna
          communities were able to obtain communal titles. However, according to
          all Garífunas the Panel met with, the boundaries of the titled areas do not
          correspond to the actual area where the community lives and which it uses
          for their subsistence. Some of the titles granted cover only the so-called
          "casco urbano" (urban perimeter) and most titles exclude areas of use and
          resource management and areas of agricultural activities. As a
          consequence, the community also lives and uses areas over which it does
          not have full property title and the municipality may claim such land as
          ejidal.

       d. Similarly, the entire Garífuna community lives in an area over which it
          does not have full title (dominio pleno) but which it has possessed and
          used for decades. If this area is or becomes part of a municipality's urban
          zone, the municipality may claim it as ejidal.

       e. In both cases, Art. 70 of the law of municipalities allows the municipality
          to acknowledge the ties of the Garífunas to the land and may provide them
          with full title after paying a sum no less than 10% of the cadastral value of
          the land in question. The municipality, however, may exclude some areas
          from this benefit and even provide full title to other people who claim or
          prove possession over these areas.

345. It should be noted that, according to the Legal Analysis carried out during
     Project preparation, while some municipalities seriously implemented the
     responsibilities they have by law, others have exceeded their mandate and have




                                         94

         titled lands beyond their jurisdiction.191 This situation has had serious
         implications for Garífuna communities and their land rights, as a number of
         Garífuna communities are in conflict with municipalities, which claim rights to
         communal land. A prominent example of this conflict involves the community
         of Triunfo de la Cruz, the situation of which is currently under review by the
         Inter-American Commission of Human Rights.

   346. Conflicts may also occur when ancestral land is in forest areas that qualify as
         protected areas. Part of the land over which the Garífunas claim ancestral
         property rights has been declared protected area. Ethnic groups including
         Garífunas claim that their rights were disregarded and consultations did not
         occur before declaring certain areas as protected. The status as a protected area
         implies many restrictions on the use and enjoyment of the land, or even
         prohibition on using the land, depending on the type of protected area. In some
         cases Garífuna communities signed usufruct agreements that would allow them
         to use the area declared as protected. However, communities believe that they
         are entitled to full title of some of the areas declared as protected, because they
         believe it is ancestral land belonging to them. They refuse the usufruct
         agreement, which gives them limited rights to use and enjoy the land but falls
         short of giving ownership rights.

   347. Land conflicts may also arise with Government agencies, such as the
         Secretary of Tourism, which has declared `tourist' areas that are within the
         functional habitat of Garífunas communities. This declaration may constitute
         the preamble to a process resulting in non-indigenous people possessing and
         eventually owning land in these areas.

   348. Conflicts over ancestral land and especially the type of title to be granted,
         whether individual or communal, have also arisen within communities. While
         community leaders and representatives generally support communal titles,
         believing that this type of tenure will help to preserve not only their traditional
         land but also the culture and way of life of the Garifúna people. However, some
         members of the communities would prefer to obtain individual titles. This has
         important implications for the structuring of a program to title lands.

   349. The Project provides that communities can opt out of the Project and thus,
         conceptually, cannot be forced to try to register either collective or individual
         titles. In practice, this may mean that individuals within the community can
         seek individual titles, even if the community itself does not participate in the
         program.

   350. As noted above, there can be conflicts within communities between persons
         seeking individual titles and the more general community desire for collective
         titles.    Dissension and division with communities makes it more difficult for



191Legal Analysis, p. 27.


                                             95

         community titling. There are reports that Garífuna want land back that was
         originally sold by individual members of their communities.

   2. Procedures for Settling Disputes over Land Titles


   351. Claims of Requesters. The Requesters argue that conflict resolution options
         provided in the IPDP differ from the dispute settlement procedures described in
         the Property Law. According to them, this has created confusion because
         people are not clear as to which mechanism they need to resort to in case of
         conflicts involving Ethnic Lands. The Requesters state that the Project did not
         study and did not take into consideration the real ability of indigenous peoples
         to access the legal system and use it effectively to protect their rights and
         interests.

   352. The Requesters are also concerned about the arbitration procedure proposed in
         the IPDP, which they believe to be an unconstitutional means of resolving
         conflicts related to land rights. In discussions with the Panel, the Requesters
         have emphasized that they believe that arbitration would not be a fair process.
         In their view, an arbitral proceeding, in which one or a few persons, albeit
         certified arbiters, decide the controversy with no possibility of appealing the
         decision, opens the process to abuses and corruption of which the indigenous
         groups would be the predictable victims.

   353. The Requesters also express their concerns, and did so during Project
         preparation as well, about other conflict resolution systems proposed in the
         IPDP, such as the Mesas Interétnicas, and conciliation and mediation
         procedures. They consider these to be unfair procedures where indigenous
         peoples would be confronting powerful elites and thus would be at a
         disadvantage.

   354. Although the Requesters do not seem to have strong faith in the national
         judicial system, they stated to the Panel that they would rather resort to the
         courts under the traditional procedures rather than arbitration or other
         extrajudicial procedures, because they believe that the appeal system and the
         public exposure of a court process may ensure a more just treatment than a
         procedure where powerful people may face poor indigenous groups on opposite
         sides of the table and only one person is to make a final and binding decision.

   355. Management Response. Management argues that "the arbitration procedures
         in the IPDP were consistent with national law at the time of Project
         preparation"192 because the IPDP was prepared when the Property Law was not
         yet in effect. As already noted, Management however states that there is a need
         to harmonize the Project and the Property Law and to update the IPDP and the
         Operational Manual with respect to land regularization methodologies and


192Management Response, ¶ 65.


                                            96

           conflict resolution procedures.193 Management indicates that "inputs into the
           development of land regularization procedures and conflict resolution
           mechanisms under the Project" may be provided through the Mesa Regional.194
           It adds that "[s]ince changes to the IPDP and the Project Operational Manual
           are subject to the Bank's no-objection, Management expects that these
           participatory consultations would result in proposals to harmonize some of the
           Project's features with the new Property Law."195

    356. Management also believes that the arbitration procedures as a means for
           conflict resolution are consistent with OD 4.20, because they provide people
           with an effective, reliable and efficient system for affected groups to defend
           their rights.

    357. With respect to access to justice for indigenous groups, Management claims
           that it recognized the difficulties for Garífuna people to access the Honduran
           legal system and for this reason it required that the IPDP include specific
           safeguards and budgetary allocations to ensure "capacity building and training
           for local community leaders on national laws and regulations pertinent to the
           Project" and "a program of training and certification for conciliators and
           arbitrators."  196


    358. Court System. Within Honduras, the court system provides a traditional means
           to resolve disputes over land titles. The courts are part of the Judicial Branch of
           the country, and consist of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Court of Appeals,
           and national courts. The basic framework and operation of the courts and
           tribunals is set forth in Chapter XII of the Constitution and in the Law of
           Organization and Attribution of the Tribunals.197

    359. The trial courts and tribunals are the first instance of jurisdiction. Their rulings
           may be reviewed by Courts of Appeals. The highest court with jurisdiction over
           the entire country is the Supreme Court. It has 15 Justices, elected by the
           National Congress. Around major cities there are specialized first instance
           courts, which include civil, criminal, family, labor courts and others. In less
           populated rural areas, courts of mixed jurisdiction tend to be more prevalent,
           and are responsible for hearing all categories of cases. Other institutions of the
           Justice system include the Ministry of Governance and Justice, the National
           Human Rights Commission, and others.198

    360. The 2005 Sector Reform analysis of the World Bank identified challenges
            facing the Judiciary in three strategic areas: weak institutional capabilities
            (resulting,     for   example,     in    significant    backlogs);     transparency      and
            accountability in administering justice; and limited access to justice for the
            population.199 It notes that the justice sector "has suffered a strong crisis of
            public confidence." The Report addresses the Justice system and indigenous
            populations, and cites to a survey in which "75 percent of ethnic minorities
            express distrust in the justice sector," and states that "[l]ocal communities
            prefer to resolve civil disputes where possible by `informal' justice."              200 The
            Report also identifies a number of legal and judicial reform initiatives in recent
            years, introducing important changes.201

    361. Conflict resolution options provided in the IPDP. The IPDP for the Project
            identifies alternative, non-judicial means of conflict resolution for the land
            regularization process, and states that these are to be applied in accordance with
            the national Law of Conciliation and Arbitration. It specifically mentions three
            levels of conflict resolution: local; departmental; and national.

    362. The local-level indicated in the IPDP is the Mesa Local Interetnica (interethnic
            board), which presents the first instance of conflict resolution. The IPDP states
            that

                 "[i]n the case of conflicts in the process, Local Inter-Ethnic Committees
                 (mesas locales interétnicas) shall be set up. These committees shall handle
                 conflicts between ethnic communities or communities that may be adjacent
                 to ethnic communities; between ethnic communities of different origins;
                 between an ethnic community and peasant settlements; or between ethnic
                 communities and the municipality and/or state."          202




            When the above-mentioned conflicts occur, according to the IPDP, the PATH
            will convene the parties, will establish the Interethnic Board, and will present a
            list of certified conciliators from which the parties select the conciliator.203

    363. The departmental level may constitute a second instance of conflict resolution
            in specific cases.     204 The IPDP refers to the already existing Departmental
            Councils of Development (Interethnic Section) chaired by the Governor of the
            Department on behalf of the SGJ. When recourse is presented to the Council,
            the parties are presented with a list of conciliators or arbiters among whom they

204Recourse to the Department Council is available when (a) the lands claimed cover more than one
municipality; (b) the conflict is with a municipality; (c) there is overlapping with protected or cultural
areas; (d) conflicts are with Government agencies. IPDP, p. 17.


                                                    98

            select the individual or individuals they prefer. The decisions or agreements
            reached at this level are final and binding. No authority may intervene in the
            decisions of the conciliators and arbiters.205

    364. The third instance is the Mesa Nacional de Resolución de Conflictos (National
            Board for the Resolution of Conflicts). The IPDP specifies that its members are
            to be the representatives of the National Indigenous Council, farmers, the
            patronatos and others that represent local communities in the Project areas
            where conflicts occur. Complaints to this Board are available with respect to
            conflicts that were not resolved in previous instances of dispute settlement. The
            directors of the Board will convene the parties and will present a list of certified
            conciliators or arbiters among whom the suitable individuals or individuals will
            be selected.        The IPDP notes that, in accordance with national law on
            conciliation or arbitration, the agreements reached may not be appealed to the
            courts.

    365. The IPDP indicates that the certification for the conciliators and arbiters will be
            provided by the SGJ (Ministry of Justice) and the Chamber of Commerce of
            Tegucigalpa after completion of a specialized course to be financed with PATH
            funds. It also notes that only individuals certified by the above-mentioned
            entities may conduct conciliation and arbitration.206 The Requesters note that
            the certification process for arbiters and conciliators does not include other
            representatives of civil society or indigenous peoples and for that reason their
            impartiality may be questionable.

    366. Conflict resolution procedures provided in the new Property Law. The
            new Property Law, in Title VI, provides for a special abbreviated judicial
            procedure for settlement of disputes over land.             207 According to this procedure,
            only an annulment recourse to the Supreme Court (recurso en Casación per
            saltum) is available to question the first instance judge's decision.




205IPDP, p. 17.
206IPDP, p. 17. The Panel notes that a new Manual for the Regularization of Ethnic Lands have been
drafter but it has yet to receive the Bank's no objection. This Manual differs from the IPDP and the current
Manual in that it includes only two instances of extrajudicial dispute settlement procedures: the conciliation
and arbitration board and the National Indigenous Board. The former would constitute the first degree of
instance of dispute settlement and will work in coordination with the Mesa Regional. According to the
Manual, this conflict resolution method will try to settle the issue through conciliation. If this does not
work, the second instance, the National Board, is to be invoked for arbitration. This Board is composed of
representatives of indigenous and Afro-Honduran communities chosen through "their federations". The
National Board would convene the parties and present a list of arbiters among which the communities will
chose one arbiter.
207According to Title VI of the Law, once the plaintiff submits the complaint, its admissibility is decided
within two days or the complaint is corrected within three working days. Once the complaint is considered
admissible, the defendant has three days to answer and the first hearing is to take place within five days of
such answer. Hearings cannot go beyond thirty working days, while the judge must decide on the merits
within five days from the end of the hearings.


                                                       99

    367. In addition, the Law provides that the Property Institute has authority to initiate
            conciliation procedures in certain situations.208 According to the law, mediation
            and arbitration procedures are also available.209

    368. Dispute Settlement in Project Implementation thus far As noted above, at
            the beginning of Project implementation (early 2005) two indigenous
            boards/mesas were created: the Mesa Regional Garífuna and the Mesa Regional
            Misquito. According to the Aide Memoire of the meeting establishing the Mesa
            Regional Garífuna, the Mesa was created with the "objective of coordinating
            the process of regularization and conflict resolution" in the communities
            selected to participate in the Project.210 The Mesa Regional Garífuna's official
            name is Mesa Regional de Regularización y Resolución de Conflictos
            "Wadabula"211

    369. According to Management Response, the Government decided to create two
            ethnic-based regional boards instead of one Mesa Nacional Indígena (National
            Indigenous Board).212 The Panel notes that the IPDP refers to a Mesa Nacional
            as one of the instances of conflict resolution. It also notes that Annex 4 to the
            IPDP entitled Acuerdo con la Secretaría de Gobernación y Justicia para los
            Procedimientos Alternativos de Resolución de Conflictos de Tierras en Areas
            Indígenas y Afrohondureñas (Agreement with the Ministry of Justice for
            alternative procedures of resolution of conflicts for lands in indigenous and
            Afro-Honduran areas) includes a letter dated November 7, 2003, from the
            Director of the Citizens Organization and Participation within the PIU of the
            Bank-financed Rural Land Management Project (Proyecto de Administración
            de Áreas Rurales ­PAAR) the experience of which, Management states, the
            PATH Project builds on. According to this letter, a Mesa Nacional Indígena
            already existed. It was used in the context of the PAAR and could now be used
            for the PATH.

    370. Discussion and Conclusions. OD 4.20 states that the IPDP should assess the
            ability of indigenous groups to            "obtain access to and effectively use the legal
            system to defend their rights. Particular attention should be given to the rights
            of indigenous peoples to use and develop the lands that they occupy, to be
            protected against illegal intruders, and to have access to natural resources
            (such as forests, wildfire, and water) vital to their subsistence and
            reproduction." (paragraph 15(a)).




208Art. 66 of the Property Law. The Law of Conciliation and Arbitration (Decreto No. 161-2000) provides
two types of conciliation: judicial and extrajudicial. Extrajudicial conciliation can be institutional, when it
takes place in conciliation centers defined in the law; notary, when it takes place before a public notary; and
administrative, when it is performed by administrative officials duly entitled by law to do so.

371. The Panel notes important positive features in the IPDP, including budget
     allocations for capacity building and training of local community leaders
     on national laws, and for training of conciliators and arbitrators. This is
     consistent with the stated intent of the IPDP to protect indigenous peoples
     from the results of depredations and invasions of their territory.

372. The Panel notes, however, the potential impact of power and/or class divisions
     in the resolution of conflicts both in the past and perhaps more recently. OD
     4.20 (paragraph 15) requires that the IPDP contain an assessment of the ability
     of the indigenous peoples "to obtain access to and effectively use the legal
     system to defend their rights." The Panel is concerned that the IPDP does
     not adequately reflect or address the risks posedto the Garífuna people by
     its proposed means of resolving conflicts. These include, in particular,
     risks posed by disparities of power in the process.

373. The use of the Mesa for conflict resolution, in particular, is of concern to the
     Panel in this regard, given the findings about representation of the communities
     noted elsewhere in this Report.     The identification of the real representatives
     of the indigenous communities is a matter of great importance for the correct,
     transparent and fair functioning of these conflict resolution systems.
     Substantial and informed supervision by Bank staff, especially specialists
     in indigenous peoples matters, to ensure that the process is fair and
     affected communities effectively participate in identifying their leaders and
     representatives, is of central importance to ensure compliance with
     relevant Bank policy.

374. OD 4.20 states that an IPDP should contain an assessment of the ability of
     groups to use the legal system to defend their rights. The Panel notes, for
     example, that the IPDP does not adequately assess the potential implications for
     indigenous peoples of the special expedited judicial procedure that is contained
     in the draft Property Law.

375. The Panel also notes the complexity of the conflict resolution procedures, and
     the concerns of Requesters that the existence of multiple conflict resolution
     procedures including those in the IPDP, in the new Property Law and others
     generates confusion in the communities. As described above, the IPDP
     envisions arbitration, conciliation and "mesas" for conflict resolution. The new
     Property Law, on the other hand, sets forth its own judicial abbreviated
     procedure, and, alternatively, provides for conciliation (for which the Property
     Institute would be the competent authority to initiate or support), arbitration or
     mediation. It should also be noted that the Project's Operational Manual
     describes the instances of extrajudicial conflict resolution as included in the
     Project IPDP, but also states that every conflict between indigenous peoples
     and third parties with respect to communal land will be subject to the special

            procedure created in the Property Law.                 213    In addition, during Project
            implementation, the Mesa Regional was created with a role in conflict
            resolution. Understandably, these many instances and options have created
            confusion and anxiety among the affected communities. The Panel finds
            that there is a need for clarification and consultation with the affected
            communities as to which procedures apply, and a need for better
            dissemination of this information.

     376. The Panel observes that demarcation and titling activities have yet to take place
            in the Garífuna communities selected for participating in the Project. The Panel
            does not express a judgment on the merits of the various means for resolving
            disputes, but notes and understands the Requesters' concerns.

Box 6.1 OFRANEH's petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)
 Box 6.1. OFRANEH's petition to Inter-American Commission of Human Rights
 (IACHR)

 On October 9, 2003, OFRANEH submitted a petition to the IACHR, which reflects the claims
 raised in the Request for Inspection to the Panel. The Panel notes that the petition before the
 Commission is not directly relevant to the Panel's investigation of the Bank Management
 compliance with its own policies and procedures. However, it informs the context in which
 the Project is being implemented and illustrates the kinds of land issues the Garífuna people
 face.

 OFRANEH's petition to the IACHR alleges that the State of Honduras violated Arts. 8, 21
 and 25 of the American Convention of Human Rights, in relation to ILO Convention No. 169
 as well, to the detriment of the Garífuna communities of Triunfo de la Cruz, Cayos Cochinos
 and Punta Piedra. The Commission decided, a few months after the submission, to separate
 the petition according to each community. This box includes a summary of the case
 concerning the community of Triunfo de la Cruz.

 OFRANEH argues that despite the community's property title (for 380 ha) and the deed
 guaranteeing occupancy (for 126.40ha), the State has violated the rights of the community
 because it did not protect them against invasions of their land by non Garífuna people and by
 the Municipality of Tela. OFRANEH alleges that the Municipality unlawfully obtained from
 INA an extension of its urban limits affecting Garífuna communal land in Triunfo de la Cruz
 and proceeded to award part of this land to its Labor Union.

 The State of Honduras contends that the petition is inadmissible because the community of
 Triunfo de la Cruz has not exhausted all available domestic remedies, especially with respect
 to the land allegedly taken by the Municipality of Tela.

 The IACHR concluded, on March 14, 2006, that the petition regarding the community of
 Triunfo de la Cruz is admissible, inter alia, because the community repeatedly complained to
 INA about actions of third parties and also brought court actions. However, ten years went by
 and, while the situation of the community is getting worse by the day, the State took no
 measure to try to solve the issue.

 The Commission is currently hearing the merits of the case. In the meantime, precautionary
 measures were requested by OFRANEH to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and
 granted in June 2005. Following inaction by the State, on September 21, 2005, the Court
 reiterated its original request for precautionary measures and requested that additional
 measures be adopted. OFRANEH has informed the Panel that, as of May 1, 2007, the
 precautionary measures ordered by the Court have not been implemented.



   G. The Implications of the Project for the Titling of Communal Lands

   377. The Project was intended to advance the titling of lands in Honduras, as an
           essential step to advance economic development in the country. The Panel
           recognizes the importance of these objectives. While the Project focuses on
           individual titling, the Project also includes a component on collective titling,


                                                 103

           with the proviso that communities can opt out of participating in the program.
           This was intended to protect the Garífuna and Misquito communities.

    378. However, the Panel finds that the Project may have consequences far
           different than intended by the Indigenous Peoples Plan. The Panel finds
           merit in the concerns of Requesters that the Project may contribute to the
           demise of titles and claims to collective lands held by the Garífuna and
           indigenous peoples. In this sense, the Project may not protect the cultural
           integrity or economic base of some of the poorest communities along the
           Caribbean coast.

    379. The Panel found that most members of the Mesas believe they were established
           to confirm and expand community titles and to get the saneamiento. In reality,
           the Mesas may not be effective in furthering collective titles, and may facilitate
           the opposite. The Panel notes concerns that municipalities may expand their
           urban limits over Ethnic Lands and grant individual titles to former communal
           lands and other lands that were formerly rural. The Panel was informed, for
           example, that all of the island of Roatán has been declared to be municipal or
           urban land. Once designated as urban lands, the municipality, not INA, has
           authority to issue the titles.         The Property Institute has responsibility for
           registering all titles.

    380. The Panel also notes that the establishment of the Mesa Regional led to a
           situation where the already existing Inter-Sectoral Commission for Protecting
           Land Rights of the Garífuna and Misquito People was ignored. Even after the
           Panel inquired to the Bank about the status of the Commission late last fall, and
           after several government officials and others signed an "Act" calling for the
           dissolution of the Mesa, the Bank responded by pressing strongly for the Mesa
           to be recognized as the appropriate body for dealing with Garífuna issues of
           title to lands.214 The Bank's position thus reinforced the power of an entity,
           (the Mesa), which has operated outside existing institutions and lacked the
           participation of the leading representatives of the Garífuna people in their
           struggle for land rights over many years.

    381. It is easy to understand why individuals would want to participate in the Mesas.
           For participants, it offers an official channel through which to present the
           interests of the Garífuna as they see them. Moreover, participants receive
           payment for travel expenses and perdiem for all meetings, which in the context
           of the poverty of the Garífuna communities may constitute a significant benefit.

    382. The Project entails legalizing the standing of the Mesas as community
           representatives. There is a danger that the Mesas, as developed during Project

214As noted previously, the Bank's letter to the Government in January 2007 requested the Government to
publicly rescind its repudiation of the Mesa Regional or submit to IDA the rationale for this "drastic
change of strategy and agree with IDA on an alternative transparent and non-exclusionary participatory
consultative framework . . ."

          implementation, will become independent organizations that will supplant the
          traditional patronatos and other existing civil society groups and may create
          further divisions within the Garífuna communities. Moreover, people who are
          not members of the Garífuna communities may be able to exert significant
          influence. In a Panel visit to the Regional Mesa, the Governor sat at the head
          table for the meeting, and delivered closing remarks.

   383. Among the Garífuna people interviewed by the Panel and its experts, there is
          broad consensus favoring communal title of Ethnic Lands. There is a
          possibility, however, that the Project as it stands will provide individual titles to
          families in Garífuna and indigenous communities, who will sell their land for
          prices which are attractive to them but inexpensive to the buyers. Individuals in
          poor communities may be most tempted.            The Panel notes that it received
          comments from various quarters that the Project may have the effect of splitting
          the Garífuna communities, which could facilitate the eventual loss of collective
          titles and the rise of individual titles across the valuable land area fronting the
          Caribbean coast in Honduras.

   384. As noted elsewhere in this Report, Management claims that communities are
          free to choose whether they want to participate in the Project and "individual
          communities can avoid the potential harm alleged by the Requesters by
          choosing not to participate in the Project." However, the Panel has significant
          concerns about the representation of Garífuna peoples under the Project,
          including the Mesa Regional's selection of the communities participating in the
          Project. This selection was followed by a questionable ex post facto
          consultation process in which one community, Punta Piedra, managed to
          disengage from the Project.        This community had special circumstances
          regarding collective titles.  215


   385. Importantly, the Panel doubts whether there is a meaningful option for most
          communities not to participate in the demarcation and titling activities provided
          under the Project. The new Property Law, enacted after the Credit was
          approved by the Board, grants specific rights to non-indigenous peoples who
          occupy and hold a "valid title" within Ethnic Lands. As a result, these non
          indigenous title holders may trigger title regularization activities in Ethnic
          Lands. Communities may face a choice of participating in a Project which they
          believe, as currently structured, does not represent their interests, or attempt to
          opt out of the Project and face significant challenges from non-indigenous
          people occupying and claiming rights over their Ethnic Lands. Given the
          relative economic and political vulnerability of the indigenous peoples, the
          Panel finds that the safeguards provided under the Project are not
          adequate to protect the Garífuna rights over their Ethnic Lands in the
          context of Project implementation.

THE INSPECTION PANEL
OFFICE MEMORANDUM

DATE:            December 20, 2006

SUBJECT:         Request for Inspection HONDURAS: Land Administration Project
                 Request for Legal Opinion

   1. The purpose of this memorandum is to request a legal opinion on certain matters
         related to the rights and obligations of the International Development Association
         (IDA) with respect to the above referred Request for Inspection. This request is
         made pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Resolution that established the Inspection
         Panel, which provides that "The Panel shall seek the advice of the Bank's Legal
         Department on matters related to the Bank's rights and obligations with respect
         to the request under consideration."216 In this instance, the "`Bank's rights and
         obligations' here must be analyzed in terms of the correlative obligations"217 of
         the Borrower.


Background

   2. On January 3, 2006, the Inspection Panel received a Request for Inspection
         raising issues related to the Honduras: Land Administration Project (IDA Credit
         No. 3858 HO) (the Project218). The Request ­ submitted by OFRANEH, an
         organization representing Garífuna communities living on the northern coast of
         Honduras ­ argues that the Project will harm the rights and interests of the
         Garífuna people and communities because it will ultimately lead to the loss of
         their ancestral land219 and their traditional communal land titles. The Requesters

2002), ¶ 2.
218Also referred to as PATH.
219As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), "for purposes of the project the term ethnic lands
means `those lands that have ancestrally and historically been settled by Amerindian groups and /or Afro-
Honduran communities for their use and that constitute their habitat on which they undertake their


                                                   115

          state that by supporting the implementation of the new Property Law (enacted
          after the Credit was approved), the PATH will deny them full rights over the
          lands they have traditionally occupied and possessed and will give title to some of
          these lands to non-Garífuna people.

    3. The Project - the objective of which is to establish a decentralized land
          administration system to provide users in the Project area with accurate
          information on land parcels and effective land administration services ­ is part of
          a proposed three-phase Bank-financed Land Administration Program.220 This
          Program was designed to be the "main instrument to implement" legal,
          institutional, and technological Government reforms aimed at, inter alia,
          formalizing property rights for the majority of Hondurans and facilitating access
          to land by the poor. (PAD, p.1)

    4. At the time of Project appraisal, a new Property Law was being discussed by the
          Honduran Congress. The new Law (Ley de Propiedad, Decreto No. 82/2004) was
          enacted in June 2004, a few months after the Board of Executive Directors of IDA
          approved the IDA Credit financing the Project (February 2004). The Property
          Law became, therefore, an essential part of the legal framework within which the
          Project is being implemented.221

    5. The Requesters state that the Property Law, as it deals with the regularization of
          property for indigenous and Afro-Honduran people, is highly detrimental to their
          rights and interests in their Ethnic Lands. In this sense, they fear that the Project,
          by providing the technical, logistical and financial means to apply the new
          Property Law, may cause the demise of their communal property and may deprive
          them of lands that they traditionally own but are currently occupied by non-
          Garífuna people. This sentiment is widely shared by other Garífuna organizations
          and people interviewed by the Panel.

Issues

    6. In their Request to the Panel and in other submissions to the Bank, the Requesters
          have raised various objections to the 2004 Property Law, which they believe will


traditional productive and cultural practices.' " PAD, p. 5, Table 2. See also Development Credit
Agreement (Land Administration Project) between the Republic of Honduras and the International
Development Association, August 18, 2004, Section 1.02(e).
220 The Project is composed of three parts (A, B and C) respectively aimed at developing the policy
framework and institutional strengthening for the creation and operation of a National Property
Administration System (in Spanish Sistema Nacional de Administración de la Propiedad - SINAP);
systematizing the regularization, titling and registration of lands in the Project area; and carrying out
monitoring and evaluation activities. Part B provides for systematic land regularization, titling and
registration of lands in the Project Area. Under this component, the Project will carry out field surveying of
macro boundaries (e.g. municipal lands), urban and rural areas, forests, protected areas and ethnic lands.
Part B further provides for parcel-level surveying and validation in the form of systematic cadastral field
surveys of urban and rural areas to demarcate property boundaries and property rights in each parcel.
Legalization, titling and registration of these lands will then be carried out.

        legitimize the ongoing violations of Garífunas' land rights by non-Garífuna
        people and will legalize the occupation and possession by non-Garífunas of land
        which the Garífuna communities were already given or to which full communal
        property titles have been recognized. The Requesters also argue that this law will
        push for a dynamic land market that favors elites in power, to the detriment of
        customary indigenous rights and in violation of laws that protect them. In the
        Requesters' view, since the Property Law is the essential normative component of
        the legal framework supporting the PATH, the Project will be the instrument
        through which territorial claims of the Garífuna communities will be denied and
        non-Garífunas will secure their rights over Garífuna land.           222


    7. Issues of occupation of Garífuna lands by people outside the Garífuna
        communities were also raised in the Project documents (including a Bank-
        sponsored Legal Analysis of the Land Administration Project and the revised
        Project Operational Manual223), which confirm the existence of serious conflicts
        between indigenous communities and non-indigenous peoples, who have
        occupied and taken possession of ancestral lands, at times with fraud and/or
        violence. (See Legal Analysis, Table 13, Land Conflicts in Indigenous Areas, p.
        41) The Legal Analysis also addresses conflicts that have arisen because land
        considered to be the functional habitat of the indigenous peoples, e.g. the northern
        coast of Honduras, was declared a tourist area or because it is subject to
        exploitation by farmers who disregard the ownership rights of the indigenous
        communities. (See Legal Analysis, Table 13, Land Conflicts in Indigenous Areas,
        p. 41). The updated Operational Manual further recognizes that the uncontrolled
        occupation of Ethnic Lands by people who are not members of the ethnic
        communities has generated harsh conflicts with these communities. According to
        the Manual, these conflicts will be subject to the special judicial procedures
        established in the Property Law. (See Operational Manual, p. 64 and 65)

    8. The Requesters object to the implementation of the provisions of Chapter III
        [Article 93-102] of the Property Law, which provides for the regularization of
        property for indigenous and Afro-Honduran people. They state that while Article
        93 recognizes the importance of ancestral land rights, the remaining articles in the
        Chapter are highly detrimental to the fulfillment of these same rights. The
        Requesters, as well as other Garífuna organizations present in Honduras such as
        ODECO, and the Mesa Regional established under the Project, strongly object to
        Article 97, according to which a third party who has title of ownership to the
        lands of indigenous peoples, and who has had and possessed the land referred to
        in such title, has the right to continue possessing and exploiting such land;224

violación DO 4.20 y DO 4.01), p. 2, in Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation Honduras: Land

223 Legal Analysis of the Land Administration Project, Mario Vallejo Larios, October 2003 and Land
Administration Project, Operational Manual for Regularization, August 28, 2004
224 "Unofficial translation" of Chapter III provided by Management to the Panel and attached to
Management Response as Annex 7. In Spanish, Article 97 reads: " El tercero que tenga título de propiedad


                                                    117

         Article 98 which provides that a third party who has received a title of ownership
         to the communal property of indigenous peoples, which may be nullified as a
         result of the characteristics thereof, shall be indemnified for the improvements
         prior to the return of the lands to the affected communities;225 and Article 100,
         which provides that indigenous communal land is inalienable, not attachable and
         imprescriptible, but allows the communities themselves to terminate such
         communal tenure system, authorizing the rental of lands to third parties or
         authorizing other contracts that allow the community to participate in investments
         that contribute to their development.226

     9. According to the Requesters, the mentioned articles are in violation of ILO
         Convention No. 169, which recognizes and protects the rights of ownership and
         possession of indigenous and tribal peoples over the lands they traditionally
         occupy.227 The Requesters believe that, as a result, by supporting the application
         and implementation of the Property Law, the Bank facilitates non-compliance
         with the ILO Convention.

     10. In its Response, Management states that "the Project incorporates appropriate
         safeguards to fill potential gaps in Honduran legislation to safeguard the rights of
         Indigenous Peoples." It adds that the content of national laws and regulation is the
         responsibility of the Government of Honduras and that mechanisms are available
         for civil society to raise their concerns. (See Management Response, at paragraph
         21). It further states that the issue of non-compliance with ILO Convention No.
         169 "may be appropriate to raise within the jurisdictional context of other fora ...
         [while] the World Bank obligation in this project is to ensure compliance with the
         World Bank's applicable policies, including the Operational Directive on
         Indigenous Peoples." (See Management Response, at note 11).

     11. Noting that the Credit financing the PATH was approved in February 2004 and
         became effective in December 2004, while the Property Law became effective in
         June 2004, Management argues that the Project design "anticipated the possibility
         of a new law by providing mechanisms ... for the continuous flexible adaptation


en tierras de estos pueblos [indígenas y afrohondureños] y que ha tenido y poseído la tierra amparada por
ese título , tiene derecho de continuar poseyéndola y explotándola."
225 Art 98 reads: "El tercero que ha recibido titulo de propiedad en tierras comunales de esos rublos, que
por sus características pudiera ser anulable, previo a la devolución de las tierras a las comunidades
afectadas será indemnizado en sus mejoras."
226 Art. 100 reads: "Se declara y reconoce que el régimen de las tierras que tradicionalmente poseen esos
pueblos conlleva la inalienabilidad, inembargabilidad e imprescriptibilidad de la misma.
No obstante, las mismas comunidades podrán poner fin a este régimen comunal, autorizar arrendamientos a
favor de terceros o autorizar contratos de otra naturaleza que permitan la participación de la comunidad en
inversiones que contribuyan a su desarrollo."
227Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO No. 169),
adopted on June 27, 1989 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation at its
seventy-sixth session, entered into force September 5, 1991. Honduras ratified the Convention in 1995.
The Honduran Congress passed in 1994 the law that approved the ILO Convention No. 169 (Decreto 26 de
Mayo 25 de 1994 que aprueba el Convenio 169 de la OIT sobre Pueblos Indígenas y Tribales en Países
Independientes).


                                                     118

    of the Project to the new law." (Response, at paragraph 52). The Response lists
    such mechanisms as:

o the issuance by the Supreme Court of a Regulatory Decree (Auto Acordado)
    authorizing a parcel-based property registry in Project areas as a condition of
    credit effectiveness;

o adequate access to legal advice and training before decisions are made regarding
    lands which are in conflict;

o transparent decision-making mechanisms for conflict resolution on these lands
    which include genuine representation of indigenous and Afro-Honduras groups;

o a covenant providing that "no titling and physical demarcation of lands adjacent
    to Ethnic Lands will take place unless procedures that adequately protect the
    rights of the indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples, duly consulted with affected
    parties in a manner satisfactory to the Association and set forth in the
    Operational Manual, have been followed;"

o adoption of a legal and regulatory framework for indigenous peoples lands as a
    trigger to phase II of the Land Administration Program.

12. The Response further states that, in light of the Project's objectives and the above-
    mentioned safeguards, Management "found the new law acceptable" and
    "concluded that the Project's safeguard provisions were not in conflict with the
    new law and the two could be harmonized." (Response, paragraph 56).
    Management also notes that the land regulations to the Law have yet to be issued
    and thus that the IPDP and Operational Manual for the Project "have not been
    updated." According to the Response, the Project's safeguards prevent the
    Government from launching field activities until the Bank has issued its non-
    objection to the land regularization and conflict resolution procedures. (Response,
    paragraph 57). Management states that if the land regularization procedures under
    preparation are approved as regulations to the Property Law and if they are
    consistent with the Credit Agreement and the Bank safeguard policies,
    "Management will endorse the incorporation of said procedures into the IPDP
    and Project Operational Manual." (Response, paragraph 63)

13. However, the records show that issues related to possible adverse effects of the
    Project and of the Property Law on indigenous people's ancestral land rights were
    of concern to Bank staff working on the PATH. With respect to the safeguards to
    be included in the Credit Agreement, staff argued that "a procedure in the
    Operational Manual, no matter how good and consulted it may be, is not the same
    as a national legal framework ..." A few months before the Property Law was
    enacted, Bank staff emphasized that although the wording of the draft Law
    seemed good, it might mean and imply different things, and thus an analysis by
    Bank lawyers expert on ethnic rights was "strongly" suggested. (Project files,
    Email dated December 17, 2003 and Email dated May 19, 2004)



                                        119

  14. The Panel notes that, according to Project records, at the Decision Meeting before
      the Credit's approval, questions were raised on whether the Bank should proceed
      with the Project before the enactment of the new Property Law. The meeting
      agreed that to go ahead with the Project under the circumstances was still the
      "best course of action" because, in Management's view, no justification prevented
      the Project from titling under the existing legal framework, which was considered
      quite adequate. The meeting also agreed that the Project Operational Manual
      would contain procedures on conflict resolution satisfactory to the Association, as
      noted above, and that the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) would include
      specific provisions "to ensure that Government takes positive steps to address the
      land rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-Honduran peoples, in particular to
      safeguard against the possibility of other land claimants taking advantage of the
      traditionally weak bargaining position of these groups."

  15. The draft DCA prepared by the Bank for negotiations contained a covenant
      related to the titling or physical demarcation of Ethnic Lands. The Panel notes that
      the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations for the proposed PATH conducted on
      January 8-9, 2004 indicated that "Article 3.10 was modified to read as follows:

      the Borrower shall ensure that no titling or physical demarcation of lands
      adjacent to Ethnic Lands will take place unless procedures that adequately
      protect the rights of indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples, duly consulted with
      affected parties in a manner satisfactory to the Association, and set forth in the
      Operational Manual have been followed." (Emphasis added) (Minutes of
      Negotiations, Washington, DC, January 8-9, 2004, paragraph27)

      The Panel notes that the reasons for or legal consequences of the amendment are
      not indicated in the Minutes of Negotiations.

  16. However, on January 22, 2004 the memorandum requesting the Senior Vice
      President and General Counsel of the World Bank to sign the Recommendation of
      the Statutory Committee with respect to the proposed Land Administration
      Project indicated that the negotiated DCA included among the legal covenants
      and "obligations for Honduras" the following provision:

      "ensure that no titling or physical demarcation of Ethnic Lands and of private
      lands adjacent to Ethnic Lands will take place unless procedures that adequately
      protect the rights of indigenous and Afro-Honduran peoples, duly consulted with
      affected parties in a manner satisfactory to the Association, and set forth in the
      Operational Manual have been followed." (Emphasis added)

      The Panel found no record indicating that the Senior Vice-President and General
      Counsel was aware of the amendment noted above to the draft DCA when he
      signed the Recommendation of the Statutory Committee.

     17. Noting that:

              a. the Project is, inter alia, providing the technical, logistical and financial
                   support to implement the Property Law;

              b. the Property Law provides that a third party who has title of ownership to
                   the lands of indigenous peoples, and who has had and possessed the land
                   referred to in such title, has the right to continue possessing and exploiting
                   such land; and that a third party who has received a title of ownership to
                   the communal property of indigenous peoples, which may be nullified as a
                   result of the characteristics thereof, shall be indemnified for the
                   improvements prior to the return of the lands to the affected communities
                   (see supra paragraph 8)

              c. Government officials have informed the Panel that no resources have yet
                   been earmarked and pledged to indemnify third parties who hold titles in
                   Ethnic Lands, which may be nullified;

              d. OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples) aims at ensuring that (a) indigenous
                   peoples benefit from development projects (paragraph 2), (b) potentially
                   adverse effects on indigenous peoples caused by Bank-financed activities
                   are avoided or mitigated (paragraph 2); (c) the development process
                   fosters full respect for their dignity, human rights and cultural uniqueness
                   (paragraph 6); (d) indigenous peoples do not suffer adverse effects during
                   the development process from Bank-financed projects (paragraph 6); and
                   they receive cultural and compatible social and economic benefits
                   (paragraph 6);

              e. Bank operational policies (OMS 2.20 on Project Appraisal and OP 4.01 on
                   Environmental Assessment) prevent the Bank from financing activities
                   that would contravene the Borrower's international obligations;228

              f. ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in
                   Independent Countries, to which the Government of Honduras became a
                   party in 1995, establishes that "The rights of ownership and possession of
                   the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall
                   be recognized. In addition, measures shall be taken in appropriate cases
                   to safeguard the right of the peoples concerned to use lands not
                   exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had
                   access for their subsistence and traditional activities..." (Article 14.1) and
                   that "Governments shall take steps as necessary to identify the lands

228 OMS 2.02 (Project Appraisal) provides that "Should international agreements exist that are applicable
to the project and area, such as those involving the use of international waters, the Bank should be satisfied
that the project plan is consistent with the terms of the agreement." OP 4.01(Environmental Assessment)
states that the EA takes into account the "obligations of the country, pertaining to project activities, under
relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank does not finance project activities
that would contravene such country obligations",


                                                      121

               which the peoples concerned traditionally occupy, and to guarantee
               effective protection of their rights of ownership and possession." (Article
               14.2)

           g. the original terms of the above-mentioned covenant provided in Section
               3.10 of the Credit Agreement were amended during the negotiations and
               apparently this amendment and its rationale were not reported to the
               General Counsel; and

           h. other than Section 3.10 and references to the Operational Manual, the
               Credit Agreement does not seem to include a specific provision, such as
               an event of default, dealing with the possibility that the provisions and
               implementation of the new Property Law would not be consistent with the
               objectives of the Project and above-referred Bank operational policies and
               procedures;

           i.  that the issues raised refer not to the content or intent of national
               legislation but rather whether the implementation of the Bank-financed
               project may result in instances of harm to the rights of indigenous people
               over their Ethnic Lands, as they fear;

       the Panel would appreciate a legal opinion on whether and to what extent the
       safeguards included in the Project and in the legal documents, including specific
       provisions of the Operational Manual, effectively protect the indigenous and
       Afro-Honduran peoples' rights on their Ethnic Lands from the harm that, in their
       opinion, will result from applying the provisions in Chapter III of the Property
       Law, with regard to the regularization of Ethnic Lands under the Bank-financed
       Land Administration Project.

   18. The Inspection Panel would expect to incorporate or refer to your Legal Opinion
       in the Investigation Report.
