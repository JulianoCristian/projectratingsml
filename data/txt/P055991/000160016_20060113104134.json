The\n            Request was submitted by the Organizacion Fraternal Negra\n            Honduras (OFRANEH) on behalf of the indigenous Garifuna\n            population of Honduras. This Request was registered on\n            January 10, 2006. The Requesters state that under the\n            project, ancestral lands are to be regularized in favor of\n            indigenous and Afro-Honduran populations by recognizing\n            communal or individual land rights, based on the preference\n            of each community, and by registering such rights in the\n            land registry. In addition, they note that properties and\n            possessions supported by ancestral title or certification\n            can be registered as private property and enjoy full\n            ownership rights. However, the Requesters fear that the land\n            titling and procedures provided under the Project will\n            ultimately cause the demise of collective property in favor\n            of individual property, which is contrary to the land tenure\n            system they prefer, and could give their land, which they\n            consider as their functional habitat, to people outside the\n            Garifuna communities. The Requesters claim: 1) in designing\n            and implementing the Project, the Bank did not take into\n            account the rights and interests of the Garifuna communities\n            and, as a result, violated a number of its policies and\n            procedures, such as OD 4.20 on Indigenous People, OP/BP 4.01\n            on Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.04 on Natural\n            Habitats; 2) the Bank did not consider the legal status of\n            the indigenous populations or the procedures to issue\n            collective titles, as provided in the country's\n            Constitution and legislation; 3) while the IPDP provides for\n            issuing regulations to delimit and demarcate indigenous\n            peoples' lands, these were never is sued; 4) the Bank\n            staff did not consult with affected people prior to\n            preparing the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP),\n            and did not distribute Project background material; 5)\n            although Bank staff were aware during project preparation\n            that the Government was to enact a Property Law, to be the\n            centerpiece of the land titling program, they did not\n            mention this law in the legal framework section of the\n            Project documents. Moreover, the Garifuna people opposed\n            this law. The failure to reference the Property Law and the\n            lack of consultation meetings with the affected people have\n            generated confusion within the Garifuna communities, because\n            the Project documents, including the IPDP, on the one side,\n            and the Property Law on the other, provide for two different\n            sets of procedures for land titling and conflict resolution.\n            And in any event, both sets of procedures are inadequate\n            because they do not respond to their social and political reality."}, "docdt": "2006-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
