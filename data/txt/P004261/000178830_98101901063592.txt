RURAL CREDIT PROJECT (Loan 1900-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The project was appraised in September 1973 but processing was
suspended in mid-1975 as the Bank and BPM could not agree on several project
issues and it was learned the Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM) Act was to be
amended (paras. 2.02-2.05). Project processing was resumed in 1977 after
these issues were resolved and the project was appraised in September 1979
and approved in August 1980. The project's main objective was to strengthen
BPM to function as an agricultural development bank and provide full banking
services to farmers. The Bank loan was to finance (a) subloans for production
credit and term lending for agriculture, (b) expansion of BPM's branch network,
(c) development of a training center for BPM, and (d) technical assistance for
BPM.
The project was cancelled on June 28, 1982, at the request of the
Government. Cancellation was caused by Government decision to initiate a
credit program for smallholders providing up to M$50,000 free of interest or
at 2% p.a. This conflicted with the loan covenant which required subloans
below M$30,000 financed under the project at 1.5% p.a. above prime rate to be
80% in number and 25% in value of the credit component. Several alternatives
were reviewed such as financing subloans above M$50,000 and scaling down the
project size so that institution building could take place. Eventually
cancellation became necessary as the poverty target group could no longer be
served and transfer of resources was not critical for Malaysia (paras. 3.06
and 3.07).
With the benefit of hindsight, it seems the Bank underestimated the
influence of various groups in the country to use subsidized interest rates as
a means to assist poor smallholders and did not realize that the new credit
program would be implemented by BPM regardless of Bank disagreement. The Bank
did have the option to request the Government to submit its interest rate
policy as a condition for Board presentation or project effectiveness which
would have avoided approval of the loan and subsequent cancellation after the
project was declared effective.
There are no other points of interest as the project was still in
the initial stage of implementation when the loan was cancelled.






MALAYSIA
RURAL CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 1900-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01       The Malaysia Rural Credit Project (Loan 1900-MA) to BPM was for
US$30 million to increase lending activities, expand branch network,
strengthen training and provide technical assistance. The project was
designed to correct defects in the traditional agricultural credit system
operated by informal lenders and to provide full banking services to
smallholders.
1.02       Project identification/preparation, which began in 1970, was
in two stages. Field appraisal took place in September 1973 but unfortunate-
ly, the project was not finalized due to disagreement with BPM on several
major issues and processing was suspended in 1975 with Government agreement.
In April 1977, the project was resurrected; field appraisal took place in
September 1979 and the loan was approved in August 1980. Although the loan
became effective in June 1981, the project encountered a major policy obstacle
(see Chapter III) and the Bank cancelled the loan, at the Borrower's request,
on June 28, 1982. No disbursements were made and the Government paid commit-
ment charges up to the cancellation date of US$317,500.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION/PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Identification/Preparation
2.01       BPM was established in 1969 as a wholly Government-owned credit
institution to provide short, medium and long-term credit for agricultural
development and to mobilize savings for the agricultural sector. After an
initial period of slow growth and conservative policies, BPM expanded its
agricultural portfolio rapidly but agricultural loans were still a minor
portion of BPM's total assets. It also ventured into other activities, citing
portfolio diversification for risk aversion as the rationale. Nevertheless,
BPM which is the official agricultural bank was chosen by the Government as
the most suitable credit institution to implement a rural credit project
financed by the Bank.
The First Stage (1970-1975)
2.02       The dialogue with the Bank started in 1970 and the first Bank
mission, in May 1971, confirmed there were reasonable prospects for BPM to
finance smallholder rubber rehabilitation. Five more Bank and FOA/CP missions



assisted BPM prior to field appraisal in September 1973. However, BPM did not
agree on a number of important issues. In June 1975, while the Bank was still
seeking agreement on these issues, BPM requested that project processing
should be deferred as a wider mandate for BPM, announced by the then Prime
Minister (i.e. acceptance of demand deposits and undertaking of all
commercial bank operations), would change the project concept dramatically.
In August 1975, the Bank agreed not to proceed until BPM had established its
priorities and objectives under the amended BPM Act.
2.03      The major unresolved issues were:  senior manager vacancies; and
the adverse impact of subsidiaries and joint ventures on BPM's main
activities. In October 1974, two of the four division manager posts were
vacant. BPM appointed the Chairman to the new post of Managing Director in
January 1974 who also became responsible for day-to-day operations as the
chief executive officer and at the same time abolished the post of Deputy
General Manager. The General Manager became the chief executive again when
the Chairman retired in 1982.
2.04      The Bank was concerned that BPMs subsidiaries and joint ventures
would become a drain on BPM-s resources, particularly as BPM's investments
and loans to subsidiaries and joint ventures increased from M$5.5 million at
appraisal to M$15.0 million, about one-third of BPM's assets, at December 31,
1975. Although the Bank wished to review BPM's financial status, BPM
management did not provide the data required, as explained in the following
paragraph.
2.05      The Bank and BPM had different approaches to two basic project
concepts; the long-term role to be played by BPM and the main objective of the
project.  In the long run, both the Govern-ment and the Bank believed that
BPM's role was to become the single source of government credit to the
agricultural sector, providing a full range of rural banking services.
Institution-building was considered by the Bank to be the most important
function of the project but BPM was less enthusiastic. BPM wished to
undertake commercial operations rather than expand agricultural credit,
for which there was strong demand. Furthermore, BPM management considered the
Bank merely as another source of funds for agricultural lending as it expected
the Government would, in any case, provide the funds needed. BPM seeemed
reluctant to accept Bank involvement in issues not directly related to the
project, such as BPM's involvement in subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Second Stage (1977-1979)
2.06      In April 1977, the Government and BPM agreed to prepare an
agricultural credit project to cover all agricultural needs in the country
other than those handled by the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA)
and Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA). They
also agreed that the focus of the first project would be institution building
and would include the following components:



- 3 -
(a)  lending for production credits and term lending for agriculture
and agro-businesses;
(b)  training for BPM and other agencies involved in project
implementation;
(c)  improvement in financial control;
(d)  technical assistance for employment of specialists.
2.07      The two major outstanding issues (see paras. 2.03 and 2.04) were no
longer considered to be obstacles, i.e.,
(a)  Recruitment of Senior Staff.  A new General Manager was
appointed and other senior managers recruited.
(b)  Subsidiaries.  BPM's holding company and its three wholly-owned
subsidiaries accumulated large losses and the Government directed
BPM to make them viable or close them down. For the purpose of
appraisal, their operations were assumed to be a separate issue to
be resolved by BPM and the Government. BPM also agreed to make no
further investments in subsidiaries.
2.08      Between September 1978 and May 1979, there were five Bank and FAO/CP
missions focusing primarily on institutional, technical and lending program
issues.  It was acknowledged that the project scope would be limited than
similar projects in other countries and expansion of the agricultural loan
portfolio depended on several developments.
(a)  Strengthening of BPM's capacity to identify, appraise and supervise
investment projects;
(b)  Reconciliation between government subsidy and credit
programs for agriculture;
(c)  Adequate operating margins in BPM's lending operations; and
(d)  Expansion of BPM's field office network in rural areas.
B. Project Appraisal
2.09      A Bank appraisal mission visited Malaysia in September 1979 which
did not make any substantial changes in project features, scope or cost.
One new issue reviewed during appraisal was the need to restructure BPM's
capital and as this was outside the scope of the project, it was agreed that
capital restructuring should be a Government responsibility.



2.10      Two amendments were made to the conclusions reached by the appraisal
mission at a decision meeting in October 1979: a reduction of the loan amount
from US$25 million to US$10 million;/1 and the introduction of a formula for
the onlending interest rate (1 1/2% p.a. over Malaysian prime lending rate)
instead of a fixed rate of 9%5 p.a.
C. Project/Loan
Project Description and Objectives
2.11      The project would finance over a three-year period (a) BPM's short-,
medium- and long-term agricultural credit; (b) expansion of the present branch
network and development of a banking system in rural areas; (c) development of
a training center; and (d) technical assistance. The principal goals of the
project were: to absorb agricultural credit programs managed by other public
institutions into BPM's portfolio; to simplify and streamline its credit
processing procedures; and to introduce a financial control system.
Project Cost
2.12      Total project costs were estimated at US$79.4 million, of which
US$30 million, or 38%, was foreign exchange. The project cost is summarized
in the following table:

Financing
2.13      The proposed Bank loan of US830 million would finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project, exclusive of taxes and duties.  The
Government would provide financing in the form of direct loans to BPM for its
lending operations. It would also institute a review mechanism reflected in
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and BPM, to determine
BPM's financial requirements.
On-Lending Terms
2.14      The interest rate in the Suhsidiary Loan Agreement was 9.25% p.a.,
the same rate as the Bank loan to the Government. BPM would onlend to
end-borrowers at a minimum interest rate of 1.5% over prime (9.07 p.a. at the
time of negotiations), the Government meeting any BPM's deficits. To reach
the maximum number of smallholders in the poverty group, BPM was required
under the project to finance subloans below M$30,000 to be at least 80X in
number and 25% in value of the credit component.
Project Implementation
2.15      Organization and Management.  The implementing agency would be BPM,
with the Treasury supervising BPM's performance. A key feature of the project
would be the development of interagency cooperation between the Rubber
Industry Smallholder Development Authority (RISDA) and BPM, as BPM would take
over RISDA's credit activities. For this purpose, a committee to plan the
transfer of RISDA's credit operations to BPM was organized to meet on a
monthly basis.
III. PROJECT START-UP AND CANCELLATION
Start-up
3.01      The first supervision mission visited Malaysia in January/February
1981 to assist BPM and agree on the final draft of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement. The mission was informed that the Government had announced a
new interest rate policy by providing funds to smallholders free of interest,
or at 2% p.a., as shown in the table below.

3.02      The possibility of the Government introducing subsidized interest
rates to help eliminate poverty was first informally reported in May 1980.
During his visit to Washington, D.C., in June 1980, Datuk Sallehudin, Deputy
Secretary General, Treasury inquired whether a Government proposal to
subsidize interest rates would be acceptable to the Bank. The Bank stressed
that subsidized interest rates as an instrument to help the poor would almost
certainly prove to be ineffective and suggested that the Government consider
interest rate subsidies for specific areas, sectors, or target groups. The
Bank also suggested the need to explore other means of assisting the poor, for
example a direct subsidy for identified groups which would have a greater
impact on poverty than interest subsidies. No conclusion was reached but it
was agreed that the Government would inform the Bank on any changes made in
interest rate policy. The Government however, did not report to the Bank that
new interest rates had been established for credit to smallholders (see para.
3.01).
3.03      The first supervision mission understood that the new smallholder
interest rate policy would be applicable only to government funds, and that
the new credit program would serve smallholders in designated poverty areas.
Implementation of the project was considered possible by serving smallholders
located outside designated poverty areas and larger farmers ineligible for
loans under the new credit program. It was agreed that the overall impact of
the subsidized interest program would be measured and that credit demand
under the project would be assessed when the Government designated the
poverty areas.



3.04      When the loan was declared effective in June 1981, poverty areas
for the new credit program had not been designated and it was assumed that
BPM would be able to implement the Bank project, although probably on a
smaller scale.
Cancellation
3.05      In October 1981, the second supervision mission found that the
Government had decided to implement the new credit program on a national
basis, retroactively from January 1, 1981. This eliminated implementation
of the Bank project which required subloans below M$30,000 financed under the
project at 1.5% p.a. above prime rate to be 80% in number and 257 in value of
the credit component. The new credit program would finance subloans up to
M$50,000 free of interest or at 2% p.a. (see para. 3.01) and the project would
be able to finance only subloans above M$50,000. Despite the condition
specified in the loan covenants, the Government and BPM both failed to consult
the Bank before the terms and conditions of BPM's agricultural lending were
changed.
3.06      The Government proposed to renegotiate the loan and to change the
project concept if necessary. No formal proposal was submitted to the Bank
but the Government suggested two possible revisions; permit financing of
subloans below M$50,000 at the subsidized interest rates applied under the new
credit program (free of interest or 2% p.a.), or shift financing to subloans
above MS50,000 charging 1.5% over prime rate. The first proposal was not
acceptable to the Bank as subloans bearing no interest, or 2% p.a., was not
considered a viable option. The second proposal was to redesign the project
to serve higher income farmers who were outside the smallholder target group
and not in greatest need, which was also not acceptable to the Bank. In view
of these new developments, the Government wrote to the Bank on June 28, 1982,
requesting cancellation of the loan. The Bank cancelled the loan, as
requested, in the amount of US$30 million originally approved, on June 28,
1982.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01      The need for a Bank assisted credit project to provide subloans and
full banking services to smallholders was well recognized. It was unfortunate
that project processing took so long as implementation of the project would
have enabled BPM to develop into a viable development bank serving the agri-
cultural sector as the major credit channel. This may have prevented the
proliferation of government departments and agencies which now handle agricul-
tural credit under different terms and conditions. However, suspension of
project processing in 1975 was necessary to enable the Bank to reflect on the
changes of the BPM Act and the impact of new programs included in the Third
Malaysia Plan.



- 8 -
4.02      The Bank wanted BPM to concentrate solely on agricultural credit
operations and to reduce or eliminate other activities. Anticipating a new
charter, mentioned in paragraph 2.02, the view of BPM's was that up to 60%
of BPM's lending should be for agriculture, the remainder for nonagricultural
purposes, chiefly in rural areas. BPM felt that this would: provide full
banking services to farmers; earn additional profits to offset losses in
agricultural lending; and channel resources from urban to rural areas. The
Bank and BPM were unable to reconcile these views during the first stage of
project preparation.
4.03      In retrospect, the Bank should have requested a Government statement
on interest rate policies as a condition for Board presentation or project
effectiveness. However, the Bank should also have taken more seriously the
Government's intention to use subsidized interest rates to assist the poor.
The Bank underestimated the influence of various pressure groups in the
country to introduce these measures.

Dear Mr KaDur,
Project Comcletion Renort on
Malaysia Rural Credit Prsject (Lcan 1900-KI)
Thank you for your letter of June 17, 1983 together with the draft
Project Completion Report on Malaysia Rural Credit Project (Loan
1900-MA).  I would like to offer the following adjustments:
1.  In Para 2.03 the post of MD was created on 1.1.74 and
the then Chairman of B-M was azpointed to the post as
well. From 1.1.74, therefcre, the ND assunmed responsi-
bilities for the day-to-day ooerations as Chief Executive
of the Bank. The Deputy General Manager's post was
abolished because at that time we have already an MD and
a GM.
2.  The next adjustment is with regard to the last sentence
of para 2.05. Please delete"such as institution
building" and leave that "BPM seems reluctant to accept
Bank's involvement in subsidiaries and joint-ventures"
because BOM was in fact aareeable to Bank's involvement
in issues of institution building.
3.  The third adjustment is in Para 4.02, second sentence:
The view of BPM's was that uo to 60% of BPM's lending
should be to the smallholders agriculture and the
remainder 40% for big-time agriculture such as financing
for estate development, agricultural marketing and
processing of agri-business. At no time BP" in its
charter was allowed to finance non-agricultural purposes.
I would be grateful if adjustments to the Project Completion
Report could be made.
Thank you
Yours sincerely
