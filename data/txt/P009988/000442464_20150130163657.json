To meet\n            the demands of the changing labor market, International\n            Development Association (IDA) supported India's long\n            term program of reforms in the middle level technical\n            education system dealing with training of technicians and\n            supervisors. There was increase in the number of\n            well-trained technicians in India and in women's access\n            to both technical education and good jobs. For example: some\n            25,000 technicians per year since 1998 trained in over 200\n            new and high technology areas. A new long term program of\n            major institutional reforms at degree level institutions for\n            engineering education has begun."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
