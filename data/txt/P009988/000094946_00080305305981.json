The\n            project achieved its objectives, which were clearly defined,\n            and relevant to national policies, most importantly, it laid\n            the foundation for greater self-reliance of polytechnics,\n            and for partnerships with industry, and community, in the\n            management, and financing of polytechnics. Among the many\n            lessons learned, the project re-enforced the importance of\n            full ownership, and commitments of the States, in tandem\n            with Government policy support, since the effective central\n            coordination promoted competition, facilitated a responsive\n            management, and further enhanced industrial participation in\n            manpower development. But regardless of a proven effective\n            decentralization, special attention by the Bank, should be\n            given to local implementing agencies, particularly in\n            providing technical assistance at the early stages of the\n            project. It is important to record, and maintain a system\n            for a timely flow of funds, and disbursements, to\n            systematically release funds, such as a line allocation to\n            the project account, which could have reduced the delays\n            faced in civil works, and procurement. The intense\n            field-based supervision allowed a close interaction with the\n            Borrower, and beneficiaries, which proved to be not only\n            effective, but economical as well."}, "docdt": "2000-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
