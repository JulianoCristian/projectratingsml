Some lessons\n            learned included: this report on the assessment of the\n            borrower's performance underlines the importance of\n            strong leadership, ownership, vision and risk taking of\n            policymakers and managers, both within and outside of\n            Ministry of Health (MOH), in conceiving and implementing\n            sector reform. This section also points to the cruciality of\n            assigning a top-notch team, with the skills and experience\n            necessary, to undertake quality work in needs assessment,\n            problem analysis and project design and development. The\n            Bank's and the Borrower's performance also\n            illustrate the value of consulting and involving the\n            managers and service providers in the periphery, as well as\n            the population, the ultimate beneficiaries, in needs\n            assessment and project design. Such a process builds\n            ownership and capacity at the local level, both of which are\n            essential to successful reform implementation. This report\n            provides detail and insight on the positive lessons learned\n            with regard to project content, summarized here. In essence,\n            the project defined in a holistic fashion all systemic\n            constraints to sector performance and addressed them through\n            dialogue and interventions both at the macroeconomic,\n            cross-sectoral level, as well as within the sector. The\n            links and complementarities of the various components and\n            actors were well exploited and interwoven to the extent that\n            the whole project equaled more than the sum of its\n            individual components. Such a project design should be a\n            guide for future operations in the sector in this and other regions."}, "docdt": "1998-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
