      population. Specifically, the project will support the\n            Government in: (i) strengthening the institutional\n            capabilities of the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) for the\n            planning and managing of human and financial resources; (ii)\n            improving sector financial resource mobilization; (iii)\n            improving the quality of primary health care delivery\n            through rehabilitation of vital infrastructure, the\n            institutionalization of family health care, and AIDS\n            prevention; (iv) developing small pilot programs of hygiene\n            and sanitation in urban and peri-urban areas, with emphasis\n            on community based initiated; and (v) improving manpower and\n            human resources development. The project will also provide\n            financing for office furniture, vehicles, and consultant services."}, "docdt": "1989-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
