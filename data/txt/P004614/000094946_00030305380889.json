project sustainability is highly likely.\n            Overall, both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            satisfactory. The generally successful project outcome\n            underlines a number of positive experiences on which to draw\n            and lessons learned in implementing credit projects in\n            countries with a diverse banking system. First, use a sound\n            wholesale institution with a strong accreditation unit to\n            appraise participating financial institutions, rather than\n            having the Bank review them. Second, this type project is a\n            suitable mechanism for disbursing relatively large loans\n            quickly to the private sector, without placing much burden\n            on the government. By on-lending at domestic market rates\n            and having the government benefit from the interest rate\n            arbitrage, but bearing the foreign exchange risk, the\n            long-term likelihood is that the government will not lose\n            and that domestic markets will be strengthened. Furthermore,\n            any benefits derived from the fact that a country can borrow\n            Bank funds more cheaply than it could borrow commercial\n            funds would accrue to the government."}, "docdt": "2000-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
