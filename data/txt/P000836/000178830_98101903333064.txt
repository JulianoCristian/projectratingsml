SUPINARY
i.        This report covers the anpraisal of the 1969-1972 expansion
program of the Volta River Authority (VRA), consisting mainly of the
completion of the Volta River Project (in part financed by Loan 310-
GH). The estimated cost of the program, including two generating units,
substation expansion, an 85 mile, 165 kv transmission line to Togo and
Dahomey a third 165 kv double circuit transmission line Akosombo -
Volta (Tema), minor works, and consulting services, is N022.4 million
(us$21.9 million) of which about N¢16.1 million (US$15.8 million) would
be in foreign exchange. This program is technically sound and the es-
timated cost is reasonable.
ii.       A Bank loan of US$6.0 million equivalent has been requested,
to cover the balance of the foreign exchange requirements for which no
other external financing is available. Canada, US AID and Italy pro-
pose to make available about US$10.3 million equivalent. An undisbursed
amount of about US$O.1 million from Loan 310-GH is available towards
the purchase of the fifth unit and the financing plan would be completed
by VRA's own resources with USW).5 million equivalent.
iii.      The nrolect w ith w%hich the Bank would associate itself (power
plant and substation expansion) is an integral part of the program and
its justification lies in V-RA's contractual obligation to serve
increasing demand from the smelter operated by the Volta Aluminum Company.
The smelter presently accounts for about 75% of VRA's total energy sales.
The incremental rate of return on the project is 265-.
iv.       The proposed project would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$6.0 million equivalent with a term of 25 years including a grace
period of 10 years.

VOLTA RI'v- AUTHORITY
APPRAISAL OF VOLTA EXPANSION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Volta River Authority (VIRA), an autonomous statutory corpo-
ration established to develop the Volta River area, has requested a Bank
loan of US$6.0 million equivalent to help finance the final two units at
the Volta River Hydroelectric Project at Akosombo, and associated sub-
station facilities. The installation of the generating units, which
would bring the power plant to its ultimate planned capacity of six 147 IV,
units or 882 MJ5¶, is necessary to meet VRA's obligations to the Volta
Aluminum Company (VALCO) which proposes to expand its smelting facilities
at the seaport of Tema.  VRA's expansion program also includes the construc-
tion of a transmission line to the Togo border as part of an international
scheme to export power from Ghana to Togo and Dahomey and a third double
circuit transmission line from Akosombo - Volta (Tema). The estimated cost
of all new facilities to be constructed by VRA during 1969-72 is US$21.9
million equivalent of which the Bank project would amount to US$4.4
million equivalent.
1.02      This would be the second Bank loan to VRA.  In February 1962 Loan
310-GH was made for US$47.0 million equivalent, to assist in financing the
Volta River Hydroelectric Project (with four units installed totalling
588 NW) and transmission facilities to permit bulk sales to VALCO, several
large mining enterprises, and the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
which provides general public power supply. (See TO-281a, August 1961).
The United Kingdom Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD), and the
United States Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) and Agency for International
Development (AID) also provided loans aggregating USt31 million equivalent.
This project wqas completed in early 1966, about one year ahead of schedule,
and at a cost of US$162.5 million as compared to the estimate of US$189.7
million equivalent. Initial sales of powier to ECG and several mines started
in late 1965 and to the smelter in April 1967.
1.03      The principal consumer of Volta River power is VAICO, which pre-
sently accounts for 75,<0 of VRA's sales, and 52% of revenues. VALCO has
recently started arrangements to construct an additional pot-line which is
expected to be in service by early 1972. Under the power sales agreement
VRA is required to furnish up to about 315 1W and 2,600 Grfh annually to
VALCO as from April 1972. Upon completion of its expansion, VALCO will
require about 57% of the total ultimate production capability of the Volta
River Project. Thus, the viability of the hydroelectric development has
been based upon the creation of a large powser-intensive industry.
1.04      The hydroelectric potential of the Volta River had been re-
cognized since 1915 but only in the 1950's was it studied in connection
with the possibility of manufacturing aluminum utilizing Ghana's bauxite



deposits. A report published in 1956 recommended construction of a power
project and aluminum producing facilities near the present Akosombo site.
In 1958 the Government commissioned Kaiser Engineers & Constructors, Inc. (U.S.A.)
to review the earlier proposal.  This led to the Volta River Project and
to the sponsorship by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation of the VALCO
aluminum plant at Tema. At present, VALCO's production capability is
115,000 m. ton/year, and will reach 150,000 m ton/year by early 1972.
1.05      The first four generating units installed at the Project were
supplied by a Canadian manufacturer, and Canada has offered favorable
financing (50 years, interest free) for purchasing the additional tw?o
generators, transformers, and auxiliary equipment from Canadian sources.
Canada has also offered to finance the engineering and construction of a
165 kv double circuit transmission line to Togo-Dahomey. (See paragraph
4.05, i).). llloreover, US AID has agreed to allow VRA to use funds from
the original loan for the Volta River Project to pay for consulting services
associated with the installation of the two additional generating units.
Tne small undisbursed balance in Loan 310-GH would be used in purchasing the
fifth turbine. Proceeds of an Italian Loan made available to the Government
of Ghana will be utilized to construct the Third 165 kv double circuit
transmission line from Akosombo to Volta (Tema).
1.06      Following completion of the Volta River Project to its ultimate
installed capacity of 882 MW (6 units at 147 MS), VRA will have to exploit
other sources. Present estimates of VRA's market growth indicate new
generating facilities will be needed by the late 1970's. One possibility
is the import of power from Nigeria. There is ample time to plan the next
phase of system expansion.
1.07      This report was prepared by E. A. Mimnig and Giovanni Vacchelli
from information obtained from VRA, the Canadian Government, during a field
appraisal in Ghana during July-August 1968, and during negotiations in
March 1969.

II. THE BORROWER
Organization
2.01      VRA was established by the Volta River Development Act of 1961,
which was reviewed by the Bank prior to its enactment. The Authority can
take any action required for the success of the Volta River Project and is
required to conduct its affairs in accordance with sound public utility
practice. Under the Act VRA is empowered to go well beyond the boundaries
of the pou7er sector, making it an integrated regional development agency.
The creation of the VIolta lake opens up the possibility of the development
of water transportation and fisheries.  VRA is also responsible for general
medical research and promotion of the well-being of the population in the
area. In the fields of agricultural development and forestry VRA acts as
an executing agency, administering government funds. The seven-man Board
of Directors is appointed for terms of three years by the President of the
Republic, who is Chairman ex-officio. At the present the chairmanship has
been assumed by a member of the National Liberation Council (NLC). The
other members include the Chief Executive of VRA, the Managing Directors
of EGG and VALCO, and four members representing the general public.
Management
2.02      The Chief EXecutive, a Ghanaian, previously Chief Engineer of the
Electricity Division, the predecessor of ECG, was appointed to his present
position in 1966 and is responsible for the general direction and day-to-day
operation of VRA.  Loan 310-GH requires the Government to obtain the
approval of the Bank prior to the appointment of subsequent Chief Executives.
This condition has been maintained in the ,proposed loan.
2.03      The Chilef Executive is able, but lacks adequate administrative
supporting staff. A number of senior positions are vacant and others will
soon become vacant when contracts with foreign staff expire. VRA (and ECG
as well) have in the past found it difficult to fill senior staff vacancies
and it will be necessary to engage in an extensive recruitment campaign.
The principal vacancies are:  the Director of Engineering (presently a
Canadian whose contract is nearing expiration); the Deputy Director of
Engineering (a Ghanaian expected to retire due to ill health); the
Treasury, Financial Accounting, Plant Account and Budget Officers; and
the Chief Internal Auditor. At present the functions of these latter officers
are performed by non-qualified staff, who need constant supervision by the
Director of Finance and the Chief Accountant. Three qualified accountants
have recently returned after training in the UK.  They will fill three of
the above vacancies. To fill engineering vacancies approaches have been
made to the Australian Government to second to VRA engineers from the
Snowy Mountains Authority.  VRA also proposes to advertise outside of Ghana
and the UN have agreed to recruit for VRA an experienced engineer to assist
with operations. VRA also intends to continue the relationship with Ontario
Hydro of Canada which in the past has seconded experienced operation
engineers and a reoluest for replacement of those whose contracts are due
to expire has been made.



-4-
2.04      The Chief Accountant himself is qualified, but the shortage of
qualified assistants has forced him to undertake detailed work which nor-
mally should be delegated. This problem should. now be overcome on the
return of the three young accountants that have received training in the
UK. The accounting department however needs to be reorganized generally
to reduce unqualified staff and to secure a better qualified middle echelon.
Procedures need to be improved. Special weaknesses are evident in the
month-Iy bank reconciliations, control of mniscellaneous debit balances,
control over accounts payable and accruals and control of stores. The
contracts ledgers have not been kept with the same care as during construc-
tion of the project. VRA has agreed to carry out a review, with the
assistance of consultants if necessary, of its operations; organization
structure; staffing policies; and accounting system and practices.
2.o5      On the other hand, VRA.'s power facilities are satisfactorily
operated by staff uell trained by a team from Ontario Hydro of Canada
which initially operated the facilities and gave on-site training. Complete
operational responsibility was transferred to the C-hanaians in 1967. Two
Canadian advisers remaining at Akosombo are scheduled to leave in mid-1969.
2.o6     lThile sufficient oualified personnel is lacking, as of June 1968,
VRA's total staff numbered 2,969: 830 in power including 167 in operation
and maintenance; and 2,139 in non-power activities. Staff employed in
various categories are given in Annex 14. There is danger that VRA's upper
management may be overextending itself, while at the same time overstaffing
exists.  Durinn negotiations agreement was reached that VRA, in the carrying
out or expansion of its non-power activities, would ensure that both orga-
nization and staff are adequate to enable non-power activities to be carried
out without detriment to the efficient conduct of its power operations.



III.  THE POW1.  SECTOR
Relation to the Economy of Ghana
3.01      Ghana is on the West Coast of Africa alnost in the center of the
countries along the Gulf of Guinea. The area is about 92,000 square miles
and the population wyas estimated at 7.8 million in 1967.  Its growth rate
is about 2.6 - 3.0M. Gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to be
US$1,758 million in 1967 at current prices, or about US$225 per capita.
The most important sector is agriculture producing about 50%l of GDP and
employing some 70% of the country's work force. Modern manufacturing
accounts for about 7% of GDP and mining for less than 3%. During 1960-65,
GDP rose at an annual average rate of 3.8%. GDP per capita also rose over
the same period but by only 1.1%, fell during 1964-1966, and showed a
modest increase of about 1% in 1967 over 1966.
3.02      Almost all consumption of publicly supplied electricity occurs in
the southern part of the country where about two-thirds of the total popula-
tion lives, and where are to be found the bulk of commercial agriculture,
all manufacturing, all mining, and VALCO.
Organizations Responsible for the Power Sector
3.03      Two organizations, VRA and ECG are charged with public generation,
transmission and distribution of power. The principal private producers of
power, the mines, have placed their generating equipment on standby and use
power produced by VRA. Under the Volta River Development Act, VRA is respon-
sible for bulk supplies to the aluminum smelter, EGG, the mines and Akosombo
Township. VRA may also supply individual consumers at voltages above 34.5 kv
whose continuous demand is above 20 NVA. ECG is responsible for distribution
of VRA pot-er in Southern Ghana and the generation and distribution of diesel
powHer in areas that cannot as yet be economically connected to the VRA trans-
mission system.  ECG may supply individual consumers at voltages not ex-
ceeding 34.5 kv whose continuous demand is less than 20 I4VA.
3.0o4     When the Volta River Project Twas considered by the Bank in 1961,
it was clear that its long-term financial success would depend on the future
development of the non-smelter demand served by ECG.  As shown in Annex 8,
in the years 1965-76 3CG is expected to provide 40% of VRA's revenues, other
non-smelter consumers 18%, and the smielter 2%. Thus one of the conditions
of Loan 310-GH was the reorganization of ECGts predecessor, then a government
department, as an autonomous public utility, to be operated on a sound
commercial basis.  This was done in 1967 with a Government Decree establishing
ECG. Necessary expansion and reinforcement of distribution facilities were
*            prevented for a time by a weak financial position.  Since 1966 work on the
rehabilitation and expansion of distribution facilities has been underway,
financed in part by a West German loan and British supplier credits. An
IDA Credit (118-GH) of US$10.0 million equivalent of June 14, 1968 will
further assist in the improvement of these facilities. (See TO-629a, May
1968). This Credit became effective on September 20, 1968 and about US$2.4
million equivalent have been disbursed up to the end of  arch 1969.



-6-
-xisting Facilities
*  RA
3.05      The Volta River Project presently has four 147 MI 1/ units
installed.  Provision was made for two additional units, which would complete
the power station and raise installed capacity to 882 MW.  The average annual
energy available is 5,400 GWh.  VRA owns and operates a 500 mile 165 kv
transmission ring serving the VALCO smelter; ECG systems in the main towns
of Accra, Tema, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Kumasi; a number of smaller towns and
villages; and gold and diamond mines at Tarlka, Dunkwa, Obuasi and Aktiatia.
ECG
*S           3.06      ECG owns and operated 90 'Hq of diesel generating capacity installed
in 29 power stations, but when TVRA commenced supplying power eleven of these
stations with a capacity of 64 IiW were shut down, and the 17 MM4 Accra plant
was placed on standby. About 9 1,11 are in service outside the area served
by VRA's transmission system, of which about 3 11J will become redundant in
1966-1970 as further areas are connected to the VRA system. Six new diesel
stations totalling 3 24IW wJill be constructed in areas not served by VRA and
seven existing up-country stations will be expanded by 6 1HE. By the end of
1970, therefore, 32 1,11 of diesel generating capacity will be in service of
which 15 NV1 supply areas outside the VRA system and 17 NW, the Accra plant,
would be on standby.
Mines
3.07      The captive generating capacity installed at the mines, amounting
to about 36 24-W, has now been placed on standby since all supplies are taken
from the VRA transmission system.
Future Power Development in Ghana
3.08      The completed power plant at Akosombo is expected to meet market
requiremrents until 1977. At that time VALCO may exercise a final option,
install a fifth pot-line and increase its demand from 295 214 to 370 i'l].
To meet this increase and also the increase from the normal growth of ECG
and other consumers, VRA will have to provide additional capacity. Various
potential hydro developments on the Volta, Pra and Tano Rivers have been
investigated in various degrees of detail in the past and are listed in
Annex 9 with their capacities, energy generation and estimated costs. It
would be possible to install thermal capacity, but indigenous fuel does not
exist. There is also the possibility that there might be an interconnection
with KIigeria where surplus power might be exported to Ghana in about 1977.
It is thus important that a thorough examination be made of these various
1/  The name plate rating of the units is 147 1W, but only 128 64 can be
achieved under all operating conditions. VRA for planning purposes
therefore prudently assumes a firm output per unit of 128 14!.



-7-
possibilities. The foreign exchange costs of suc'h studies would be financed
under the proposed Bank loan.
Export of Power
3.09      Since 1966 discussions have taken place between VRA, Togo and
Dahomey concerning purchase of VRA power by Togo and Dahomey. A draft
power agreement between the three countries has been concluded and negotia-
tions on tariffs took place in February 1969. The Canadian Government has
offered to finance on favorable terms the 185 mile 165 kv transmission line
from Akosombo to Lome (Togo) and Cotonou (Dahiomey). About 85 miles of the
line would be within Ghana and about 100 miles within Togo and Dahomey.
A routing study prepared by Canadian consultants (Demers, Lemieux et Roy
of MIontreal and T. Ingledow and Associates of Vancouver) and financed by
Canada was approved by the three Governments in July 1968. A definitive
engineering report with cost estimate was issued in February 1969. It is
estimated that the line could be in service by mid-1971.

IV. THE PROGRA?H, PROJECT AND LOAN
The Program
4.01      VRA1s expansion program covering the period 1969-1972 includes:
i) completion of the Akosombo (Volta River) power station by
the addition of the fifth and sixth 147 lIT generating units;
ii) expansion of 165 kv substations at Akosombo, Volta (Tema),
and the VALCO smelter to meet increased smelter demand;
iii) expansion of 165 kv substation facilities at Tema, Sekondi-
Takoradi, and Xumasi to serve EICG;

Sources of Finance
4.05      The program would be financed by Canada, US AID, Italy, IBRD
Loan 310-GH, VRA and the proposed Bank Loan.
i) Canada: Canadian financing totalling US$7.92 million, of which
US$7.6 million will be as a loan and US$0.32 million as a grant,
will be used for the following items:
- generators, step-up transformers, auxiliary electrical
equipment and substation equipment for the Akosombo power
plant and Akosombo substation, all to be obtained from the
supplier who was the successful low bidder for the original
project at a price negotiated to allow for escalation in
costs since the original bidding;
- foreign exchange costs of the installation of Canadian
supplied equipment but not the transport cost of such
equipment; and
- foreign exchange and local cost component of the trans-
mission line to Togo including engineering services.
73ngineering services estimated at US$0.32 million will
be financed by a grant.
Canada imposed three conditions on their loan. These are:
a) formation of a joint Togo and Dahomey Electricity
Authority;
b)  agreement by Ghana, Togo and Dahomey on a trans-
mission line routing study; and
c)  negotiation of a mutually acceptable tariff for
S 4                            the export of VRA power to Togo and Dahomey.
The first two con6citions were met in July 1968. An agreement on
the tariff was reached in February 1969, thus fulfilling the
conditions and allowing the Canadians to proceed with their loan.
ii)  US ATD:  AID is rrepared to finance out of the undisbursed
porncicn of their original Volta River Loan an amount of
US$0.65 mi, -ion to cover the foreign exchange costs of the
engineering consulting services associated with the pro-
posed power plant and substation expansion. VR4. has en-
gaged for this purpose the services of Kaiser Engineers &
Constructors, Inc., (U.S.), the Government's consultants
for the original project.  The contract between VRA and
Naiber.-insofae   as the scope of w-ork is concerned, is
satisfactory.
iii)  Italy:  The Italian Government has made available to the
Government of Ghana a loan of US$10.0 million. VRA would
utilize US$1.71 million of this for:



- 11 -
- foreign exchange costs of the third double circuit
transmission line Akosombo - Volta (Tema); and
- foreign exchange costs of the Volta (Tema) substation
expansion needed for the two additional circuits.
iv) I3RD, 310-GTH: As provided in Loan 310-GH, the US$0.1 million,
representing the undisbursed portion of the original loan,
would be utilized towards the cost of the fifth turbine.
v) VRA: VRA would finance,with the exception of the transmission
line to Togo and Dahomey, all the estimated US$5.54 million
local currency cost component  of the program.  VRA would
also finance the cost of the services of Preece, Cardew and
Rider of the UK, VRA's consultants for a power cost allocation
study, and a -review of present tariffs. This work w^as started
in September 1968 and completed in March 1969 and will allow
VRA to assess the consequences of the July 1967 devaluation.
Data to enable a satisfactory tariff to be negotiated with
Togo and Dahomey was also provided for. Since the costs
involved are small (Ii03-5,000) they are not included in the
above estimate and VRA considers this as an operational
expense.
vi) Proposed Bank Loan: The remaining items with a foreign
exchange cost of US$6.0 million equivalent would be financed
by the proposed loan, more fully described in the following
paragraphs.
The Loan
h.o6      The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance the foreign cost
component of the following specific facilities and works:
i) The fifth and sixth 147 rmY turbine units at Akosombo.
Penstocks of units five and six are already in place
and the major civil works completed.  The works to be
financed by the proposed loan and associated with the
power plant extension are limited to the supply and
installation of the two turbines including auxiliary
mechanical equipment such as governors, valves,
piping, etc.
ii)  To meet the increased smelter demand, supply and
installation of substation equipment at Volta (Tema)
and the smelter, including structures, appropriate
switching and control equipment, a 165/13.8 kv, 85 IVIVA
transformer at the smelter and two miles of 165 kv
transmission line from the Volta substation to the smelter.



- 12 -
iii)  To meet increased ECG demand, supply and installation of
substation equipment at Tema, Seklondi-Takoradi, and
Kumasi, including structures, appropriate swiitching and
control equipment, and four 165/34.5 kv, 25/33 M'VA trans-
formers.
iv)  Civil works associated w'ith the installation of the fifth
and sixth units and substation expansion described above.
v) Purchase of construction and service vehicles needed for
maintenance of the 165 kv transmission facilities.
vi) Consulting and training services to review future expansion
-plans, to reorganize the accountancy department, and to
improve o-perations.

5.02      Annex I graphically shows VRA's "Total System Demand" as currently
estimated and as estimated in 1961. WJith the exception of initial operation
__          both demand forecasts are practically identical.  The reason for the differ-
IS           ence is that the smelter came into service with a higher demand than
originally expected.
5.03      Energy sales have been consistently higher than originally esti-
mated.  A comparison of actual sales in 1967 with estimates made in 1961
shows that:
i) sales to the smelter were nearly 50A% higher owing to a higher
demand and a better-than-assumed load factor;
1/  Demand at generating plant, including transmission losses.
2/ Commercial operation with supply to ECG and mines started in September
and October 1965, earlier than scheduled.
3/ Smelter commenced commercial operation in April 1967, also ahead of
schedule.



- 16 -
ii) sales to the mines were nearly double, reflecting the fact
that the mines, originally reluctant to depend for power
supply on VRA because of fears about the quality of service
offered, placed confidence in VRA earlier than anticipated;
and
iii)  sales to ECG were lower by 7% for two reasons:
a)  between 1963 and 1965 the rate of growth of the
economy in general was slower than had been anti-
cipated; and
b)  a shortage of funds slowed the development of ECG's
distribution networks and thus its ability to use
VRA power.
5.04      The current estimate for 1969-1976 energy sales is higher than
that in 1961 because new industrial loads and the export of power to Togo
and Dahomey are noiw expected.  These new loads, especially the power to be
exported, have hign load factors.
5.05      VPA's overall sales are estimated to increase at an annual average
rate of 12.1%o during 1967-1976. ,Iaximum demand, without transmission losses,
would increase at an annual average rate of only 7.5% during the same period
as growth of higher load factor sales predominates. Annual system load
factor would improve from 51.4% in 1967 to 82.3% in 1976 as sales to VALCO
increase, and base-load power is exported.  The increased smelter and mine
loads are assured; the neTw industrial loads and the export of power to Togo
and Dahomey have been estimated on a conservative basis. On the other hand,
EGG's load growth is subject to greater uncertainty. The effect on VRA's
sales and revenues of a possible variation in ECG's load may be expressed
in probability terms. It is estimated to be 95% probable that VRA's 1976
total sales figure will be at least 98.8% of the forecast, and-revenues at
least 97.9%.
Justification of the 1969-1972 Program
5.06      VRAk's contractual obligations to VAICO require it to install
additional generating capacity by April 1972 at the latest.  VAICO has
started negotiations with the US 2,Xport-Import Bank to finance the smelter
extension. VALCO estimates it will require no more than 18 months to
install the fourth 70 111iJ pot-line. VRA on the other hand requires 30-36
months, as from the date of signing an engineering consulting contract or
recruitment of experts, to increase available capacity.
5.07      Although only one additional generating unit at the Volta River
power plant would be required to meet the increased smelter demand it is
proposed to install unit six at the same time as unit five, with only six
months difference in the in-service dates. Given the present load forecast
unit six would not be needed until 1974. The decision to install it now is
based on an estimate of the likely savings in installation costs and in



- 17 -
purchase price. A present worth calculation shows a difference in favor of
the proposed accelerated schedule of about N0600,000, assuming a cost of
money of 8f.
5.o8      Using current power prices the rate of return on the incremental
investment for units five and six and associated substation expansion is
26%. This high rate, while correct, is attributable to the fact that the
investment for certain common facilities needed for units five and six is
already sunlk. This calculation is shown in Annex 15. If account had been
taken of the investments already made and of the time such investments were
made in penstocks, draft tubes and the major part of civil works, and that
reserve plant capacity mnust also be allocated to the new units, the rate of
return attributable to units five and six would be 6.8%. Similarly, the
rate of return on the investment needed for transmission facilities to
0            export power to Togo and Dahomey is 25%.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance and Present Position
6.01      As noted in Chapter II, VRA as a regional development authority
is becoming increasingly involved in a number of activities unrelated to
power operations, the most important of which are likely to be development
of lake transportation, and agriculture. Most non-power activities are at
present relatively small in comparison with power (although lake transpor-
tation might claim sizeable amounts of finance in the near future). No
attempt therefore has been made here to present a consolidated financial
statement. The income and fund statements, and the balance sheets shown
in Annexes 11-13 cover only power operations. VRA also administers Akosombo
township and hospital. The expenses involved are the costs of welfare for
VRA staff, the administration and maintenance of VRA properties, and the
cost of operating public services on behalf of the Government.  The Govern-
ment has agreed to contribute N0300,000 per year starting from fiscal 1967-
1968 for the Akosombo Administration, and to meet, as a public service, most
of the hospital and health administration expenses. Further resettlement
administration expenses are to be met entirely by the Government.
Past Earnings
6.02      In consideration of the special nature of VRA's market, and the
fact that the Authority was initiating operations with a very substantial
size project, Loan 310-GH contains a performance target, to be met only by
1974, of an 8% return, calculated after payment of interest, on the Govern-
mentls equity. A minimum interim requirement that revenues cover all ope-
rating expenses, including depreciation, interest and any debt amortization
in excess of depreciation, has not been met in 1967 for the reasons discussed
in paragraph 6.03. It has however been met in 1968, and compliance is
expected in the future.
6.03      Because the project was geared to meet VALCOts requirements, which
did not begin until April 1967, earnings for 1965-1967 are hardly meaningful.
Sales during 1965-1966 were relatively small as the period was one of transi-
tion from completion of construction to full-scale commercial operation. It
was not until 1967 that VRA started to depreciate its power project assets
and discontinued capitalizing interest: both these charges are also sub-
stantially higher than expected due to the 1967 devaluation of the Cedi,
only partially offset by higher revenues from VALCO, paid in United States
dollars. The result has been a N03.1 million operating loss in 1967. More-
over, misinterpretation of calculated and applied tariffs for non-smelter
conswmers (discussed in detail in Annex 10, paragraph 4) also had an adverse
effect on revenues. It is expected, however, that VRA's earnings will improve
with the growth of the market and that the rate of return would exceed 8% in
1974, 1975 and 1976. For 1977 this rate drops to 6.5%. This results from
depreciation being charged on Kpong facilities for the first time and dis-
continued capitalization of interest on the loan assumed to help finance
them. As mentioned in paragraph 6.11, however, the forecast is based on the
most capital intensive alternative, the Kpong hydro-electric scheme, the
final selection being dependent on the results of the study described in



- 19 -
paragraph 3.08. It would therefore not be necessary at this stage to
consider alternative measures to improve the rate of return until the
consultants have reviewed future expansion plans.
6.04      The details of cash operating expenses -- about N01.9 million
in 1968 -- are shown in the following table:
Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 1968 1/
(in thousands of N0)
Salaries and Wages                        853
Materials                                 135

Akosombo Administration (net)             200
Akosombo Hospital (net)                   126
Personnel expenses are high because of the overstaffing mentioned in para-
graph 2.06, which may be more a result of the general economic policy of
the Government than of any inherent organizational defect. In viem of the
simple nature of VRAts power operations it would appear that material
savings could be achieved, particularly through reduction of personnel,
reasonable allocation of common costs to power and non-power activities
and more efficient controls. As mentioned in paragraph 2.04, a compre-
hensive review of these problems has been agreed upon. The forecast takes
into consideration appropriate increases due to the expansion of operations.
Balance Sheet
6.o5      VRA's ba'ance sheet as of December 31, 1968 is condensed below;
figures are preliminary and subject to audit. It reflects the arrangements
made for financing the Volta Project. Equity includes Government funds
made available to VRA both in local currency and foreign exchange. The
1961 Development Act however assigned the responsibility for expenses of
resettlement arising from flooding the reservoir area to the Minister in
charge of Social Welfare, and limited VRA's contribution to EG3.5 million
or N07.0 million.  According to VRA's records an additional N014.1 million
had been spent for resettlement directly by the Government by the end of
1967, but is not considered as invested in the project. Following the 1967
devaluation of the Cedi, VRA has revalued all foreign exchange assets,
whether acquired with foreign loans or Government equity; also, following
the 1967 pound sterling devaluation, VRA has included in the equity the
resulting exchange difference.

Plant Account and Depreciation Policy
6.o6      Included in the N0145.8 million gross fixed assets in the table
in paragraph 6.05 are certain elements of cost, totalling about Ug60 million,
such as interest during construction, resettlement expenditure charged to
the project, construction camp facilities, and an amount equal to re-
valuation of assets financed by foreign debt. As of December 31, 1967
these costs had not been allocated to specific plant accounts such as the
dam, generating equipment or transmission lines, and were being written off
over various periods as long as 100 years. The average depreciation rate
on VRA's total fixed assets in operation was about 2.7% in 1967. VRA plans
to prepare a newq plant account, which would properly allocate the above
mentioned costs and to adopt a new depreciation schedule, with the
assistance of consultants if necessary (see paragraph 2.0h). For the
purposes of this report, a provisional allocation of costs has been made
and an average depreciation rate of 2.5% has been used from 1969 on.
Accounting and Audit
6.07      VRA's accounts and accounting organization will be satisfactory
when the weaknesses described in paragraphs 2.0h and 6.06 have been
eliminated. Separate accounts are already kept for non-power activities,
but the allocation of costs common to power operations, non-power operations
and activities undertaken on behalf of the Government is not satisfactory
and needs to be improved. An undertaking to this effect was obtained
during negotiations. The audit arrangements, with Cooper Brothers & Co.
(the Ghana branch of a United Kingdom firm), are satisfactory.
1/ This loan is amortized by means of EStg 130,000 promissory notes
(equivalent to about N0318,000) with semi-annual maturities until
October 31, 1972; the interest rate on the notes, variable depending
on conditions prevailing at the date of issue, is in the order of 6%.

6.09      V1A %ould finance internally all of the local currency and that
portion of fo-3i,n exchange expenses for which external financing could not
be secured, 3 uch as transport costs of Canadian supplied equipment and
miinor Tzorks. Tne following loans have been assumed:
i) tUe proposed US$6.0 million equivalent Bank loan, repayable
c rer 15 years,  -efter'l10.ears of grace&  at -.n assumed
interest rate of 6-1/2%;
ii) the proposed US$7.6 million equivalent Canadian loan to the
Government on concessionary terms (no interest, 50 years),
relent to VRA at 2-1/2%, for 25 years plus 5 years of grace;
iii)  US$1.7 million equivalent, part of an Italian credit to the
Government, to be made available to VRA at an interest rate
of 6<g, for 8 years plus 4 of grace;
iv) a final US$0.1 million equivalent disbursement under Loan
310-fkl; and
v) an additional US$0.7 million disbursement under the AID
loan.
This would complete the debt financing, for a total of US$16.1 million
(N016.4 million) excluding future expansion requirements. The Government
has decided to make available to VRA as equity a Canadian grant, of
US$0.3 million equivalent, covering the engineering of the Togo-Dahomey
transmission line.
6.10      Ghana's need to borrow most of the foreign exchange require-
ments is expected to result in VRA having a surplus of local currency
funds not required for power expansion.  Direct investment of these in
S w           non-power operations, although provided for by the Act, would not seem
from a general economic point of view to use them to best advantage.  It
would be preferable to return them to the Government's development budget,
so that their allocation could be made on the basis of overall national
priorities. The Act provides that, having regard to its financial position
and future requirements, ViUA may pay the Government a return out of net
income, or repay part or all of the Republic's investment. The first
formula seems preferable, and during negotiations VRA stated its intention
to follow it and, in any case, not to finance directly, from power
operations revenues, its other activities. The level of such dividend
payments would be variable, dependent on the financial requirements of
VRA's power operations year by year. Under the present forecast they would
total about N012 million between 1972 and 1977, and would average about
3% of the Government equity in the power operation. Should the Government
decide to promote development of non-power sectors in the Volta lake region,
new allocations would be made frorm the development budget, and the funds
made available to V'LA in the form of new equity on which an adequate return
to be determined sector by sector, should be earned. The advantages of this
mechanism are:



23 -
i)  to allocate funds to development on the basis of nationally-
assigned priorities, rather than by the narrower criteria of
the 1961 Development Act;
ii) to bring about an effective separation of accounts for the
various activities of VRA; and
iii)  to provide a ready measure of the relative efficiency of
investments in different public sectors, such as power,
agriculture, and transportation.
Future Expansion
6.11      As noted in paragraph 3.08, additional power sources will be
required by 1977.  A forecast based on the most capital intensive alter-
native under consideration, the Kpong hydro-scheme on the Volta River
downstream of Alosombo, shows that 14051.0 million would be required,. inclu-
dftg  N042.0 million (82.0%) in foreign exchange.  It is expected thiat
NU3h.3 million will be borrowed and a loan at 6-1/2% interest and 20
years plus 5 years ol grace has been assumed.
Projected Performance
Estimatecd 7arnings
6.12      Fo-recast revenues for the period 1969-1977 are satisfactory.
Tariffs have been assumed to remain at current levels; although VRA is
envisaging the possibilitv of future increases, they do not appear to
be necessary (see Annex 10). Provided operating expenses are kept under
control and the power operation is not burdened with expenses for non-
power activities, the 8% return on the power operation's equity envisaged by
1974 under the ternis of Loan 310-GH would be achieved. (see however also
paragraph 6.03).  For purposes of comparison, Annex 11 also shows the return
on net fixed assets in operation plus a working capital allowance. On this
basis, the average return over the period 1974-1977 would be about 7.3%,
which is acceptable considering the contractual natu-re of the preponderance
of VRA's sales as well as V&A's limited requirements to generate funds for
future expansion. The rate of return covenant as in Loan 310-GH was con-
firmed, but the rate base more clearly defined, to include in addition to
the Government's actual investment in the Project, as recorded in VRA's
books at historic values: i) amounts corresponding to appropriate re-
valuations of assets; and ii) net cumulative retained earnings.
Future Financial Position
6.13      Gross fixed assets in operation would increase about 55% to
M0226 million by 1977, reflecting the assumption of the addition of a
second major hyclro-plant. The equity/rate base would increase from
N063 million to N090 million in the period 1968-1977, while outstanding
debt as a percentage of total capitalization would decrease from 56% to 52%.
On average, internal cash generation would be 1.5 times annual debt service,



- 24 -
a satisfactory coverage on year by year basis.  Homever, the debt limitation
covenant of Loan 310-OH, which would be maintained, prescribes that, except
as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, internal cash generation
of the fiscal year or a later 12 month period prior to the incurrence of
a debt shall be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service require-
ment in any succeeding year on all outstanding debt plus the debt to be
incurred. Although the coverage on this basis would be of only 1.1 times,
the Bankc intends to agree to VRA entering the described financing arrange-
ments for the 1969-1972 program in view of the justification of the pro-
posed investments and the substantially higher level of future cash
generation forecast.
6.14      The ratio of current assets to current liabilities, which was
one in 1968, is expected to remain around unity throughout the period.
This level is acceptable. Most of the current liabilities consist of
current maturities on long term debt. Cash and security holdings as of
year end are expected to be maintained at prudent levels, adequate,
including additional cash generation from operations through the year,
to meet debt maturities and other cash requirements.
6.15      Starting from a substantial asset base built up in a relatively
short time, expansion of VRA's power activities to meet market requirements
will necessarily be slower in the future. Expansion of other sectors will
however have to be limited, until organization and staffing have been
strengthened. Subject to this condition, VRA should not have problems in
achieving and maintaining a satisfactory financial position.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      Since engineering of the proposed expansion project is based on
work already executed and in operation, no engineering problems should be
experienced. The estimated cost reflects past experience and is reasonable.
The new facilities are required to meet growing market requirements and
contractual commitments such as the increased smelter demand resulting from
the proposed smelter expansion.
7.02      The two-unit extension to the existing powerplant completes the
originally planned development on the Volta River and represents the least
cost means of supplying the growth in demand until 1977. The indicated
incremental rate of return on the proposed investment in the two units is
26%, reflecting the fact that certain investments common to all six units
have already been made.
7.03      The structure, organization and staff of VRA require review and
improvement. Current management, suitably assisted by consultants or a
team of experts, are competent to carry out the project.  VRA's recent
and projected financial position is acceptable.
7.04      During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained:
i)  VRA will take adequate steps to ensure that qualified
personnel is recruited to fill existing vacancies



- 25 -
(paragraphs 2.03 and 2.04).
ii) VRA will retain if necessary appropriate management
and accountancy consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank in carrying out a review of:
a)  its accounting system and practices (paragraph 2.C4).
b)  the Authority's organization structure aad
staffing (paragraph 2.04).
c)  cost allocation and appropriate depreciation
rates (paragraph 6.06).
iii)  VRA will retain appropriate engineering consultants on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to:
a)  prepare tender documents and specifications,
design and supervise power plant and sub-
station expansion; (paragraphs 1.05 and 4.05
ii); and
b) review future expansion plans (paragraph 3.08).
iv)  VRA will not, and the Government will not require it to,
expand non-power activities beyond their present scopes
unless proper measures are taken to insure efficient
operations (paragraphs 2.06, 6.07 and 6.15).
v) VRA shall not apply any net earnings from power operations
to the expansion of non-power activities (paragraph 6.10).
vi) The covenants on debt-limitation (paragraph 6.13), rate
of return after 1973 (paragraph 6.12), interim revenue
requirement up to and including 1973 (paragraph 6.02),
and approval of appointment of subsequent Chief Exe-
cutives (paragraph 2.02) will be maintained.
The project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.0 million,
for a term of 25 years including a 10 year period of grace. It has been
agreed that the proposed loan would not become effective until:
i) The Canadian Government's loan to VRA to finance the
two generators with electrical auxiliaries and trans-
formers is also effective (paragraphs 1.05 and 4.05,
i), and
ii)  VALCO shall have made satisfactory arrangements to
finance the expansion of its smelter (paragraph 5.06).

REPUBLIC OF GHANA
VOLTA RIVER AUTHORITY (VRA)
Elements Utilized in the Preparation of the
Load Forecast
Smelter (VALCO)
1.        The power contract between VALCO and VRA, concluded for a period
of 30 years, requires VRA to make available a constant amount of power to
the smelter increasing at stated intervals up to 390 MW inclusive of trans-
mission losses. On the "Permanent Delivery Date" (PDD), April 25, 1967,
VRA was required to make available at the point of delivery 158 MW and
thereafter as follows:
April 25, 1968            210 MW
April 25, 1969            315 MW 1/
April 25, 1970            370 MW 2/
1/  Increase subject to one year's notice
2/  Increase subject to two year's notice
2.        If by the tenth anniversary of the PDD, April 25, 1977, VALCO has
not exercised its option, VRA need not provide more than 315 MW, however,
without prejudice to any higher figure which may be in effect at that date.
3.        For energy consumed VALCO pays in foreign currency at the rate of
US mills 2.625/kwh, subject to a minimum consumption of:
Year beginning April 25, 1967   66 MW  or    578 GWh  1/
April 25, 1968  167 MW  or  1,463 GWh  1/
April 25, 1969  200 MW  or  1,752 GWh  1/
April 25, 1972  267 MW  or  2,339 GWh  1/
and            April 25, 1973  300 MW  or  2,628 GWh  1/
1/ Computed on the basis of 100% load factor
4.        Commencing commercial operation on April 25, 1967 with three
pot-lines each of 70 MW capacity, about 115,000 tons of aluminum are presently
produced annually (7 kwh/lb aluminum).  The load served VALCO amounts without
transmission losses to about 220 MW including auxiliary requirements. VALCO
now proposes to extend the smelter by adding a fourth pot-line of 70 MW to be
in service not later than April 25, 1972 increasing smelter output to 150,000
tons/annum and smelter power requirements to about 295 MW. The construction
time of the smelter extension is estimated at about 18 months so that con-
struction would have to commence by not later than mid-1970.
5.        VALCO's power and energy requirements are therefore estimated to
develop as follows:

Maximum Demand, MW       221.4      220.0     295.0      315.0 1/      315.0 T/
1/ If no fifth pot-line is added by 1973, the take or pay clause of the con-
tract becomes effective after April 25, 1973 (see paragraph 3 above).
6.        The apparent discrepancy between contractual power ceilings and
actual demand is because originally it was VALCO's intention to install
pot-lines of 50 MW capacity rather than the 70 MW actually installed. With
four pot-lines originally contemplated as an initial development, power
demand would have coincided with the April 25, 1968 requirements of 210 MW
including 10 MW auxiliary requirements. Similarly the accellerated smelter
expansion contemplated the addition of a fifth and sixth pot-line by April
25, 1969 raising power requirements to 315 MW inclusive of 15 MW auxiliary
requirements.
7.        With the change to 70 MW per pot-line, with contractual arrangements
remaining unchanged, the smelter is now expected to develop as follows:
April 25, 1968 1/ 3 x 70 MW pot-lines = 210 MW + 10 MW auxiliary
requirement
April 25, 1972  1/  4 x 70 MW pot-lines = 280 MW + 15 MW auxiliary
requirement
by not later
than April 25, 1977  1/  5 x 70 MW pot-lines = 350 MW + 20 MW auxiliary
requirenent
1/ Dates corresponding to full capacity operation rather than in service
dates of the pot-lines.
It is anticipated that VALCO at some future date, not later, however, than
April 25, 1977 will install a fifth pot-line provided that alumina for
conversion to aluminum will continue to be imported. Should VALCO however
exercise its option to develop bauxite deposits in Ghana, it may very well
be that rather than extend smelter capacity VALCO would utilize some of the
remaining power of 75 MW for the production of alumina to be used in the
smelter.
8.        Since by the end of 1976 VRA would have surplus firm capacity of
46 MW and some time in 1977 additional generating capacity would be taken
into service to meet domestic power requirements -- either by the construc-
tion of the 140 MW Kpong hydro scheme, a thermal plant or by interconnection
with Nigeria -- smelter development over the contractual 315 MW demand would
not influence VRA's next expansion plans or VRA's ability to serve the
increased smelter demand, would however accelerate expansion after 1977.
For this reason smelter development in excess of the addition of the fourth
pot-line has not been taken into account in the present forecast.
Electricity Corporation of Ghana
9.        From 1961 to 1966 ECG's total sales increased at an average annual
rate of 13.3% and are estimated to increase at 13.9% for the period 1967-1972.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 5 pages
Energy supplied by VRA is estimated to increase for the same period at an
average annual rate of 14.3% from 360.3 GWh to 667.6 GWh and demand at 13.2%
from 66.8 NM to 119.0 MW. It is estimated that this growth rate would
continue at least until 1976/77. The lower growth rate in demand as against
the energy growth rate results from an improvement in ECG's average annual
load factor as a consequence of tariff measures and increased industrial use
of power.
10.       Power consumption of ECG's consumers, divided into the six tariff
classifications presently in force shows summarized the following:
Average Annual

Total Generated or Purchased    389           692             13.0
11.       Based on past development, known new industrial loads and reasonable
future prospects, the EGG demand to be served by VRA has with a 95% probabi-
lity a tolerance of ±5%. With expected sales by VRA to EGG by 1976 estimated
at 1,028.0 GWh the range would therefore be, upper limit 1,080.0 GWh and
lower limit 980.0 GWh.
Mines
12.       Some mines are working successfully and may as a result of the July
1967 Ghana currency devaluation increase their output. Other mines however
are marginal operations. It is therefore unlikely that there will be any
significant increase in overall power demand above the present level of 28 MW.
The forecast nevertheless allows for a modest increase in power consumption
from 164.1 GWh in 1967 to 205.0 GWh by 1976 at an average annual increase
rate of 2.5% mainly from the connection of a new consumer at the Konongo
substation.

Other Consumers
13.       Akosombo TOwnship. Originally the Volta Project construction
camp, this township not only has developed into VRA's center of operations
and field activity, but has also attracted other residents and industries.
The load forecast therefore assumes that power consumption will not only be
influenced by a continued development but also by VRA's activities associated
with the current expansion program. For the period 1967-1976 the average
annual growth rate is estimated to be 8%.
14.       Akosombo Textile Factory.  With an installed capacity of 3,000 kw
and estimated peak demand allowing for diversity of 2,400 kw, the factory,
due to difficulties experienced with the supply of raw materials and labor,
has not operated at capacity.  Maximum demand in June 1968 did not exceed
450 kw. Oil burning process steam generators are presently installed which
the Union Trading Company (UTC), the owners, by mid-1970 intend to convert
to electricity adding a further demand of 4,800 kw. In the forecast it has
been estimated that power requirements would increase gradually to 2,400 kw
by mid-1970, that single shift operation would continue until mid-1969
(operator training period) and that after mid-1969 two shifts would be
employed.
15.       Chlorine Plant, Stond.  The in service date of this plant was
given as April 1970. To allow for a period of training and start-up it has
been estimated that demand would increase from 1,500 kw in April 1970 to
12,000 kw by September 1971. Two shift operation has been assumed.
Export of Power to Togo and Dahomey
16.       Since the proposed line to serve Togo and Dahomey would consist
of one single circuit, it is probable that for supply security existing
diesel generating facilities at Lome and Cotonou would be kept on a standby
basis. In such an event and depending on the tariff finally negotiated with
Ghana, consisting of a demand and an energy charge based on power costs at
Akosombo with possibly a fixed annual charge for transmission facilities to
the border, it could prove to be more economical for Togo and Dahomey to
import base load power at a high load factor only, whilst utilizing standby
equipment to generate peak power.
17.       For the purpose of the load forecast and expected revenues therefore,
it has been estimated that 60% of the combined Togo-Dahomey maximum demand
with an energy content of 82% would be imported and 40% with an energy content
of 18% would be locally produced.
18.       Energy sales during 1960-1966 increased in Togo (Coastal Region)
at an average annual rate of 19.5% from 4.2 to 12.3 GWh and in Dahomey
(Coastal Region) at 16.0% from 8.4 to 20.3 GWh. Load forecasts prepared by
Electricite de France for UNDP in connection with the Mono River Study and
the formation of a joint electricity company,and by the IBRD Economic
Mission of May 1967, estimate that power consumption would increase for the
period 1966-1970 at an average annual rate of 13.2% from 12.3 to 20.0 GWh
in Togo and at 10.3% from 20.3 to 30.0 GWh in Dahomey. For the period
1970-1975 the estimated average annual increase rates are 11.5% from 20.0
to 35.0 GWh in Togo and 11.7% from 30.0 to 52.0 GWh in Dahomey.



ANNEX 3
Pag-e Tof 5 pages
19.       The potential Togo and Dahomey power market for VRA energy and
power including transmission and distribution losses is estimated to increase
from 60.0 GWh in 1970 to 114.0 GWh in 1976 at an average annual growth rate
of 11.3%. Maximum demand in the same period would increase from 11.9 MW'to
22.5 MW.
20.       On the assumption made in paragraph 17 above it is estimated that
VRA would need to supply 27.4 GWh in 1970 (six months,line in service mid-1971)
to 92.0 GWh by 1976. Maximum demand would increase from 7.8 MW to 13.3 MW
corresponding to an average annual load factor of about 79% compared with a
Togo and Dahomey total system load factor of about 58%.

Tariffs
1.        VRA's tariffs were established in 1964 on the basis of a study
utilizing estimated construction, operation and maintenance costs and an
optimistic non-smelter load forecast.
2.        Since the tariff charged the smelter is fixed by contract for a
30-year period at US mills 2.625/1kwh, the profitability of VRA is dependent
on the development of the non-smelter load and the tariffs charged non-
smelter consumers.
3.        One basic tariff is utilized by VRA applicable to EGG and to the
mines and other consumers, consisting of an annual demand charge of N¢30/kw
and an energy charge of NO.O00183/kwh.
4.        Since VRA bills on a monthly basis the above tariff was subse-
quently revised to
- a demand charge of N92.50/kw/month and
- an energy charge of N¢0.00183/kwh.
Dividing the annual demand charge by 12 and billing on a monthly
rather than on an annual basis,produced annual revenues which from ECG
were lower by 8-10% and from the mines were lower by about 3-4%.
5.        In September 1967 VRA increased its tariff to EGG to
- a demand charge of N02.75/kw/month and
- an energy charge of NOO.00183/kwh.
Contracts with the mines signed for five years did not allow their tariff
to be adjusted. Nevertheless, the mines voluntarily agreed to a tariff
increase as from June 1, 1968 equal to the increase for ECG.
6.        VRA has engaged the services of Preece, Cardew and Rider of the
UK to review its tariffs and to make a power cost allocation study. This
review which took into account the effect of the 30% July 1967 Ghana
currency devaluation and the current load forecast was started in September
1968 and completed in March 1969.
7.        Revenues in this report are based on current tariffs and no
further increase has been assumed. Present indications are that any tariff
adjustments will be either small or not necessary. Nevertheless, VRA is
contemplating the following tariffs:
ECG - a demand charge of N43.00/kw/month and
- an energy charge of N0.002/kwh as from April 1970
Mines - a demand charge of N03.00/kw/month and
- an energy charge of NOO.0025/kwh as from September 1970
when the present contracts expire.



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 2 pages
8.        The tariff negotiated between VRA and Togo-Dahomey, consists of a
three part tariff of
- a charge of US$24,500/month to recover the cost of transmission
facilities from Akosombo-Aflao and their operation and mainte-
nance during the initial contract period of 15 years;
- a demand charge of US$2.0/kw/month; and
- an energy charge of US mills 2.0/kwh.

Rate of Return on New Investment in the Project
The method followed to determine the rate of return on the addi-
tional investments required to complete the development of the Akosombo plant,
consists of comparing the streams of costs and benefits attributable to the
project. In the calculation, the following elements have been taken into
account:
Costs
i.  Investments in generating facilities between 1969 and 1972,
including the fifth and sixth units and related civil works,
installation and auxiliary equipment (see Annex 5, item A);
ii.  Investments in transmission/substations from 1969 to 1976, by
which time the new generating facilities will be fully utilized
(see Annex 5, item B and Annex 6, item A.3);
iii.  Consulting  services and miscellaneous works related to these
investments between 1968 and 1976 (see Annex 5, item C and minor
works of N0410,000 as explained in footnote 1 at page 9);
iv. Operation and maintenance expenses, starting from 1972, and
continuing for the assumed 33-year economic life of the
described facilities;
Benefits
v. The revenues, at current tariffs, from the sale of energy
attributable to the new facilities over their assumed eco-
nomic lives; this has been calculated taking into consideration
the commissioning dates (January 1972 for the fifth unit and
July 1972 for the sixth unit), and the market forecast
(maximum demand, load factor and sales).
,,
The resulting streams of costs and benefits are shown on page 2.
The rate of return on the proposed investment is the discount rate at which
the present value of costs equals the present value of benefits. The rate
of return is in excess of 25% and has been estimated to be 26% by extrapo-
lation.
