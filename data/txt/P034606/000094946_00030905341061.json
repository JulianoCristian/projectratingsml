Among the\n            several lessons learned, it is suggested that an emerging\n            financial sector requires, not only the reform policy, and\n            legislature supporting same, but special attention on\n            strengthening public awareness about these reforms. The\n            Government's commitment to such reforms, which conveyed\n            a strong ownership, played a paramount role for the success\n            of the project, along with the interplay between technical\n            assistance, and adjustment lending, which provided the\n            continuity to sustain the momentum of the reform process.\n            But a gradual approach to reform, requires that all parties\n            remain abreast of each change, regardless of their impact,\n            to be able to move forward in the transition period. The\n            continued financial support for institutional capacity\n            building is a long-term commitment, which should be\n            strengthened within the supervisory agencies, and, allow for\n            a decrease of dependence on multilateral aid. The total\n            closure of old pension systems, when starting new pension\n            systems, conveys a strong commitment to the performance of\n            reform, thus its reform process is simplified, and the\n            compliance cost for enterprises is reduced, becoming\n            equitable among all sectors of the working population."}, "docdt": "1999-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
