                         Implementation Status Overview
                         It is expected that the signing of MoU between the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Vendor FreeBalance (FB) will take place in June 2012. Following this, the much delayed
                         SRS report of TMIS/HRMIS could be signed by the MoF and the implementation of TMIS and HRMIS could begin. In recent months project implementation has intensified with FB
                         working with the relevant technical teams and increased commitment of the MoF to finalize the TMIS/HRMIS implementation by current project deadline of December 28, 2012.

                         December, 2012. However, there is a delay in the implementation of the Budget Planning module. FB is currently working on the SRS Report on Budget Planning module, taking
                         into account the technical specifications provided by IBS (the Russian company which submitted its report in December 2011). It is expected that the MoF and FB will work
                         collaboratively and intensely towards finalizing this module as well by the project deadline.
