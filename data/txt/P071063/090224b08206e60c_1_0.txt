                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         This project is scheduled to end on December 31, 2013. Key remaining activities of the project implementation include piloting the TMIS in two Regional Treasury Organizations
                         and testing the interface between TMIS and the inter-bank payment system, customs system, and tax administration system. Government should take a decision in late November
                         on whether project can be fully implemented by December 31, 2013. Government should also begin to conduct parallel payrolls through HRMIS as soon as feasible to determine
                         what issues remain to be corrected.
