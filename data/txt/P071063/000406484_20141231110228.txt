1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, land-locked country with a population of 5.6 million.
Following independence in 1991, income levels declined by about 60 percent as
budgetary transfers from the Soviet Union ended, traditional trading relationships were
disrupted, and the central planning system collapsed. At appraisal, agriculture accounted
for about 40 percent of GDP and gold and electricity were the two most important
exports.

The country undertook major reforms beginning in 1993 to create the basic foundations
of a market-oriented economic system, including a market-based price system, substantial
private ownership of key productive assets, and an open international trade regime (the
Kyrgyz Republic was the first CIS country to join the World Trade Organization). A
large number of small and medium enterprises emerged during this period. The regional
financial crisis in 1998 halted economic recovery. It also highlighted continuing
vulnerabilities caused by large financial imbalances in the energy sector, fragile public
finances, inefficient safety nets, and a poorly developed banking sector.

The primary purpose of the Governance Technical Assistance Credit (GTAC) approved
in May 2003 was to support the implementation of the reforms included in the two-
tranche Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC) which was approved by the
Bank at the same time. These projects were launched in an improved macroeconomic
context as the country had made significant progress in attaining macroeconomic stability
and restarting economic growth, averaging 4.8 percent in 1999-2001. The fiscal deficit
had fallen from about 11.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2002, mostly
as a consequence of expenditure cuts. The current account deficit declined from an
average of 18.4 percent of GDP in 1996-98 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2002. As a result of
the fiscal and monetary tightening, inflation fell to 2.3 percent in 2002.

Despite the improving economic and fiscal situation, the Kyrgyz Republic remained the
second poorest country of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) republics and one of the
poorest countries in the world. In 2001, per capita income was less than US$300. Severe
poverty affected 13.5 percent of the population and 47.6 percent were considered poor
with incomes below US$4.30 per day (PPP). Poverty was highest in rural areas, but there
were large regional disparities. Access to public services such as running water, public
sewerage, reliable electricity, district heating and telephone service was very low. The
country also had a heavy burden of external debt, which stood at 477 percent of
Government revenues in net present value terms at the end of 2001. Civil servants were
poorly paid and often sought alternative sources of income.

Macroeconomic Policy Framework: A 3-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive Board of the IMF in December
2001, provided the basic underpinnings for the macro-policy framework. The



                                           11
Government’s reform efforts had also been supported through adjustment lending by the
World Bank. Seven prior Bank adjustment operations provided support for wide-ranging
and ambitious policy and institutional reforms in the following areas: privatization and
enterprise reform; agricultural privatization; improvements in the business environment;
financial sector reform; public sector resource management; pension reform; and power
and gas sector reform. These operations helped the Kyrgyz Republic to orient its policy
and institutional framework to the principles of a free market economy.

Governance. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) recognized that weak
governance and an ineffective state were serious hurdles to achieving development goals.
At the level of central and local administration, policy making capacity was extremely
weak, implementation of policies was poor and often non-existent, transparency and
accountability were inadequate, and Government interference in business activities was
excessive. The civil service also suffered from political interference. Its professional
capacity and accountability for performance were low as real salaries declined and
motivated staff became demoralized and left for other opportunities. Surveys of
households and firms confirmed that corruption was a systemic problem in public
agencies. Moreover, the judiciary and law enforcement agencies faced serious capacity
and integrity challenges that reduced their ability to uphold the law. Political parties were
weak, politics was personalized and characterized by populist measures to mobilize
political support and rent-seeking behavior. NPRS noted that the legal framework
suffered from lack of public discussion of proposed laws and regulations and inadequate
public access to normative acts. For these reasons, the NPRS accorded a high priority to
measures that strengthened governance and accountability.

Public Financial Management. Economic and sector work in 2002-2003, such as the
Public Expenditure Review (PER) and the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), identified a moderate to high degree of fiduciary risk in the use of public
resources. Critical weaknesses included the absence of effective cash planning, weak
institutional arrangements for assessing the effectiveness of budget implementation, weak
internal controls further compounded by the absence of an internal audit function,
insufficient accountability arrangements for state-owned enterprises, weak external audit,
and weak capacity in the legislative body to provide effective parliamentary oversight
over the executive. The Government recognized the need to modernize its treasury
operations and was strongly encouraged to do so by the IMF. The country already had the
requisite legal and regulatory framework for treasury operations but all treasury functions
were carried out manually. Government and its external partners believed that
computerization would help to address shortcomings of the manual system related to
transparency, informality, control of funds and inefficiency.

Rationale for Bank Involvement. The reforms included in the Government’s program
were urgently needed to successfully implement the poverty reduction agenda. The Bank
had been actively involved in supporting reforms to key public sector institutions through
various operations, including the Public Sector Resource Management Adjustment Credit
(PSRMAC), projects to reform the health sector and Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) grants to strengthen public procurement. GTAC’s primary objective was to provide



                                             12
technical assistance to design and implement the policy and institutional reforms
supported by the GSAC (see Table 1). Extensive consultations with the Government and
the donor community helped to build consensus around the GSAC-supported policy
actions and the technical assistance activities to be provided through the GTAC. The
Bank was identified as the lead partner given its global experience in implementing
public sector reforms, its country knowledge and strong relationships with counterparts
and stakeholders. The Bank was only one of several partners supporting a complex,
multi-sector reform program and the GTAC was only one of several Bank-financed
projects supporting these reforms. However, the Bank was identified as the only donor
with the expertise and resources needed to support the computerization of treasury
operations.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The objective of the GTAC was to strengthen the Borrower’s institutional capacity to
implement the measures under the Program outlined in the GSAC Program Document
and to assist with the Treasury modernization. The original results indicators spanned
several sectors and were designed support implementation of GSAC program measures:




                                                  13
   •   Number of declarations of high state officials published annually
   •   Number, quality and timeliness of key pieces of official information, specified in
       the GSAC Policy Matrix, published annually
   •   Number of draft laws and regulations discussed with the private sector and civil
       society, prior to their adoption
   •   Number of public grievances addressed annually, by the President's
       Administration, the Office of the Government and the regulatory agencies
       covered by the GSAC
   •   Coverage, quality and timeliness of audit reports of Chamber of Control (COC)
   •   Public perception about the transparency, responsiveness and integrity of the
       public sector
   •   Increased usefulness of the budget as a strategic policy instrument, as a result of
       improvements in its formulation process, content and presentation
   •   Improved access, reliability and timeliness of information about budget execution,
       to public officials and civil society
   •   Improved financial accounting and compliance with laws and regulations in three
       ministries, due to strengthened internal control systems
   •   Percentage increase in the number of private firms participating in public
       procurement
   •   Improved allocation, predictability, availability of resources for health &
       education services
   •   Percentage of recruitments and promotions in the Civil Service made on a
       competitive basis.

Only one of these indicators was related to the second element of the PDO to assist with
Treasury modernization: improved access, reliability and timeliness of information about
budget execution, to public officials and civil society. Text in the table at PAD Annex 1
(Project Design Summary) identified ‘computerized Treasury system implemented’ as an
output-level rather than an intermediate indicator. No indicators were formulated to track
progress in the implementation of Treasury modernization or the impact of these reforms.
The structure of the intermediate indicators bore little relation to the relative weight of the
project components, focusing on the activities supporting GSAC implementation rather
than the longer-term needs of Treasury modernization.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,

Although the GTAC was extended several times, no revisions were made to the PDO.
Relevant project results indicators were updated to reflect new closing dates and two
results indicators were dropped, because the Borrower (during implementation) gained
access to grant funds from other development partners to implement the corresponding
activities. No key indicators were formulated to track progress in the implementation of
Treasury modernization or the impact of these reforms despite repeated project
restructuring, even when the Treasury modernization became the only active project
component.




                                              14
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The initial project design anticipated that benefits of the project would accrue to:

   •   The people of the Kyrgyz Republic through more effective and transparent use of
       public sector resources and improved access to information and grievance
       mechanisms, both critical to the delivery of public services key to addressing
       poverty reduction and other developmental goals;
   •   The private sector, as a result of improvements in regulatory policies and
       practices and public procurement;
   •   Civil servants, on account of improvements in applicable policies, processes and
       actual practices; and
   •   The political executive, due to the availability of a more effective state machinery
       to assist in policy-making and implementation.

Poverty would be reduced indirectly through improved public services resulting from
better public financial management and improved business confidence resulting in
increased investment and faster economic and employment growth.

1.5 Original Components

GTAC was intended to support a wide range of reforms, including but not limited to
those supported by GSAC program. GTAC had three components:

Component 1: Technical assistance to support the design and implementation of the
reforms included in the GSAC (US$1.98 million). GTAC provided TA for key reforms
supported by the GSAC, complementing grant assistance provided by other donors.
GTAC assistance covered a five year implementation as compared to the two years for
the GSAC in order to enable institutionalization and sustained implementation of difficult
public sector reforms. The key reforms to be supported by GTAC were: strengthening
voice and participation by the private sector and civil society in public decision-making;
increasing transparency in public procurement; improving service delivery in education,
social protection and health services; strengthening the professionalism and effectiveness
of the civil service by increasing its independence and merit-based personnel actions;
streamlining the structure of three ministries via functional reviews; refining the NPRS
and implementing a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to measure progress in
achieving NPRS objectives.

Component 2: Modernization of the treasury (US$6.37 million). This component was
to finance consulting services, goods and training for the modernization of treasury
operations through the implementation of a Treasury Management Information System
(TMIS), restructuring for Treasury General Ledger (TGL), and implementation of a new
Chart of Accounts (CoA) in full compliance with the new GFSM2001. It was also to
provide assistance in (a) preparation of user requirements, conceptual design of the
system, system architecture and software and hardware specifications for the TMIS; (b)
selection, procurement, adaptation and implementation of an off-the-shelf software


                                             15
package; (c) procurement and implementation of hardware and communication
equipment; (d) development of the regulations for the implementation of the system; and
(e) training of staff. It was envisaged that the IMF would be closely involved in the
implementation of the TMIS and would also provide technical assistance. The system
would first be piloted in the Central Treasury and two or three pilot oblasts before being
replicated to all regional treasury offices.

Component 3: Project management (US$ 0.66 million). This component was intended
to finance consulting services, equipment and training for the Project Management Group
and Project Implementation Unit. It was also intended to finance the communication of
project objectives and activities to stakeholders, stakeholder surveys and project audits.

GTAC combined two distinct sets of activities: public sector and institutional reforms
supported through GSAC; and a treasury modernization project comprising ICT hardware
and software, associated regulatory reforms and capacity building. The modest credit
(SDR5.80 million) could only finance an initial set of activities within the vast public
sector institutional reform agenda of the time, but it was considered prudent to proceed
with a project of this size initially so that the Government could draw on the experience
gained from implementing this TA project in addressing its wider TA needs for
supporting public sector reform.

1.6 Revised Components

There were adjustments in the structure of Component 1 during implementation. Two
subcomponents were dropped in their entirety because the Government was able to
access grant financing from other donors: sub-components 6, streamlining the structure of
Government ministries and agencies; and sub-component 7, refining NPRS and monitor
and evaluate progress. The two intermediate indicators applicable to these
subcomponents were also dropped. In addition, specific activities were dropped from the
subcomponents that remained under Component 1:

   •   Strengthened Voice and Participation: regulatory impact assessment of proposed
       laws and regulations; support to public grievances by the President's
       Administration, the Office of the Government and the regulatory agencies
       covered by the GSAC.
   •   Improving Service Delivery in Health and Education: improvement of inspection
       regimes of Sanitary and Epidemiology Service and Pharm Control Laboratory
       PCL; funding for health insurance for pensioners and the unemployed accordance
       with budget allocations.
   •   Improving the Internal Control Environment: improvement in financial
       accounting and compliance with laws and regulations in three ministries through
       strengthened internal control systems.

The specific reasons for these adjustments in the scope of the project are not clear from
the project record: some activities were addressed through complementary projects,
others were dropped because priorities changed.


                                           16
1.7 Other significant changes

There were four extensions of the project closing date with the project finally closing –
without concluding project activities – on December 31, 2013 five years beyond the
original closing date of December 31, 2008. The final project restructuring completed on
December 18, 2013 cancelled the remaining US$2.5 million of the credit. There were no
significant changes in implementation arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation commenced in December 2000. Support for preparation and capacity-
building was also partly financed with a Policy and Human Resource Development
(PHRD) Grant (TF026448) for US$729,250 from the Government of Japan which was
formally associated with the preparation of the GSAC program but covered preparation
of several GTAC activities. These included technical assistance for:

   •   an Anticorruption Strategy (US$56,350);
   •   Public Administration Reform (US$460,600) including the preparation of an
       administrative and civil service reform program; a draft law on public service; an
       assessment of budgetary employment and remuneration; and an analysis of the
       institutional environment within which three to four key ministries or government
       institutions function; and
   •   Public Expenditure Management (US$48,550) including development of
       proposals for reforming budget management in the health and education sectors.

GTAC was grounded in diagnostic work, including but not limited to the analysis
financed by the PHRD Grant, which had supported the development of the GSAC
program. There was strong national ownership of the institutional reform program, an
extensive consultation process with the government and with society more broadly. The
context appeared very conducive for reform. Against this background, and although the
size of the credit was small, the project scope and activities were thought to be achievable.
Indeed, the project scope and objective were also reviewed by a Quality At Entry (QEA)
exercise which rated the project under preparation as Highly Satisfactory.

However, in hindsight, the Treasury modernization component of the project was
inadequately prepared and the MOF far from ready for implementation. The design of the
Treasury modernization component was similar to other Bank-financed treasury
modernization projects prepared in the early 2000s. A detailed review of treasury
operations had been completed by a joint IMF-WB team during GTAC appraisal. The
review concluded that Government was now ready for a successful transition, within a
period of about three years, to a fully functional modernized treasury that employed
contemporary information technology. However, this timeline proved to be unrealistic.
Preparatory work on Treasury modernization, in particular the detailed specifications for


                                            17
the TMIS, the business process re-engineering requirements and implementation of
related institutional reforms, only began after project became effective.

2.2 Risks Assessment and Mitigation

Most of the significant risks were correctly identified and recognized during preparation,
and risk mitigation measures put in place, although these risk mitigation measures were
not always effective. However, the risk of major political upheaval was one not identified
at appraisal: indeed, such a risk in the case of the Kyrgyz Republic in 2003 would have
been considered a ‘black swan’ event and inconceivable at appraisal. The risks identified
at appraisal, and what actually happened, are summarized in Table 2 below.

The PAD failed to identify risks specifically related to the implementation of Treasury
modernization. Three risks stand out, all of which subsequently materialized: first, the
lack of technical and management capacity to design and manage a complex TMIS
contract and the business reengineering requirements of Treasury modernization; second,
internal resistance to reform from those with vested interests in the existing system and
the flexibility and informality that it facilitated; and third, differences in perspectives
regarding systems requirements across institutions and within the Ministry of Finance.
GTAC’s failure to manage these risks contributed to the failure of the project’s Treasury
modernization component.

2.2 Implementation

By the time of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in March 2008 the majority of Component
1 activities had been completed, with only a small allocation left for work on
strengthening capacity in the civil service reform. The MTR assessment at that time was
that the reforms envisaged by GSAC and supported by GTAC had progressed at a
varying pace during different periods due to both political developments and the complex
nature of the institutional reforms. Nonetheless, the MTR considered the reforms as
largely successful and prospect of sustainability for these reforms to be high.

Implementation of the Treasury Modernization component proved to be problematic.
Procurement issues and the political events of 2005 led to delays in the first three years of
the project. As a result, GTAC had only disbursed 23 percent of the credit proceeds at
MTR. A project extension was needed to launch procurement of the TMIS/HRMIS
software (ICB-1) and hardware (ICB-2), which only started in 2009. Although the
installation of the ICT hardware (ICB-2) was successfully completed, subsequent
implementation delays relating to the implementation of the TMIS/HRMIS software


                                                      19
(ICB-1) led to three additional extensions of the closing date, more than doubling the
original implementation timeline. In the end, this component could not be satisfactorily
completed. The factors that affected implementation of the Treasury modernization
component are outlined below.

Delays in the preparation of technical specifications for TMIS and HRMIS. The
decision to submit the GTAC for Board approval alongside the GSAC operation meant
that the GSAC preparation schedule was driven by the country’s urgent budget support
needs. Preparation and the implementation readiness of GTAC activities were a
secondary consideration. Consequently, preparatory work on the Treasury modernization
component was only undertaken after the project became effective in August 2003 when
a consultant firm was contracted to define the functional requirements and prepare the
technical specifications for the TMIS and HRMIS. Although a bidding document for this
tender was issued to a shortlist of three qualified companies in February 2004, the
evaluation committee became deadlocked and opted for an external evaluation of the
proposals. An external expert was selected in December 2004 to evaluate the proposals,
and an international firm selected. The TMIS and HRMIS design reports were finally
completed at the end of 2006, more than three years after effectiveness. These delays had
significant implications for procurement, contracting and contract implementation. In the
absence of detailed specifications, there was no proper basis for estimation of the cost of
the software and related hardware at the time of Project appraisal, and these costs turned
out to have been underestimated. The specifications, scope and business re-engineering
requirements of the Treasury modernization were not thoroughly reviewed during project
appraisal and agreed during negotiation of GTAC financing. Lack of agreement on these
details contributed to delays during implementation and ultimately to the failure of the
Treasury modernization component.

Deficiencies in the TMIS tender process. The TMIS as described in the Treasury
modernization component of the PAD did not envisage modules for human resource
management, budget preparation, debt servicing, and agency accounting on an accrual
basis. However, these modules were included in the technical requirements issued to
bidders. This added to the system cost and complexity. When the first international
competitive bidding (ICB-1) process for the TMIS and HRMIS application software and
related servers was evaluated by the Government’s Evaluation Committee, the lowest
evaluated bid was found to be nearly US$2 million above the budget allocation. The
Evaluation Committee decided to rebid, hoping that the participation of more companies
would lower the bid price. When the tender was relaunched, specifications were not
updated to incorporate advances in information technology, changes in the country’s pay
system, the preferred structure and content of the single CoA, or the MOF’s approach to
adopting international accounting and reporting standards. Some of the TMIS functional
requirements were not clearly defined, including terms such as ‘preparation of a draft
national budget’ and ‘preparation of a medium term financial plan’. The expectations of
MOF’s Treasury and Budget departments differed on the extent to which budget
preparation functionality would be included in TMIS. The vendor agreed to produce a
customized module, which it demonstrated to the Government in mid-2012, but the MOF
was unwilling to accept this module. The MOF and the vendor had very different



                                            20
expectations regarding the scope of system customization required to satisfy the
requirements of the contract signed in 2009. These differences in expectations regarding
the scope of TMIS functionality and system customization were compounded by delays
on the part of the authorities in finalizing two system design elements: the CoA and the
interface between the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and the banking system.

Delays in the approval of the Chart of Accounts. A unified CoA was expected to
provide the backbone for classification, accounting, transaction processing, reporting and
control within the TMIS. However, the development of the CoA took much longer than
anticipated. The revisions to the budget classification and CoA structures only started in
2006. A unified CoA was expected to be introduced in 2009 and shared immediately with
the winning bidder of the ICB-1 second stage. In reality only a partial version, relating to
Treasury, was ready at this time. The selected vendor stated that it could provide a
unified CoA as part of its software package. After a few months, however, it became
clear that the vendor’s standard CoA did not meet the needs of Government operations.
After a year of negotiations, the vendor eventually agreed that a new unified CoA was
needed. The CoA was finally completed in September 2012, nearly two years later than
scheduled.

Lack of clarity with regard to the design of the Treasury Single Account and NBKR
interface. In 2007, before launching bidding on TMIS/HRMIS, the MOF signed an
agreement with the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan (NBKR) on managing gross payments
in online mode and establishing direct access for the Treasury to the central bulk
clearance arrangements. The NBKR did not have the capacity to perform transactional
banking tasks for the Government and expected that the existing practice of using
commercial banks, or establishing access to the interbank payments system for Treasury,
would be adopted for payment processing, detailed settlements, and transfers between the
Government’s accounts. The NBKR maintained a simpler structure for Government
accounts and had revised its CoA prior to the 2007 agreement. The NBKR was not
consulted about the technical specifications for the TMIS contract. These specifications
included a general provision for the design of interfaces with the NBKR and agent
(commercial) banks for the transfer of information on accounts, payments, and other
matters, and for the receipt of payments data to commercial banks. It also included an
outline of the proposed operations of a TSA system that the Treasury expected to be open
with the NBKR. After the TMIS contract was signed, disagreements arose on how the
TSA should function. The Treasury and the vendor were unable to resolve the details of
the TSA arrangements due to the difficulty in defining the mode of TSA operations and
the lack of legal/operational framework (such as a TSA agreement or protocol) between
the Treasury and the NBKR. In 2012, the vendor agreed to develop an NBKR interface to
work within the bulk clearance system. Ultimately, the vendor was not able to produce
this software before the contract was terminated.

Delays in contract implementation. In January 2012, the Bank was informed of the
Government’s intention to terminate the contract with the vendor due to the continuous
delays in contract implementation. At this stage, the contract was supposed to close by
the end of December 2012. Following discussions with the vendor, the Government



                                            21
agreed to continue with the contract. The MOF and the vendor signed an MOU on June 8,
2012 setting out explicit deliverables and timelines. However, progress in TMIS/HRMIS
implementation continued to be unsatisfactory as both the MOF and vendor missed key
deadlines, and the parties were not able to agree on detailed system specifications for
TMIS/HRMIS software, testing and operational acceptance. In early 2013, a new action
plan for full implementation was agreed between the parties with the vendor agreeing to
demonstrate a fully functional module by December 2013. Delays and communication
difficulties persisted, however, and the Government decided to terminate the contract
with the vendor on November 27, 2013 citing the vendor’s failure to complete
TMIS/HRMIS implementation activities within the agreed timeline. The Government
also notified the Bank on December 16, 2013 that it had elected to cancel the undisbursed
amount of the credit (approximately US$2.5 million). The MoF and the vendor are
expected to be in discussion over the issues in contention.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

The GTAC results indicators and results framework reflected the practice in the Bank in
2003. As a TA project supporting the achievement of key policy and institutional reforms
under an adjustment credit, the results framework was aligned with the GSAC policy
matrix. The results framework was reviewed during the Quality At Entry (QEA) exercise
and considered as representing best practice. In retrospect this assessment seems
unwarranted: the monitoring and evaluation framework was weak in design and
implementation.

The use of public perceptions of transparency, responsiveness and integrity of the public
sector as the PDO indicator for Component 1 presented problems of attribution since a
wide range of factors outside the project would have impacts on those perceptions. Many
of the GTAC intermediate outcome indicators measured processes rather than the outputs
or outcomes of reforms. Many of the indicators lacked baselines, others lacked target
values. In constructing the datasheet, the ICR team has presumed target values based on
assumptions of the kinds of outcomes that would be associated with the indicator.
Attribution problems also arise because of the design of GSAC and GTAC as parallel
operations. Component 1 indicators were monitored by joint GSAC and GTAC teams,
focusing on the Government’s progress in achieving GSAC triggers. Close alignment of
the GSAC and GTAC results frameworks made it difficult to distinguish which results
can be attributed to each of the financing instruments.

A significant shortcoming of the M&E original design was the lack of an appropriate
monitoring framework for Treasury modernization, the largest of the two components in
terms of value. This component featured as a PDO indicator (“Establishment of a modern
computerized treasury system”). However, the intermediate indicators were formulated in
such a way as to assess the performance of the Treasury and Budget systems as a whole
rather than specific components (“Improved access, reliability and timeliness of
information about budget execution, to public officials and civil society”; “Increased
usefulness of the budget as a strategic policy instrument, as a result of improvements in
its formulation process, content and presentation”). The intermediate indicators provided



                                           22
little guidance to stakeholders on the intended scope and functional capabilities of the
proposed Treasury system and related reforms.

Implementation of the M&E framework was also deficient. The PDO indicators required
the use of periodic surveys of stakeholders of households, firms, and public officials to
assess perceptions about transparency, responsiveness, and integrity of the public sector.
No baseline survey was undertaken and the periodic surveys were dropped without
explanation. Data was gathered in relation to intermediate indicators, though several of
these indicators were dropped as the scope of Component 2 was adjusted in the course of
implementation. It is unclear to what extent M&E information was used to feed back into
management decisions and guide GTAC implementation. Monitoring of the indicators
related to Component 1 ceased following the MTR in 2009, by which time most of the
Component 1 activities were completed. Consequently, it is not possible to assess the
status of these indicators at the time of project closing.

These shortcomings in the GTAC M&E design were noted in the MTR and several
subsequent ISRs. However, no action was taken to adjust the M&E framework to better
align project objectives, scope, content and results indicators. Perhaps the most obvious
missed opportunity was the 2009 restructuring undertaken to align the PDO text in the
PAD with that in the legal agreement as part of a Bank-wide exercise. Other
opportunities to restructure the results framework arose during subsequent project
extensions. Indeed, the need for restructuring of results indicators was discussed in ISRs
as late as 2013.

2.4 Implementation Arrangements

A GSAC Coordination Council (CC) was set up to provide strategic guidance to both the
GSAC and GTAC projects. The CC’s role was to: oversee and track the implementation
of policy changes; approve and submit draft legislative acts and regulations to the
Parliament and the President; help to resolve inter-agency coordination issues; and assist
in overcoming resistance to some of the reforms. The CC was chaired by the Deputy
Head of the President’s Administration and included the Vice Minister for Economic
Development, Trade and Investment, the Minister of Finance and other members drawn
from different branches of government. Between the 2005 and 2008 when the GSAC
closed, there were at least eight changes in the CC Chairman together with other changes
in CC membership. Loss of continuity undermined the CC’s effectiveness and the
coordination function fell largely to the Ministry of Finance, which became the central
government institution with relatively more institutional continuity. Once Component 1
activities had been completed, the multi-sector CC oversight arrangements were no
longer relevant to GTAC implementation, since Component 2 was solely the
responsibility of the Ministry of Finance..

Originally, a Project Management Group (PMG) was established to manage GTAC
project implementation. PMG was led by a director with a manager to run day-to-day
project operations and deal with coordination and reporting. The PMG was financed by
the project. Funds were provided for local consultants as thematic coordinators to assist



                                           23
the government agencies to push forward the GSAC agenda. These coordinators covered:
civil service reform and public administration; public expenditure management and
related areas; treasury modernization; and information technology. Separately, a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) provided procurement and financial management services.
These arrangements proved dysfunctional. The PMG was dissolved in the early stages of
GTAC implementation and the responsibilities were taken over by the Project
Implementation Group; individual consultants continued working to support the
government’s efforts to implement GSAC working directly with the respective
institutions, while the PIU functions were transferred to another existing PIU in the
Ministry of Finance.

2.5 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project did not activate any safeguards. No fiduciary compliance issues were flagged
during implementation and the fiduciary ratings were Satisfactory through most of
project implementation.

2.6 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

There are currently no concrete plans for a follow-up project to GTAC. The joint donor
trust fund for public finance capacity building, which is not linked to GTAC, has
provided post-GTAC support for PFM reforms and will continue to do so. Other
institutional reforms are supported by the government’s own resources with assistance
from other development partners such as the EU, USAID and DFID.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives were strategic and remain relevant. The Country Partnership
Strategy for 2013-17 includes a pillar on governance, which includes actions related to
public administration and public service delivery. Improvements in governance are seen
as essential for achieving poverty reduction and boosting shared prosperity.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO was formulated in two parts: first, to strengthen the Borrower’s institutional
capacity to implement the measures under the program outlined in the GSAC Program
Document; and second, to assist with the Treasury modernization.

In relation to the first part of the PDO, the 2009 GSAC ICR concluded that “the
objectives for Pillar 1 on public sector transparency and responsiveness were essentially
achieved”. Pillar 1 of GSAC contained most of the elements included in Component 1 of
GTAC. The overall ICR rating of the GSAC was ‘Moderately Unsatisfactory’ because at
the time of writing, 2009, there was evidence of backtracking in areas such as
depoliticizing the civil service, in procurement, and in overall transparency. However,



                                           24
after the GSAC ICR, the 2010 revolution led to a change in Government and many of the
reforms proved to be resilient. The independent Civil Service Agency continues to
operate, competition-based appointments are more common – though political patronage
and other considerations are still important in many selections – and procurement and
transparency reforms have been followed-up by subsequent Governments. The per capita
health and education financing models developed with GTAC support are still in use
today; so too are the income and asset reporting system for public servants, the
improvements in budget presentation and reporting, the mechanisms for public
consultation around the policy process and the public information centers. GTAC played
an important role in the implementation of all of these reforms. Given the impact and
resilience of the GTAC supported reforms a rating of Moderately Satisfactory is justified.

The PDO sought to assess the impact of these reforms through surveys of public
perception of transparency, responsiveness and integrity of public sector. Since the
surveys were never undertaken, it is not possible to assess performance against this
indicator. An alternative source of data from the World Governance Indicators shows
that ‘Voice and Accountability’ and ‘Government Effectiveness’ indicators were volatile
over the project period (see Figure 1). It is unclear what impact the GTAC project had –
or could have had - on these indicators or public perceptions. Broader governance
concerns related to political stability are likely to have been a far more important
consideration of public perceptions than any of the GTAC-supported governance reforms
no matter how successful they may have been.

Progress against the second part of the PDO, Treasury modernization is considered
Unsatisfactory. At GTAC closing, the MoF did not – and still does not – have a
functioning ‘modern computerized treasury system’, the PDO performance indicator.
This investment has not been a complete failure. By the MOF’s own account the Ministry


                                                                                                                     25
now has the foundations needed for the implementation of TMIS system. The data
centers (ICB-2) were successfully completed. This has improved the network
connectivity for the whole MoF structure. The legal basis for a modern automated
treasury system is now in place. The Ministry has gained valuable experience and is now
better placed to supervise future system development. Work in this area continues,
financed by a recipient-executed trust fund for public financial management.

3.3 Achievement of Results by Component

Component 1. TA to support implementation of the reforms included in the GSAC

Access to information on income and assets of high state officials (political appointees)
has increased. The government adopted legislation on income and assets declarations of
high state officials and their immediate family members. GTAC-financed consultants
helped the government to draft and introduce necessary by-laws regulating the
declaration process for this category of civil servants and make the whole process
operational. As a result, currently about 98 percent of political appointees declare their
incomes and assets on an annual basis and submit the declarations to the Civil Service
Agency. According to the law, the CSA has the right to verify the information provided
by communicating with the Tax Inspection and to report to the President, Parliament,
Constitutional and Supreme Courts in case incomplete or false information was provided.
The agency was also authorized to publish information on incomes and assets of
politicians (except details such as addresses and telephone numbers) on the agency
magazine and web-site. While the information on income and assets of senior officials
was available in numerous publications, it is not widely used by civil society as an
instrument for strengthening accountability and integrity in the public sector as originally
expected. Media and NGO awareness on how to use such information has improved over
time.

A Public Information Center was established and is now functioning. The PIC was
opened in late 2005, under the President’s Administration, with GTAC financial support
for procuring equipment and software, as well as for training of staff. The PIC provides a
wide range of services for the general public, including free access to internet-based
information databases and a PIC library, IT training for different groups of citizens,
public discussions on various topics. The government has established regional mini-PICs.
This success became possible due to strong support from the President’s administration
and dedicated PIC staff. The PIC successfully collaborates with many donors working in
the country.

Access to legal information was improved. The GTAC helped the MOJ create a
database of laws, treaties, legal acts and judicial decisions, publicly accessible through
the MOJ web-site (www.minjust.gov.kg) which in 2007 won first prize as the most
popular government site.

A Law on access to public information was adopted at end-2006. The Law was drafted
by a Working Group, which included representatives from the government and civil



                                            26
society with active participation of GTAC expert consultants. According to the law, all
government entities (including local self-governance bodies) are obliged to make all
information related to their performance public other than so called “state secret
information”, either by publishing this information in mass media, or upon requests of
citizens in written format. The law also provides tools for individuals to appeal against
denials of requests for information.

Improvements in private sector and civil society engagement in decision-making.
Despite the modest financial resources allocated a number of activities were implemented
to facilitate citizens’ access to public information and their participation in drafting of
laws and regulations. Public steering councils were established comprising
representatives from civil society, think tanks, professional and sector unions, and experts
to provide public opinion on formulating and implementing government policy

Improved transparency and value for money in public procurement. GTAC helped
strengthen capacity of the State Procurement Agency and line ministries, improve public
procurement rules and increase transparency of public procurement process. About 4,500
staff of procuring agencies were trained in the new procurement legislation and rules,
many through a Public Procurement Regional Training Center. New tender documents
conforming to the 1997 Public Procurement Law, guidelines and manuals were
developed and adopted. The Government initiated publication of a monthly Public
Procurement bulletin. Working with the local branch of Transparency International, the
Government raised awareness of new procurement rules among business circles. An
internationally recognized company undertook an audit of selected items procured from
the republican budget and made recommendations for improvement of the procurement
process to achieve greater value for money.

Improved service delivery in health, education and social protection. GTAC provided
technical assistance to strengthen financial management in support of service delivery.
This included the development of more equitable formulae for grant transfers for health
and education which were then under local government jurisdiction. The health sector
financing reforms were not implemented owing to the transfer of responsibility for all
health institutions to the republican budget. However, a more transparent and objective
geographic allocation of health resources was achieved through the application of the
new financial rules for the sector based on per capita and caseload criteria. In the case of
education, the GTAC-supported capitation-based grants were adopted in March 2008,
when the government decided that reforms in education sector had made sufficient
progress to use per capita financing for resource allocation.

Improved transparency, accountability and effectiveness of the civil service. GTAC
supported civil service reforms that sought to eliminate patronage by ministers and their
appointees in designating civil servants, introduce merit and rule based appointment and
promotion and improve security of tenure for professional civil servants. Following the
approval of the 2004 Civil Service Law (CSL), GTAC helped establish the CSA. GTAC
financed advisory services developing a rule based system of appointments and
dismissals which separated political appointees from career civil servants and introduced



                                            27
State Secretaries to head the permanent civil service in all ministries. A massive training
program for civil servants in Human Resource Management was conducted throughout
the country, including special programs for CSA staff. During the revolution of March
2005, when there was considerable turnover of political appointees, the newly established
CSA managed to protect some professional civil servants from illegal dismissals. The
system of appointments was significantly improved with the reported number of
appointments made through due process being close to 100 percent at the time of the
MTF, compared with about 50 percent at the end of 2005. To reduce the personal
interface with candidates for posts, the CSA, with GTAC financial support, established a
Testing Centre, where all candidates undergo computer-based assessments of their
general competencies. Most government bodies now have State Secretaries who manage
human resources and budget of the ministries to meet their objectives. While the
responsibilities and capacity of State Secretaries need to be further developed, this reform
has had a positive impact on the quality of civil service and agency management.

Strengthening budget preparation, reporting and oversight.                   GTAC financed
consultants to help the Treasury develop the GFS-2001 compliant budget classification
and provided technical support to implement the Medium Term Budgetary Framework
(MTBF). The budget is now presented based upon this new classification structure and is
presented with two years of historical data and indicative ceilings for the next three years.
The linkages between the MTEF and the annual budget is, however, extremely weak.
GTAC provided technical support for the development of the unified CoA and the
creation of the TSA. These reforms contributed to the development of the MoF’s
capability to submit comprehensive budget execution reports to the Prime Minister’s
Office, the Parliament, NBKR, the National Statistics Committee, and other stakeholders
within six months of budget execution. These reports are posted on the official website of
the MoF for public access. However, in the absence of an operational TMIS, data from
regional treasuries is still compiled from summary reports, and MOF is unable to access
all budget execution data at a transaction level in real time. In addition, to work on budget
reform and treasury reform, GTAC financed consultants to help the Government draft
and pass the law on CoA that stipulated performance audits and an evaluation of the
efficiency and effectiveness of public spending in June 2004. Capacity building to the
Accounts Chamber was provided through IDF grant. The Parliament now receives the
progress report of the Accounts Chamber every September for the previous budget year
as well as the opinion on the draft Budget Law for the subsequent fiscal year and the
results of the audit reports are widely discussed and referenced in the mass media. The
reports, however, are mostly related to the legality, not the effectiveness or efficiency of
public expenditure.

Component 2. Modernization of the Treasury

Establishment of a modern computerized Treasury system.        GTAC supported the
modernization of treasury operations through the development of a Treasury
Management Information System (TMIS). It was originally intended that the TMIS
would be piloted in the Central Treasury and two or three pilot oblasts, before being
rolled out to all 8 oblasts and 57 rayon treasury offices. TMIS development was



                                             28
interrupted in 2005, resumed and then ran into a series of technical and operational
problems discussed at length in section 2.2 above. Ultimately the project closed without
delivering a functioning computerized Treasury system. The TMIS will require
significant additional work to be made fully operational.

Intermediate outputs: the regulatory framework for Treasury automation. GTAC has
provided assistance to the authorities in developing the legal and regulatory instruments
needed for the implementation of a TMIS. These include: instructions on functioning of
the Unified Treasury Account; adoption of a unified CoA and a unified CoA Manual for
Users; and a protocol between the MOF and the NBKR on the functioning of the TSA.
Delays in the adoption of these regulatory instruments contributed to the delays in TMIS
development.

Intermediate outputs: the ICT infrastructure for Treasury automation. The Bank had
identified the key Information and Communications Technology infrastructure
requirement needed for successful implementation of TMIS/HRMIS. The Government
put this infrastructure in place using its own budgetary resources, including:
reconstruction of the Data Processing Center (DPC) and the Reserve Data Processing
Center (RDPC) and laying of fiber-optic communication lines (FOCL) between
KyrgyzTelecom Joint-Stock Company, the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance,
the State Personnel Service, and the Data Processing Center. GTAC financed system-
specific infrastructure including: equipment for the central TMIS/HRMIS system, 22
servers, data storage systems and management and monitoring systems; equipment,
software and main and local networks installed at regional units of the Treasury; and
computers for the Central Treasury and its regional units. While the ICT infrastructure
cannot be used to its full operational potential without the TMIS software, the MoF has
used these platforms to support the daily operations of legacy systems and automate parts
of the budget execution, reporting and support functions using software developed in-
house.

Establishment of a Human Resource Management Information System. The HRMIS
was not identified as a project activity or output in the PAD. However, the HRMIS was
discussed in detail in the first aide memoire dated September 2003 as a tool that would
support the automation of human resource management functions with the Civil Service
Agency as the primary user. Notwithstanding the fact that the HRMIS and TMIS had
distinct institutional arrangements, the Bank team advised the authorities that the TORs
of the TMIS and HRMIS should be included in a single package bid package to generate
sufficient interest from international firms. The HRMIS was included in the TMIS
contract signed by the client in 2009. The HRMIS implementation also met significant
delays due to disputes over the level of customization and system functionality. In March
2013, the CSA and the vendor had identified a list of 44 changes to be made in the
HRMIS component to finalize the software. At project closing, the vendor had completed
22 of these changes and the Civil Service Agency stated that the system did not meet
their requirements owing to problems in calculating the payroll and in generating the
reports they needed.




                                           29
Component 3. Project Management

Project is managed efficiently, implementation progress monitored and evaluated on
time. Component 3 financed project management, implementation, coordination and the
monitoring arrangements. Project management was geared to the complex coordination
needed for Component 1 with its multiple stakeholders. Its monitoring framework was
designed to track implementation of Component 1 activities. However, GTAC never
implemented the perception surveys that were required to monitor and evaluate the
achievement of PDO level outcomes. Moreover, the project management arrangements
failed to provide adequate support to Component 2. Inadequate attention was given to the
management requirements for TMIS design and implementation with its associated
business process reengineering and change management activities. In the end, most of
the management and oversight over TMIS was undertaken by the MOF structures with
limited technical support from the project.

3.3 Efficiency

The PAD anticipated that GTAC would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness within
the public sector by improving transparency and accountability. However, as a TA
project, no cost-benefit analysis was undertaken at appraisal.

Component 1 of GTAC has indeed contributed to significant, sustainable reforms that
have delivered improvements in transparency and accountability. However, these benefits
cannot be precisely mapped to improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in public
spending. Furthermore, attribution of benefits to Component 1 of GTAC is not
straightforward: the reforms supported by GTAC were also supported by the Bank-
financed GSAC and projects financed by bilateral partners.

In relation to Component 2, preparatory work has contributed to improvements in
transparency – notably through work on the regulatory framework – and will facilitate
follow-up work on Treasury modernization. In addition, IT infrastructure has been
significantly strengthened throughout the country due to the US$3.5 million for the
establishment of regional data centers and hardware upgrades. However, given that the
project failed to deliver a functioning TMIS, the investment of the US$5.5 million (70
percent of project costs) in this component was not an efficient or effective use of funds.

Finally, the operational efficiency of financing was very low. The costs of supervision at
$1.2mn represents 15 percent of the original credit amount and 20 percent of
disbursements.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

While a single rating is required, GTAC is best understood as two distinct projects:
Component 1, a multi-sector technical assistance program designed to support a
development policy operation; and Component 2, a standalone investment project in


                                            30
Treasury automation and information systems. GTAC’s implementation arrangements
and monitoring framework were designed to support the first component. The second
component was inadequately prepared. Furthermore, at project design, the project’s
implementation arrangements and monitoring framework were not designed to support
management of a complex IT contract and associated business processing and
institutional change management.

The broad objectives supported by GTAC remain highly relevant today just as they were
in 2003. The National Sustainable Development Strategy (2013-17) considers governance
and state-building as its overarching theme. The Bank’s FY14-17 Country Partnership
Strategy also focuses on governance as a means of reducing extreme poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. The first of four areas of engagement under the FY14-17
CPS supports efforts to create a robust public administration and improve the efficiency
and quality of essential services. Building on the achievements of earlier reforms,
including those under GTAC Component 1, the Bank’s priorities shifted slightly:
transparency and accountability of the civil service and in decision making are less
prominent in the reform agenda, since the basic structures have been put in place, the
management of public resources continues to figure prominently, though with greater
emphasis on internal audit and external oversight, and the justice sector has been
identified as a new area of engagement.

GTAC’s performance in terms of achieving the PDO is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. Most of the activities and outputs foreseen under Component 1 – other
than those that were dropped because alternative sources of financing were identified –
were completed successfully and have proved sustainable: the independent Civil Service
Agency continues to operate, procurement and transparency reforms have been followed-
up by subsequent Governments. Component 2, in contrast, failed to deliver a functioning
‘modern computerized treasury system’ as expected. While many of the elements needed
for the implementation of a TMIS system have now been put in place, it will still take
several years for the government to put in place a TMIS with the broad system
functionality originally proposed if contracts have to be tendered to identify a new vendor.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The PAD anticipated that GTAC would have a positive impact on poverty reduction
through the reduction in opportunities for corruption and more effective use of public
funds. These impacts cannot be assessed. No specific gender perspective was addressed
in the PAD or during project monitoring.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional change and strengthening was a central theme of GTAC and so pervades
much of the discussion of development objectives and outcomes. The public sector and
governance reforms supported by Component 1 have proved resilient. A large proportion
of civil servants are now recruited competitively following a process approach overseen

has been institutionalized and further reforms are being supported by other donors. Per
capita financing for the education and health sectors are now used to allocate resources.
The Government has implemented an access to information law and created opportunities
for the engagement of citizens in the decision making process. GTAC also contributed to
the introduction of a unified CoA, a TSA and timely audit of the state budget. The
widespread increase in computer use through all levels of the civil service, and especially
in the Treasury Department of the MOF, has enhanced capacity, as have the expanded
training efforts. Indeed, Component 2 has also proved more successful in strengthening
the institutional framework for Treasury automation than it has in delivering a
functioning TMIS. The institutional and technological foundations for Treasury
automation are now in place and MOF has gained valuable experience in contract
management. MOF is now well-placed to proceed with Treasury modernization.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

No unintended positive or negative outcomes have been identified. However, the failure
of Component 2 and the lack of a modern, computerized TMIS have significantly limited
the benefits that the Government has been able to realize from its PFM reforms. The
existing Treasury information systems have been adjusted to accommodate the new CoA,
the TSA has been established and is operational, however the existing is not integrated
across functions, institutions and levels of government. Consequently, MOF is not able to
drill down in real time to transaction level data across the whole of government and
budget execution reports are compiled using aggregate level data submitted periodically
by the regional treasuries.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted as part of this ICR. The
public perception surveys foreseen under the project were not implemented.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

The resilience and institutionalization of key public sector reforms under Component 1
indicates that their sustainability is high. However, the failure of the TMIS contract does
pose a substantial risk to project outcomes. The vendor has revoked MOF access to any
of the systems in development. It is unlikely that MOF will be able to proceed with
Treasury automation until this issue is resolved.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance




                                            32
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The fundamental flaw in the design of the GTAC project was the combination of two
distinct projects with very different institutional and implementation requirements under
a single financing instrument.

Project design focused on the needs of Component 1, the multi-sector technical assistance
program supporting a broad range of institutional reforms under the associated
development policy operation, GSAC. Preparation of this Component was supported
through a PHRD Grant, officially tied to the GSAC, which provided useful capacity-
building and analytical support to the MOF. The implementation arrangements focused
on the requirements of the multi-sector reform program and the project results framework
focused on these activities. A Quality At Entry review undertaken before approval rated
the project preparation Highly Satisfactory. While this assessment may be merited for the
design of Component 1, it ignored the poor preparation of Component 2.

Component 2, Treasury automation, was unprepared and certainly not implementation
ready at effectiveness. The functional scope, technical specifications and business process
change requirements of the TMIS were not agreed by effectiveness. There is no evidence
that the project had undertaken an assessment of the change management implications of
Treasury automation, identifying the winners and losers, reform champions and resistors
and adjusting project institutional arrangements to address implementation risks. Indeed,
the project implementation arrangements were unsuited to TMIS implementation which
requires clear lines of vertical accountability to ensure prompt and authoritative decision-
making. These design shortcomings combined led to significant delays in the launch of
the TMIS procurement and undermined effective TMIS contract management.
Furthermore, the results framework did not include indicators that could be used to
monitor the performance of the TMIS modernization and provided no guidance on the
TMIS functional scope. Given these design failures Component 2 was poorly equipped
to achieve the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

GTAC has benefitted from intensive supervision for much of the implementation period,
albeit with interruptions during periods of political instability in 2005 and 2010.
Implementation support missions have taken place at least twice each year,
complemented by additional support through remote VC consultations. During the early
stages of implementation supervision activities covered by Components 1 and 2 and was
combined with supervision of the parallel GSAC. During the period up to the 2005
revolution the project benefitted from intensive supervision, with substantial technical
assistance and advisory services to support implementation. Supervision subsequently
tailed-off to the time of the mid-term review in 2009, when activities under Component 1
had largely been completed. Thereafter, supervision focused exclusively on Component


                                            33
2 and ramped up significantly as problems arose in the Treasury modernization.
Supervision was particularly intense in the last two years of project implementation.

Over the ten year project implementation period, there have been numerous changes in
key Bank staff: including four country managers and six project team leaders.
Nonetheless, throughout the project there has been a strong mix of technical skills on the
team. Throughout TMIS procurement, contracting and subsequent project
implementation the Bank’s Task Team included specialists in the area of Treasury reform,
financial management information systems and procurement of IT systems. Recognizing
the challenges in implementation of Component 2 and broader governance reforms, the
Bank, with support from bilateral partners under a parallel capacity building project,
fielded a resident TTL in Bishkek from September 2011 to March 2013. After this field
assignment was terminated and the TTL changed, from mid-2013 through to project
closing, the Washington, D.C.–based TTL organized tripartite video conferences – Bank,
MOF and vendor – every three weeks to track progress in implementation and an effort to
resolve implementation problems. The Bank made repeated efforts to help the MOF and
TMIS vendor come to an agreement on the TMIS functional and customization
requirements. Aide Memoires of implementation support missions provided detailed
assessments of the implementation challenges and clear recommendations on solutions.
Ultimately, in December 2013, four years after contract signature, MOF cancelled the
contract. The Bank continues to provide technical support on Treasury modernization
issues after the project closed, financed through a trust fund.

Despite the high technical quality of the supervision of both components and the close
implementation supported offered by the Bank, the overall quality of supervision is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, the Bank’s supervision failed to use the
opportunity of project restructuring to address the design flaws in Component 2,
particularly as regards the lack of a clear decision-making structure for the resolution of
technical problems related to the design and implementation of the TMIS and the lack of
an adequate results framework to monitor and evaluate the Treasury modernization
component. Second, the Bank’s supervision did not place sufficient weight on the
delivery of technical advice to the MOF on TMIS design and contract management.
GTAC did contract an international advisor to provide this support, but the advisor was
insufficiently engaged in the discussions within the MOF to guide the authorities in
managing a complex TMIS contract and relations with the vendor.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Overall Bank performance in relation to Component 1 was satisfactory. GTAC
Component 1 complemented a governance reform program supported by the GSAC. At
negotiations, Component 1 met the criteria for a successful project: high level of national
ownership and commitment to reform, close coordination between external partners and a
package of technical support for implementation. The Bank provided close supervision
during the implementation phase, adjusting the scope of Component 1 to take account of



                                            34
alternative sources of financing and addressing challenges during implementation.
Component 2, in contrast, was poorly prepared and certainly not implementation ready at
effectiveness. The Bank failed to ensure clarity over TMIS specifications during
procurement and failed to address design flaws when opportunities for project
restructuring arose. Despite the high quality of technical supervision of Component 2,
the serious shortcomings in terms of the implementation support to the management of
this component justify an overall supervision rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory.

With the benefit of hindsight, the Bank could have been more decisive in cutting its
losses and closing the project when faced with disagreements between the MOF and its
vendor and repeated failure of the vendor to meet production deadlines. The task team
and Bank management discussed alternative project restructuring options during 2012
and early in 2013. However, the Bank’s technical team believed that the contract could
have been completed successfully if the Government and vendor agreed on system
specifications and the vendor put adequate resources at the disposal of the project.
Furthermore, the Bank recognized that there was a significant downside risk to project
failure since the Treasury would have to restart the process of procuring an automated
Treasury system, and delivery would be delayed by several years. Bank management
decided that the risks and costs to the client from prematurely closing the project
outweighed the risks and costs to the Bank.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic managed to deliver a broad program of
governance reforms with support from GSAC and GTAC through a period of political
instability. During and in the immediate aftermath of the 2005 and 2010 revolutions, the
Government was understandably preoccupied with restoring political and fiscal stability,
and the reform agenda was a secondary consideration. The CC established by
Presidential Order played a role in coordinating these reforms during the early years.
After 2005, Ministry of Finance assumed this role. The performance of Government
institutions – the Ministry of Finance, the Procurement Administration, the Civil Service
Agency, the Ministry of Health, and the Chamber of Accounts – has inevitably been
affected by changes in Government and institutional leadership and the capabilities of
different leadership teams have varied. Nonetheless, despite these changes, the broad
direction and institutional framework created by these reforms under Component 1 of the
project has been sustained.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The MOF was the lead implementing agency for Component 1 and the sole implementing
agency for Component 2. There have been frequent changes in MOF management during
the course of project implementation: with a succession of six Ministers of Finance, four
State Secretaries and five heads of Treasury between 2010 – when the TMIS vendor
began activities – and project closing at the end of 2013. These changes have inevitably
impacted the capability to manage a complex Treasury modernization process.
Leadership change entails a steep learning curve as managers were brought up to speed
on project design and implementation issues. This inevitably contributed to delays in
decision making and lack of continuity. This problem was compounded by the lack of
familiarity with Bank procedures. Protracted procurement procedures and time-
consuming management processes requiring heavy involvement of senior officials
contributed to delays in respect of ICB-1 and cancellation of ICB-2. This delayed
implementation of Component 2 and the pursuit of early results.

Two particular shortcomings in implementing agency performance stand out. First, the
Ministry of Finance was slow to agree on and implement the institutional reforms needed
to support the Treasury modernization, notably the unified CoA and the requirements for
the TSA interaction with the banking system. Second, the Ministry failed to articulate its
expectations of the TMIS clearly at the start of implementation and subsequently changed
system requirements during implementation, this was partly due to differing expectations
within the Ministry and the Ministry’s failure to put in place an adequate decision making
structure to resolve these differences in views. These shortcomings contributed to delays



                                           36
in implementation, delays in procurement and the disputes between the MOF and the
vendor.

Both of these issues reflect the Ministry’s limited technical and managerial capacity and
its inexperience in dealing with complex Treasury modernization. After all, the Ministry
had never gone through this process before. The Ministry of Finance recognized its
limited capacity in this area and established an in-house IT organization to develop
solutions that were outside the capabilities of MOF staff. However, this organization was
inadequate to address the technical and change management requirements of a Treasury
modernization process.

Both the Bank team and the vendor had considerably more experience in Treasury
automation, and both had the opportunity to highlight these problems and ensure that they
were addressed. The Bank team should have done more to ensure that the Ministry had
adequate access to a technical specialist embedded in the Ministry of Finance with
experience on Treasury modernization and automation to support decision making
throughout TMIS design and implementation.

Opposition to the Treasury modernization process from within the Ministry of Finance
contributed to these delays and the difficulties in reaching agreement with the vendor.
When many of the high level officials who were most critical of the modernization
process were replaced starting in late 2012, the prospects for successful implementation
improved markedly. The vendor, however, did not respond to the improved operating
environment and did not deliver on commitments made to supply a functioning system by
November 2013.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The successful management of the governance and institutional reforms under
Component 1 has to be offset against the poor management of the Treasury
modernization process under Component 2.

6. Lessons Learned

These lessons learned focus on the TMIS modernization component. The Bank
recognizes that complex IT projects are particularly difficult to implement. However, the
potential rewards are significant, and it is now inconceivable to undertake institutional
reforms without the use of information technology. Based on review of the project
documentation and discussions with stakeholders, including Government, Bank staff and
suppliers, the main lessons learned from the failure of GTAC Component 2 are:

The Bank should avoid combining complex ICT projects with development policy
operations. The time frame for DPO preparation tends to be driven by budget financing
requirements and the government’s readiness to complete prior actions; DPO



                                           37
implementation tends to be relatively short term; and the operations tend to include a
range of interventions across sectors and thematic issues requiring complex, multi-
institution implementation arrangements. All of these characteristics are incompatible
with the requirements of complex ICT projects. ICT preparation schedules are much
more extended and determined by project implementation readiness; implementation
schedules are much more extended; and implementation arrangements have to be simple,
ensuring clear lines of decision-making and accountability within a lead institution.

ICT projects are first and foremost institutional reform and change management
projects. Project design and the early stages of implementation focused on the IT and
PFM technical requirements of Treasury modernization, with little consideration given to
the institutional and change management requirements of Treasury modernization. A
better understanding of the winners and losers within MOF and more active steps to
manage potential resistance to change could have helped in identifying and managing
risks before and during implementation. Adequate resources should be devoted to assist
MOF staff and other internal and external stakeholders understand the institutional
reforms and potential impacts. Resistance to change should be anticipated and the project
should retain consensus building and communications arrangements throughout
implementation.

Project design should build in ‘circuit breakers’ to allow disengagement during
implementation if certain key assumptions are not fulfilled or there are major
delays. In the case of the GTAC, such a ‘circuit breaker’ could have been inserted during
restructuring in the form of dated covenants to enable the Bank to cancel credit proceeds
if the contracts for associated activities and TMIS implementation had not met specified
implementation deadlines.

The institutional requirements for Treasury automation – and other complex IT
systems - should be in place and detailed system specifications should be agreed
before project effectiveness. Changes in the institutional arrangements and system
specifications during implementation are a source of delays and a cause of disagreements
between governments and vendors. This has important implications for the sequencing
and financing of system design work, which needs to be undertaken during project
preparation rather than project implementation. Typical project preparation budgets are
insufficient to cover these costs and so preparation financing is required, whether from
trust funds or project preparation facilities.

The expectations of vendors should be made explicit through the tender process and
during contract negotiation, in particular as regards the degree of customization
and the presence of technical staff in the field. Customization and field presence are
areas where the vendor has strong incentives to make cost savings, while the client has a
strong preference for more vendor input. Specification of these requirements up front
allows the vendors to budget appropriately in the tender process and provides a basis for
monitoring contract performance.




                                           38
Implementing agencies should retain advisers with expertise in managing large and
complex ICT systems implementation projects. It is possible that the problems in
communications and mismatched expectations could have been avoided had the initially
strong team been retained or replaced with equally effective experts. Contract
management capacity is particularly important when disputes arise. ICT projects should
retain ICT experts to provide strategic advice on integration of ICTs into the sector
specific domain and examine the domain for business architecture and business process
re-engineering needs. The resultant requirements need to be planned and executed by a
client PIU that possesses in-house expertise to prepare technical bidding documents and
ensure appropriate vendor and contract management

The expected results and impacts of ICT projects should be specified in project
documentation. Delivery of an automated system is not an end in itself. Specification of
the results and expected impacts of ICT projects helps stakeholders prioritize, informs
system design and adjustments during implementation, and allows assessment for
effectiveness and efficiency.

A realistic time frame for the design and implementation of a complex FMIS project
is seven to eight years (based upon a World Bank review of 55 closed and 32 active
FMIS projects from 1984 to 2010). Implementation time frames can be reduced by
completing FMIS and business process reengineering design work during project
preparation. However, design adjustments and resulting delays are not uncommon. A
clear understanding of the nature of IT projects at their start, their implementation
challenges and unusual back-ended disbursement profile can help reduce the frustrations
and disagreements among key stakeholders.

Complex IT projects require a significant investment in change management. Since
the technical specifications were not written by the Treasury, the key internal
stakeholders had limited understanding of the technical details developed by the
consultant and the implications for business processes. The tender documents, for
example, were hundreds of pages long and many of the terms were not properly
translated into Russian. More resources should have been devoted to assist the MoF staff
to understand the inherent changes in business processes that would result from
implementing the new system and a more comprehensive change management process
should have been incorporated into the project design to prepare and manage the change
process.

Capacity building activities should begin early, ideally during project preparation.
The procurement of ICT systems in areas such as Treasury modernization requires
substantial involvement of senior government officials, both in terms of system design
and the organization and implementation of related business process reengineering and
change management activities. It is unlikely that senior officials will have these skills,
since these systems tend to have a life expectancy of a decade or two. Consequently,
capacity has to be built for senior agency management if they are to assume the
leadership functions effectively. Where Bank procedures are to be used for the
procurement of these systems, senior management needs to be informed of the



                                           39
implications of these procedures for system design and implementation in order to
facilitate timely and informed decision making.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower highlighted many of the issues contributing to the failure of the project
discussed earlier in this report, for example, the multiple changes of key personnel, the
generality of contract requirements and failure to reflect reform progress in the contract
provisions, the communications difficulties between the Borrower and the vendor. The
Borrower also emphasizes the need for continuous and consistent support from the World
Bank and the importance of suitable team leaders. These comments reinforce the points
raised earlier about the importance of appropriate and sufficient implementation support
from the Bank to the Borrower, particularly in low capacity environments. The Borrower
provides added explanation for the difficulties encountered in linking TMIS to the NBKR
and the difficulties that the vendor had in understanding and adapting to the Borrower’s
needs. The Borrower also provides more details on the chronology of progress with
systems development, illustrating the multiple interchanges between the parties.

I. Project Management:

1. From the World Bank’s Side

Since January 01, 2013, Mr. David Nummy has been GTAC Project Manager from the
World Bank. During this time there have been regular monitoring activities (once in 3
weeks) conducted to follow the progress with the involvement of all project stakeholders.
Besides, the IT-related matters of TMIS/HRMIS components have been coordinated by
Mr. Henry Forero since April 2011.

2. From the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic

The Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic approved the Project Charter in April
2011. Based on the Charter, revisions were made in the project structure and
management. Thus, in accordance with the Project Charter the Stats Secretary of the
Ministry of Finance is the Project Director. Also, there were Working Groups/Task
Forces established under the leadership of respective deputy ministers.

Besides, through the Ordinance of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 26 July
2011, no. 299-р, the Government approved a new Regulation on the Coordination
Council for GTAC Project chaired by the Minister of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic.

3. From FreeBalance Side

Since the contract came into force the FreeBalance Company assigned Vice President,
Ms. Suan Dorion and, later, Mr. Kamran Khan to manage the project on behalf of the
company. The company opened a local office run by the country managers.

II. Treasury Management Information System and Human Resources Management
Information System (TMIS/HRMIS).


                                           54
Implementation of the contract with Free Balance Ltd. for Application software
Development (ASD) for TMIS/HRMIS included delivery and installation of the central
servers and equipment for data processing in TMIS/HRMIS (ICB-1). The contract came
into force on 28 Dec 2009. The contract amount is $2,590,063. As of 31.12.2013 under
ICB-1, the disbursement volume amounted to $388,509.15 (i.е. 15% of the total contract
amount).

The FreeBalance Ltd. delivered equipment in accordance with Section 4.0 of the
TMIS/HRMIS Project Implementation Plan: Supply and Installation of Equipment for
MSC and BCC, including delivery and installation of the central servers, data storage and
backing-up/recovery equipment and relevant software. Payment for equipment delivered
had not been made as the Buyer (Ministry of Finance) has not yet signed a
transfer/acceptance document (to be signed based on testing of the software loaded on
equipment).

1. Hiring an International Consultant (Contract Manager) to Support in TMIS
   and HRMIS Development and Introduction.

The contract with Mr. Aare Laponin was signed on 13 October 2010 for providing
support in TMIS implementation. The contract amount is $109,793.

The contract with Mr. Laponin was revised in view of including the support in HRMIS
implementation and the respective revisions were approved by the World Bank on 7 June
2011. Based on the revised contract there were new tasks and functions added to the
Terms of Reference providing for HRMIS implementation. On 10 June 2011, there was
an Addendum to the above contract with Mr. Laponin signed covering the period ending
28.12.2012.

As the World Bank did not approve extension of the contract with Mr. Laponin, the
Ministry of Finance initiated hiring another international consultant in April 2013, to
provide professional consulting services to the Ministry of Finance and the State
Personnel Service of the Kyrgyz Republic in managing the contract signed with
FreeBalance. Thus, the Ministry of Finance prepared the draft Terms of Reference for the
international consultant and sent to the World Bank for approval. Due to the project
completion, the selection of consultant was terminated on 09.12.2013.

2. The Project Extension and TMIS/HRMIS Project Implementation Plan.

The contract with Free Balance Ltd. was extended 3 times:

   •   On 31.12.2010 a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) no. 1 was signed
       approving the updated Project Schedule and Deviations List. MOU also set the
       new completion date - 30.06.2012. The reason for extension is the lack of Budget
       Module and module for accounting at budget-funded institutions in the system
       design.



                                           55
   •   Due to delays in implementation and introduction of Budget Module Software of
       TMIS/HRMIS, a decision was made at the Meeting of the Coordination Council
       chaired by the Ministry of Finance on 09.02.2012 on adopting a new MOU and
       revised schedule. On 08.07.2012 a new MOU no.2 was signed with the new
       Project Schedule and Deviations List. There was also the new project completion
       date set for 28.12.2012. The reason for extension is the poor quality of TMIS and
       failure to submit a report on Budget Module by FreeBalance.
    • Given the end of GTAC Project period the Ministry of Finance initiated holding a
      meeting of the Coordination Council which took place on 12 December 2012. The
      decision was made on this meeting to extend GTAC Project for 2013 and
      complete already launched activities by FreeBalance to introduce TMIS/HRMIS.
      The final project completion date is 31 December 2013. On 31.12.2012 the World
      Bank extended GTAC Project till 31 December 2013. However, a decision was
      made this time to sign an Addendum no. 1 to the Contract through which
      revisions would be made in the contract terms. On 01.02.2013 the Ministry of
      Finance and FreeBalance agreed on the updated Project Schedule with the World
      Bank’s participation which was proposed to be adopted when signing Addendum
      1. The reason is in the incorrect banking interface that FreeBalance had been
      providing and in more time that would be needed to complete the work in
      accordance with the requirements of the Central Treasury of the Ministry of
      Finance. Activities on Budget Module, TMIS, HRMIS implementation were
      implemented in accordance with the Work Schedule agreed by the Parties on
      1.02.2013.

Given the failure to timely complete activities on TMIS/HRMIS implementation, there
was a decision made on 27.11.13 at the Coordination Meeting to terminate the contract
with FreeBalance effective 31.12.2013.

2.1. Budget Module Designing Process:

The revised report on SRS for designing the Budget Module of version 1.3 was submitted
on 27.03.2013 by FreeBalance. The report was finalized based on discussions at the
seminar on 5-7 March 2013 and comments/additions from the Main Department for
Budget Forecasting of the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic were forwarded to
FreeBalance on 18.03.2013. In April – June 2013 FreeBalance submitted two versions of
the Supplementary Report on SRS to designing of the budget module based on the
comments from the Ministry of Finance. According to FreeBalance, the Supplementary
Report on SRS to designing of the budget module would be submitted in early July 2013
based on the recent comments from the Ministry of Finance dated 7 June 2013. The
available comments of the Ministry of Finance were taken into account in the final
version of the report approved by the project director on 26.07.2013. Since then, no
activities were conducted by FreeBalance on the Budget Module. On 30.09.2013 Vice
President of FreeBalance, Mr. Kamran Khan, informed that in December 2013, there
would be a demonstration of Budget Module held. Meanwhile, FreeBalance plans to
work on Budget Module only in 2014. According to FreeBalance, they planned to have a



                                          56
demonstration of Budget module in December 2013. These activities were never
conducted during the period ending 31.12.2013.

The timeframe set by the updated Project Schedule dated 01.02.2013 was not followed.

2.2. Designing of TMIS:

In spite of the continued joint activities, there were delays from FreeBalance’s side in
following the Work Schedule. In order to solve the arising issues FreeBalance meets with
the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance.

It should be noted that according to the decision of the Coordination Council Meeting on
12 December 2012, the Parties were to prepare a draft MOU to reflect the interaction
between the InfoSystem State Enterprise under the Ministry of Finance with FreeBalance
in TMIS application software implementation and introduction. To implement the given
decision of the Coordination Council it was recommended to GTAC PIG to consider the
need and feasibility of preparing this MOU and in February 2013 a meeting was held
between the Ministry of Finance, FreeBalance, InfoSystem State Enterprise under the
Ministry of Finance, which did not result in any agreements on potential cooperation.

Since granting GTAC Project an extension for 2013, the Central Treasury of the Ministry
of Finance together with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic conduct activities on
testing the interface with the interbank pay system for direct participation of the Central
Treasury in the given pay system.

TMIS Status: Report

In September 2013, 2 reports were submitted on TMIS marking the completion of the
designing stage:

       •   Supplementary report on “TMIS System Requirements Analysis” (SRA or
           SRS – system requirements specifications), with a detailed description of
           future TMIS system design with functioning of the Unified Treasury Account
           and use of the new Unified Chart of Accounts.
       •   Report on “Functional Compatibility Analysis” (FCA), with a detailed
           description of technical solutions to ensure direct interaction of TMIS with
           interbank pay system (Gross System of Settlements in Real-time Mode and
           Package Clearing System), and interaction of TMIS with information systems
           of the Tax and Customs services of the Kyrgyz Republic. The National Bank
           of the Kyrgyz Republic provided any kind of assistance in this process, the
           clarifications/explanations were provided to FreeBalance specialists on
           formulation of program codes for banking interface and typical test scenarios
           were offered. Also, there were 3 reports signed on TMIS, submitted by the
           Supplier:




                                            57
       •   “TMIS Training Plan” describing the strategy and methodology for training of
           all categories of TMIS users.
       •   “Information Protection and Electronic Digital Signature Application”
           describing the key measures on information protection and use of the
           electronic digital signature in TMIS.
       •   The report on “Data Architecture and Hierarchy” showing the architecture of
           the TMIS software (application software) platform with description of data
           categories.

It should be noted that approval of the above reports by the Ministry of Finance was
given without the expert opinion of the contract manager A. Lapynin, because of having
no approval from the World Bank for a contract extension with him.

In communications with FreeBalance, the Ministry of Finance has been expressing the
commitment in successful implementation of TMIS/HRMIS indicating the delays in
Work Schedule, i.e. not completed activities on system design reports within the given
timeframe, failure to conduct testing etc. The Ministry of Finance had concerns on failing
to conduct the planned testing.

In spite of the above, the parties have been conducting joint activities on achieving the
project goals to introduce TMIS/HRMIS and continuing the work on finalizing the
system design reports.

In order to finalize and approve two major reports: “Supplementary Report on SRS to
designing TMIS application software system of 4.1 version” and “Supplementary Report
on SRS to TMIS of 6.0 Version”, FreeBalance and the Central Treasury of the Ministry
of Finance together with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, State Tax Service,
State Customs Service conducted joint events in April-June 2013 to determine the
functionality of current accounts mode and development of interface with the interbank
pay system to ensure direct participation of the Central Treasury in this pay system, and
also interfaces with the information systems of the State Tax Service and the State
Customs Service. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic provided various types of
support in this process, the clarifications/explanations were provided to FreeBalance
specialists on formulation of program codes for banking interface and typical test
scenarios were offered.

As a result of joint activities by the Central Treasury and FreeBalance specialists the
Supplementary Report on SRS to designing TMIS application software was thoroughly
finalized, particularly, the subsection on description of TMIS interfaces with external
system. This subsection of the report was finalized in accordance with the requirements
of the Protocol of Interaction between the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic
and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 23.10.2012 on the banking interface,
and also the proposals from Sinam Company – developer of the State Tax Service
Information System.




                                           58
On 17 May 2013, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic sent comments by the
Central Treasury and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic on functional
compatibility analysis for FreeBalance’s review and finalization of the report. Ministry of
Finance also sent the Terms of Reference on "Automated System of the Main Book of the
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic", approved by the Central Treasury of the
Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 27.05.2013 to
finalize the Supplementary SRS Report.

In the process of discussing the above reports, the parties have agreed on simultaneous
approval of these reports as they were interrelated. As a result, the Supplementary Report
on SRS to System Design of TMIS was approved on 26.07.2013, while the report on
analysis of the functional compatibility (IDS) was approved on 30.08.2013.

TMIS: Comprehensive Testing and Banking Interface Testing

After the approval of the Supplementary Report, FreeBalance has been conducting
acceptance testing of TMIS modules in September, except for the interface of the
National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, as this system, according to the Supplier was
planned to be provided in November 2013. Based on the tests conducted, it should be
noted that they were of ad hoc character, rather than comprehensive, as stipulated in the
contract (Section 2.7.2.2.7). In tests conducted it was not possible to follow the full chain
of money flows in TMIS. Besides, because the banking interface was not ready, the
testing of it was not conducted (Free Balance promised to conduct testing of banking
interface in November 2013). Individual modules of TMIS were also missing with
reference to the lack of the banking interface (e.g., revenues modules, the Main Book,
Budget Reporting Module). Based on the testing conducted, the comments were sent to
FreeBalance with a request to revise the application software.

TMIS: Training

In spite of the above, to ensure the progress, the Ministry of Finance decided to shift to
the next project stages – training stage and TMIS piloting stage. FreeBalance submitted
the methodology, plan and schedule of testing, which were approved by the Ministry of
Finance on 01.10.2013. During the period of October 3-18, FreeBalance has been
conducting training of the treasury specialists (the total of 9 days on individual modules
of TMIS), which further would become trainers on TMIS application software.

TMIS: Pilot Testing

TMIS Pilot Testing was pledged by the Supplier to take place after 10.10.2013. TMIS
Pilot Testing (contract term 2.7.2.4) according to the Schedule would start in April 2013,
yet these tests were postponed till October 2013. On 11-12 October 2013, Free Balance
specialists together with the Central Treasury and InfoSystem State Enterprise have
visited the pilot regional treasury units (Leninskoye and Chuyskoye regional treasury
units) to start testing, where the assignments were given to prepare initial data entry. On




                                             59
12 October 2013, all requested data was prepared and sent by FreeBalance to budget-
funded enterprises (listed in the National Budget of the Kyrgyz Republic).

Since then, no other activities on pilot testing were conducted on TMIS application
software, i.e. pilot testing has not started yet. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly
communicated this issue to Free Balance and on 4 November 2013, the company
requested filling out additional tables on entry data for pilot units. As of today, the
regional treasury units have filled out the tables, yet the pilot testing has not been started.
Meanwhile, Free Balance informed that the tests will lack the module for local budget
implementation. In accordance with the contract terms (2.2.2.9.1), the local budget
implementation module should be part of this stage. This was communicated to Mr.
Nummy during the meeting on 26.11.2013 at the World Bank Office.

Activities on pilot testing were not completed by the Supplier, as well as the works on
interface with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic.

TMIS: Accounting Module

FreeBalance submitted a report on the system design phase for the accounting module.
On 13 June 2011, the Department for Financial Reporting and Internal Audit
Methodology communicated to FreeBalance that they had no comments to the report
submitted and sent a request to share information on operations for accounting of funds in
the cashier’s office of a budget-funded entity; operations for accounting of reporting
entities, on banking transactions, on maintenance of the Main Book at each budget-
funded organization. Besides, the specialists have conducted a thorough expert appraisal
of reports submitted by FreeBalance, particularly for the financial reporting and
accounting modules. Afterwards, the comments and suggestions were sent to
FreeBalance. Also, the Department for Financial Reporting and Internal Audit
Methodology of the Ministry of Finance sent an official request to FreeBalance to share
additional information on accounting module meeting the technical specifications of IBS.

2.3 HRMIS Designing:

The joint work of FreeBalance, State Personnel Service and GTAC on HRMIS
implementation has been conducted in accordance with the revised Schedule of
remaining activities for 2013. There were some deviations from the schedule, yet, overall,
there was a certain progress in some of the activities under HRMIS implementation.
Loading of master files into the system for 32 state bodies out of 36 is complete. Loading
of terminology was conducted (however, the loaded terminology did not meet the
requests of module managers: terms were not translated from English, it was not possible
to determine the meaning and format of information being entered) and mass calculation
of the salaries for all loaded state bodies (the state bodies have noted mistakes in
calculation of base salary rates; recalculation of salaries was not conducted because the
module was not ready).

   •   FreeBalance provided electronic carriers of HRMIS application software and
       package list of licenses on 10.02.2013. The transfer & acceptance protocol was


                                              60
       signed by the State Personnel Service and approved by GTAC Project Director on
       12.03.2013.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Plan and Methodology for Testing the HRMIS
       Interface for review and approval on 15.02.2013. The Plan and Methodology was
       signed by the State Personnel Service approved by GTAC Project Director on
       19.02.2013.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Schedule of the Second Cycle of Comprehensive
       Testing dated 15.02.2013, which was then signed by the State Personnel Service
       and approved by GTAC Project Director on 19.02.2013.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Preliminary Testing Report on HRMIS Interfaces
       dated 15.02.2013 (company’s internal testing report) for acceptance testing in
       accordance with the Schedule of HRMIS Implementation, para. 3.2: “Interfaces of
       HRMIS with the webportal and software for testing the State Personnel Service”.
       The State Personnel Service communicated on 05.04.2013 that had no comments
       or suggestions on this document.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Training Plan for TMIS/HRMIS, version 1.2 dated
       20.02.2013 which, because of no comments from the State Personnel Service, was
       approved on 04.03.2013. The partial training on this plan was conducted in
       October 2013 (some of the modules were presented for the first time, i.e.
       “Assessment/Attestation” Module. It should be noted that training was done on
       user level).
   •   The second cycle of Comprehensive Testing of HRMIS modules based on the
       schedule approved by the deputy director of the State Personnel Service/head of
       the working group on HRMIS dated 19.02.2013. Testing cycles, both the first and
       the second one were of ad hoc mode. The proposed testing scenarios did not cover
       the functional requirements. As of 01.04.2013 the report on the second cycle of
       comprehensive testing of HRMIS modules has not been submitted by
       FreeBalance.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Supplementary Report on HRMIS implementation,
       version 4.2 dated 05.03.2013, for approval by GTAC Project Director. The report
       was reviewed by the State Personnel Service and comments were communicated
       to FreeBalance. FreeBalance addressed the above comments and the State
       Personnel Service approved, while the Ministry of Finance confirmed the
       Supplementary Report on HRMIS implementation, version 4.2 on 6 Mary 2013.
   •   FreeBalance submitted the Methodology and Testing Schedule of HRMIS Users’
       Accounts dated 22.03.2013, which was approved after receiving no comments
       from the State Personnel Service on 02.04.2013. However, the HRMIS users’
       report, in accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic was not
       submitted for testing until end-2013.

Besides, to expedite activities related to HRMIS implementation on 28.03.2013 there was
a discussion held of unresolved issues and a decision made to finalize the work based on



                                          61
mistakes found. However, the mistakes were not eliminated by the time of the next
training in October 2013.

There were regular meetings held to discuss issues related to HRMIS implementation
with the participation of stakeholders (Ministry of Finance, GTAC PIG, the State
Personnel Service and FreeBalance: on Income Declaration, HR Expenditure Accounting
and Salary Calculation, data entry on 8 state bodies, terminology issues related to all
modules etc.)

Supplementary Report on SRS to HRMIS, version 4.2, was submitted by FreeBalance. It
was approved on 06.05.2013 by GTAC Project Director, i.е. the Ministry of Finance.

On 12 June 2013 GTAC PIG sent the information to Vice President of FreeBalance, Mr.
Kamran Khan on the current situation and introduction of HRMIS as of 12.06.2013. On
20 June, 2013, FreeBalance submitted the information “On Updating the Current
Activities on HRMIS”, with the milestones indicated to address earlier found comments
and on overall progress in HRMIS implementation.

The works on HRMIS on users' accounts development were not completed. Therefore,
FreeBalance did not submit results of users’ accounts testing. The mistakes reflected in
the Journal to Register Mistakes were not fully eliminated. No training was conducted for
the system administrators, although the administrator resource was submitted for a review
in the report on application software development. In particular, the training did not cover
the documentation processes, generation of new types of reports etc. Later, with
agreements reached during Mr. Kamran Khan’s visit to Bishkek on 23-30 September
2013, training of users was conducted on 8-18 October 2013), administration issues were
not considered.

The full functionality of the system was not implemented. Due to the delays in the
implementation, and as a result of FreeBalance’s request, there were priority tasks
identified, which also were not implemented.

During the implementation process, no logical sequence of actions was observed. For
example, training of trainers and users had been conducted before the system was
finalized, i.e. the system faced significant changes after the training in 2012.

The standard software application of the company was never adapted to requirements of
the business processes of the Kyrgyz Republic.

The Report on HRMIS Configuration submitted by FreeBalance on 11.09.2013, the
Report on Completion of HRMIS Testing, the Report on the Second Cycle of the Users’
Acceptance Testing of HRMIS were not approved by the State Personnel Service because
of a number of comments. The listed reports were returned to the Supplier for finalization.

As a result, HRMIS system, as of 2013, had significant flaws and did not ensure proper
processing and formulation of exit information.

3. Activities to Implement ICB-2 Contract
Implementation of the Contract for Delivery and Installation of Computer, Network
Equipment and Engineering Systems (ICB-2) with ALSI (Kazakhstan) that came into
force on 9 March 2010. The contract amount is $3,517,426.43. As of 30.12.11, under
ICB-2 the disbursements amounted to $2,603,247.31. This includes an advanced payment,
payment for system design, payment for equipment and software delivery under Phase I
(Installation and Commencement at DPC and RDPC), and payment for training of
technical specialists and system administrators of InfoSystem State Enterprise in charge
of supporting the TMIS/HRMIS systems and payment for equipment and software
delivery under Phase 2 (Delivery and installation of equipment, installation of SCS at
regional units of the Treasury and territorial representative offices of the State Personnel
Service).

Over this period, ALSI conducted reconstruction of RDPC and partial works at DPC.
Also, ALSI completed Phase 1 of the contract on delivery of equipment for DPC, RDPC,
telecommunications equipment and computers. Testing of systems supplied under Phase
1 is complete.

Under Phase 2 of the contract, ALSI completed delivery and tuning of the computer and
telecommunications equipment and establishment of cable networks at 59 regional units
of the Central Treasury and 3 branch offices of the State Personnel Service. ALSI
completed works under the contract and submitted three reports for review and approval
by the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. These reports on Testing of the
Introduced Systems in the Field under the second stage of General Type Hardware and
Software Provision and on Testing with the Full Loaded System, and also the final report
on the System Roll-Out were agreed with the working group on ICT and heads of
TMIS/HRMIS component, and approved by the TMIS/HRMIS project director. Based on
the contract terms, after approval of the report on Testing, the introduced systems in the
field under the second stage of General Type Hardware and Software Provision, a
payment of $210,693.84 was made; after approval of the report Testing with the Full
Loaded System, a payment of $351,742.64 was made. Also, upon approval of the final
report on the System Roll-Out, a payment of $351,742.64 was made to ALSI Company.
The contract was completed and the guarantee period has started.

III. Supplementary Reforms in Public Finance Management:

1. Development of a Unified Chart of Accounts (UCA)

To assist the Ministry of Finance in UCA development, contracts were awarded to Mr. V.
Redburn, the international consultants under GTAC (the contract amount is $100,000)
and 2 local consultants (А. Аlapaev, Е. Tsoi) (the contract amount is $8,000). In response
to a request from the Central Treasury and upon approval from the World Bank, contracts
with the local consultants were extended by additional 6 months. The total contract
amount is $12,000. The unified chart of accounts was fully developed. The draft Manual


                                            63
on its use was prepared. The local consultants presented UPS to the chief accountants of
leading ministries and agencies.

Given the significant volume of work for the local consultants, the Ministry of Finance
initiated an extension of contracts with the local consultants by additional 4 months (from
September till December 2012). Because of a late request from the Ministry of Finance,
i.e. the letter was sent to PIG GTAC after the contract completion date (following 10
days after the completion date), the World Bank rejected the extension. Thus, through the
initiative of the Central Treasury a new tender was announced to select local consultants
based on the open competitive bid. As a result of summing-up the scorecards and
interviews with bidders, А. Аlapaev and Е. Tsoi were selected. The contract amount is
$12,000.

2. Transition to UCA and Connecting the Central Treasury to the Package
   Clearing System

In the process of TMIS application software development, FreeBalance faced difficulties
in understanding the structure of interbank pay systems (Gross System of Settlements in
Real-time Mode and Package Clearing System) of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic. In accordance with the final official report on TMIS functionality by
FreeBalance dated 9 March 2012, «…The Central Treasury is becoming a direct
participant of SRS in PCS of the National Bank and will use both systems according to
the regulation of the National Bank». However, when specialists of the Central Treasury
and FreeBalance moved from the reporting phase to practical actions, i.е. preparation of
commissioning testing, including the interface with the National Bank, FreeBalance
proposed a totally different principle of building interface with the National Bank. To
obtain the model of UCA functioning, provided in the contract between the Ministry of
Finance and FreeBalance, in August-October 2012, there were videoconferences and
series of meetings conducted with participation of the World Bank’s leading experts,
engaged in the project for treasury modernization since the very beginning of the project,
and also with participation of the regional representative of the Department for Budgeting
Issues of the International Monetary Fund, Mr. D. Zohrab. Based on the meetings of
FreeBalance there was a rigid clarification given on the need to develop and introduce
TMIS interface and application software in accordance with the requirements of the
Central Treasury and regulated standards of the National Bank.

Procedures for interaction of the Central Treasury with Interbank Pay Systems (Gross
System of Settlements in Real-time Mode and Package Clearing System) of the National
Bank and step-by-step business processes in the treasury system with UCA functioning,
including functions of the financial control an information security were jointly worked
out by both parties and reflected in the Protocol of Interaction between the Ministry of
Finance, in person of Minister Olga Lavrova and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic in person of Chairperson Zina Asankojoeva, signed on 23.10.2012.

3. Development and Promotion of Normative Legal Acts of the Kyrgyz Republic
   Providing for Improvement of the Public Finance System Functioning to



                                            64
   Implement the State Budget through Introduction and Use of TMIS/HRMIS
   Integrated Systems.

In order to implement the above activities, 2 local consultants were hired under GTAC
Project, to develop functionalities and provide legal support. The contract with the
Functional Specialist (J. Kadyrova) was signed on 19.08.2011 and its amount was $6,000.
The contract with Legal Consultant was signed on 13 September 2011. In response to the
request of the Ministry of Finance and approval from the World Bank, contracts with the
above consultants were extended by 2 more months.

4. Introduction of the Unified System of Accounting with Use of UCA and
   Development of Reporting in accordance with СООС of the Ministry of Finance

In the context of reforms being conducted to improve the public finance management
system, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic, in accordance with the Decree
of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic dated 22 October 2009 no. 396, plans to shift to
the international standards of financial reporting for the public sector (IFRSPS). IFRSPS
will be initially launched on cash basis with further transfer to accrual basis. In this
regards, the Central Treasury initiated hiring an international consultant. The terms of
reference were prepared by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the World Bank.
Following the review of CVs submitted, the best candidate meeting criteria was selected.
Given that financing from GTAC of this consultant is over, the further financing will be
supported from the trust fund.

IV. Other Activities Financed under GTAC Project

1. Matters Related to Network Infrastructure of TMIS/HRMIS

1.1. To implement TMIS/HRMIS, there was an agreement signed between the Ministry
of Finance and KyrgyzTelecom Joint-Stock Company on provision of communication
services to the Ministry of Finance (connection through VPNL2 channel) for
FreeBalance Software with throughout capacity above 128 Kb/s. Today, these lines are
being used by the Central Treasury for the current automated system called
“IS:Kazna.Budget”. At present, the Ministry of Finance is conducting works on
connecting regional treasury units to VPNL2 channels and to territorial financial units;
this measure will enable increasing the speed of throughout capacity on these channels
significantly.

1.2. Prior to the start of TMIS/HRMIS Project implementation, the World Bank set a
number of preliminary conditions for the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic related to
establishment of information and telecommunication infrastructure.

These conditions were fully met by the Government, i.e. the InfoSystem State Enterprise
was established, the Data Processing Center and the Reserve Data Processing Center
were reconstructed (prepared), and the fiber-optic lines of communication (FOCL)




                                           65
between KyrgyzTelecom Joint-Stock Company, the Central Treasury of the Ministry of
Finance, State Personnel Service, DPC, and RDPC were laid.

For laying the above FOCL the Ministry of Finance has signed contracts with
KyrgyzTelecom Joint-Stock Company and Aknet ltd. for the total amount of KGS
1,424,293, financed from the state budget.

2. Activities Being Implemented and Planned under the “Civil Service Efficiency
Improvement” Component

2.1. Training of the civil servants. Budget - $98,157.37.

2.1.1. Develop capacity of the civil servants and the State Personnel Service of the
Kyrgyz Republic (conduct conferences, seminars, and study tours). The funds remained
unused.

2.2 Consulting Services

2.2.1. Develop and implement the Training Program for Stats Secretaries of
Government Agencies. Budget – $33,188.90. Funds remained unused.

2.2.2. Hire local consultants to develop drafts of normative legal acts and methodic
instructions to implement the Concept of Modernized Civil Service of the Kyrgyz
Republic. Budget – $73,600.

The draft terms of reference were developed by the State Personnel Service and approved
by the World Bank. Besides, there was recruitment of the relevant consultant announced
and CVs collected. Yet, since no candidate met the qualification criteria and given the
end of GTAC project, this selection was terminated. Funds remained unused.

2.2.3 Hire an IT Consultant to Assist in Implementation of the Information System
Component. Budget – $8,000.

All procedures on hiring a consultant were conducted in accordance with the World Bank
requirements. The approval was received. Contract no. CS-GTAC/INDV-32/2013 was
signed between the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic being the Executing
Agency for GTAC Project and Mr. Kalybekov on 05.04.2013.

2.3 Goods and Commodities

2.3.1 Procurement of computer and office equipment for the State Personnel Service.
Budget: $144,500.

The announcement on re-tender was published on 31 August 2012. Bids were opened on
12 October at the Ministry of Finance. The technical and financial evaluation processes
were suspended for the period of conducting negotiations between the Government of the



                                           66
Kyrgyz Republic and the World Bank on GTAC Extension until end-2013. Following the
decision on the project extension, bid evaluation process resumed.

The tender committee conducted the following procedures of technical and financial
evaluation in accordance with the World Bank requirements: evaluation report on
procurement of the computer and software for the State Personnel Service was sent to the
World Bank for approval on 22.02.2013. The World Bank had comments of technical
character related to some of the equipment types dated 20.03.2013. The comments were
reviewed by the procurement specialist and experts. The information was sent to the
World Bank on 29.03.2013. Approval from the World Bank was received in April 2013.
Contracts were signed between the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic and
Logic Company (Lot 1,3, Contract dated April 2013) and Atexis Company (Lot 2,
Contract dated 3 May 2013) for delivery of computer and telecommunication equipment
for the State Personnel Service under GTAC Project where all activities were completed
and contract amounts fully disbursed.

3. Other activities

3.1. Under the GTAC Project there was office furniture procured for the Central Treasury
(chairs).

3.2. Under the GTAC Project office equipment and computers were procured for the
Central Treasury staff.

3.3. Under the GTAC Project office equipment and computers were procured for the
subordinate units of the State Personnel Service.

Findings

In spite of the long implementation period of the GTAC Project, the Project did not
achieve its primary goal: implementation of a modern information system for accounting
of public funds and human resources based on the international standards failed.

In light of the situation developed, we consider the following potential reasons.
     • Frequent changes in the project management and of project participants: since the
        date of signing the contract with FreeBalance for implementation of
        TMIS\HRMIS (2010) there were the following changes observed: project heads
        from the World Bank’s side - 4, Ministers of Finance - 6, Project Directors – 4,
        vice presidents of FreeBalance – 3, country managers – 4. In spite of this, changes
        in management had a minor impact on the project implementation progress, as
        every manager tried to make every effort for successful implementation.
   •   High level of aggregation and generality of contract requirements which allowed
       different understanding by each of the parties. It should be noted that the contract
       was signed in 2009 based on specifications developed in 2005. When signing the
       contract, the changes in the pay system of the Kyrgyz Republic and objectives of
       the Ministry of Finance to shift to international accounting and reporting


                                            67
       standards were not taken into account. All of these aspects were reflected in the
       contract, yet in a generalized manner. Therefore, clarifications in the design of the
       future system took a long time.
   •   Systematic failure to fulfill the requirements by the Supplier of TMIS/HRMIS
       application software. This resulted in extending the project 3 times. Moreover,
       the last Work Schedule was also not fulfilled within the given timeframe
       (Attachment 1 gives detailed monitoring information as of 25.12. 2013).
   •   Lack of qualified functional and technical specialists from FreeBalance. In order
       to timely resolve the issue, the Ministry of Finance repeatedly communicated to
       FreeBalance a request to mobilize highly qualified experts on the functionality of
       TMIS, Budget Module and a Specialist on interfaces for the entire period of
       project implementation. However, specialists have been coming for 1 to 2 weeks,
       attending 2-3 meetings and going back. In 2-3 months new specialists would be
       coming with the same questions as their predecessors. There is no consistency of
       operations. A more permanent presence has been ensured by managers, yet they
       were more focused on addressing the conflicting issues related to contract terms.
       Staff of the local office are not fully aware of the possibilities and products of the
       mother company.
   •   When conflicts would arise related to contract terms, it took a long time to finally
       agree on some of them. For example, the language issue took 2 to 3 months
       (because different sections of the contract stipulated different terms), UCA
       discussion took more than 8 months, and discussion of the UCS functioning
       principle took more than 4 months. While the Ministry of Finance was the Client
       of the System, it had to prove to FreeBalance the properness and correctness of its
       requests, compliance with the international accounting and reporting standards,
       and information safety requirements. For that, the Ministry of Finance of the
       Kyrgyz Republic appealed to the International Monetary Fund and the World
       Bank, thus the relevant consultants supported the decision of the Ministry of
       Finance and, only after that, FreeBalance would commence the next stages of
       project activities.
   •   The needed level of support from InfoSystem State Enterprise under the Ministry
       of Finance to FreeBalance was not achieved in implementation and introduction
       of TMIS/HRMIS application software.
    • The psychological tiredness of staff of the Ministry of Finance from receiving
      reports by FreeBalance with no practical results (e.g., in a form of separate
      modules demonstration). Practically, all of the reports submitted by FreeBalance
      had to be revised many times and it took a long time always, some of the reports
      were approved after the 14th or 15th submission.

The methodological and consultative support from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in addressing the aforementioned issues related to understanding of the
contract terms should be particularly noted. The relevant experts were engaged by the
World Bank and IMF which helped to correctly determine the project objectives in
accordance with its goals and in compliance with the international standards and


                                            68
requirements. However, we think it would be more efficient if the experts would be
engaged on permanent basis and closely cooperate with the project, i.e. not only when
problems would arise, but when moving from one stage to another in view of identifying
the similar difficulties and working more closely with the executing parties in charge of
each component.


We’d like to emphasize the continuous monitoring and support from the World Bank
Project Team Leaders. With the appointment of a new Project Team Leader, Mr. David
Nummy, there has been regular monitoring of the project progress conducted (once in 3
weeks) through video conferences, where each party could express the thoughts and a
unanimous decision would be made and further reflected in the minutes. We think the
same practice should have been adopted from the very start of the project.

We also would like to emphasize the following positive aspects in GTAC Project
implementation:

1. Technical infrastructure for the automated treasury system functioning was
developed:
   • Reconstruction and refurbishment of the server centers for the Main and Reserve
       Data Processing Center;
   • Equipment delivered for the central part of TMIS/HRMIS system, 22 servers, data
       storage systems and management and monitoring systems in total;
   • Equipment and software delivered and main & local networks installed at the
       regional units of the Treasury of the Ministry of Finance;
   • Computers of the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance and its regional
       units were renewed;
   • Training has been conducted on information technologies.

2. The Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic developed the normative-legal
base for the improved treasury system:
    • In accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
       no.597 dated 30 August 2012, there was a Temporary Instruction on Functioning
       of the Unified Treasury Account approved for the Central Treasury of the
       Ministry of Finance;
    • The Unified Chart of Accounts (UCA) and the Manual on UCA Use were
       developed and approved by the Order of the Ministry of Finance no.177-П dated
       04 September 2012 in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the
       Kyrgyz Republic “On Delegation of Authorities to the Ministry of Finance of the
       Kyrgyz Republic to Approve the Unified Chart of Accounts and the Manual on Its
       Use by the Public Administration Sector” no. 605 dated 04 September 2012.
    • Based on the recommendation of the World Bank, the Protocol of Interaction
       between the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic and the National Bank of
       the Kyrgyz Republic on Functioning of the Unified Treasury Account of the
       Central Treasury of the Ministry of Finance was approved by both parties on
       23.10.2012.
