Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This is the last ISR for the GTAC project, now in its 11th year and closing on December 31, 2013. Originally designed to provide support for reforms
 under a Development Policy Operation (DPO), the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit (GSAC), the project had two substantive components and
 a project management component. Activities under the first component, Technical Assistance to Support Reforms Under GSAC, largely ended by the
 fifth year of the project. The second component, Treasury Modernization, was intended to finance increased automation of key elements of financial
 management, treasury operations and payroll and personnel management. Automation of budget preparation also became a third element of
 automation. These three automation elements collectively were to be part of the implementation of a Financial Management Information System
 (FMIS). The first component of the program supported a variety of human resource management, and administrative reforms as well as reforms to
 increase transparency in the use of public funds. A significant emphasis was on professionalizing management of the civil service and increasing the
 meritocratic elements of the public sector workforce. Accomplishments include support to the establishment of a civil service agency, the State
 Personnel Service (SPS), an increase in the placement of senior officials based on competitive merit-based processes, and financial disclosure of
 senior public officials. This component has yielded outcomes that have proved to be sustainable since project support ended. The core of the second
 component was the acquisition and implementation of the FMIS referenced above. This component proved to be problematic from its origins as
 evidenced by the fact that a tender for acquisition of the system did not occur until four years into the project. The first tender was canceled due to the
 fact that prices offered by acceptable bidders exceeded the budget, a re-tender occurred and a contract was not signed until almost six years after the
 project started, well after the originally scheduled closing date. Post contract implementation of the system proved to be equally troubled. Significant
 disagreements between the Government and its FMIS vendor about required functionality of the three components resulted in lengthy delays and
 changes in leadership on both sides occurred since contract signing. On the Government side, there were multiple changes in the position of Project
 Director, the key position of Director of the Treasury, and changes in the position of Minister. On the vendor side, there were multiple changes in
 project management staff with frequent turnover in local staff and key project management, developer, and senior management positions.           In the
 beginning of 2013, a detailed action plan was developed and agreed by both the Government and its vendor outlining necessary steps for full
 implementation. Despite an improved focus by all parties on making progress on the plan, slippage occurred and key events did not take place as the
 project closing date approached. The Government notified the Bank on December 16 that it had elected to cancel the credit amount of the project that
 has not been disbursed, approximately $2.5 million and the Bank agreed to this request. Accordingly, the amount of funding allocated to the treasury
 modernization component was reduced by more than 50%.
