      the quality of life of the rural poor. The project has the\n            following components: (1) Rural Water Infrastructure -\n            comprising integrated development and water resources\n            management, including catchment management and other water\n            conservation practices; investments for the rational use of\n            water for agriculture, livestock and human consumption\n            including small dams, dugouts, boreholes, hand-dug wells,\n            streamflow diversion and pumping to support small-scale\n            irrigation in the dry season; and rainfall conservation and\n            management for more effective use in rainfed crop\n            production. (2) Rural Transport Infrastructure - selectively\n            rehabilitating and improving degraded feeder roads;\n            developing village trails and tracks linking farms to\n            villages to permit the use of simple wheeled vehicles to\n            reduce the need for women and children to head carry\n            weights; and a pilot program to develop intermediate means\n            for the rural poor to convey goods to market. (3) Rural\n            Post-Harvest Infrastructure - developing on-farm and\n            village-level drying facilities to reduce post-harvest\n            losses; on-farm and community storage and other\n            village-level market infrastructure for more efficient\n            marketing; appropriate facilities for processing crops,\n            livestock and fisheries products to increase their quality\n            shelflife and market value; and income-generating activities\n            targeted at the poorest. (4) Institutional Strengthening -\n            capacity building within district assemblies to strengthen\n            their planning and financial management of rural\n            infrastructure; strengthening NGOs and other community-based\n            organizations to provide more effective implementation\n            support to communities and groups in developing sustainable\n            rural infrastructure; and empowering beneficiary\n            associations and groups to take direct responsibility for\n            the sustainable operations and maintenance of rural infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1997-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
