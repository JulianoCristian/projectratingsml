This environmental\n            assessment identifies potential environmental concerns and\n            provides appropriate environmental guidelines for mitigation\n            measures. In the water project subcomponents, contamination\n            of surface and ground waters can be mitigated by conducting\n            regular quality analyses.  Lined canals or pipes can be used\n            to prevent disease vectors and seepage.  Ground water\n            depletion can be reduced by ensuring that abstraction rates\n            are consistent with natural aquifer recharge.  Reducing\n            farming activities upstream can reduce sedimentation and\n            discourage aquatic weed growth.  Salinisation may be\n            controlled by leaching of salts through periodic flushing or\n            soils.  In terms of rural transport infrastructure, road\n            surface should be sealed with bitumen to avoid erosion.\n            Frequent watering can reduce dust impacts.  Appropriate\n            culverts and drifts can be used to eliminate flooding.  Axle\n            loads of trucks should be regulated to avoid depressions and\n            ponding.  As for the rural post-harvest infrastructure, some\n            of the solid waste generated by processing equipment could\n            be recycled.  Liquid waste should be analyzed to determined\n            possible uses. The use of mud silos provides protection to\n            dry crops and prevents bush fires."}, "docdt": "1996-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
