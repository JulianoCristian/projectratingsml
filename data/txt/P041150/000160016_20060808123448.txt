I     IEG Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                I
 About this Report
      The Independent EvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
 ensurethe integrity of the Banks self-evaluationprocessandto verify.that the Bank'swork is producingthe expected
 results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough the disseminationof lessons
 drawnfrom experience. As part of this work, IEG annuallyassesses about 25 percentof the Banks lending operations.In
 selecting operations for assessment,preferenceis given to thosethat are innovative, large,or complex;those that are
 relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank managementhave
 requested assessments;andthose that are likelyto generateimportantlessons.The projects,topics, andanalytical
 approachesselected for assessmentsupport largerevaluationstudies.
      A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletionReport
 (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conductedby IEG.To prepare PPARs, IEGstaff
 examine project files and other documents, interview operationalstaff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
 onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the
 information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interestto broader IEG studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent to the
 borrowerfor review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
 Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.

 About the IEG Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suitedto the broad range of the World Bank'swork. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adaptto lending instrument,project design, or sectoral
 approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic methodto arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definition
 and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is availableon the IEGwebsite:
 http://worldbank.org/oedleta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
 development priorities andwith current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategies and corporate goals
 (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies,Sector Strategy Papers, Operational
 Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 accounttheir relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved,or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.Possibleratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally appliedto adjustment operations.
      Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows overtime. Possibleratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstifutional Development Impact: The extentto which a project improvesthe ability of a country or regionto
 make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human, financial, and naturalresourcesthrough: (a) better
 definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictabilityof institutionalarrangements and/or (b) better
 alignment of the mission and capacity of an organizationwith its mandate,which derives from these institutional
 arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intendedand unintendedeffects of a project. Possible
 ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectiveswere achieved,or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possibleratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BankPerformance: The extent to whichservices providedby the Bank ensuredquality at entry and supported
 implementation through appropriatesupervision (includingensuringadequatetransition arrangementsfor regular
 operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownershipand responsibilityto ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation,and compliedwith covenants and agreements, towards the achievementof
 development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
 Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) ofthree projects inthe Republic
of Ghana: the UrbanEnvironmental SanitationProject, the Village InfrastructureProject and
the SecondCommunity Water andSanitationProject.

The UrbanEnvironmental SanitationProject (UESP) was approvedinMarch1996for an
IDACredit ofUS$71.O million(Credit 28360). At project closure, 90percent (US$63.8
million) ofthe Credit had beendisbursed. The project was closed inDecember 2003, one
year behind schedule.

The Village InfrastructureProject (VIP) was approvedinMay 1997for an IDA Credit of
US$30.0 million(Credit N020). At project closure 78 percent (US$23.3 million) ofthe
Credit hadbeendisbursed.The project was closedinJune 2004, six monthsbehindschedule.

The SecondCommunity Water and SanitationProject (CWSP-2) was approvedinAugust
1999for an IDA Credit o f US$25.0 million(Credit 32820). At project closure 95 percent of
the Credit hadbeendisbursed. The project was closedinDecember2004, 18 monthsbehind
schedule.

Thereportpresentsthe findings of: (1) a review oftheprojects' implementation completion
reports, appraisalreports, legal documents, sector reports andother relevant material; and(2)
an IEGmissionto GhanainFebruary 2006, including visits to project sites anddiscussions
with government officials and agencies, project directors andstaff, beneficiaries, key donors
andacademia. The collaboration ofallpersonsmet is gratefully acknowledged.

Thethree projectswere selectedbecausethey had all beenimplementedwithinGhana's
overall strategyto decentralizecentral government services to the towns andruraldistricts.
The national decentralizationprogram has gone slowly, but eachofthese projectshas made
progressintheir programsto decentralize the water and sanitationsector. Two ofthem-the
CWSP-2 andthe VIP -have also pioneeredlarge-scalecommunity driven development
programs. Eachproject covers a different facet of the water and sanitationsector; the urban
environment inthe case ofthe UESP, andtwo rural projects, the CWSP-2 exclusively for
water andsanitationservices, the other (VIP) with water and sanitationas a choice ina menu
of rural investmentoptions. Together, the three projects illuminate anarray ofexperiences
andissues, andprovide pointers to the way forward. They alsoprovide lessonsfor other
sectorsproviding local public services inGhana, andfor decentralizationpragrams inother
countries.

Following standardIEGprocedures, copies ofthe draft PPAR were sent to government
officials andagencies for their review andcomments. Commentswere taken into account in

Summary

        This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews three projects in
Ghana's water and sanitation sector, covering both rural and urbanareas: the Urban
Environmental Sanitation Project (UESP); the Village Infrastructure Project (VIP); andthe
Second Community Water and Sanitation Project (CWSP-2).

        The three projects helpedpioneer the implementationof Ghana's decentralization
strategy. Decentralization has beena priority for both the Government andthe Bank for over
a decade, and both the 2003 PRSP and2004 CAS emphasize its continuation. The main
objective i s to shift responsibilityfor the delivery o f local services such as water and
sanitation from the center to the district and municipal governments. UESP devolved
responsibilityfor sanitation services to municipalities. The CWSP-2 andthe VIP
decentralized rural water supply andvillage infrastructure to district governments. A further
thrust o f the two rural projects was their community drivendevelopment (CDD) approaches.

        Ghana's experience with CDD was still nascent whenthe projects commenced, and
there was even less experience with large-scale decentralization. Both the Government and
theBankwere disappointed withthe progressofthe decentralizationprogram. Itwas
proceeding slowly and lacked a consistent implementationmodality betweenthe different
government departments and donor agencies. Success stories indecentralization were very
limited, andconsequently there was little positive experience to learn from and emulate. The
three projects, particularly when compared together, thus assume particular importance, as
eachwas broadly successful inits decentralization program. They were uniqueintheir large
scale: (i) implementingdecentralization; (ii) commencing to harmonize approaches
           in                                      in
between different actors; and (iii)  inpromotingCDD approaches. Thus, their "good practice"
features, as well as the problems they encountered, provide valuable lessons for the future:
for Ghana's water supply and sanitation program, for other sectorsproviding local public
services inGhana, and also for decentralization programs inother countries.

        The Urban EnvironmentalSanitation Projectwas moderately satisfactory inits
outcome. It successfully implemented its investmentprogram instorm drainage, sanitation,
solid waste management, andconstruction o f community infrastructure inGhana's five
largest cities, but its objective to establish financing mechanisms to enable funds for
maintenance was not achieved. Nevertheless, the projectwas efficient inbeing economically
viable, andits relevkcewas substantial giventhat one thirdo fthe country's poor are urban,
andthat sanitation serviceshave a largeimpactonwelfare andinreducingwater-associated
diseases. The UESP's institutional achievements incapacity buildingwere substantial,
although the degreeto which responsibilities were actually handed over to the municipalities
was lower than for the CWSP-2 andthe VIP. Underthe UESP newagencies were created in
each city for consolidated management o f all sanitation services. With major training, these
agencies were enabled to function andto commence taking over some ofthe sanitation sector
activities that were managed centrally. Thus, each city set an example that decentralization o f
urbanservicescould likelybe successful.However, the UESP failedto makefundingfor
operations andmaintenance (O&M) services available. Sustainability is unlikely, and
because neither the Bank nor the Government focused on sustainability, their performances
are rated unsatisfactory.

                                                   X



        The Second CommunityWater and SanitationProjectwas targeted specifically on
rural potable water (boreholes), sanitation facilities and hygieneeducation, with major
emphasis on capacity building. The Village InfrastructureProjectfinanced a variety of
small rural infrastructure that could be chosen by communities from a menu(themain
investmentsturned out to be boreholes, feeder roads andmarkets). Inother respectsthere are
substantial similarities betweenthe two projects, although CWSP-2 placed stronger emphasis
on software aspects-training, andthe integration o f hygiene education. The VIP i s rated
satisfactory for outcome and for the Bank's and Borrowers performance, andthe CWSP-2 is
ratedhighly satisfactory for these same rating categories. The CWSP-2 was a consistently
highperformer across all its development objectives (the VIP's physical objectives were
short o ftargets) andthe Bank andthe Government were significant innovatorsinCDD
approaches.

         The VIP and the CWSP-2 considerably advanced the decentralization agenda,
providingmajor training andcapacity buildingto the district governments, and devolving
implementation entirely to them. The central government agencies stepped back to take a
facilitating rather than an implementing role. The institutional impact o fbothprojects was
substantial, andnational incoverage (the VIP was inevery district). Nearly all the district
governments enhanced their capacity for investment inwater supply, sanitation and small
rural infrastructure, andtheir increased capabilities had some utility for other sectors.
Additionally, all o fthe districts gained experience inpromoting CDD approaches. There was
also some progress inharmonizingthe approaches o f different government agencies and
donors to the same implementationmodalities. The sustainability o fthe two projects i s not
yet clear andis ratednot evaluable. Training was excellent when the communities andtheir
boreholes were established, but routine follow-on extension andtraining has not been
provided. For the moment, nearly all the boreholes are functioning, but their sustainability in
the longer term, andwhether or not follow-on technical assistancewill be needed, is still to
bedetermined.

         For all o f the projects three broad areas were found to be important for successll
decentralization and community drivendevelopment. First, an enablinginstitutionaland
policyenvironmentwas neededandwas largelypresent. The Government andthe Bank
recognizedthat a long-term commitment was needed andhave stayed with the
decentralization agenda for over a decade andplan to continue. For the two rural projects -     '
the CWSP-2 andthe VIP -a strongly demand-driven approach to CDD was adopted
including a requirement for contributions to investments by local governments and
beneficiaries which helpedcreate "ownership" o fthe facilities andbetter prospects for
 sustainability. The roles o fthe center, the local governments and communities were clear,
 anddetailed inwidely distributedoperational manuals. Harmonizing implementation
 modalities to be the same across different donor agencies and government departments was
 also found to be important, thoughprogress was limited.

          Second, major capacitybuildingprovedessentialfor all the decentralized entities:
 local governments or municipalities, communities, andfor other involvedparties such as the
 private sector. Especially for the CDD-based rural projects, training hadto be massive, and,
 importantly, was done before investments. Eacho fthe projects had a strong central
 coordinating unit to facilitate the activities o fthe local governments, andthis proved
 essential. ButM&Eto inform management on impacts and appropriate adaptations was

                                                 xi


inadequate, and contributed to some implementation weaknesses. Training communities in
hygiene, a natural concomitant to water and sanitation projects, appears to have had good
health benefits, but only the CWSP-2 integrated hygiene education as a core activity.

        Third, Sustainabilityneededto bea centralfocus. This was not so withthe UESP
where no solution was found for raisingrevenuesto finance O&M. Yet sustainable O&M
funding should receive as much, or more, attention as engineering inproject preparation and
implementation. For all three projects, follow-on training for local governments is needed;
for progressive enhancemento fcapacity and, inparticular, to deal with Ghana's problem o f
overly frequent staff rotations. Attention should also be paidto creating self-sustaining
support services. The CWSP-2 is a particularly good example. It created a three pronged
network: (i) a private sector network o f shops selling spareparts for boreholes; (ii)similar
                                                                                         a
network o ftrained private mechanics; and (iii)water and sanitation technical assistance
                                                   a
team within eachlocal government, available on demand. This providedthe essential
elements for a proactiveborehole community to successfully maintainand operate its
facility. Such a self-sustaining network may by itselfbe sufficient to enable the continued
good functioning o f rural water facilities, or to substantially reduce the intensity o f any
supplementaryextension support that might still berequired.

        Based onthe observations regardingthese three areas, the following lessons on
decentralization (including community drivendevelopment) would apply inmost respects to
other sectors inGhana andinlargepart also to decentralization programs inother countries: .

    0   Decentralizationrequiresan enablinginstitutionalenvironmentincluding: a
        long term commitment, a demand-driven approach includingbeneficiary
        contributions, clear institutionalroles and guidance for all stakeholders, and a
        common implementation modality for all actors.

        A major drive to build implementationcapacityis essentialfor decentralization
        including: major training for local governments, communities andprivate sector
        support services, emphasis on up-front capacity buildingbefore investment in
        infrastructure, strong central coordination includingM&E, and (for water and
        sanitation sector projects) integration o f hygiene education alongside the investment
        program; and

    0   Sustainabilityneedsto be a centralfocus o f a decentralization program, including:
        priority on raising revenues for O&M, institutional adjustments ifneeded to improve
        revenue collection, self-sustaining support services preferably from the private sector,
        andfollow-ontraining for the localgovernments and, as needed, the community
        organizations.

1.       Water and Sanitation in Ghana's DecentralizationStrategy

1.       This Project Performance AssessmentReport (PPAR) reviewsthree projects which
helpedthe Republicof Ghanato decentralize and develop its water and sanitation
infrastructure: the UrbanEnvironmental Sanitation Project (UESP, approved inFY96); the
Village Infrastructure Project (VIP, FY97); and the Second Community Water and Sanitation
Project (CWSP-2, FYOO)' The projects are of strategic interest, especially whenassessed
collectively, becausethey have all taken pioneeringsteps to implementthe Government's
decentralization strategy.

ECONOMIC WATER SECTORDEVELOPMENT
                 AND

2.       The three projects have beenimplementedwithin aneconomic andwater and
sanitation environment that has, ingeneral, beenimproving. GDP growth has accelerated
from slightly under 4 percent per annum in2000 to about 5 percent currently, and is expected
to remainon this growthpath over at least the next several years. The fiscal deficit has been
reduced from 9 percent in2000 to about 5 percent currently.Domestic debt has beenreduced
from 29 percent of GDP in2000 to about 12percent in2005, and Inflationhas fallen to about
16percent per annum, from its level o f 40 percent in2000.'

3.       As concerns the water and sanitation sector, inrural areas access to potable water
increasedfrom about 40 percent o fthe rural populationin2000 to 46 percent at end2003.
Urbanaccess to potable water was estimated in2004to beabout 61percent. Investment in
sanitation has beenslower. Sanitation coverage inrural areas was estimated to be about 28
percent in2002. Inurbanareas, sanitation access was estimated in2004 to be about 40
percent. The improving water and sanitation coverage has, however, not been matchedby
improvinghealth indicators. The Government's 2003 Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper
(PRSP) comments that the health situation inthe country may evenbe worsening. The
incidence o f water associateddiseases such as malaria, guinea worm anddysenteryhas
shown little reduction (guinea worm has increased). Malaria andanemia represent some 40
percent o freported deaths o f childrenunder 15, and an increaseinthe mortality o f infants
andchildrenunderfive years hasbeenrep~rted.~

4.       The Bank's 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) andthe Government's 2003
PRSP target continued investment, for bothrural andurbanpopulations, inpotable water and
sanitation. Increasedaccess to bothpotablewater and sanitation are part o f Ghana's program
to meet its MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Also, for rural areas, village infrastructure

generally (including rural roads and facilities for marketing and processing) is considered an
important factor for rural growth, and an investmentinwhich poorer groups also benefit.

GHANA'S     EXPERIENCE      WITH DECENTRALIZATION

5.       The establishment o f local government structures inthe early 1990sset the stage for
Ghana's continuous objective since thento strengthenthe capacity o f the new local
governments -the District Assemblies (DAs) and, inthe case o f cities, the Municipal or
Metropolitan Assemblies (MAS)-andto devolve various responsibilities to them.4The
objective i s to shift responsibility for planning and deliveringlocalpublic services from the
center to these local government levels. Inspecific terms as concerns the three projects
assessed inthis review, this meansinthe case o fthe UESP, shiftingresponsibilities to the
MAS,and, for the VIP andthe CWSP-2, to theDAs.Additionally, for the ruralprojects
(CWSP-2 and VIP) implementation was further devolved to rural communitiesthrough
community drivendevelopment (CDD).

6.       Ghana's experience with CDD was still nascentwhenthe three projects commenced,
andthere was evenless experience with large-scale decentralization. The country's progress
withdecentralization was considered disappointing. Itwas proceeding slowly andlacked a
consistent ("harmonized") implementationmodality, bothbetweendifferent government
departments andbetween development partners (multi-lateral andbilateral donors and
NGOs). Thus, the Ghanaian Government, inits 2003 PRSP, commented: "While the
institutional and legal frameworks for decentralization have made great progress since 1992
whenthe DistrictAssemblies were established . . no clear trendhas beenobserved to
                                                        ... ..
deepenandinstitutionalize decentralization efforts of government. Projects have beenlargely
uncoordinated andapproaches to implementationhave beendivergent." Inthe 2004 CAS, the
Bankcommented: "The capacity ofdecentralized public serviceprovision structures to plan
andexecute programs, managefinancial resourcesandprocesses, andmonitor andevaluate
interventions must be strengthened." The IndependentEvaluationGroup (IEG) andthe
Bank's BoardofDirectors have also expressed~oncern.~

7.       Nevertheless, despite such concerns, the commitment to decentralization, both inthe
Government andthe Bank, remains strong andi s prioritizedinthe 2003 PRSP andthe 2004
CAS.




4. Followinglegislation in 1988 andanamendmenttothe constitutionin 1993, the legalandadministrativebase
for decentralizationwas further strengthenedin2000withthe passingofthe LocalGovernmentServicesAct.
Thenin2004 aNationalDevelopmentActionPlan(NDAP) was formulatedto accelerate implementationof
 decentralizedactivities andto buildthe capacityofthe Assemblies.These actionshaveestablishedthe legaland
administrativebasisfor decentralization,but, as indicated, implementationofdecentralizationremainsan issue.
 5. Fromthe IndependentEvaluationGroup: "Improved governanceis essential.First, decentralizationis a
priority,butprogresshasbeen stalled"(IEG, CountryAssistance Evaluation, 2000), and(ii)fromthe Bank's
BoardofDirectors, CommitteeofDevelopmentEffectiveness(CODE): "The Committeeagreedthat improved
governanceis essentialand inthat context, decentralizationis apriority.Although it expressed concernabout
the OED(now IEG)findingthat progressinthis areahasstalled, the Committeeacknowledgedthat hrther
progresswouldrequireamajor effort incapacitybuildingat the districtlevels   ........"(Reportfrom the CODE
 onthe Ghana, CountryAssistance Evaluation, March2000).

8.      Given Ghana's still limitedexperience with successful large-scale decentralization,
the three projects reviewedare ofparticular interest. Although all three had some shortfalls,
eachproject was broadly successful inimplementingits decentralization program, especially
institutionally and incapacity enhancement. Thus, eachproject provides "good-practice"
features, and the difficulties encountered also provide learning materialfor the
decentralization program. The lessons are specifically basedon the water sector. However, to
varyingdegree, the experience ofthe projects andthe lessonslearned is relevantto
decentralization o f other sectors providing local public services inGhana, andto other
countries as well.

THEKEYISSUES

9.      This PPARfocuses onthree broadissuesthat were found bythe IEGmissionto be
particularly relevant as Ghana takes its decentralization program forwards.

10.     First, there i s the overall institutionaland policyenvironmentand what aspects
appear to be particularly important to success. Were institutionalroles clear, and if so, how
were they made clear? How importanti s the harmonization o f implementation modalities
between agencies and donors? What made the community drivendevelopment (CDD)
approach o f the CWSP-2 andthe VIP largely successful, andwhat can be learned from
aspects o f CDD that were less successful?

11.     Second, the needfor capacitybuildingwas an implementation issue for all three
projects. Eacho fthe projects put major effort into strengthening institutions: the capacity o f
the MASand some private sector participants inthe case o fthe UESP; andthe capacity o fthe
DAs, rural communities andprivate sector underthe CWSP-2 andthe VIP. What lessons do
the projects provide inhow to buildthe capacity of these institutions?

12.     Third, the sustainabilityofworks andinstitutionswas anissue, especially for the
UESP. Canthe Government improvethe generation ofurbanrevenues for O&M? For the
CDD projects, what are the institutional andfinancial features that would help continued
operation o fboreholes? I s follow-on training and extension support requiredfor the borehole
communities?

13.     These and other related issues emergedduringthe individual reviews o f each project
inSections2,3 and4 ofthis review, andinthe summary oflessonslearnedinSection 6. It
should be emphasized, first, that the lessons are those specifically stemming from reviewing
the three projects. While wide-ranging, the lessons are not intended to be comprehensive.
Second, this assessment outlines issues and lessons, anddoes not attempt to precisely detail
them. Finally, there were some issues encountered for which the veracity o f observations and
data could not be determined, or for which the appropriate actions are not readily apparent.

THETHREE      PROJECTS

14.     The Urban EnvironmentalSanitationProject(UESP, FY96)was the first o fthe
three projectsto be approved. It financed investment instorm drainage, sanitation, solid
waste management and community infrastructure inGhana's five largest cities (Accra,
Kumasi, Tamale, Tema and Sekondi-Takoradi), andprovided associatedtraining, with

                                                     4


assistance from the Nordic Development Fund, to enhance the capacity ofthe MAS.Direct
implementationwas devolvedto the five MAS,assistedby a central coordination unit. The
project followed the largely successfulUrbanI1Project (FY90), whichhad financed urban
infrastructureandhousinginthe same five cities. The UESP was the first project inthe water
supply andsanitation(WSS) sector to have a decentralizedapproach.

15.      The VillageInfrastructureProject(VIP, FY97) financed community-level small
rural infrastructure- primarily boreholes, feeder roads, tracks, markets, small-scale irrigation
andpost-harvestprocessingfacilities. The potablewater component (boreholes and some
dug-wells) was by far the most popular investmentfor the communities. The VIP was, with
the CWSP-2, Ghana's first large-scaledecentralizedrural project andthe country's second
CDD project.6The project was co-financed with Germany's KfW andthe International Fund
for Agricultural Development. VIP hadnational coverage, involving all 110of Ghana's DAs,
andit was the first ruralproject with a multi-menuapproach. VIP made some progfess
towards harmonizing service delivery to DAs.Decentralizationwas supportedby major
training andtechnical assistanceto the DAsand communities. Like the UESP, central
coordination was through a project implementation unit.

16.       The SecondCommunityWater andSanitationProject (CWSP-2,FYOO)was
effectively implementedover the same period as the VIP, as VIP start-uphadbeen
substantiallydelayed. The CWSP-2 financeddevelopment of village water and sanitation
facilities, alongwith training andtechnical support to the DAsandcommunities. The CWSP-
2 addeddecentralizedimplementation by the DAs to the CDD approach introduced under the
first CWSP. Centralcoordination was through an existing governmentagency, the
Community Water and SanitationAgency (CWSA). DANIDAandKfW were major partners
inthe CWSA program.'

 17.      Theprojectsandtheir ratings are discussedinthree sectionsbelow, one for each
project, startingwiththe first approvedproject (UESP), followed by the VIP andthenthe
CWSP-2. Eachsectionstarts witha summary table ofthe project's Development Objectives
(DOs), an assessment ofthe relevance, efficacy andefficiency inachieving each
developmentobjective, andthe overall outcome rating for eachproject basedonthese sub-
ratings. Then, eachsectioncontinues by assessingthe project's InstitutionalDevelopment
Impactand Sustainability, andconcludesby assessingthe Bank's andthe Borrower's
Performanceinpreparingandimplementingthe project. Monitoring and evaluation and
fiduciary issues are reviewedinsection5 andits relatedannex. The final section(Section 6)
discusses lessonsfor the future decentralizeddevelopment of the water andsanitationsector.




 6. The first Community Water and SanitationProject (CWSP, FY94) was the first CDDproject, but
 implementationwas still managed centrally.

RELEVANCE

18.      The UESP fittedwell with the Bank's and the Government's development strategies
as laid out inthe 2000 and2004 CASs andthe 2003 PRSP. The key emphases o f boththe
Bankandthe Government were to promote economic growth andpovertyreductionwitha
special focus on Ghana's decentralization program. Environmentalmanagement and an
increasedrole for the private sector were also targeted. Investmentinsocial infrastructure in
theurbansector, and, specifically, onurbanenvironmentalmanagement, was a complement
to the attention already placedon rural water supply and sanitation. The urbansector has
beenthe growthleader inGhana's economic development, andurbangrowthcan also
provide markets and employment for the rural sector. One-third o fthe country's poor are
urban. The urbanpoor have worse social indicators (health, education) thanthe ruralpoor,
andthe majority ofepidemic diseasesare inurbanareas.

19.      The UESP's three Development Objectives (DOs) complemented eachother to
provide comprehensive support bothto alleviation ofurbanpoverty and diseases, andto
Ghana's decentralization strategy. The first DO      - developingurbaninfrastructure supporting
improvedenvironmental sanitation-tackled the highlyrelevant needto improve
environmental sanitation. The five cities -Accra, Kumasi, Secondi-Takoradi, Tamale and
Tema -contained 23 percent o fthe country's population. The last objective -buildingthe
capacity ofthe MAS-was an essential concomitantto decentralization as, without major
training inalmost all skill areas, the newly independent MASriskedfloundering. Its
relevance was also high.

20.      Development Objectivetwo was critically important as the maintenance o f urban
environmental sanitation infrastructure was chronically under-funded.Thus, inconcept, the
D O was highly relevant, but as it was ineffectively reflectedinthe design o fthe project, the
relevance o f DO2i s rated modest.Fewspecific actions to enable the adequate provisiono f
funds for O&M were proposed, andproject implementationdidnot redressthis serious

sustainability issue. This gap would turn out.tobe, by far, the UESP's overarching weakness.
The highrelevance ofthe other two DOs is, thus, pulleddown, to an overallrelevance of
substantial, andthe O&M financing issue has larger influence on other project ratings.

EFFICACY

21.      The UESP's first objective was supported by the project's first four components: (a)
drainage, (b) sanitation, (c) solid waste management, and (d) upgrading o f community
infrastructure, together comprising 86 percent o f actual project costs. Annex 2 summarizes
the components andtheir costs. Therewas some variability inachievementbetweenthe
components, but, overall, the achievement o fD O 1was substantial.

22.      The storm drainage constructed is estimated, for most drains, to have significantly
reduced seasonal flooding and the risk from exceptional future floods.' The IEGmission also
notedthe prevalence o f low income households inthe main flood zones, indicating the
particular benefits to poorer people.

23.      The sanitation component funding household, public and school latrines exceeded
                                     -                                                 -
project targets. An inspectioninAccra by the mission found functioning facilities. A public
toilet was operating well, though it was not as clean as desirable. Severalprivate latrines
inspected were ingood condition. The Waste Management Departments(WMDs) had
successfully outsourced management o fpublic toilets to private operators.

24.      O fparticular interest is the school latrine program and the potential impact from
promoting healtheducation and awareness. The missionvisited one school and found the
toilet to be immaculate'ly clean. Itwas highly appreciated by the headmistresswho felt that,
inadditionto the significantreductioninopen-space defecation. Thetoiletwas contributing
to better awareness ofsanitation. Hygiene education was not anexplicit part o fthe project
though UESP funds did contribute to a nationalpublic awarenessprogram o f sanitation
practices. The school visited indicatedthe interest inimproving sanitation practices. Without
any extra funds, the headmistress hadprovidedwashbasins and soap outside every
classroom, and intendedifaffordableto install runningwater. Inherview, the value o f this
was as much interms o f education inhygiene as inthe betterhealth conditions specifically
providedbythe washbasins. The school also had a healthand sanitation teacher.

25.      Solidwaste management (SWM) improved inall five UESP cities duringthe project
period. The percentage o f solid waste collectedis estimated to have increased from 60 to 63
percent inAccra, from 45 to 77 percent inKumasi, from 40 to 72 percent inSekondi-
Takoradi, from 10to 57 percent inTamale and from 50 to 60 percent inTema.' An

increasing amount of solid waste is beingcollected under private sector franchise
arrangements.lo

26.       The Community Infrastructure Upgradingcomponent appears aparticular success.
Small infrastructure facilities -drainage, paved small roads, electricity andpublic toilets -
were installed inlow income communities inthree ofthe project cities. Inanunscheduled
visit bythe IEGmissionto Nimacommunity, a former slum inAccra, aremarkable change
was noticed. Citizens said that sanitation related diseases had declined, and improved
employment and incomes were also enthusiastically recounted. Improved living standards
were also indirectly evident inamissionwalk-through. Small businesses and shops were
thrivingandmost buildingswere newlypainted. An inspectiono fproject infrastructure
found facilities generally ingood shape. Maintenance o fthe larger infrastructure was good.
A secondarydrainhadminimal silt deposits andwas beingcleaned at that time. Repair of
roadpotholes was also beingdone.

27.      According to a former Assembly maninthe neighborhood, the community hadbeen
significantly involvedindecisions onthe location andtype o f upgrading. However, this
appearsto have beenlimited to participationinmeetings. There hadbeenno contributionto
investmentcosts. Also, while smaller infrastructure was beingmaintainedbythe community,
larger infrastructure, including the drain and roadmaintenance above, was maintainedby the
government. To increase community ownership and longer term sustainability, it would be
desirable to increasecommunity input, bothas part o f investment and inshouldering more of
themaintenance.

28.      The project's second objective -to establish better institutional, financing and policy
frameworks so that improvements are sustained over time -had modestachievements. As
plannedat appraisal, a separateline itemfor waste management was established ineach
MA's budget.All five cities enactedlegislationfor establishing Waste Management
Departments (WMDs), which were subsequentlyformed. However, translationo fthese
actions into sustainable fimding for operations andmaintenance was not achieved (refer to
Sustainability section).

29.      The final objective -to buildcapacity o fthe MASto manage environmental and
sanitation services -involved major effort intraining o fMA staff, but capacity buildingwas
impeded by the government practice o f frequent reassignment of staff, a country-wide
problem inGhana. Staff departures to the private sector, which offeredhigher remuneration
thanthe very lowwages ingovernment, were also aproblem. The Director ofUESP
estimated that a government staffpositionhad, on average, three different staff duringthe
project period. This problem varied by city. For instance, the Director o fthe Kumasi WMD
commented to the missionthat most o f the senior staffhadremained duringand after the
project period, butthe training efforts o fmost WMDs were reduced inimpact. The UESP
made some progress indevolving implementationresponsibilities for sanitation to the MAS,
butits central coordination unit still providedmajor hands-on implementationassistance. By


10.There were some problemswith the sanitary landfills.The February 2006 Bank supervisionmissionfor the
UESP-I1found that inKumasi, usage ofthe landfillis diminishedby a limitednumberoftrucks and, dueto low
financial incentives, a limitednumber ofprivate sector waste collectors. Also, effectiveoperationofthe land-fill
was impairedsince there was no compactor.

comparison, the VIP and the CWSP-2 were able to make the DAs more self-sufficient. The
efficacy o f the UESP's thirdDO i s rated modest.Considering all three objectives combined,
theproject's overall efficacywas modest.

EFFICIENCY

30.     The actual cost ofUESP's investmentswas 93 percent ofthe costs estimatedat
appraisal, and the project's investment components largely achieved their targets. The one
year extension o fthe closing date was not excessive. The economic analysis, at both
appraisal and ICR stage, covered only the project's drainage component, but hadpositive
returns. All o f the other physical components - sanitation, solid waste management and
community infrastructure -hadpositive impact but no ERRswere calculated. This was an
analytical gap as ERRsfor these components could have been estimated.]' Nevertheless,
taking account o fthe cost-effectiveness ofthe project, and of general Bank experience about
the benefits from such investments, itisprobable that the project's overallERRwould have
been above the opportunity cost o f capital. Efficiency is estimated substantial,though a
better analysis would have enabled a greater degree o f confidence inthis rating.

OVERALLPROJECTOUTCOME

31.     The UESP's relevance and efficiency were both substantial. The project achieved its
physical investment objective (DO l), efficacy was modest for the project's 2ndand 3rd
                                               but
DOs, andoverall efficacy was modest. The outcome o fthe UESP is assessedmoderately
satisfactory. This is the same as inthe ICRReview. The ICRrated outcome satisfactory.'*

INSTITUTIONAL      DEVELOPMENT          IMPACT

32.      The UESP's two main institutionalachievements were: (a) the establishment ineach
MA o fa Waste Management Department; and(b) the project's support to Ghana's
decentralization programthrough the major training provided to the decentralized MAS.The
newWMDs provided, for the first time, a consolidationandlocally basedhome for the
related activities o f drainage, sanitation and solid waste management. MA legislationalso
providedthe WMDs with authority to recruit their own staff, to set their own tariffs, andto
retainthe revenues that they collected, rather than pass these onto the MA general funds.'3
The enablingfeatures for independent andself-financing localentities to fundoperations and
maintenance were therefore established. Additionally, the head o fthe WMD became a part o f


11. Economic returns for the other components, while these might have been basedon only approximate
assumptionso fbenefits, could have been calculated, with sensitivity analysis usedto test the robustnesso fthe
estimated ERRs against differentassumptions o fbenefits.
12. ICRs have a four point scale for rating project outcome (HighlySatisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory
and HighlyUnsatisfactory). For rating outcome, IEGuses a six-point scalethat also includes a Moderately
Satisfactory and a Moderately Unsatisfactory category. All other rating scales are the same for the ICR, the ICR
Review and the PPAR.
13. As concernsthe independenceo fthe WMDs, the mission was told that the powers provided to themthrough
the new legislationwere only modestly applied inpractice; the WMDs, liketypical governmentdepartments,
seemto be still very much a part ofMA authority.

each MA's management team. Finally, while reduced inimpact because o f staffrotations, the
UESP's largetraining program, assistedbytheNordic Development Fund, strengthenedthe
capacity o fthe WMDs, and made decentralized implementation possible. It should, however,
beremarked that the UESPstill involved substantial implementation assistance bythe Project
Unit(PU). Inthis regard, UESPmade moremodestprogresstowards decentralized
implementationthanthe two rural projects. Nevertheless, the establishment o fthe
institutionalbase for decentralized provisiono f sanitation services, the creation and capacity
strengtheningo fthe WMDs and some progress inthe actual assumption ofresponsibilities
from the center to the MAS,were very positive achievements. Institutional Development i s
rated substantial. The ICR and ICRReviewratings were modest.

33.      The Apurom-iateness o f aProiect Coordination Unit:Project activities for the UESP
(andalso the VIP) were implementedorganically withinthe existinggovernment structures;
the MASinthe case o fthe UESP, andthe DAs and a numbero f central technical agencies for
the VIP. However, to coordinate andsupport the activities o fthese multiplelocal
governments and central agencies, project coordination units (PCUs) were established for
bothprojects; the "Project Unit" (PU) for the UESP, and the "Rural Infrastructure
CoordinationUnit" (RICU) for the VIP. (The CWSP-2 was coordinated bythe existing and
substantially autonomous Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), thus, a
government agency, but with management features somewhat similar to a PCU.) The UESP
andVIP PCUs were each staffedexclusively byconsultants, andhadsubstantial autonomy
from their umbrella ministry, the Ministry o fLocal Government andRuralDevelopment.
Could project coordinationo fthe UESP andthe VIP have beenwithinan existing
government ministry?After discussion withbothagencies andBank staff the IEGmission
concluded that the use o f PCUs inthe particular circumstances ofthe two projects andthe
then stage of institutionaldevelopment was appropriate. The low salaries o f government staff
provide little incentiveto take onthe kindo fworkload neededand found inthe PU and
RICU. Government employees inministries were also constantly beingtransferred, whereas
continuity andexperience were required. The highlydemandingoutreach, multi-agency and
capacity buildingnature o fthe UESP andthe VIP neededstrong andsubstantially
independent coordinationentities ifthe projects were to succeed. Nevertheless, over time, it
would be appropriate for the PCUs to be absorbedas organic parts o fthe existing
government structure, including appropriate remuneration.

34.      For now, there is the interestingcontrast o fthe project implementers -five
municipalities for the UESP and over a hundredDAs and multipleministries and agencies
for the VIP   - beingentirely part o fthe existing government structure, andthe PCUs beingthe
reverse. However, it was more importantto successfully promote, usingPCUs, the entirely
organically basedmajor decentralization andharmonization program that the UESP andthe
VIP started, thanto have less effective programs promotedby institutionally embeddedbut
lower capacity project managements.l4



14. There is nowthe question,which cannotbe answered at this stage, o fwhether the coordinationo fthe
UESP's andthe VIP's successor projects-the UESP2 andthe CBRDP (theCommunityBasedRural
DevelopmentProject)-have the rightbalanceinterms ofevolutiontowardsmoreorganic projectcoordination
yet continuedstrongcapacity.The UESP-2hasreducedthe PU's role andis experiencing initialproject
coordinationand implementationproblems,butthis maybeatemporary adjustmentproblem.

SUSTAIN ABILITY

35.     Inadequatefunding for operations andmaintenance(O&M) was consideredby most
personsmet to be the UESP's critical issue. The mission shares this view. As examples, the
MASwere typically months behindinpaymentsto garbage collection contractors, the
compactor at Kumasi landfillhadbrokendown, and drainagemaintenancewas reportedto be
frequently poor. One example was the Odaw main drain inAccra. The project hadhelped
reconstructthisto achieve a higher flood protection thanpreviously. The missionwas
informed that, as designed, the drain hada depthof five meters. However, from the mission's
visual inspection, build-up of silt hadresultedina drop of not muchmore thanthree meters
before meeting the silt bed. This would meannearly two meters of silt, anda capacity
reduction of nearly 40 percent, still adequatefor smaller floods, but an evident reduction in
capacity for large floods.

36.      Ifsuchsituationscontinue, itmight bequestionedwhetherthere shouldbeany
additional investmentinGhana's urbansanitationsector. With inadequateO&M, constructed
infrastructure would rapidly fall into disuse or reducedcapacity, as is already happeningwith
some landfills anddrains. Neverthless, while beyondthe UESPproject period, positive
initiatives are now being taken. For Odaw draina group ofprivate contractors is putting up a
proposalto the Governmentto manage the entire basin of eight kilometers, including Odaw's
keytributaries, as amore sustainable measure, andthe Bankis supporting this with aPPIAF
grant to carry out the financial model.

37.      The source ofthe O&M financing issue is, to a substantial extent, broaderthanthe
project itself. A number ofwaste managementactivities, particularlydrainage andpart of
solid waste management, have a public goods element andare difficult to charge for directly.
Butiffunds are requiredfrom the MAS'generalrevenues, these must compete withthe other
chronically under-fundedmunicipal activities. Waste management O&M expenditures, even
at the present inadequatelevels, are already a huge part of annual city budgets; typically
some 30 -50 percent of annualMAexpenditure. Significant increasesinallocations to waste
managementwould severely impact other urbanneeds. Hence, part o fthe urbanO&M
financing solution requires augmentingMA revenues. The other part is to find ways to
augment revenues for waste managementservices. Butthere were no significant project          '

actions, or other actions by the MAS,that effectively improved either sourceo frevenues.
Giventhat a solution was not found for O&M financing, sustainability is ratedunlikely,as in
the ICR and ICRReview.

38.      Looking ahead, resolvingthe revenues issue appears feasible. A common view
expressedto the missionwas that the MAShadsome obvious options for sizeablerevenue
enhancements. Itwas amatter of actually applying these options. For instance, the Chief
Executive of Kumasicity advisedthat property taxes andbusiness licensescould be a large
source of increasedrevenues. Only about one-third o fpropertytaxes were being collected,
substantially due to out ofdate property records. Registering of businessesfor licenses was
also very incomplete. The Director ofthe UESP andBank staff advisedthe mission that
similar observationscanbemadeaboutthe other MAS.As propertytaxes andbusiness
licenses, evenat presentcollection rates, are typically well over one-third ofMA self-
generatedfunds, increasingthese two fhding sources alone has potential to more than cover
O&M costs for urbansanitation, andto contributeto other urbanexpenditureneeds. There is

                                                     11


also likely to be scope for enhancing direct charges for waste management services, and
practical sources of such fees could be looked for.

39.      An example of successful generationofrevenuesfor O&M is the Bankfinanced
UrbanI1project (Credit 2157) whichwas approvedinJune 1990, six years before approval
ofthe UESP. The UrbanI1project coveredthe same five cities as the UESP. Two-thirds of
the Urban-11's costswere, likethe UESP, for urbanpublic goods (mainly rehabilitation of
roads and sewerage, and solid waste management). The Urban-I1project put major emphasis
on sustainability andraisingrevenuesfor O&M. Positive financial flows were achieved, in
excess of O&M expenditureneeds.I5IEGundertooka PPAR on the UrbanI1project andhad
a favorable assessment. One ofthe PPAR's two major lessonswas the needto have strong
revenueflows. Inthe PPAR's conclusionIEGcommentedthat "Sustainability is ratedlikely,
inview ofthe stronglocalcommitmentto theproject, together withpositive financial flows
generatedinkey areas."I6

BANKAND BORROWER              PERFORMANCE

40.      Boththe Bank andthe Borrower performedwell inimplementing the project's
investments. Components 1through 4, supportingDevelopmentObjective 1and comprising
86 percent ofproject costs, were completedbroadly as targeted, andwith strong "ownership"
by the MAS.Project coordination by the PUwas goodand its professional staffprovided
major assistance to the MAS.The establishment by eachMA of a Waste Management
Departmentwas animpokant institutional achievement. The handover ofsupervision
responsibility to the Bank's Accra office enabled a more immediately responsivetask team.
Inengineering, physical investmentandtraining, theperformanceofboththe Bankandthe
Government was strong. However, minimal attentionwas placedon O&M financing by both
the Bankandthe Government.Yet this was theproject's keyissue."




15. Therewere somedesignfeaturesto achievefinancial viability inthe UrbanI1project, includinga property
revaluationexercise, improvedbillingand collection systemsand some institutionalstrengthening. However,
The success ingeneratingrevenuesappearsto bemorethe resulto fstrongfocus, monitoringanddialogue
betweenthe Bankandthe Government,bothduringprojectpreparationandduringimplementation.The success
thus includeda strong"cultural)' element-Le., simplytakingdecisionson service fees and collection andon
'municipalrevenuesthat would achievethe sustainabilitygoal. The Urban11's log-frameexemplifiesthis
attention.Mobilizationofmunicipalrevenuesis one ofthe performanceindicators, andthe targetedincreasein
revenuesis specifiedbycity.
16. At the conclusiono fthe UrbanI1project, the Bank's AfricaRegionwas lookingaheadto maintainthe
urbanenvironmentalsanitationsector's financial viability.The ICRfor the UrbanI1projectcommented,
"Consideringthe positivetrend inrevenuebuild-upinallthe Assemblies,the foundationfor puttingthemon a

financial practices, andsupport is beingprovidedunder follow-onprojectsapprovedin 1994 and 1996, the

17. Referto the Government'scommentonthe sustainabilityissue inAnnex F.Regardingthis comment,IEG
notesthat bothprojectdesignand implementationare important.Specifically, IEGevaluatesBank Performance

supportedimplementation,andBorrowerPerformanceintermso fthe extent to which the Borrower ensured
qualityofpreparationand implementation.

                                                         12


41.      A number ofobservations can be made about the inattentionto O&M financing. For
the Bank, the focus at appraisal was on the physical components ofthe project. Therewas no
planfor O&M and its financing. The Government had minimal achievement inimproving
O&M financing. It is telling that government's ICR report for the UESP has no mentionat all
o f financial issues. For boththe Bank and the Borrower, attention to O&M financing was
very muchinthe back seat, both at project preparation and during implementation.'*

42.      The lack of attention to revenue generation and O&M is disconcerting becausethe
UESP was designedwhen the Bank already had significant experience inGhana's urban
sector, including insuccessful generation of municipal revenues inthe UrbanI1project. But
the Bank appears notto have learnt from thisprior experience. The UrbanI1lessons
regarding successful revenue generation were not taken forward under UESP. The same lack
o f learning by boththe Government andthe Bank continued ina number o f respects inthe
design o fthe UESP-2 (FY04, Credit 3889)." Inthe Bank Quality Assurance Group's
"Quality at EntryAssessment" o fUESP I1inOctober 2005, the QAG panelcommented that
its mainconcern was "the failure to address adequately issues o fproject sustainability."20

43.      The Bank's andGovernment's performance for the UESP are bothrated
unsatisfactory.This is a downgrade o fthe satisfactory performance ratings assessedinthe
ICR and ICR Review, because o fthe greater weight attachedto the UESP's most critical
issue."




18. Another contributor to not tackling the O&M/financing issue may be the limited strategic sector analysis.
Severalgovernment observers felt that Ghana did not have a comprehensive strategy for waste management,
andthe Bank also appears to lack a comprehensive sector analysis. There was an Urban Development Strategy
Review conductedjointly bythe Government and the Bankin 1993/94, butthis was more technically than
financially and institutionally oriented, and is also outdated.
19. The UESP-2 appraisal report has minimal mention or features addressing O&M financing. There is no
Development Objective or component addressing O&M financing, the Lessons Learned section does not
include a lessonrelated to financing, and the Results Framework also omits O&M financing. Onthe positive
side, however, a large study on institutional and financial matters was includedunder the project (para44).
20. The QAG also commented that "the project (UESP 11)remains less than satisfactory inthe likelihood of
sustainablealternative revenue generating arrangements. Indeed, one would have expectedan analysis o fthe
current municipal revenuesgenerating arrangements..      ...."
21. The World Bank's Africa Regioncommented as follows on the ratings provided for the Bank's and the
Government's performance: "Despite the launch o fthe decentralization process inthe late 80s inGhana, fiscal
decentralization remains very weak inthis country. The bulk o fLocal Governments' resourcescontinuesto
come from the CDF and the total amount allocated through this instrument is around US$80- US$lOO million
per year (for 138 LocalGovernments comprising 86 urbancenters) and representsa small percentageof
government revenues(should not be lessthan 5% according to the Constitution). Localresourcesgenerated by
Local Governments representonly 30% o ftheir resources. The situation is not specific to Ghanaand is quite
similar to most ofthe countries inSSA. While average level ofLocal Government revenuesis 11%ofGDP in
OECD countries spanning from Denmark (3 1%)to Greece (2.8%), that share is between4-15% incountries in
transition.By contrast, that share in SSA, varies from 5% inUganda to 3.5% inSouth Africa. The share reaches
1%inmost ofthe countries like Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Cameroun, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Madagascarand
Senegal. Property taxes have beenadvocated as one o fthe best local resourcesbut resourcesfrom this tax are
very difficultto generateexcept inSouth Africa, where they are mandated bythe Constitution, representthe
main source o frevenueso fLocalGovernments."

                                                        13


 44.      A more positive situationis, however, emerging, withvarious measuresto beginto
 more rigorously tackle the O&M financing issue beingtaken by the Bank and the
 Government underthe UESP-2. The most significant o fthese is the provisioninUESP-2's

RELEVANCE

45.       The VIP was highly relevant both inits overall objective to enhance the quality o f
life o fthe ruralpoor and inits specific objectives and supporting components to achieve this.
The 2000and2004 CASs support pro-poor participatoryeconomic growthbasedon
infrastructure investment anddevelopment o fhumanresources. The Government's Medium
Term Agricultural Development Strategy identifiedlack o fbasic rural infrastructure as a
constraint to improvingrural livelihoods. Underlyingall o fthe Government's development
efforts was its decentralization strategy, including empoweringlocal communities and
strengtheningo fdistrict level capacity.


22. Financingis fromthe NordicFund's part ofthe project. The studyandTA focuses on imgrovementof
accountingsystems andprocedures,enhancingmunicipalrevenuegeneration(largelythroughbetter
implementationofpropertytaxation assessmentsandcollection), andrationalizationo fthe budgetaryprocess.
The funding ofO&Mfor basicurbanservicesand infrastructurefacilities is aparticular focus. This will largely
be implementedat the municipalities ratherthanat the central governmentlevel.

                                                   14


46.     TheVIP's specific objectives complemented eachother to support the overall
~bjective.'~The first development objective, to empower andbuildcapacity o f localrural
communities was a key grass roots needfor the decentralization program and for community
drivendevelopment (CDD). The secondobjective - to provide the rural infrastructure, as
prioritizedby each community -was the fulcrum o fthe project. Strengthening the capacity
o f the DAs under the final objective was essential; the decentralization programrequired
significant enhancement o fthe capacity ofthe local governments, and the DAswere also to
be the primarymanagers o f their respective village investmentprograms.

EFFICACY

47.      ImplementationConstraints: A strongly positive feature ofthe infrastructure
program andits supportinginstitutional activities was the training provided to DA staff and
the communities before the investments were made. Though this necessarily contributedto
the project's very slow start The project's first borehole was not constructed until2000,
                                 -
three years after the project was approved      - the training  provideda much firmer base for the
sustainability o fthe investments.

48.      The first factor inthe VIP's very slow start was not a good augur for the project. The
project coordinationunit,the "Rural Infrastructure CoordinationUnit" (RICU), was not
established until 1 % years after Board approval. A substantial part o fthe RICUteam (all
consultants) had been identifiedbefore project effectiveness, but letters o f appointment were
not signeduntilJanuary 1999,20 months after Board approval. Already, 25 percent o fthe
project periodhadbeen usedup.

49.      Other implementationconstraints have beenas follows. First, the project preparation
team's Project Operational Manual, a particularly critical document for a CDD project so that
all staff down to field andDA level have a clear understanding o fprocesses, was inadequate
andhadto be substantially re-writtenby RICU. Second, the VIP's variedmenuneeded
implementationor technical assistanceto DAsand communities from a number o f different
agencies,24andfor each agency a memorandum ofunderstandinghadto be agreed and
signed. Third, a demand-based programnecessarily hasto follow demandrather than
particular targets. Finally, a new program will inevitably require a learning-by-doing phase
which will initially be slow.

50:      Achievements: The efficacy ofthe VIP's Development Objectives will be reviewed
commencing with its infrastructure achievements (DO 2), with the two institutional
objectives reviewed subsequently. The VIP's infrastructure investments were through three

IrrigationDevelopmentBoard, andthe NationalBoardfor Small-scaleIndustry(for privateinvestments).

rural investmentcategories (project components 1,2 and 3, refer to Annex B): (a) rural water
infrastructure; such as boreholes for potable water and small scale irrigation infrastructure;
(b) ruraltransport infrastructure; such as roads andtrails; and (c) ruralpost-harvest
infrastructure, such as markets and drying and storage facilities. Becauseo fthe
implementationconstraints noted above, achievement was modest except for water
infrastructure. Annex C provides a table o fthe infrastructure program's achievements. Some
highlightsare providedbelow.

51.      Water Infrastructure: Some 1000boreholes were established, and, together with
other sources o f potable water, reached about 2000 villages (about 20 percent above the
appraisal target). The project's investment inirrigationwas on a much smaller scale than
boreholes, but its impact onproductivity was high, demonstrating its future potential. Small-
scale irrigation is reportedto have increased vegetable crop intensificationto 4 crops per
annum, against the appraisal target o ftwo harvests per annum, andyields have increased
substantially.

52.      According to boththe RICU management and as notedinthe "Beneficiary Survey o f
the VIP",   25virtually all boreholes established underthe VIP are still fhctioning.
Breakdowns are not uncommon, but these are usually repaired quickly, either bythe village
borehole mechanic or, at a charge and for more complex repairs, by a private "area"
mechanic, both trained underthe project.26The IEGmissionvisitedtwo villages with
boreholess established under the project. Bothwere clean andfunctioning well. One borehole
hadbrokendown a month before the mission, but hadbeenrepaired intwo days. The Water
andSanitation Committees (WATSANs) met about quarterlyinone village andevery six
months inthe other. One WATSAN had a 7 person executive committee o f which 3 members
were women including the treasurer andsecretary. The other had a 5 person committee
including two women, one o f whom was the Treasurer. Revenueswere collected monthly;
1000 Cedis per adult inone community andthe same amount butper householdinthe other.
A village mechanic andthe WATSANexecutive members(president, treasurerand
secretary) hadreceived training. The main areao f concern was the size ofthe Bank accounts;
one had Cedis 1million or about U S $ l l l , andthe other hadonly Cedis 200,000 (US$22).
Such amounts would be inadequate ifmajor repairs were needed. Inother respectsthe
WATSANS andthe general body were well functioningvillage level institutions.
Observations such as the above were also typical inthe mission's visits to CWSP-2 boreholes
The water component's efficacy i s ratedsubstantial.

53.      Transport Infrastructure:Rehabilitationo froads andconstruction o ftracks
achieved about 50 and 60 percent respectively o f appraisal targets2'The roads andtracks
were highlyappreciated by the communities. They improved (or even enabled) access to
markets. The ChiefExecutive o fAsante Akima NorthDA commented to the missionthat a
former "wilderness area" hadbeen opened upto markets, and incomes had significantly

improved.28A program that was appreciated was given a significant start, but achievements
were short of appraisal targets. Efficacy is rated modest.

54.      Post-HarvestInfrastructure:Investment inmost post harvest infrastructure was
very small relative to targets, though 174markets were constructed. These were appreciated
bythe DAsbecausemarket fees are one oftheir largest sources o frevenue.The mission
visitedone market, where bustlingactivity betweenbuyersandsellers clearly indicated
vibrant usage.29.Nevertheless, the substantial underachievement o f investmentsinmost post-
harvest infrastructure points to a modest efficacy. Taking account o f all three components
underDO 2, its overall efficacy was modest.

55.      The projectperformedstrongly inits two institutional objectives. Likethe CWSP-2,
the VIP tackled community empowerment andcapacity building(VIP's ObjectiveI) a                   on
massive scale. Nearly all numericaltargets were exceeded, a number of them considerably
exceeded. Some 3300 Communities, spread over all o f Ghana's 110rural districts, received
training ingroup development, participatoryprocesses, businessmanagement andO&M. The
training programs includedtraining o fthe office bearers o fthe community organization, and
training inother skills as needed; such as village mechanics for communities investing in
boreholes. A private sector support network was also developed; mechanics were trained to
more advanced skill levels thanthe village mechanics, and a network o fprivate retailers
stocking and selling spare partswas also facilitated.

56.       The impact appears to have been considerable, going well beyondprovision o fthe
skills needed for O&M o f the community's investment. According to the Beneficiary
Assessment, there was an increase inthe confidence o f communities. VIP staff commented
that the five percent down-payment requiredfrom a community to qualify for a VIP
investment was also contributing to empowerment and "owner~hip"~~.The ICRcommented
that a former "cycle o f dependency" was beingprogressively replaced by the participatory
skills, attitude and confidence to as targeted inObjective 1 identify, plan, implement and
                                        -                             -
maintain small village-level infra~tructure.~'      The efficacy o fObjective 1 was high.


28. Therewas, however, a potentialnegativeeffect of developmento f feeder roads.Where suchroadsopened
up accessto forestedareas, they couldalso enable illegal loggingand impactonwildlife throughpoaching.An
environmental screeningprocessfor all investmentswas introducedto helpdealwith such risks.
29. This was not so with allofthe marketsas some(advisedby RICUto beabout 10 percent) hadbeenpoorly
 located.These were mostly the partiallyconstructedmarketsfrom an earlier project, ASIP, which were finished
 offby VIP.
 30. Requiringdown-paymentshas beencontroversialinGhanaamong donors, some consideringthe
 investmentsshouldbe free. The five percentcontribution fromthe community (andanother five percentfrom
the DA) i s nowusually the norm, thoughsomeNGOs still provide infrastructurefree. The fivepercent
 community contributionappears to be aboutright.Giventhe prevailing low incomes,the five percentis a
 significant contribution, requiringeffortandcommitmentbythe community. Thus, a borehole(well, pumpand
 apron) mighttypically cost aboutUS$8,000. Fivepercentofthis isUS$400.Thisrepresentsthe monthlysalary
 of abouteightbase levelclerical staff, and is evenmoresignificantcomparedwithruralincomes.
 31.Governmentanddonor assistedprojects in Ghanahadtendedto providevillagers with free rural
 infrastructure.This practicereducedownershipbythe communityand its interestinmaintainingfacilities.
 Another comment inthe ICRisthat communitieswouldtendto refer to aboreholeor other infrastructurebythe
 name ofthe donor. The boreholewas consideredbythe communitynotto betheir boreholebutthat ofthe
 contributingdonor.

                                                     17


57.      The Government's decentralization program was substantially aidedby the VIP
(Objective 3). The project was purportedly the only CDD projects inGhana that covered all
of the country's 110 districts, so capacity buildinghad nationalsignificance. Training courses
includedtraining o f all o fthe District Planning Officers and Finance Officers, two key
positions inthe DAs.Also, over 2000 DA staff (the target at appraisal was 200) were trained
inproject implementation andprocurement. One DA ChiefExecutivecommented to the IEG
missionthat "we got more training from VIP than from any other project" (N.B. No
comparison with the CWSP-2 i s intended; since it did not cover this district.). The mission's
discussions with DA andVIP staff corroborated the views expressedinthe ICR and
Beneficiary Surveythat practically all DAshad at least some capacity improvement, and
some to a considerable extent. As withthe CWSP-2, this was from both "learning-by-doing"
under the project and from the VIP's training programs. The mainareas o f improvedcapacity
were planning, financial managementandprocurement, andvarious technical areas.32One
problem area, however, andcommonto all three projects inthis review, was the turnover o f
staff inthe DAs, implyingthat training will needto be a continuous process ifDA or MA
capacity i s to be maintained or to further strengthen. The efticacy o f objective 3 was high.
Based on the ratings for all three objectives, the VIP's overall efficacy was substantial.

EFFICIENCY

58.      The re-estimated ERRfor the project at completionwas 41 percent compared with an
estimated ERR at appraisal o f26 percent.Neithercalculation included the costs o fRICU, but
institutional benefits were also excluded. The viability o fthe project's three physical
components basedon models was estimatedat project completionas: rural water 42 percent;
rural transport 54 percent andpost harvest infrastructure at 29 percent. Efficiency is rated
substantial,onthe assumptionthat, as the program expands, RICUcosts will become a
smaller overhead inthe investmentprogram.

OVERALLPROJECTOUTCOME

59.      The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory,the same as inthe ICR and ICR
Review. The VIP was highly relevantto the Government's decentralization strategy, was
economically viable, and institutionbuilding (DOs 1and 3) was strong, both at grass-roots
andDA levels, eventhoughphysical achievements(D02) were modest.

INSTITUTIONAL       DEVELOPMENT        IMPACT

60.      Institutionaldevelopment impact is rated substantial,the same rating as inthe ICR
Review, though below the highratinginthe ICR. VIP's very considerable achievement was
to support ina major way the Government's decentralization program and to help the
beginning o f"harmonized'y33activities betweenthe supporting government anddonor

32. The VIP also piloted capacity building ofabout60 Area Councils, the administrations belowthe DAs.
Across Ghana, the Area Councilswere seldomeffectively operational. The VIP's pilotingwas reportedly
successful, and could be an examplefor strengtheningArea Councilselsewhere.
33. "Harmonization" has beentakento encapsulateactivities such as: (i)makinggovernment activities, no
matter from which agency, follow an agreedand uniform approval, financingand implementationmodality;
(ii)makingdonoragenciesagreeamongeachotherandwiththegovernmenttoalsoapplyacommonapproach

                                                      18


 agencies. It was one o fthe first projects to promote the decentralization andharmonization
 agenda, andwas pioneeringinits nationwide coverage. The VIP demonstrated that the
 empowered but still nascent DAs could upgrade their capacity, evenifthe degree of
 upgradingwas only a beginningto achievingthe institutional strengththat the DAs
 ultimately need. The project also promoted a large programto establish, empower and
 strengthencommunity organizations.

 61.      Dueto its multi-sector nature, the VIP necessarily hadto coordinate the activities ofa
 numberofdifferent agencies. This was inplace o fthe disparate anddisconnected agendas
 often sponsored by different government agencies. There were also different implementation
 modalities between donor agencies for the same sector. The VIP begana single window
 approachto assisting the DAs with improvedcoordination between agencies. To the extent
 that financing and implementationprocesses can be simplified and generalized (the same
 form for instance, for all disbursement requests, no matter which sector andfinancer) and
 implementation modalities made identicalinany one sector (e.g. uniformity inapplyingthe
 five percent community contributionfor boreholes, and five percent contribution by the
 DAs), thiswill assist the DAs intheir development activities. The VIP's harmonization
 achievementswere partial, and by no means the same across all activities and government
 agencies or donors, but a start was made and an example provided for other programs.


 SUSTAINABILITY


`62.      Thetype o finfrastructure is one factor insustainability risks. Project infrastructure
 such as the water investments (boreholes, irrigation) may have greater likelihood o fbeing
 maintainedthan other infrastructure, as benefits are tangible and felt by each involved
 household, and funds for O&M are more easily collected. Feeder roads will need regular
 maintainingbythe DAs. The roads program i s highly appreciated, andthis may helpto
 ensure funds are made available by the DAs. Tracks are maintainedby communities, and
 experience is variable, some communities steadfastly maintainingthe tracks, others letting
 themgo into disrepair. Markets, ifwell situated, canbe greatly appreciated by users, andthe
 DAs may maintainthem as they provide revenues from market fees. However, probably
 more significant thanthe type o f infrastructureis the soundness o fthe institutions involved.
 The missionwas informed, andalso saw, that where a community was strong, institutionally
 andfinancially, the infrastructure tendedto be well operated andmaintained.

 63.       The importance o fthe institutional capacity o fthe VIP's community organizations
 raises a concern. The IEGmission's review o fthe CWSP-2 boreholes found signs o f
 weakened management (e.g., insufficient funds inthe bank account, irregular meetings, etc.)
 inthe communityinstitutions(paras. 76to 88). Fromthe mission's fieldvisits and
 discussions, the situationfor VIP i s similar to CWSP-2's boreholes. While, for bothprojects,
 strong training was providedbefore and during installationo f a borehole, thereafter there




 (e.g. the 10percentcontributionto investment inboreholes, 5 percenteach from the communitiesandthe DAs);
 (iii)closecoordinationbetweendonors,amonggovernmentagencies,andbetweengovernmentagenciesand
 donors; (iv) single-window provisionof servicessuch as inthe VIP; and (v) progressionto programrather than
 project by projectapproaches, enabling national sector programssupportedbypooled funds.

                                                    19


were minimal routine follow-on visits andtraining by extension                    The mission
discussedwith RICUmanagementwhether follow-on support would behelpful.The view
was affirmative. However, no funds hadbeenprovided underthe VIP's successor project -
the Community BasedRuralDevelopmentProject (CBRDP) for such follow-on support. Due
to the uncertainties resultingfrom the IEGmission's discussions and analysis (which was not
available at the time of project completion), sustainability is rated not evaluable. The ICR
andICRReview bothrated sustainability as likely. An important part ofthe ICR's
conclusionof likely sustainability for the VIP was basedonthe assumptionthat the CBRDP
would provide follow-on support to VIP comm~nities.~~

BANKANDBORROWERPERFORMANCE

64.      The major weakness ofthe Bank andthe Governmentwas the extraordinary gap
betweenBoardapproval andestablishment ofRICU, some 20 months after Board approval
andrepresenting25 percent ofthe plannedproject period (para. 48). UntilRICUwas
established, no project activity could proceed. There was also some over-optimism inthe
assumed rate ofimplementation, contributing to the physical achievements beingonly about
a halfto two-thirds those assumedat appraisal. CDD-type projects, especially when key
institutions have to be establishedfirst, tendto start slowly. Inother respects, the
performanceof boththe Bankandthe Government was strong.

65.      The VIP was highly relevantto the Government's objectives inthe rural sector, which
were also supportedby the Bank.It was path-making inproviding nationwide support to
ruraldecentralizationandharmonization, andto advancingCDD approaches.Boththe Bank
andthe Government recognizedthat institutional development andtraining were as important
as the physical investments, ifnot more so. Investment was not rushedaheadofcapacity
building, eventhough the latter would slow down project implementation. RICU's strong
performancewas a major determinant of the project's success. The Bank's supervisionteams
were complete inthe breadthof specializations, and included institutional and social
specialists as well as capacityinprocurement, finance, engineering, economics and other
specializations. There was goodteamwork betweenthe Government andthe Bank.Boththe
Bank andthe Borrower performanceare ratedsatisfactory, the same as at ICRandICR
Review stages.




34. Underthe demand-drivenmodelfor RWSSdevelopedunder the CWSP andthe CWSP-2,the DistrictWater
andSanitationTeam is availableto visit boreholecommunitiesifrequestedbythe community.Butthe DWST
doesnot systematicallymakeroutinevisitsto all communities.(Thisis discussedinfurther detail inthe CWSP-
2 section.)
35. The followingremarksare made inpages 8 and 9 o fthe ICR: (i)"Sustainability is ratedLikely, as the
successor project, CBRD, hasbeenapprovedbythe Bank's Boardandwill continueto providefunds and
supporttrainingandcapacitybuilding.Itwill reinforcethe abilityofbeneficiariesinplanningandmanaging
their own developmentprojectsreachedatthe closing o fthe VIP." (ii) "However, the approach(CDD) is still
very newfor Ghana, andcommunitiesandassembliesrequiremoretime andexperienceto become fully

 RELEVANCE

 66.       The CWSP-2was highlyrelevant.It sharedwiththe VIP the centrallyrelevant
 objective ofimprovingruralwelfare, a core priority inthe 2000and2004 CASs andinthe
 Government's 2004 PRSP.Access to safe water andimprovedhygieneare core partsofthe
 country's programto achieveits MillenniumDevelopment                         Thereis a strongwelfare

 water and sanitationwas launched inthe early 1990s'and in 1994ruralwater and sanitationwas placed under
 its own specializedand substantiallyautonomous agency, the CommunityWater and SanitationAgency
 (CWSA). The Bank's first ruralwater supply and sanitation(RWSS) project CWSP-successfblly supported
                                                                           -

 add value by helpingto further improvethe nationalprogramandto increasingly align it to Ghana's
 decentralizationobjectives.

development objectives were highly relevant inbeingnecessary and mutually
complementary aspects o f Ghana's RWSSprogram. The investmentprogram under the
project's first D O was supported by three institution strengtheningobjectives, at community,
district and national levels respectively. As with the VIP, an exemplary feature inproject
designwas the major emphasis on institutionaldevelopment. There are, indeed, a number o f
similar operational features betweenthe two projects, andthe issues that eachencountered
also have similarities.

EFFICACY

67.       The efficacy o fthe CWSP-2's first objective (demand responsive and sustainable
investments inRWSS) was high. Physical objectives were more than achieved inall major
investmentcategories as showninAnnex CyTable 2. Some 2800 boreholes were constructed,
three times the appraisal target.37

68.       The efficacy o fthe project's second objective -primarilyto strengthencommunities
to enable them to manage their RWSS facilities -is rated high. A massive training program
was organized by CWSA to train all communities, especially office bearers (presidents,
treasurers, secretaries andvillage mechanics). Investmentdidnot proceed untilsuch training
hadbeen completed. The great majority o f community water and sanitation committees
(WATSANs) started well, with goodcapacity andfimctionality.

69.       The efficacy o fthe third objective -to strengthen DA implementationcapacity -i s
also ratedhigh. This objective was at the heart of the decentralization program, Major
training was providedto staff inthe DAs3*and most DAsestablished a District Water and
Sanitation Team (DWST). These teams comprised an engineer, a CDD/extension officer, and
a hygiene specialist. Inthe mission's discussions with a DA andthe CWSA's Sunyani
RegionWater and Sanitation Team (RWST), bothCWSA andthe DA confirmed the positive
impact on the capacity o f the district administrations to managetheir RWSSprogram. Areas
mentionedby the DA as improved includedRWSS engineering, planning, procurement,
contract management, financial management, CDD approaches and hygiene. There were,
however, comments that refresher training was needed.Further, some comprehensive
training to DWSTs was considered neededon a continuous basis, As withthe UESP andthe
VIP, this was required to deal withthe ubiquitous practice inmost DAsMAs o frotating
staff.

70.      The project's fourth and final objective -to strengthenCWSA's capacity to transition
from a direct provider of RWSS services and investment, to a facilitator was substantially
                                                                                      -

37. This includesboreholes and dug-wells combined.2732 boreholes were establishedand 57 dug-wells,
boreholesbeing muchmore popular with the communities.The correspondingVIP figures for total investments
inpotable water are 1114 boreholesand 454 dug-wells.
38. Major training and capacity buildingwas also providedto the private sector. Some 650 private drillers,
contractors, shopkeeperslsuppliers(for spare parts), area mechanics, and consultants(for subsequentextension
activities) were trained. NGO trainingwas probably less successful. Fieldaccounts and discussionwith other
donor agenciesindicatedthat a numberofNGOspreferredtheir independence,and some practicedalternative
implementationproceduresfor RWSS (a numberprovideRWSS infrastructurewithout requiringcontributions
from the communityand DA). This had a negative impacton government'sharmonization objectives.

                                                     22


achieved. The move from a direct implementerto a facilitator was a major step, calling for
changingthe staff culture andgatheringexperience and skills inCWSA's new role. Like the
VIP, the CWSP-2 was a path-maker inachieving and exemplifying effective
decentralization.From the mission's observationsanddiscussionwith other parties, The
CWSA significantly strengthenedunder the project and it has also been a leader inthe
Government's harmonizationprogram.Various workshops, including participation by the
Bank andother donors, have progressivelybuilt consensusandactiontowards a single
RWSS model, broadly, the model usedinthe CWSP-2.39The final demonstrationof CWSA's
success is that it progressively built its ability to deliver a large RWSS program. CWSA's
investmentactivity went from 200 boreholesin2000, to about 2100 boreholesin2004. The
correspondingfigures for the VIP program were zero in 1999 (before the project's field
implementation hadbegun)to an average of 382 boreholes in2003/2004.

71.     Taking account ofthe achievementsof all four objectives, CWSP-2's overall efficacy
was high.

72.     The Impactof HygieneEducation: The CWSP-2 (inparticular) andthe UESP
included a focus on sanitationandhygienepractices. The UESP includedsanitation
educationinschools, andthe mission's visit to a school inAccra illustrated the benefits that
were possible (para24). A NationalHandWashing Campaignwas fundedunderthe CWSP-
2. The CWSP-2 hygieneprogramis particularly impressive. CWSA considershygiene as a
key and fully integratedelement inits program, whichlinks potable water, sanitation and
hygiene incombination inits sector strategy. Thus, inproject designand implementation,
hygiene promotion was integratedas a core part of CWSA's training of,WATSANs, and in
CWSA's overall support system. The humanresourcesappliedto this were considerable.
Sanitation specialists were includedinCWSA's RWSTs, and, at DA levels, the DWST's
three-personextensionteams includedahealthspecialistas well as the engineer and CDD
specialist. One ofthe outputs of CWSP-2's hygiene technical assistancewas production o f a
hygiene improvementandenvironmental action plan.Basic sanitation practicessuch as the
importanceof hand-washing, clean water andutensils, keeping boreholesand surroundings
clean andweed-free, andbettervillage sanitationpracticeswere promoted. One WATSAN
visited bythe missionhadawoman health representativewho visited a group of different
householdsevery morning to promotebetter hygiene. As discussed inAnnex E, it is likely
that the CWSP-2's hygienepromotionactivities provided substantialadditional benefits, as is
usually found internationally inRWSS projects whichinclude healtheducation. Extending
CWSP-2's attentionto hygiene for all of Ghana's rural andurbanwater supply and sanitation
program would help improve the stagnant (no improvement) health situation inGhanathat is
rightly preoccupyingthe Government (para 3). The VIP didnot include sanitationpromotion,
the emphasis of its boreholeprogram being on the physical investments. Missedbroader
opportunities canbea disadvantageinamulti-activity menuapproach suchas the VIP and
the CBRDP. A single sector approachhas a better opportunity to focus onthe sector and its
associatedadditional opportunities.




39. However, harmonizationinthe RWSS sector is still only partial.NGOs in particular are resistantto
adjustingtheir approaches, and often provide the boreholewithout any contribution from the DAs and
communities.

EFFICIENCY

73.      The CWSP-2's economicrate ofreturnas recalculatedat ICRstagewas 21 percent,
thoughthe cost streamsonly includedthe investmentcosts inwells, excludingthe project's
"sohare" supportwhichmadeup 23 percent of project costs. Actualprojectcosts at
US$32.2millionwere about 15percentaboveappraisalestimatesbutthis increase is mainly
dueto exchangerate changes.Theprojectfar exceededits physicaltargets ina five year
projectperiod(thisperiodincludeda projectextensionof 18months).This is impressive
giventhat CWSA andthe DAshadto learnandbecomeacquaintedwith their newroles, and
the communitiesrequiredmajortraining. WhiletheERRwouldhavebeenmarginalifall

75.      Likethe VIP, the CWSP-2's majoremphasison"software" strengthenedcapacityat

SUSTAIN ABILITY

76.      CWSA's ruralwater supply andsanitationprogram,supportedbythe Bankthrough
two projectsenablinga continuumof support from 1994onwards, hasjustifiablyattracted
internationalinterestbothbecauseofits overallsuccess andbecauseithas employeda
particularlyaccentuated"demand-driven" approachto the RWSS sector. Most RWSS
programsentailat least some"supply-driven" supportto boreholecommunities,whereinthe

of shopkeeperswho, as part oftheir business, stock and sell spare parts for boreholes; and
(iii) the existence ineachDA ofa District Water andSanitationTeam (DWST). This
environment enables an enterprisingWATSANto havefacilities repairedand, for some
expenditure (transport andother costs), to get advice from the DWST. Oncethe initial
intensivetraining is completedat the time ofinstallingthe borehole, supply-drivenextension
i s not systematicallyprovided,and the communities needto beproactive to access all their
needs. The relativemeritsofdemandor supply-drivenapproaches has attractedsome
internationaldebate. The questionthis PPARhas soughtto answer is -will the demand-
drivenmodel, andhence the project, result infunctioningboreholessustainedover time?
And, ifneeded, what adjustmentscouldbemadeto the modelto improvesustainability?

78.      Underthe CWSP-2, the WATSANs startedoffvery well. The intensivetraining
providedsufficient capacityto operatethe borehole andthe WATSAN's activities. Almost
all ofthe CWSP-2water facilities are still operating.However, the bulk ofthe CWSP-2
boreholeswere constructedinthe last two years ofthe project (FY03 and04). Thus, mostof
these wells are less than four years old. Inthe mission's discussionswith CWSA staff, and
also observedbythe missioninthe site visits, pump sets are usuallyrepairedas quickly as
possiblebythe WATSANs. Ifarepairis beyondthe scope of the village mechanic, or a spare
part is required, the spare is bought, or the &ea mechanic sought for, usuallywithintwo to
three days. Further, ifthe WATSAN has insufficient money initsbank account, the mission
was toldthat the requiredmoney is usuallycollectedquickly fromthe families usingthe
well.

79.      Fromthe IEGmission's discussionswith concernedbilateralagencies (DANIDA and
KfW)andwith someRICUandCWSA extensionstaff, from field visits, andfromreviewof
availabledata, the degree to whichthe satisfactory situation describedabove will continue
maybe a risk.41Noarrangementsor funds havebeenprovided, either bythe Governmentor
underthe Bank's follow-onproject, the CBRDP, for follow-onextensionandtraining for the
CWSP-2NIPcommunities. Will the three prongedenablingenvironment be enoughsupport
by itself? Is there needfor a degreeof"supply-driven" provisionoftraining andextension,
where DWST staffor their consultantsregularlyvisit the communities?And ifso, at what
intensity?

 80.     The availableinformationprovidesmixedsignalsregardingthese questions. Onevery
positivefact is that, as ofnow, a highpercentageofthe boreholesare still operating. A large-
 sample            sponsoredbythe WorldBank (Komives andWakemanet al, draft, 2006) of
boreholes over five years old, foundthat 89 percent of sample boreholesinBrongAhafo
regionwere still functioning, andsome ofthese mayhavebeenonly temporarily out of order
dueto abreakdown.The same study foundthat there was little difference inthe percentage
of still functioningboreholesbetweenBrongAhafo -a CWSP/CWSP-2 region andVolta -               -

 41. Two additionalriskshavenotbeenexaminedhere.First, itwill be important for the DAs to maintaintheir
 capacityovertime, which, as for the UESP and the VIP, giventhe staffturn-over problem, may be difficult.
However,the presence ofa follow-on project, CBRDP, which will needto maintainthe implementation
 capacityofthe DAs for new investments,will reduce this risk. Second, fluoride and other naturalcontaminants
 are appearinginthe groundwater ofsome areas, and groundwater pollutionfrom humanactivity is growing.

 Komivesand Wendy Wakeman et al., final draft, 2006).

a regionwith a DANIDA project which, as mentionedabove, hada more "supply-driven"
approachincluding several extensionvisits to eachcommunity a year. Some 94 percent of
boreholeswere functioning inVolta region, only slightly above Brong Ahafo. Thus, at least
inthe shorterterm, the surveyresults are encouraging, suggestinggood sustainability under
the demand-drivenapproach.

81.       However, the fact that almost all of the boreholes inthe above survey are still m i n g
i s not necessarily a sufficient indicator to the situation inthe longer term. Development
experienceandthe extensive international                       on CDD activities, points to a causative
linkage betweenthe strengthof a community organization andthe success of its activities; in
this case, boreholeoperationandmaintenance. Thus, a decline inaWATSAN's social
cohesionandfinancial reserves might increasethe risk of un-repairedbreakdown. Minimal
datais available to test this possibility, but some information found by the IEGmission
suggests that borehole WATSANs might be vulnerableto reducedfunctionality, both
financially and socially.

82.       One source ofindirectinformation was from a small random sample of survey forms
that the missiontook of 40 WATSANs. This was from a muchlarger number of forms with
raw datathat hadrecently beencollected from the field by CWSA's GreaterAccra Region.
Greater Accra regionwas not one ofthe CWSP-2 financedregions, but CWSA's procedures
for training communitiesand establishingboreholes are the same, whether financedunder
C`WSP-2or from other sources.

83.      Table 4 Shows anumber ofparameters from the sample. Only about halfor less of
theWATSANs: (a) heldregular meetings; (b) hadaccountsavailable or upto date; and(c)
collectedmoney from the villagers regularly. Taking the 50% of WATSANs withthe lowest
savings, their average savings are only Cedis 124,000 (US$14). This is not enoughfor major
repairs.

84.       Some information from CWSA's monitoring visits to the WATSANs establishedin
BrongAhafo regionunder the first CWSP is also interestingthough it must be emphasized
that this is not arandom sample. Across four districts with 101WATSANs, 53 ofthem were
visited bythe RWST. The results (Table 4) also indicate possible signs o f weak financial and
socialcapacity.44But as found withthe KomivesNakeman survey, despite the apparent

43. IEG's "Review ofthe Literatureon ParticipatoryApproaches" (BarbaraPozzoniandNaliniKumar, 2005)
commentsthat "evidence from the literaturereviewedon participatorygovernance also pointsto social capital
as a determinantfor successfulcitizens' participationinitiatives.GoetzandGaventa(2001) reviewnumerous
civil-society-ledinitiativesaimedat amplifyingcitizens' voiceto influencepolicy and spending decisions.They
findthat `success stories' are rootedinsocialmovementsandorganizationswhich havebuilt trust andmutual
support amongst their members."
Relativeto Ghana, IEG's report on TheEffectiveness of WorldBank Supportfor Community-Basedand -Driven
Development,2005, illustratesa casewhere strong social capitalenableda communityorganization-the
NangbanyiniNyagsaWomen's Group, SaveluguNantonDistrict, NorthernRegion, Ghana-to succeed within
aBankfinancedprojectthat hadnot goneparticularlywell (The AgricultureSector InvestmentProject, ASIP).
TheIEGreportcommentedonthis as follows: "The success ofthis subprojecthas less to do with the project
(ASIP) thanwiththe existinggroup capacity andthe dynamic personalityofthe group leader."
44. The resultsfrom bothdata sources GreaterAccraRegionandBrongAhafo Regionshould be regardedas
                                      -
tentative only. The GreaterAccraRegionData is a smallsample fromthe much larger samplethat will be
available fromCWSA's forthcominganalysis. The BrongAhafo data are from field monitoringreports intended

weaknesses of a number of the WATSANs, nearly all boreholeswere fbnctioning. Out of the
53 WATSANs, only two were abandoned.

85.     Nevertheless, as discussed above, while the wells are nearly all working now, ifthe
social capital ofthe communities is declining, this could be an augur for a less satisfactory
situation inthe longer term.

86.     The needfor longer term extensionsupport inCDD projectsis perhapsthe most
commonly heldview amongst developmentpractitioners. A 2005 IEGstudy of international
experience with CDD projects4'also supportsthis view. The following comments are made
inthereport's conclusions section: "Bank-supported CBD/CDD projectshavehadmuch
more success    .......where it  has provided consistent long-term capacity-building support to
communities over time." Also, "For individual communities, the Bank's sub-project cycle is
generallytoo short to bring about the kindof enhancement o f community capacity that is
visualized inBank supported CBDICDD, particularly CDD,projects. Further, Bank
processes and systems have not beengearedtoward supporting long-term processessuchas
empowermentand social capital enhancement."

87.     Fromthe findings anddiscussionabove, the information to makea reliablejudgment
of sustainability i s not sufficiently clear at this stage. The recentKomives/Wakeman survey
indicatesthat inthe shorterterm a demand-drivenapproachwithout significant supply side
follow-on extension provides adequate support for communities. This is important as it
appears to reflect the soundnessof the three pronged enabling environment approachinthe
CWSP-2 model. However, other information, the literature andviews expressedto the
missionsuggest caution. The primarymeasure of sustainability inthe study -that the well is
still operating -may not capture the weaknesses ininstitutional and financial functionality
notedfrom other sources. These weaknesses could bethe precursorfor a less satisfactory
situation inthe longer term. Longer term impacts have not yet beenstudied. Furtherreview
would be desirable. Finding out whether the existing demand-drivensupport system ofthe
CWSA model is adequate, or whether, as a supplement, a degree of follow-on support is also
needed, is important to the success ofGhana's RWSS program over the longerterm.46

88. . As concernsa rating for sustainability, given the uncertainty regardingthe future of
the CWSP-2's WATSANs andtheir infrastructure, sustainability is ratednotevaluable.This
assessment is also the basis for the same sustainability rating for the VIP. This compareswith




primarilyas managementtools inCWSA's operations, andare not randomsamples.There are also slight
differencesininterpretation for particular indicators; for instance, inthe GARdata, "regular" meetingsmeansa
frequencyofa meetingeverythree monthsor more, whereas for BrongAhafo this is less specifically defined.

levelscoupledwith availabilityof spare partsat affordablepricesandever growingprivate sector are practical

BANKANDBORROWER              PERFORMANCE

89.      Boththe Bankand Ghana applied a commendable forward vision inconceiving the
project, recognizingthat decentralization and CDD approachesprovided the best chance for
further developmentofthe RWSS sector, andpioneering(withtheVIP) amajor program
supportingthe decentralization policy. This entailedrisk, whichwas taken by bothparties.
Then, the featuresneededfor the newapproach, were designedintothe project, and, inthe
event, the designhas provenappropriate. There was sustained commitment by bothparties.
The Bank, the Government's Ministry of Works andHousingandMinistry ofFinance and
Economic Planning, and CWSA, heldfirm whenunder considerablepressure by other
government interests and donor agenciesto relax the requirementfor a capital contribution to
investmentsby DAsandcommunities. Eventhough disbursementswere very slow inthe
initialproject years, the Bank and CWSA perseveredwith the training andextensionprogram
before investments,rather than succumb to pressures to invest andincrease disbursements
without the necessaryDA andcommunity preparation.

90.      The BankaridCWSA also catalyzedaprocessof change within the donor
community. Discussions andworkshops ledto greater acceptance ofthe new decentralization
and CDD approach. Harmonization of approachesandimplementationmodalities inthe

CWSP-2 model, is significantly underway. The determinedimplementationefforts of CWSA
and, inmost cases, o f the DAs, were facilitated by a number o f Bank actions. The project
team had a good mix o f local and headquartersstaff, the core team remained largely
unchanged throughout implementation, and supervision missions had strengthboth insocial
andtechnical areas. The performances of boththe Bank andthe Borrower were highly
satisfactory. The ICR and ICRReviewbothrated Bank andBorrower performances as
satisfactory. The upgrade inpart recognizes the strong performance o f CWSP-2 inall
implementationaspects. But, particularly notab1e.b the Bank and Borrower achievement in
developing and successfully implementingan innovativedemand-drivedenabling
environment approach. While this approach may needadjustments as experience is gained,
the CWSP-2 modelhas attracted international interest, and its strategic relevance as a
successful model for CDD, inGhana and elsewhere, i s self-evident.

          Projects

M&EDESIGN,IMPLEMENTATION               ANDUTILIZATION

91.       At the beginningof eachproject, "M&E" was more inthe nature o fMIS material.
Project progress was well documented andpresentedinregularquarterly reports. These
reports formed a useful management tool for project implementation. However, data was
almost all quantitative (for example, kilometers o froads or drains achieved, number o f
marketsbuilt or training coursesprovided). The principal shortcomingwas the lack of
measurement of qualitative achievements; for instance, the impact o f a market or feeder road
on community incomes, the impact o f a borehole onvillage healthandthe well-being o f
women, the silt build-upand other maintenance needs o furbandrains, and expenditure levels
onmaintenance. (A more detailed review o f M&E is provided inAnnex D.)

92.       The VIP andthe CWSP-2 M&Eunits further developed their capacity towards the
endofthe projects and subsequentto closure. BothRICUand CWSA have now startedto
undertake surveys collectingqualitative data, andthis should shed light on sustainability and
other issues important to project impact. The UESP's municipalities andthe PUnow have
data on municipal revenues and for expenditures on maintenance o f sanitation infrastructure.
Ifanalyzedinuniformformatandreportedonregularly,thiscouldformagoodbasefor

reported to the IEGmission.48The CWSP-2 ICR comments that an issue that needs
monitoring and actionas neededi s the presenceo f arsenic inthe groundwater insome parts

positive: as examples, improvedurbanenvironments andreduced flood risks; reduced labor

   for women infetching water, andgreater social cohesion and empowerment o fvillage
   communities. Some localized environmental problems have beenreported. The UESP ICR
   reports possible risk o f siltation from the incomplete landfill at Takoradi. The VIP ICR
   reports situations where a feeder road has enabled access by loggers and poachers to forested
   areas, withpredictable results (an environmental screening process has now been
   introduced). On a smaller scale, poor community practices could have deleterious local
   effects; for instance, inadequateweeding around a borehole can obstruct drainage and
   increase the risk of water relateddiseases.

   6.       Decentralizingand Developing Ghana's Water Sector:
            Lessons for the Future

   94.      All o fthe principal lessonsfrom this performance assessmentrelate directly or
   indirectly to Ghana's decentralization program; from the apex organizations and local
   governments to the local communities. While all three projects are inthe water sector, the
   lessons are inmost cases not only relevantto water. They provide lessons for other sectors
   providing local public services inGhana, and for decentralization programs inother countries
   as well.

   95.      All three projects werepath-makers. Underthe UESP a start was madetowards
   decentralization inthe urbanenvironmental sanitation sector. The CWSP-2 andthe VIP took
.  decentralization further, succeeding intransferring implementationto the DAs, and then to
   rural communities. The CWSP-2 andthe VIP decentralized well before nearly all other
   sectors inthe country. The CWSP-2, the VIP and, to a lesser extent, the UESPhave shown
   that decentralization can be successful. Initselfthis i s important as reassuranceto individuals
   andinstitutionsthat are skeptical ofdecentralization. These projects provide a rich
   experience as concerns their specific implementationmodalities, mostly inbest practice, but
   also with lessons stemming from mistakes or problems encountered.

   96.      The lessonsfall under three broad areas. First, from the projects' experiences there
   are a set of lessonsrelatingto what is needed inthe institutionaland policy environment.
   Second, all o f the projects found that major capacitybuildingwas needed. Third,
   sustainabilitywas amajor issue, andneededto be addressedas a priority. Table 5
   summarizes the points co~ered.~'

   1. ANENABLING       INSTITUTIONALAND POLICY ENVIRONMENT


        0   Long-termcommitment:Decentralizationis a long-termprocess, andneeds
            consistent and sustained support inorder to succeed. This has beenthe case inGhana.
            The Government's interest indecentralization started to develop inthe early 199Os,
            well before the three projects commenced. The Bank has consistently supportedthe



   49. It shouldbe emphasizedhere that the points beloware the practicallessons directlyderived fromthe three
   projects reviewed. While the lessons are wide-ranging, they are not intendedto providecomprehensive
   coverageofall issuesrelatedto decentralizationand communitydrivendevelopment.

                                         30


  decentralization agenda, starting inthe mid-199Os,and the 2004 CAS emphasizes
  continued support.

  A demand-drivenapproachincludingbeneficiarycontributions:The CWSP-2
  and the VIP were implementedthrough a demand-driven approach requiringDAs and
  the communities to select themselves as project participants. Inparticular, they
  requiredanup-front financial contribution from the DA and community. The project
  experience has found this to be important: for DAs to demonstrate their commitment;
  for creating community ownership o fthe facilities; andto helpreduce the "cycle o f
  dependency" (expecting everything fiee) which hastendedto prevail inGhana's rural
  societies.

0 Agreed institutionalroles: These needto be clear andagreed. The VIP involveda
  numberofdifferent ministriesandagencies. Their roles and specific responsibilities
  were clearly defined. This was thenformally agreed inMemorandums of
  UnderstandingbetweenRICUandeach agency. The projects also established the
  responsibilities o f the PU, CWSA or RICU relative to those o fthe MASor DAs.For
  thetwo ruralprojects (the CWSP-2 andthe VIP), clear rolesbetweenthe DAsandthe
  communities also hadto be defined andwidely understood.

0 Clear andwidely distributed"rules of the game": Understandingwhat to do and
  how to do it is key many new actors are involved andthey needto operate
                        -
  effectively. The Pxoject Operation Manuals (POMs) for boththe VIP andthe CWSP-
  2 were clear, detailed, anddistributed to all staffand agencies with implementation
  roles. Hence, there was sound guidance and minimalambiguity at all levels. The
  CWSP-2 went further. After the POM (primarily for CWSA staff), there was thena
  D O M(District Operation Manual) for the DAs, andthena C O M (Community
  OperationManual). Thus, the DAs and Communities had focused material
  specifically needed for them.

0 Harmonizedimplementationmodalities:The borehole programs underthe CWSP-
  2 andthe VIP commenced a harmonizationprocess, bothamong donors andamong
  differentgovernment departments. The progress made, while only partial, hasbegun
  to exempli@ the advantages o fharmonized implementation. Previously, eachdonor
  tended to have its own implementationmodalities, andprojects even overlapped
  geographically. This confusedthe DAs and communities. Progressively, donors and
  government have been convergingtowards a single implementation model; for
  instance, for boreholes, essentially the CWSA model. This inturnwill facilitate
  further harmonizationto programapproaches, withcombined and simplified donor
  assistance.

0 Minimalpoliticalinterference: Caseswhere localpolitical interests have influenced
  borehole committee membership have beenreported, which would not necessarily
  enhancethe committees' social cohesion and capacity. Processesto minimize local
  politicalinfluences would be desirable.

2. A MAJOR DRIVETOBUILDIMPLEMENTATIONCAPACITY

   0 Software, and software first: Capacity buildingshould be emphasized as muchas or
     more than infrastructure, and most capacity buildingshould be done up-front. The
     CWSP-2 andthe VIP emphasizedsohare (training, extension, technical assistance)
     for capacity building.Further, for every DA and every community, the capacity
     buildingwas done before the infrastructure. For communities, completionofthe
     requiredtraining andformation oftheir committees were mandatory before any
     construction. These two projects, andthe UESP, providedsubstantial training for the
     DAsor MASandfor the communities inthe case o f the rural projects.

   0 Massive training: Trainingwas massive. For the two CDD projects, training covered
     all actors: communities, DAs, andprivate mechanics and suppliers o f spare parts. The
     UESPhadintensivetraining for the MAS'Waste Management Departments.The scale
     ofthe training considerednecessaryfor the CDD projects bears emphasizing for other
     decentralizationprojects. The CWSP-2 trained over 3800 communities, groups or
     individuals. The VIP, covering all o f Ghana's districts andrequiringa greater rangeo f
     skillneeds, hadsome 5800suchtrainings.

   0 Strong central coordination: Strong central coordination and guidance is necessary.
     Thevery natureofdecentralization meansthat manyinstitutions haveto quickly master
     their new responsibilities. Eachproject hada strong coordination unit:the PUfor the
     UESP, RTCU for the VIP and CWSA for the CWSP-2. Eachmanaged to provide the
     MASor DAswiththe necessarysignificant training andtechnical assistance.

   0 M&Eto facilitate programadaptation: Capacity to assessandprovidefeedbackto
     managementonproject impacts is needed. M&E for all three programs was not
     sufficiently developed duringproject implementation to inform management onproject
     impacts andissues. Thus, had CWSA's M&Ebeenstrong, issues such as the needor
     otherwise for follow-on supportto communities would be clearly known, whereas,
     even now, this remains a question. Underthe UESP, the PUandmunicipal WMDs,
     could have hadmonitoringsystems providingregular reports onthe state o f
     maintenance and funds. This mighthave helpedbetterdecision makingbythe
     municipalities regardingboththe allocation o f funds andthe needfor increased
     municipal revenues.

   0 Development of private sector service providers: The CWSP inparticular included
     trainingofinterestedindividuals to beprivate mechanics, andfacilitated the
     development of a network of shopkeepersto stock andsell spare parts for boreholes.
     Over 650 private individuals or entities were trained. These included: drillers,
     contractors, consultants, mechanicsandother privateparties where capacity
     enhancementwas neededto foster the development o fa private sector support network.

   0 Includinghygiene education: The CWSP-2 (inparticular) andthe UESP included
     education inhygiene practices. For the CWSP-2 ,this was a fully integratedpart o fthe
     trainingofthe WATSANs. A healthspecialist was included ineachDWST's extension
     team (the other two were anengineeranda CDD specialist). Significant improvements
     incommunityhealthwerereportedbyseveralWATSANs visited. Hygieneeducation

                                              32


     initiativesby an urbanschool were considered important. Hygiene education and
     extension i s anatural concomitant inwater supply and sanitation programs. The costs
     of includinghygieneeducation are usually modest relative to thebenefits.

3. MAKING SUSTAINABILITY A CENTRAL FOCUS

   0 Prioritizingrevenuesfor O&M financing: For the urbanwater and sanitation sector
     O&M fundingneedsto be atop priority. The UESPwas well designedand
     implemented from anengineering perspective, butthe primary issue for the U W S S
     sector-inadequaterevenues andfinancial allocations for O&M, and, consequently,
     inadequate O&M -was not tackled. Itwould havebeenbetter to have placed as much,
     or even more, attention to the fundinglO8zh.lissue as to the physicalworks.

     Creatingself-sustaining support services: This i s importantto ultimate success. The
     CWSPmodelisparticularlyinteresting. Three needswere identifiedto provide long-
     term support to borehole communitiesunder a demand-driven approach: (i)        availability
     o fspareparts, (ii)availability o fprivate mechanics, and (iii)
                                                                   availability o ftechnical
     assistanceon a demand basis. The CWSP-2's promotiono ftheprivate sector rather
     thangovernment asthe long-termproviderto communities ofspareparts and
     mechanics, is more likelyto be sustained over time than services reliant on
     government.

     Follow-on training for localgovernments: Giventhe chronic Ghanaianproblemo f
     turn-over of govemment staff, the follow-on project to the VIP and CWSP-2-the
     CBRDP will needto provide refresher trainingfor the DAs as well as training for the
               -
     CBRDP's specific implementationneeds, The sameneedispresent for the UESP,
     thoughthe follow-on UESP-2maybe able to providethe necessarytrainingfor the
     W M D S .

   0 A possibleneed for follow-on training for communities: Neitherthe CWSP-2nor
     theVIP, northe designofthe commencingfollow-on project, CBRDP; included
     continuedtechnical support (extension visits, refresher training) to the community
     organizations. At thisjuncture, it is not clear whether the communities' social cohesion
     andfinancial strengthsare decliningor remainingstrong. Morefieldassessmentsare
     neededto assess on-the-ground realities andwhat may or may not beneededto address
     the situationthat is found.

Annex D. Monitoring and Evaluation

All three projects' M&E systems improved over the project period, andthere has beensome
furtherdevelopment since project closures.Muchofthe "M&E" tendedto bemore inthe
nature of management information systems (MIS), and developedto be good inthis respect.
Information on the progress ofthe project interms of its physical implementationwas
generallythorough: for example, information such as the progress of contractingand
implementationofworks for the UESP; kilometers of roadsrehabilitatedfor the VIP;
WATSANs establishedandboreholesconstructedfor the CWSP-2; andother progress
indicators. The universally weak area was inM&Eof the qualitative achievements of each
project. For example, the degree to which a rural market or a feeder road is usedand
appreciated, andtheir effects on incomes; the functioning of boreholecommittees andthe
degree to whichthey are collecting revenues for O&M; health impacts; andthe status and
funding of O&M.

M&EIN PROJECTDESIGN:

The UESP didnot havea specifically designatedM&Eunit,but each city producedgood
technical (quantitative) data, whichwas further consolidatedfor the project as a whole bythe
PU. However, for the project's secondDevelopment Objective -on establishinginstitutional
and financing mechanismsfor sustainability, a regular monitoring systemwas not
established.

The VIP started weakly, withpoor performance ofthe consultants contractedto prepare a
MISandM&Esystem. The initialsystemthat was eventually establishedtendedto be
quantitative innature. Itwas useful as amanagementtool but lacking inprovidingbetter
understandingo fproject impact. A baseline survey was done, but severalyears after project
commencement.

The CWSP-2 developedregular managementreports on project progressandestablished
MISofficers ineachofCWSA's 10regions.Again, datacollectedandreportedtendedtobe
quantitative, focused on physical project progress, but was useful for project implementation.
Themonitorable indicators establishedat appraisalwere far too numerousandanumber
difficultto measure. This problem was rectified at mid-termreview.

M&EINIMPLEMENTATION

For the UESP, reporting was quarterlyandformed a good information base for the WMDs,
the PU, the Governmentandthe Bankto monitor the project's physical implementation.
Monitorable indicators hadnot beenincludedinthe original project design, but were
retrofitted during project implementation. However, such retrofitting didnot rectifythe M&E
designweakness concerning lack of qualitative indicators. The ICRcontainsno data
describingthe status of O&M andO&M funding.

TheVIP initially establishedits M&Eteam (one staffinthe field for eachofRICU's four
zones, and one central coordinator) using staff secondedfrom government. These staffwere

                                              46                               Annex D


paidsignificantlylessthanRICU's consultants, andwere unmotivated. After a periodof staff
turnover andweak performance,the team was newly staffed, entirely with consultants.
Thereafter, thoughthe M&E unit hadto deal with a backlogofunanalyzeddata, and other
laggingaspects, performanceprogressively improved, to become goodby the endofthe
project.RICUdevelopeda computerizedMIS-the "Village Infrastructure Management
InformationSystem" (VIMIS), whichwas a useful base for buildingandimplementingits
MIS/M&E system. The VIP was the only projectto commissiona consultant's study ofthe
project.This "Beneficiary Assessment" (July 2003) provideduseful qualitative data for
evaluatingthe project, though, as it was at the endofthe project, it was moreusefulfor post-
projectactivity
CBRDP     - than- particularlyfor theICR andfor preparingthe VIP's follow-on project,
                for implementationofthe VIP.

The CWSP-2progressivelyimprovedits MIS/M&E system. As withthe other two projects,
datawas useful as a projectmanagementtool. An impressivefeature of CWSA's M&E
programis its developmentafter the project, with financial help from DANIDA. CWSA
developeda more qualitativeevaluationsystem, with bettercapacity to measureproject
impactandto developinsightsonissues suchas sustainability.Thesub-sampleof survey data
inTable4 ofthe maintext, from acountry-wideongoingCWSA survey, isanillustrationof
the kindof data startingto beincludedinCWSA's program.The CWSA i s also introducinga
"Monitoring of Operations andMaintenance" (MOM) system. This is as muchanextension
tool as a M&Eprocess, but is an encouragingdevelopment.The MOMScouldbe a precursor
o f a follow-onextensionprogram, as discussedinthis PPAR's discussionofCWSP-2's
sustainability .

M&EUTILIZATION

As indicatedabove, all three projectmanagements, and, to a degree, the decentralized
governmentstructures (the DAs andMAS)usedthe MISdatathat was collectedto report on
projectprogress, andalso as a managementtool for follow-upactionbasedonthe data
findings.

Forthe UESP, informationwas beingcollectedonmunicipalandWMD financing. This
providescapacity for detailedanalysis ofthe financialsituation andconstraints.This was
foundbeingusedby bothKumasiandinAccra, but analysisdidnot appearto beprovided
regularlyandina uniformandorganizedpresentation, whichwouldenableeasy comparison
over time andbetweencities. Itwouldbe usefulto take these initiativesfurther inshort
formalizedreports,perhapspreparedquarterlyor semi-annuallyby each city. Suchreports
couldsystematicallyanalyzeandreportoncity andWMD revenuesandexpenditures and
reportonthe statusof O&M andO&M needs.This wouldprovidea base for reviewand
actionsinthese critical areas. The UESP's follow-onproject, UESP-2, couldprovidea
 sourceoffinancingfor these activities.

Forthe VIP, RICUhasmaintainedmost of its M&Estaff, andhascontinuedto developthe
VIP's MIS/M&E system, whichis nowbeingfinancially supportedunderthe CBRDP. A
CBRDPbaseline surveyhasbeenprepared.Datais nowbeingcollectedonqualitative
aspects ofthe VIPKBRDP program.RICUhas drafted a M&E manual, and is developinga
"results- based"M&E system, linkedwith the CBRDP logframe andmonitorableindicators.

                                             47                              Annex D


A strongMIS/M&Esystemis developing.The development ofqualitative dataonprogram
performanceis underway.With such, andalso applicable to the UESPand CWSA programs,
a base for adjustingprojectmodalities inresponseto the performancefindings of M&E
would bepresent.

Concerningthe CWSA, as indicatedabove and applicable to all three projects, an important
usageofCWSA's datawas as a basic managementtool on the status ofproject
implementation. CWSA's further progresssince projectclosure, to planningandnow
implementingsurveys aimedat assessing qualitativeas well as quantitative aspectsof
implementation, will enablebetter evaluationofprogramimpact.Forinstance,the as yet
undeterminedassessment ofsustainability for the CWSP-2 andthe VIP boreholes(rated"not
evaluable") will be substantially illuminatedas the recently compiledCWSA survey results
are analyzed.

 Annex E. The Benefitsfrom IntegratingPreventiveHealthwith
Water and SanitationInvestments

Boththe CWSP-2 and the UESP includeda focus on hygiene. Inthe case o f CWSP-2,
hygienewas a core andfully integrated part ofits program. This appears to have had
 significant impact.

 One of the CWSP-2's activities was the provisiono f financial support to Ghana's part of a
multi-country Hand-washing Campaign. Ghana hada national campaign, including use o f
television andradio, to promote hand washing and better hygienepractices, andthis was
reported to have beensuccessful. Hygiene education was also integrated into school
curricula. The UESP's community infrastructure (slum upgrading) program also hadhealth
benefits. Citizens ina community visited by the missionreported reduced incidence o f water
related diseases(malaria, diarrhea, typhoid and cholera) since the sanitation and drainage
 facilities had beeninstalled.

UnderCWSP-2, bothCWSA's RegionalWater and Sanitation Teams (RWSTs) andthe
DA's District Water and Sanitation Teams (DWSTs) hadhygienestaff. A DWST would
normally comprise an engineer, a CDD specialist and a healthspecialist. According to both
CWSA and Bank staff, the strategy was to integrate, as a triad, water, sanitation and
preventivehealth. The CWSP-2's WATSANtraining includedbasic hygienepractices such
as handwashing, clean w.ater, keepingboreholes andtheir surroundings clean and free of
weeds, and better village hygiene practices.

One WATSAN visitedby the IEGmission illustrated some o fthe benefits o f including
hygienetraining andextension inRWSS. The WATSAN hada female healthrepresentative
who said she spent one hour every morningvisiting households andtalking to the women
about hygiene practices. The villagers commented that the hygieneactivities were useful.
Attention to weedingandpotential sources o fmosquitoes, clean pumps and surrounds, hand
washing, clean water and other practices were reported to have reduced the incidence of
water borne diseases

Anurbanschoolvisitedillustratedthe interest andpotentialimpact o fhygieneeducation.
Without any govenunent or donor funds, the headmistress hadprovidedwashbasins and soap
outside every classroom, and intendedifaffordable to install runningwater. Inher view, the
'value o fthis was as much interms o fhygiene education for the future as inthe better health
conditions specifically providedbythe washbasins. The school also had a healthand
sanitation teacher.

The VIP only marginally includedhygiene promotionwith its RWSS program. The VIP's
borehole programwas, likethe project's name, primarilytreated as an investment program.
Reduced benefibcanbe expected. This kindo f situation is one o fthe potential drawbacks o f
multi-component, single window programs such as the VIP. The multiple activities that are
sponsored may not enable sufficient concentration on eachparticular sub-program.

The reportgenerally reflectson the CWSP 2; itsfocus, objectives, achievements and
challenges.


(a)   However,the last sentence, paragraph 16,"Likethe VIP, the sustainability of the
      CWSP 2's infrastructureand community organizationsis a question"  - (page4)  is not a
      reality on the ground.Among other things, the intensive Communitydevelopment
      activitiesand well organized institutionalstructuresat both community and district
      levels coupled with availability of spare parts at affordablepricesand ever
      growing privatesector are practicalpre-requisitesto promotesustainability.



(b)   Last sentence  -paragraph  76 "A DANIDAfunded projectin Ghanaexemplifiesthe
      supply-sideapproach"should bedeleted. Forthe current DANIDAassistedWSS
      "District BasedWSS" has severaltenets of "demanddriven"than "supply-driven". This
      projectwas launched in 200314.The phase IIof DANIDA Projectwhichwas executed
      aroundthe same'timeas CWSP-2was also basedon demand-driven approaches.

Dear George,

Thanks for the IEG report. The IEG may be right in identifyingO&M as an important issue relevant for
the sustainability of investments. However,we expect an evaluationto be based on original PLAN,
rather than an alternate plan that the authors consider relevant. Para 40 of the report States'I
...minimal attentionwas placedon O&Mfinancing by both Bank and Government.Yet this was the
projects key issue". This statement, in our view, attempts to misrepresentthe project as originally
designed, and thereby evaluate it as unsatisfactory.

UESP 1was largely intendedto provide Urban EnvironmentalSanitationfacilities such as storm
drains, Sanitary Landfills, household/schools/publicsanitation which had been determined to be
lacking after a Bank urban sector study. We had expectedthe report to recognizethis in the
evaluation, ratherthan attempt to redefinewhat the project should have set out to do.

There is always the possibilityof designing a new project specifically to address urban infrastructure
O&M issues as is being proposed under UESP2. We have always emphasizedthat there is a need
for a free standing Institutionaldevelopment programme, that addresses staffing, revenue
mobilization and utilization,and O&M in all our urban towns. Such a project should not necessarily be
tied to any infrastructurecomponents. This is importantsince institutionalchanges are difficult, take
a long time, and are influenced by many many factors beyondthe scope of any particular project.

You may wish to review your findings accordingly.
