The following are some lessons of\n            experience: 1) The project utilized a large number of\n            indicators, which were not always easy to measure, and did\n            not promote efficiency in the management of the project.\n            This reflects the trend that projects formulated more\n            recently have a) fewer and b) easier-to-measure indicators.\n            2) For community-driven development (CDD) projects,\n            micro-project implementation depends on demand from\n            communities. It is therefore difficult, and sometimes\n            self-defeating, to predict the quantity of micro-projects\n            that communities will request. The targets predicted are\n            difficult to attain, or alternatively, can be substantially\n            exceeded; this is mitigated by reviewing the indicators as\n            projects progress, or, at Mid-term Review (MTR). On the\n            other hand, the indicators chosen can be just qualitative in\n            nature. 3) A large amount of capacity building and training\n            is essential, even in an infrastructure project, to ensure\n            optimal use of the infrastructure provided. Without\n            institutional strengthening and capacity building, a project\n            can fail in its original objectives (e.g. a dam built for\n            irrigation can be used for drinking water only, making\n            sub-optimal use of a large investment). This demonstrates\n            that infrastructure development alone cannot lead to\n            sustainability. The project demonstrated that approximately\n            half of recipients are able to carry out their own planning,\n            and subprojects as a result of the training provided by the\n            project. However, the remaining half requires additional\n            training, and, institutional strengthening and capacity\n            building also led to communities taking control of their\n            development. Other lessons address, and/or reinforce the\n            importance of project ownership, of maintenance planning,\n            and, of an integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene education."}, "docdt": "2004-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
