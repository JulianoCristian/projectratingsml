Description        The proposedoperation is designed to helpthe Government o fRwanda implement key
                   policy actions outlined in its July 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
                   which focuses on (a) creating a favorable private sector investment c h u t e that would
                   promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; fb) improving
                   quality, coverage, and equity of basic service delivery through improved expenditure
                   efficiency; and (c) supportingoverall improvement o f public expendituremanagement
                   and governance, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability to citizens'
                   voice and participation. In line with this agenda, the proposed PRSC Isupports the
                   Government's efforts to (a) stabilize the macroeconomic framework and advance the
                   privatization program; (b) develop a result-oriented Medium-Term Expenditure
                   Framework (MTEF) approach to budgeting, including the development of sectoral
                   MTEFs, particularly ineducation, health, water, and energy, and pilot performance-
                   based contracting agreements for provision o f services in these sectors; and
                   (c) strengthen governance and transparency, particularly through an improved
                   fiduciary framework and establishment o f the Office of the Ombudsman, along with
                   associatedelection of localmediators.
Benefits           This programmatic operation would support the implementation o f a PRSP that has
                   been prepared in a participatory manner, with strong country ownership. Benefits
                   would accrue to the population overall, with a particular focus on poor people inboth
                   rural and urban areas. By supporting Government efforts to promote a favorable
                   private sector investment climate to foster growth, and efforts to improve the fiduciary
                   framework and transparency and accountability, the proposed PRSC aims to
                   strengthenthe ability of central and local government to improve delivery and increase
                   equitable access to basic services, with a view to achieving MillenniumDevelopment
                   Goals, particularly in human development. PRSC preparation has also accelerated
                   donor harmonization efforts; all donor partners havebeen involved inpreparation, and
                   the African Development Bank is closely aligning its budget support to the PRSC. In
                   addition, the Partnership Framework for Harmonization and Alignment of Budget
                   Support, signed by budget support donors and the Government, aims to ensure
                   predictable andtimely support at reducedtransaction costs.
Risks              The risk posed by regional instability is not insignificant. The Bank supports

1.       This proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) is designed to help the Government
of Rwanda (GoR) achieve the goals outlined in its July 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) and meet MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) related to PRSP objectives.' The proposed
PRSC Iwould directly support the GoR's budget as part o f a three-year program (PRSC I,                  PRSC 11,
and PRSC III) PRSP implementation through2007.
                covering
2.       The proposed PRSC focuses on helping the GoR to reduce poverty by strengthening the
macroeconomic situation to foster sustainable delivery o fbasic services. The fiamework for the PRSC
series addresses growth and human development through a holistic, cross-sectoral approach, in line
withthe GoR's PRSP. EachPRSC inthe series would support implementationofkeypolicymeasures
and expenditure programs aimed at (a) creating a favorable private sector investment climate that
would promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; (b) improvingthe quality,
coverage, andequity inthe delivery of basic human development services, and increasing expenditure
efficiency; and (c) enhancing public expenditure management and governance, with an emphasis on
expanding the voice and participation o f citizens.
3.       Ensuring that Rwanda remains on a path o f economic and social progress is key to sustaining
achievements since the 1994 genocide and increasing the stability of the Great Lakes region.
Rwanda's transition from conflict to peace and development and its ability to implement its PRSP
require substantial development assistance. The proposed PRSC series would build on significant
achievements in public expenditure management reform, fiduciary transparency, service delivery
performance, and reconciliation and unity made by Rwanda between 1995 and 2004. It would also
assist Rwanda in sustaining an adequate macroeconomic framework. A blend of grant-credit support
under the proposed PRSC is essential for Rwanda to sustain its economic and social recovery and
transform its economy, including developing exports to address debt sustainability concerns and
reduce dependence on foreign aid.
4.       To this end, the GoR, with support under the proposed PRSC, i s developing andimplementing
a comprehensive export promotion strategy. Inthe near term, agriculture will play a key role, and the
GoR i s concentrating on agricultural transformation to feed into the strategy and to boost rural
incomes to increase demand for non-farm products and services. Simultaneously, the GoR is
concentrating on creating the policy and regulatory environmentto encourage development of private
sector enterpllses and, thus, private-sector led growth. This includes continuation of privatization of
publicly-owned enterprises, improvements to the environment for doing business, and reform of the
financial and banking sector.
5.       The PRSC also focuses on sustaining and deepening the progress made by Rwanda on human
development, because a healthy and educated population is one of the most promising resources for
growth. The proposed PRSC program would support the GoR's efforts aimed at integrating better
delivery of services in four sectors that are key to achieving MDGs-education, health, water, and
energy-by     addressing policy, regulatory, and capacity constraints inthese sectors? Ineach of these
' Rwanda's PRSP and its implementation is fully owned and driven by the GoR. Followingpublicationof the PRSP in
  2002, the GoR worked to develop amoreaction-orientedPRSP policy matrix during 2003 and into 2004. This was done
  inclose collaborationwith developmentpartners, includingthose providingassistance inthe form of budget support (the
  United Kingdom's Department for Intemational Development (DFID), the European Union (EU), the Afi-ican
  Development Bank (AfDB), Sweden (SIDA), and the World Bank), and partners providing support through sector
* investment/progamapproachesandprojects(Belgium, Germany, USAID, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA).
  Investmentsinthe water andenergy sectorswill beprovidedthrough investmentoperations, which are beingimplemented
  and/or preparedintandemwith the proposedPRSC.

sectors, results-orientated budgeting, through the use of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), public expenditure management, and transparency and accountability would be addressed.
Actions inthe education andhealth sectors are fully integrated into the proposed PRSC I,  while for the
water and energy sectors the focus is on preparatory work (e.g., strategy development, costing o f
scenarios). PRSC 11would be expected to engage fully in actions in all four sectors, and PRSC El
would aim to scale up service delivery inthese sectors.
6.       The proposed PRSC Iwould provide a credit of SDR10.3 (US$15 million equivalent) and a
grant o f SDR34.3 (US$50 millionequivalent) to help cover Rwanda's remaining fiscal year (FY) 2004
financing gap and support Rwanda's FY2005 financingneeds.
7.       Several diagnostic studies o f Rwanda's fiduciary framework have been carried out, including
a Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP, akin to a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment), a Public Expenditure Management Review (PEMR),                    a Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS), and a Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP, akin to a
Country Procurement Assessment Review). Based on these studies, Rwanda's fiduciary framework
has been assessed as sound, though improvementsto strengthen it have been identified. The proposed
PRSC i s supportingthe GoR to implement the recommendedimprovements.
8.       Support provided under the proposed PRSC and budget support from other development
partners has been prepared andwill be implemented as part o f the GoR's budget cycle, a process that
i s being institutionalized through the Partnership Framework for Harmonization and Alignment o f
Budget Support, a memorandum o f understanding signed in November 2003 between the GoR and
donors providing budget support. The Framework statesthat donors agree to harmonize their practices
inregardto (a) methods andtimingfor the Government's annualPoverty Reduction Strategy reviews;
(b) criteria for evaluating macroeconomic performance; and (c) requirements for public financial
management and governmental fiduciary arrangements. This approach is a major change from the way
donor assistance has previously been provided to the GoR, and should allow for improved
predictability o f aid flows and an increase ininstitutional resources directedtoward substantive (rather
than procedural) matters. In addition, the PRSP policy matrix-from           which the PRSC matrix is
directly drawn-will     help the GoR and donor partners focus policy dialogue and prioritize actions for
support.
9.       Proposed PRSC program results would be monitored through key indicators associated with
progress in poverty reduction, such as macroeconomic stability and growth, time-lag to open a
business, primary school completion rates, immunization coverage, use o f bed nets, number andrates
of assisted deliveries, access to clean water, frequency o f hand-washing, and reduction in electricity
shortages. Traditional statistical monitoring o f progress would be complemented with beneficiary
assessments and feedback from stakeholders through focus groups, consultations, and citizen report
Cards.

                II. EconomicDevelopmentsandMacroeconomicOutlook
                     Recent

A. Country Context
10.      Rwanda is a poor country facing severe structural constraints. Its GNI per capita is US$230
and its population of 8.2 million is growing annually at the rapid rate o f 2.9 percent. It is still
addressing the legacy o f the 1994 genocide, in which close to one million people were killed, two
million people were driven into exile, over a hundred thousand people were put in prison, and
thousands o fpeople were handicapped physically andmentally. The destruction o f capital that ensued,
along with declining investment and low productivity, reduced government income and revenue and
increasedpoverty.
11.      Over the last 10years, Rwanda has made a remarkable transition from genocide to peace and
development. The GoR has worked to lead the country out o f conflict and into rehabilitation,
reconstruction, and recovery. Many refugees have returned and the reconciliation process has

 progressed significantly. Between 1995 and 2002, the average annual GDP growth rate was 9.3
 percent. Financed largely by donor funds, reconstruction efforts have been strong. Public investment,
 mostly for reconstruction, has picked up and is currently estimated at 6.8 percent of GDP. Private
 investment increased to 12 percent o f GDP by 2002, and was estimated at 12.8 percent in 2003.
 Rwanda has taken huge strides toward improving social services, reducing gender disparities, and
 initiating a serious effort to attack HIV/AIDS. Health indicators have improved steadily and are
 reaching pre-genocide levels. At all levels o f education enrollment rates have increased, with net and
 gross enrollments surpassing pre-genocide levels and primary school enrollment o f girls on par with
 that o fboys.
 12.      In addition to economic rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, the GoR has invested
 significantly in addressing the causes of genocide, including mainstreaming dialogue and creating
 institutions that promote national reconciliation and build social capital and local capacity for
 governance. Since 1998, Rwandans have discussed their peace and development challenges most
 prominently through the Village Urugwiro (traditional public meetings), consultations o f the National
 Unity and Reconciliation Commission (UJRC), and most recently the PRSP. National dialogue,
 resettlement and reintegration o f genocide victims (including refugees and internally displaced
 persons), adjudication o f the cases o f genocide suspects, poverty reduction, and good governance have
 been recognized as prerequisites for national reconciliation. Dialogue under the UJRC and the PRSP
 process helped to sharpen the linkages between the different challenges faced by the country, build
I

 consensus on strategies and actions, and monitor and evaluate results. To foster citizens'
 empowerment, the National Assembly adopted decentralization laws inlate 2000 and early 2001, and
 elections for offices innew district administrations were held inMarch 2001. Decentralizedentities
 came into being thereafter, and in May 2003 a new Constitution was approved in a national
 referendum. This paved the way for national elections in August 2003, which the international
 communityjudged as free andfair.
 13.      While impressiveprogress has been made, significant challenges remain. Regonalinstability
 remains a threat to peace and development. Rwanda is also likely to have serious difficulty inattaining
 the MDGs. Access to safe sources o f water in rural areas remains low. Primary school participation
 rates are high, butthe completionrate i s low by international standards andRwanda's repetitionrate is
 among the highest inthe world. Highfertility rates combined with poor nutritioncontribute to placing
 poor children and women at great risk o f disability and early death. Current estimates o f under-five
 mortality and maternal mortality rates are among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
 Additionally, Rwandai s heavily affectedbythe HIV/AIDS epidemic.

 B. RecentEconomic Developments

 14.      Per capita exports are much lower than the average for SSA. Rwanda's revenue base has
 increased, though it i s also low by regional standards: 8.7 percent o f GDP over 1995-1997 and 11
 percent over 2000-2002, versus an average o f 17.7 percent in SSA. In2002, private investment was
 estimated at 12percent o fGDP, roughly the same level as other countries inthe region. Farm incomes
 remain lower than in the pre-genocide period, and the average size o f farms has decreased due to
 population growth, while productivity has remained flat. This has compounded the long-standing
 problem o f production being primarily consumed on the farm rather than sold in local markets,
 reducingpotential income that couldsupport the non-farm rural sector.
 15.      The Rwandan economy i s based on agrlculture, which i s estimated to account for 41 percent
 o f GDP. Services account for 38 percent, consisting o f wholesale and resale trade invarious products,
 transportation, andpublic administration. Industry accounts for 21 percent o f GDP, with roughly half
 of this share attributed to manufacturing and the other half to construction. The majority o f
 manufacturing firms are small. The larger establishments are principally engaged in production or
 processing o fbeer, soft hnks,tobacco, cement, textiles, tea, and coffee. Thus, the economy is heavily
 dependent on the primary sector, with industry strongly tied to processing o f primary products (i.e.,
 agrlcultural productionfor inputs).

                                                      4

16.      There are three principal structural constraints inthe economy: the country i s landlocked, the
quality o f the roads network and transportation is low (a transport project i s currently under
preparation), and there i s limited availability or access to water and energy, which increasesthe cost o f
production. In addition, critically low lake levels at the hydroelectric plants coupled with rising
demand have recently led to an energy crisis, with rationing and rotating power cuts across the
country. Moreover, Rwanda is vulnerable to external shocks arising from regional conflicts, weather,
fluctuations ininternationalprices o f tea and coffee (which account for about 60 percent o f Rwanda's
exports), and aid dependency.Although Rwanda's involvement inthe war inthe Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) appears to be winding down, the high costs of the war and regonal instability
continue to hinder economic growth?
17.      Despite structural rigidities, continued improvement in security after the genocide and strong
Government commitment to reforms led to strong economic growth until2003. The period from 1995-
2002 was one o f systematically high growth, ranging from an average annual growth rate o f 11.4
percent between 1996 and 1998 to 8.1 percent between 2000 and 2002. This, coupled with low and
stable inflation, made Rwandaone of the best performers inSSA (see Table 1). Through improvedtax
policy and administration, revenue performance reached 13.5 percent o f GDP in 2003, up from 9.7
percent in2000. Duringthis period, agriculture and constructionwere the main sources of growth.
18.      In2003, estimates show that GDP growth fell to 2.4 percent, while inflation rose to 7.4
percent (compared to 9.4 percent GDP growth and 2 percent inflation in 2002). The poor level of
growth was mainly due to drought conditions during late 2002 and early 2003, which were
exacerbated by falling international commodity prices and unforeseen expenditures associated with
national elections. Tea production, which accounts for the largest foreign exchange earnings
(estimated at US$23 million), declined slightly because o f the drought. Total merchandise exports
dropped by US$4 million from the previous year (to US$63 million), while imports continued to
increase inline with GDP growth (from U S 2 3 4million in2002 to US$244 million in2003). Inflation
was mainly driven by rising prices for petroleum and food products and faster than programmed
expansion in monetary aggregates, which adversely affected the country's terms of trade. These
developments led to an increase inthe current account deficit, from 16.6 percent o f GDP in2002 to an
estimated 19.2 percent in 2003. To finance this deficit, the GoR drew down foreign reserves, which
fell to the equivalent o f five months of import cover at end-2003, compared to 6.3 months in2002.4
19.      Despite the fact that revenue collections were on target, unforeseen expenditures on the
domestic side contributed to an increase in the deficit. For the first time since the genocide, Rwanda
held presidential and parliamentary elections, which were critical to establishing a more stable
political framework. However, the elections (at 1.6 percent o f GDP) cost more than programmed in
the budget (an attempt to raise funds from the population produced US$2 million, which was
insufficient to cover the cost). There were also one-off expenditures inthe health sector. Both costs
were to be coveredbyexternal grant financing projected at US$18 million, butthis didnot materialize.
Inaddition, externalbudgetary assistancefellshortofprojectionsbyroughly4.4 percentofGDP. The
result was anoverall deficit (excluding grants) o f 10.6 percent o f GDPin2003.
20.      This larger than programmed deficit was financed mainly through the accumulationo f arrears
to domestic suppliers and creditors. The GoR was, however, able to maintain recurrent expenditure
allocations to priorityprograms. Inaddition, recurrent defense spending declinedto 2.7 percent o freal
GDP in2003, compared to 2.9 percent in2002 and 3.3 percent in2001. The faster than programmed
expansion in monetary aggregates was fueled by these events and construction-related bank lending.
Broad money rose by 15 percent in 2003. There was also rapid exchange rate depreciation, which
peaked at 20 percent during the second half of the year, despite an increase from US$1.3 million to
US$1.8 million inforeign exchange offered bythe National Banko fRwanda (NBR).

  An agreement between the Governments of Rwandaand the DRC to dismantle the forces of the Interahamwe (Rwandan
  militia)and the ex-FAR (Force Armees Rwandaises)and withdraw Rwandan forces fiomthe DRC was signed inPretoria
  on July 30,2002.
  The target was 7.5 months.

21.       Despite these setbacks, as of end-June 2003 policy performance under the IMF-supported
Poverty Reduction GrowthFacility (PRGF) was broadly satisfactory. Duringthe June 2003 review of
the PRGF, six quantitative performance criteria and all structural performance criteria were met.
Three quantitative measures were narrowly missed because o f weakened policy performance brought
on by the unexpected events described above. To correct for slippages, the 2004 PRGF program
includes a substantial reduction in net credit from the banking sector to the Government, slower
reserve money growth, and a fiscal program that incorporates contingent cuts to assure the domestic
fiscal balance remains consistent with macroeconomic objectives. By January-April 2004, payment
orders had been issued to eliminate the stock of domestic arrears that had accumulated at the end o f
2003. As o f end-April 2004, net central bank credit to the Government was below projected
requirements, and reserve money growth was lower, and net foreign assets of the NBR were higher,
than targeted. As a result of this progress, on June 9,2004 the IMFBoard concluded the second and
third reviews of the PRGF, and approved the disbursement o f additional interim assistance under the
HIPC Initiative. Subject to continued satisfactory progress in the program, the next review is
scheduled for November-December 2004. Prior to this, in September 2004, the Fund Board will
consider an Article IV consultation. With continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance, it is
expected that Rwanda will reach its HIPC CompletionPoint inDecember 2004.
22.       The GoR continues to work with the Bank, in the context o f the proposed PRSC and the
preceding Institutional Reform Credit (IRC), to ensure deepening of and continued progress in
structural reforms to support sustained economic growth, revenue generation, and debt sustainability.
The GoR does not expect any further deterioration in fiscal and monetary aggregates, provided
promised donor money comes as programmed in the budget. To manage the risk to the budget
associated with uncertainty in donor disbursements, the GoR has identified and agreed on contingent
levels of spending under the PRGF program, and would continue to seek increased grant financing
fromdevelopment partners.

C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

23.      The GoR's Medium-Term Policy Outlook (2005-2007) i s based on relatively steady rates o f
growth, forecasted at 6 percent o f GDP. Inflation i s programmed to be reduced to 5 percent by end-
2004 (this increase over the previously planned level o f 3 percent reflects continued exchange rate
depreciation) then declining to around 4 percent. These targets are achievable provided planned
measures to improve productivity, supported by the proposed PRSC, are successfully implemented
(see Box 1). Additional donor funding, particularly in the form of grants, will also be necessary.
Revenues are projected to remain close to 14 percent o f GDP given reforms already inplace. On the
expenditure side, the budget contains substantial funding increases for the education, health, and road
sectors as well as financing to promote increased economic growth. Total budgetary expenditure i s
plannedto increase to 27.1 percent o f GDP in2004, compared to 24.1 percent in2003, andthe overall
fiscal deficit to 13.6 percent o f GDP.
24.      The current account deficit is projectedto be 19.6 percent of GDP in2004, compared to 19.2
percent in 2003, mainly due to lower than expected export perfonnance, coupled with a higher need
for imports related to capital investment and fertilizer. The GoR has developed an export promotion
strategy, a key measure supported under the proposed PRSC. Exportvolume i s expected to increase by
10-15 percent over the near to medium term as the strategy is implemented. This i s expected to
improve the current account deficit gradually, to around 20 percent o f GDPby 2006.
25.      Weak export performance contributed to a loss o f central bank foreign reserves o f about
US$35 million and a significant increase in Rwanda's net present value (NPV) o f external debt-to-
exports ratio, from 195 percent in 2002 to an estimated 300 percent in 2003. This contrasts with the
projected levels outlined inRwanda's H P C document o f 193 percent for 2003, with a steady decline
to 149percent in2008 and 134 percent by 2019. Revisedprojections forecast the NPV to peak at 366
percent in 2005, before declining to 237 percent by 2019.' Inresponse to these trends, the GoR has
kept new borrowing within the range established in the decision point document: total borrowing
amounted to US$84 million in 2002 and US$40 million in 2003. Borrowing was also at highly
concessional terms from the World Bank and A h c a n Development Bank. In addition, an import-
related, Government-guaranteed, short-term loan on commercial terms, which formed part o f the
financing package for the constructiono f a major hotelproject, was liquidatedinJune 2004.
26.      Given financing constraints and traditional unpredictability of external financing, the 2004
budget includes about US$30 million o f contingent expenditures (i.e, expenditures that will only be
made if additional resources are forthcoming from donors in the form o f grants). The Ministry o f
Finance and Economic Planning(MINECOFIN) estimates that about US$15 million o f this amount
will be forthcoming in the form o f grants. However, the recent electricity crisis would require
expenditures o f about US$15 million that have not been budgeted, lack an identified source of
financing, andrequire the GoR's immediateattention.
27.      Provisional external financing needs for 2004-2007 are summarized inTable 2. For 2004, the
financing gap i s estimated at US$41 million, after accounting for US$40 million disbursed under the
Bank-supported IRC. The sum o f the financing gap for Rwanda's FY04 and FY05 budget, including
an estimate o fthe cost requiredto addressthe current energy crisis, results ina total o fUS$85 million.
US$65 million would be provided under the proposedPRSC and the remaining financing i s expected
to be provided by other development partners. The total financing gap during the 2006-07 period is
estimated to be about US$107 million.




  These results are explainedby a lower discount rate and exchangeratemovements, which raise the NPV o f Rwanda's debt
  stock by about USS70million relative to the decision point document. Exports were expectedto reach USS186million in
  2003, and thenrise to US$400millionby the end of the decade. However, actual exports totaled USS126 million in2003,
  contributingto arevised projection for 2009 that is well below the decision point projections.

                                        Rwanda's

A. Poverty ReductionStrategy

28.        Rwanda's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), published as a PRSP in July 2002, elaborates
the GoR's vision for achieving the MDGs, including reducingpoverty by halfby 2015. It articulates a
medium-term program (2002-2007) as a first step toward the GoR's "Vision 2020," which includes
ambitious targets o f increasing GDP per capita to US$900 (from US$230); reducing the number of
poor people to 25 percent o f the population (from 60 percent); increasing life expectancy to 65 years
 (from 49 years); and increasing literacy to 90 percent of the population (from 48 percent). Vision
2020 views national reconciliation, domestic and regional security, good governance, and economic
transformation as overarching challenges to achievingthese ambitious goals.

                                                           9

29.      The PRSP provides a comprehensive diagnosis o f the causes of poverty, and outlines the key
objectives and actions required for reducing it. The diagnosis draws from surveys completed in 2000
and 2001, including the Household Living Standards Survey (HLSS), the smaller Core Welfare
Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).                     These surveys,
and the national rapid poverty assessments (NPAs) carried out at the grassroots level, confirm that
living conditions in Rwanda, while slowly improving since 1994, continue to be very poor,
particularly inrural areas.
30.      Prior to the genocide, estimates showed that 46 to 48 percent of households were poor!
Poverty dramatically increased following the genocide, reaching 78 percent, including 82 percent in
rural areas and 28 percent inurban areas. By 2000, the proportion o f poor had declined to 64 percent.
In 1999, a new definition ofpoverty was established and a new poverty line created from the NPAs
and the HLSS, establishing the headcount index at 60.3 percent below the poverty line, including 65.7
percent in rural areas and 14.3 percent in urban areas. The HLSS showed a significant change in
income inequality, with the Gini-coefficient risingto 0.455 from the 0.270 inthe 1985 HLSS, andwith
urbanpopulations much better off than rural. In 2000, the Gini index ranged from roughly 0.32 in
Kibuye and Gitarama (largely rural areas) to 0.43 inCyangugu, Butare, and Kigali City (urban areas).
Seventy five percent o f households in Kigali were in the highest expenditure quintile, compared to
nine percent in Kibuye. The increase in inequality reflects the relative neglect o f rural areas in the
post-conflict reconstruction process as external funding provided development and employment
opportunities for urban dwellers, butprimarily humanitarianreliefto ruralcommunities.
31.      These surveys and intensive consultations with stakeholders conducted in the context o f the
PRSP have produceda rich databaseon socioeconomic conditions inRwanda, sensitized policymakers
and the population to poverty-relatedissues, and established a basis for combatingpoverty. The PRSP
process inRwanda integrated traditional problem-solving, such as Gacaca (community tribunals), into
the national poverty reductionprogram, which has broadenedthe GoR's legitimacy to take action. The
PRSP implementation process is underpinned by decentralization of government administration,
which supports participatory planning o f the general budget and local funds for implementation o f
community projects. Grants for community-based development projects are being channeled through a
Common Development Fund,established inMay 2002.
32.      Development partners strongly supported Rwanda's PRSP process, and have universally
commended the GoR for the consultative manner through which it was developed. The PRSP was
endorsed by the Boards of the Bank and Fundon August 12, 2002. The strategy was complemented
bythe development ofanMTEF.
33.      The PRSP identifies the private sector as the main engine o f growth, with the transformation
o f agriculture and the rural economy as the leading source o f growth in the near to medium term. To
deal with the legacies o f genocide and structural impediments to economic transformation, the PRSP
outlines five basic building blocks for economic growth and poverty reduction-macroeconomic
stability, human development, good governance, partnership, andthe prioritization o fpublic actions-
and six priority action areas (a) rural development and agricultural transformation; (b) human
development; (c) economic infrastructure; (d) good governance; (e) private sector development; and
(f) institutionalcapacity building(see Box 2). The PRSP stresses the importance of defining sectoral
strategies and associatedMTEFsto guide public actions for implementation.




  Poverty estimates basedon 1985 householddata, which used projectionsconsumption. In 1990, it was estimated that 48
  percent ofthe population was poor (50 percent ofthe ruralpopulationand 19percent ofthe urbanpopulation).

 Six Broad Priority Action Areas:
 1. Agriculture transformation and rural development: including support to agriculture and livestock and
 environmental actions, landandsettlement, credit andsaving institutions, and export promotion.
 2. Building an enabling environment for private sector development: including private sector investment
 promotion, financial sector reform, commercial justice reform, privatization of state enterprises,
 manufacturing, mining, tourism, artisanalactivities, and services.
 3. Human resources development and improving the quality of life: including health, family planning,
 education and training, early childhood care and development, primary, secondary, vocational, and tertiary
 education, science and technology, technical education and vocational training, water and sanitation, control
 andprevention ofHIV/AIDS.
 4. Economicinfrastructure: including roadtransport, railway and air travel, transport and communication at
 the grassroots level, energy for the formal sector, energy for poor households and rural enterprises,
 communications.
 5. Good governance: including establishing security, demobilization, national reconciliation, human rights,
 criminal justice and Gacaca, constitutional reform and democratization, decentralization of the government,
 decentralization at the cellule (household) level, civil servicereform, accountability, and transparency.
 6. Social capital to support vulnerable groups: including orphans, widows, and people affected by


34.     In2002, MINECOFINestablished the Strategic Planningand Poverty ReductionMonitoring
Department (SPPRMD) to coordinate the implementation of the PRSP's core programs, including a
monitoringand evaluation hction. InJuly 2003, the GoR produced a first PRSP Progress Report,
covering the first year of PRSP implementation (August 2002-June 2003). The Progress Report took
into account recommendations providedby development partners and the October 2002 mission ofthe
Strategic Partnership for Afiica. It also incorporatedthe results of a participatory survey undertakento
gauge the satisfaction o f grassroots groups with public services and private initiatives targeted at
poverty reduction.
35.     The Progress Report found substantial progress in education and health (see Table 3),
governance, and infrastructure development. Enrollment rates in primary school improved and
repetition rates decreased, although dropout rates remained high. The use of health services rose
between 2001 and 2002. Ingeneral, while it was too early to evaluate the full impact of the GoR's
sectoral initiatives, it appeared that implementation of programs outlined in the PRSP were having
some positive effect.

36.        The Progress Report also highlighted that achieving poverty reduction targets would only be
possible if strategies and programs affecting production, productivity, trade, and governance were
articulated and implemented to complement traditional humandevelopment programs. The Progress
Report took note of the need for action inthe areas o f capacity buildingand the environment. Finally,
the Progress Report noted that achieving macroeconomic stability, through increased agncultural
productivity, export promotion, and articulation o f a medium-term fiscal stance, relies on obtaining
additional extemal borrowing. Development assistance from the international community, including
the Bank, in support o f PRSP implementation was seen as essential for poverty reduction, thus
strengthening the foundation for sustainedpeace inRwanda andthe Great Lakesregion.
37.        The Bank-Fund Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the Progress Report largely concurred with
these conclusions. It also indicated that Rwanda's implementation o f macroeconomic policies during
2002 and 2003 was broadly satisfactory; that substantial progress had been made in establishing a
political structure that can effectively strengthen social justice and stability; that a new Constitution
and a new president and legislators had been democratically elected; that advances toward achieving
peace in the Great Lakes region will contribute to PRSP implementation and the attainment o f its
objectives; that progress on structural and policy reforms had been broadly successful; that the

                                                              12

authorities had shown continued commitment to privatization o f public enterprises; and that financial
management reform was on track and there hadbeenprogress toward social sector targets, particularly
in education. The GoR is finalizing its second Progress Report, reviewing experience during the
secondyear o f PRSP implementation (July 2003-July 2004). Itwill be circulatedto the Bank and Fund
Boardsindue course. The GoR plansto update its PRSP in2005.

B. Policies andReforms, 1995-2003

38.      The GoR's commitment to reform has proven consistently strong. Over the past 10 years, the
country has moved from the ruins o f the genocide to the implementation of advanced macroeconomic
management practices andpublic expenditure reform(see Box 3).
39.      Regarding trade, export taxes and non-tariff barriers have been completely eliminated. The
maximum tariff rate for import duties has been cut from 100 percent to 25 percent, yielding an IMF
trade restrictiveness index o f 2.7 Price barriers were eliminated for all but a handful o f commodities
(cement, electricity, water, and telecommunications), and a flexible retail petroleum pricing
mechanism was instituted. Import tariffs for goods from the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) have been eliminated, and exchange rate and current account transactions
are fully liberalized.
40.      Though there have been delays in some sectors, the GoR's commitment to privatization
remains steadfast. Inthe case o f telecommunications, legislation for liberalization and regulation has
been in place since 2001. A multisectoral regulatory agency has been created to manage licenses in
telecommunications, water, and energy. The coffee sector has been completely privatized. Tea
privatization i s ongoing, with one factory recently sold to a successful bidder and sales o f the
remaining 10 factories are on the GoR's agenda.
41.      The tax base continues to be strengthened, withrevenue collection stronger than expected. The
GoR established the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) in 1998 as a semi-autonomous agency for
revenue collection. The Value Added Tax (VAT) was introduced in 2001 and revenues increased
from about 10.6 percent o f GDP in 1996 to 12.2 percent in 2002. In2002, the VAT rate was raised
from 15 percent to 18 percent and collection on income taxes improved despite the reduction in the
corporate income tax rate from 40 percent to 35 percent. These measuresledto an increase inrevenue
to 13.5 percent o f GDPin2003.
42.      Inthe financial sector, the focus hasbeenonimprovingprudentialregulationandaddressing
the issue o fNon-Performing Loans (NPLs), which constitute 29 percent o f total gross loans. Recovery
o f these is difficult as court procedures are lengthyand enforcement o f verdicts i s oftenjeopardized by
weak administrative procedures. The banking system, while liquid, provides relatively little credit to
the private sector and lacks investment opportunities in local currency for its excess liquidity. Past
reforms have included establishing the independence o f the central bank and a move to privatize the
banks that have the highest rates o f NPLs. There have also been efforts to reduce the number o f total
loans outstanding, and there has been continual restructuring o f the external debt. An inter-bank
commissionlookedinto the NPLissue duringthe secondhalf o f 2002 andofferedrecommendations to
mitigate future portfolio problems. Although overall progress on these measures has been slow,
actions taken by the NBR and other banks have resulted insignificant improvement inrecoveries. In
addition, commercial chambers have recently been createdto facilitate the resolutiono flegal disputes.

43.     Rwanda's budget system, including related institutional memory, was severely damaged by
the genocide. After the genocide, the focus was on reviving tax administration and reforming the tax
system, restoring and reforming processes for budget preparation and execution, improving
macroeconomic analysis and projections, strengthening budget monitoring and accountability, and
buildingcapacity for budget and economic management. Since 1998, the pace of fiscal andbudgetary
reform has been steady. Budget procedures and calendar have generally been respected. From 1998
onward, the draft budgethas been adopted by the National Assembly before the beginning o f the fiscal
year. A broad poverty-focused budget prioritization program was introduced in 2001. Budget
preparation was decentralized, providing for the active role o f line ministries and the involvement of
civil society. The Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry o f Planmerged in 1997 into the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), and preparation of the Public Investment Program
(PIP) and development budget were streamlined. Starting in 1999, the GoR introduced
computerization o f budget transactions and production o f monthly reports on budget out-turns. The
Office o f the Auditor General and the National Tender Board (NTB) were established. The GoR
created the Office o f the Inspector General for Public Finances, to take the lead inthe audit of budget
transactions, and the Division o f Government Accounts, to prepare and publish regular accounts o f
government financial operations. The Central Projects and External Finance Bureau (CEPEX) was
established as a semi-autonomous body within MINECOFIN to monitor and evaluate development
projects under implementation, coordinate donor fundingo fprojects, andmanage the PIP.
44.     Rwanda moved to a second generation of reforms in 2000 by adopting the MTEF as a
comprehensive framework to further public expenditure management reform. The introduction of the
MTEFwas supportedbyDFIDandthe World Bank. MTEFobjectives are fourfold:

0   Establisha national policy andbudget fiamework based on the PRS that includes a medium-term
    fiscal strategy, predictable arrangements for extemal programmatic support and debt relief, clear
    and consistent ceilings for line ministries, a comprehensive integrated budget to capture all public
    expenditures withinan integrated format, and a formalized risk management strategy;

0   Develop sector strategies consistent with the national policy framework, better aligning policy
    planningandbudgeting;

0   Promote a results focus in budget preparation and execution, with monitoring and reviews of
    budget outputs and outcomes to evaluate consistency o f budget execution with allocation and
    sector objectives andpolicies;

0   Improve financial management and accountability to ensure that budget execution i s consistent
    withbudgetary appropriations andrelatedoutputs.
45.     The MTEFapproach has been introducedina phasedmanner. Introduced at the sectoral level
with the 2001 budget process, all line ministries have now elaborated their respective MTEFs for
2002-2004, and priority expenditure programs have been identifiedand ceilings defined. In2002, the
presentation of the budget was changed in all ministries to reflect classification o f expenditures
according to programs and subprograms, expected outputs, and inputs. The chart o f account was
revised to reflect regional and international standards. The effective implementation o f the MTEFhas
been supported by ongoing PERsby the Bank and other partners, social sector expenditure reviews in
1999 and 2000, and reviews o f the transport and agriculture sector in 2002. The challenge now is to
strengthen the predictability o f the MTEF system (through improved revenue and expenditure
forecasting), its coverage (in particular with respect to off-budget projects), and its results focus (by
improvingperformance monitoring).
46.      Significant reforms have also been adopted inthe public financial management system. The
new Constitution adopted at end-May 2003 established a clear framework for public financial
management. The Auditor General was vested with sole accounting authority to report directly to
Parliament. In2003, the Auditor General audited 41 public entities, includingnine ministries (among
them the Ministries o f Defense and Finance), and completed a report to Parliament in January 2004.
A new Organic Budget Law was submitted to Parliament inJune 2004. The accompanying financial

                                                    15

instructions were issued in May 2004. The GoR i s also implementing an action plan for financial
accountability, based on the recommendations of the FARAP. A 2002 PETS concluded that the
management o f public funds was largely transparent with no systemic pattern o f leakage. Salaries are
paid regularly and budgeted public h d s reach rural schools and health centers, provided cash flow
allows it.
47.      The PER showed that priority programs are increasingly funded. Social spending increased to
6.2 percent o f GDP in 2003 from 3.9 percent in 1999. Expendituresto finance primary schools were
higher, and enrollment o fpoor andrural children increased dramatically. Health facilities have largely
been rehabilitated and a decentralized health management system has been adopted. Key health
programs such as immunizationhave been adequately fimded and immunization coverage i s one o fthe
highest in SSA. Essential drugs are available inclinics. The ricWpoor ratio interms o f healthcoverage
with major service delivery is generally smaller than the average for SSA and low-income countries,
althoughricher groups benefit more frompublic spending onhealththando poorer groups.
48.      The 2004 budget i s closely linked with PRSpriorities. Bothrecurrent and capital expenditures
are rising, together representing 26 percent o f GDP, versus 24.4 percent in2003 and 23.1 in2002 (see
Table 4). The increase in recurrent expenditures i s driven by the introduction o f fee-free primary
education (RwF 2.3 billion), the cost o f anti-retroviral drugs (RwF 1.3 billion), food for prisoners
(RwF 1.5 billion) after the retreat of the International Committee of Red Cross, an increased number
of policemen (RwF 1.2 billion), increased gradual pay for health workers (RwF 0.8 billion), and the
transfer o f administrative and other duties to new institutions created by the new Constitution (RwF
3.9 billion). Exceptional expenditures make up 17percent o f the budget in2004, against 27.7 in2003.
This is evidence that the country i s movingfrom an exceptionalsituation to a normal one, following a
nine-year politicaltransition.
49.      Priorityexpenditure allocations for 2004 have increased by 69 percent compared to 2003, with
most concentrated in the social sectors. Total education spending has increased by 55 percent and
accounts for 42 percent o f priority expenditures in 2004. The largest increase is for secondary
education (197 percent), following the GoR's decision to increase dramatically the enrollment rate of
grades 7, 8, and 9. The share o f tertiary education priority programs, mainly scholarships inside and
outside the country, remains high.
50.      Following education, administrative and political services, which includes internal affairs,
public service, and local government, received the second highest budget allocation in 2004, as was
the case in 2003 and 2002. Priority programs in this category represent 18.7 percent o f the total in
2004, against 16.8 percent in2003. The most important program inthis category is the development o f
the national police service, which received 6.4 percent o f the total priorityprograms budget allocation
in2004. This hasbeen consistent withthe GoR's policy to reinforce internal security. Allocations for
healthpriority programs have also increased, ffom RwF 6.5 billion inthe 2003 to RwF 11.5 billion in
2004, reflecting increased allocations to provincial health facilities, increased pay for health workers,
andallocations for anti-retroviral drugs.
51.      Although agriculture development has been identified as a key sector in the PRSP, budget
allocations have remained relatively low. Priority programs inagriculture, livestock, and environment
mainly concentrated on agriculture and livestock production as well as land planning and
management, received RwF 3.6 billion in the 2004 budget, against RwF 3.5 billion in 2003. This
represents 4 percent o f total priority program allocations against 5.8 percent in 2003.         Budget
allocations for other economic services (commerce, transport, communications, energy, and water
resources) represent 6.9 percent o f the total in2004, o f which 74 percent are for the development and
modernization o f communications infrastructure. Decreases in allocations to the water and energy
sectors reflect the fact that investments in these sectors were largely channeled through donor-funded
projects.

52.        Overall, the GoR faces the challenge o f acheving PRSP and MDG targets in the context o f
tight fiscal and capacity constraints. Expenditures increased at a faster pacethanrevenue in2003 and
2004. Consequently, the GoR continues to be heavily dependent on foreign assistance, with about 50
percent of 2003 public expenditures financed by external grants and loans. Inthe past, the precarious
political situation o f the region and donors' complex aid procedures have contributed to
unpredictability o f donor disbursements. The cash budget approach adopted by the GoR as a result
compromises the budget formulation process and priority setting, often resulting in a loose link
between the MTEF and annual budgets. This undermines line ministries' and local administrations'
confidence in the MTEF. The issue i s particularly pressing given the ongoing process o f
decentralization.
53..       Regardingdecentralization, the GoR's vision is to move to full devolution (see Figure 1). The
process of strategic development and budgeting was devolved to the district level in 2002. Districts
now prepare their own MTEFs, though available resources are not taken into account in costing and
there is a need to ensure that district plans/MTEFs are integrated into the national level MTEF and
budget process. This requires a rigor in public expenditure management that is laclung at the local
level due to capacity constraints. Inaddition, to reduce the unpredictability o f external financing, the

                                                          17

GoR needs to improve the realism of its budget estimates and its implementation capacity. The
proposed PRSC supports reforrns inthese areas.

                      IV. Bank Supportto Rwanda's PovertyReductionStrategy

A. Linkto Country Assistance Strategy

54.      Following on and consistent with the PRSP, the most recent Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Rwanda was discussed by the Boardin December 2002. It articulates a Bank program of
support around four themes (a) revitalization of the rural economy; (b) private sector development and
employment creation; (c) human and social development; and (d) improvement in governance and
effectiveness of public sector actions. The CAS highlights the need to move progressively Erom
project-based approaches to sectonvide approaches (SWAPS) and budget support, envisaging a PRSC
inthe base case lending scenario. The CAS also proposed greater emphasis on economic and sector
work, recognizing that, at this stage inits transition frompost-conflict to development, Rwandaneeds
to establish a soundanalykal basis for developing strategies andprograms.
55.      Thus, the objectives of the proposed PRSC are in line with the CAS fits within base case
lending levels. In the context of good performance in PRSP implementation, and in the case of
shortfalls indonor grant-financing, IDA lending could be inthe highend of the CAS base-case range,
to the extent that debt sustainability concerns permit.

B. Donor Harmonization Arrangements

56.      The PRSP process has enjoyed broad support and financial assistance from donor partners,
who have recognized the GoR's strong commitment to consultations with stakeholders and partners,
harmonization of donor methods and requirements, and achievement of strategic goals. In a GoR-

                                                    18

development partners conference in Kigali in November 2001, donors pledged to support PRSP
implementation.
57.      In November 2003, the GoR and donors providing budget support signed the Partnership
Framework for Harmonization and Alignment of Budget Support (see Annex 5).             This Framework
aims to improve donor coordination, decrease overlap, and reduce transaction costs for the GoR. The
Framework identifies a lead sector ministry/agency to manage preparation of a strategy for the sector,
with support from a lead donor inthe sector. The lead agency is the principal contact inthe GoR for
donors and civil society stakeholders, while the lead donor assists the lead agency with coordinating
donor activities, harmonizing worlung procedures and practices, and supporting the sector strategy
development process. The GoR has identified lead donors for key sector clusters: agriculture, land,
habitat, and environment (EU/World Bank); infrastructure and information communications
technology (EUNorld Bank); human resource development and capacity building (SIDA); private
sector development (USAID); social sector (DFIDBelgum); decentralization and the Common
DevelopmentFund(Netherlands); and governance (UNDP). The cluster groups, including govemment
counterparts, meet regularly to coordinate the approach inthe sector. Inparallel, the proposed PRSC i s
serving as a vehicle for promoting harmonization o f objectives andmethods among donors providing
support through projects and those active in, or preparing, SWAPS. The proposed PRSC encourages
development partners to move increasingly toward joint or.shared analytic work and would, to the
extent possible, rely on assessmentscarried out by other partners.
58.      Several partners-UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, USAID, Belgian Aid, French Cooperation, Dutch
Aid, German Aid, SIDA, the EU, and DFID--have           participated in the preparation o f the proposed
operation. The GoR and donor partners have agreed that the comprehensive PRSP policy matrix
would be the basis for policy dialogue on bothbudget support and sector support operations, as i s the
case in the education sector, in practice a SWAP, and as i s envisaged in the health sector.
Developmentpartners would select a subset o fthe PRSP policy measures and milestones as a basis for
supporting the GoR's budget. As such, the PRSC matrix i s a subset of measures taken directly from
the PRSP matrix. Furthermore, CEPEX has proposed a timeline o f key phases in the PRSP review
cycle and the GoR's budget cycle, and associated timing o f donor disbursements and reviews, as a
basis for M e r i n gharmonization, alignment, anddialogue.
59.      Bank-Fund collaboration has focused on the area of macroeconomic monitoring, with the
Bank participating inPRGFreview missions and the Fundparticipating inPRSCmissions. Fund staff
have participated in the extensive consultations held with stakeholders to further define the PRSP
policy matrix, to feed into the definition o f the PRSC matrix, including prior actions and triggers. The
Bank and Fund are also collaborating to produce the HIPC Assessment and Action Plan (AAP)
exercise report and, inaddition to producing JSAs o f the PRSP and PRSP Progress Reports, the Bank
and Fund have been in consultation on Rwanda's fmancial and banking sector policies, fiscal
decentralization, andfinancial management.
60.      Cupucity Building. To more effectively help the GoR to address capacity constraints, donor
partners and the GoR are aiming for a more coordinated approach to capacity buildingactivities, to be
facilitated through the GoR's new human resource management agency, which i s expected to be
established before the end o f 2004. Capacity building efforts under the proposed PRSC will be
complemented by the Public Sector Capacity BuildingProject (PSCBP) and the Decentralization and
Community Development (DCDP), both o f which will become active at the end o f 2004. The PSCBP
was designed specifically to support the proposed PRSC, with the aim o f enhancing the capacity o f
govemment institutions for implementation o f PRSC-supported reforms. The PSCBP would target
staff in relevant ministries for training, including in public expenditure and financial management,
humanresource management, strategic planning, leadership, and change management. The PSCBP
would also help ministries, departments, and agencies to contract out certain services to non-
governmental service providers, with a view to improving the quality and effectiveness o f services.
Transparency would be enhanced by supporting such agencies to develop and disseminate service
delivery guidance materials and define associated monitoring mechanisms. The PSCBP seeks to

                                                    19

enhance citizens' voice and participation in policy-making through helping Parliament mount and
implement a public outreach strategy. Citizen report cards (a tool the GoR i s developing to monitor
PRSPimplementation) would be instrumental inmeasuring satisfaction with service delivery, service
standards, and the public'sperceptionof the level oftransparency and accountability o f government.
61.      The DCDP focuses on strengthening capacity o f district government institutions to lead the
processesof local development planningand service delivery, which will reinforcethe implementation
o f district and community level actions envisaged under the proposed PRSC. The DCDP primarily
provides (a) technical support to the provinces, who in tum train and provide just-in-time technical
assistance to districts; and (b) grants to finance public infrastructure and private sector development
activities that local populations categorize as priority. Activities in education, health, nutrition,
HN/AIDS, community roads, water, and local energy supply are expected to be financed by DCDP
grants. Training provided to districts will concentrate on planning skills, leveraging resources
(including pooled financing and program implementation arrangements), budgeting and financial
management, procurement, and results-based monitoring. The DCDP will support the Ministry o f
Local Administration (MINALOC) to consolidate a communications strategy for the second phase o f
the national decentralization implementation program. Through varied means, this strategy will keep
the different players at all levels o f implementation (national, provincial, district, secteur, and cellule)
informed about the objectives, activities, and modalities of decentralization. The project is also a
vehicle for pilotingcitizenreport cards, the filler implementation o fwhich i s expected to be supported
underPRSC II.

C. Relationshipto Other Bank Operations

62.      The Bank has been active in Rwanda since 1991. Currently, 10 operations are under
implementation, with the majority achieving their development objectives. The full range o f issues
facing Rwanda has been addressed through previous and ongoing operations (see Box 4), including
economic recovery (via three adjustment operations that have introduced the concepts o f gender
sensitivity in regulations and law and the use o f MTEFs to provide direction to annual budgeting);
infrastructure and private sector development (covering transport, communications, energy, water
supply, and rural water and sanitation); agriculture and rural development; human development
(education, health, and HIV/AIDS); and community development (advancing decentralization in
expenditure management and accountability). Some investment projects are also under preparation,
such as the transport, water, and emergency energy projects. Many o f the investment operations have
embraced SWAP principles and have been undertaken with varying degrees o f donor collaboration.
However, most have relied on project-driven implementation arrangements, and have encountered
issues o f counterpart funding, indefmite strategic focus on poverty, and uncertain post-project
sustainability.
63.       The proposed PRSC would build on recently completed operations, and would be
complemented by ongoing and planned investment projects. The added value o f the PRSC lies in its
leverage to move forward the policy dialogue and policy actions, particularly in the area of strategic
budgeting and planning, overall and sectorally.       To this end, the proposed PRSC i s expected to
improve implementation o finvestment operations.

D. LessonsLearned

64.     Rwanda i s an excellent example o f how timely Bank support in a difficult situation can
contribute to stabilization and motivate the government to focus on a medium- to long-term reform
agenda. The Bank quickly resumed operational activities after the 1994 genocide, and the need to
adapt operations to the emergency situation soonbecame apparent. The Bank adjustedbyrestructuring
and strengthening implementation o f pre-war projects. Such restructured projects made a valuable
contribution to the transition from emergency, and the GoR was able to put inplace an ambitious and
sustainable long-term reform agenda. Even with the huge human resource challenges caused by the
genocide, the GoR demonstrated its ability to attain seemingly ambitious goals.
65.     Restructuring helped to stabilize the situation inthe immediate post-genocide period, however
complex project design resulted in the cancellation or substantial underachievement o f many o f the
operations (such as in energy and urbadrural water and sanitation). Experience under previous
investment operations inRwanda demonstrated that projects are not the best instrument to tackle key
sectoral reforms, nor were they designed to ensure sufficient attention to poverty reduction and access
to services by poor people. Currentexperience inthe Bank's Rwandaportfolio also points to the lack
of implementation capacity. Inline ministries, top managers are carefully appointed and positions are
filled by experienced and skilled candidates; however, at the more technical level, managers often do
not have adequate skills or sufficient experience. T h ~ sleads to bottlenecks and slow project
implementation. In general, the GoR, the Bank, and development partners have not always given
adequate attention to long-term capacity buildingneeds. As mentioned, inthe context o f the proposed
PRSC, the PSCBP was developed to addressthis need.
66.     Another lesson drawn from Bank involvement in Rwanda i s that strengthening good
governance-and      the inclusion o f all levels and groups of society ingovernanc+is a prerequisite for
poverty reduction and development. The GoR has embarked on a very ambitious Unity and
Reconciliation Program aimed at rebuilding the social fabric at the grassroots level, while ensuring
that old andnew policies are inclusive and do not discriminate against any social group. Actions under
the decentralization policy complement this objective. The ultimate goal is to financially and
administratively empower Rwandan communities to make key decisions and to see that the voice o f
citizens i s taken into account. The proposedPRSC follows this approach, aiming to help see that all
plannedreforms take into account stronger empowerment o f Rwandan citizens.

E. AnalyticUnderpinnings

67.     Inline with CAS objectives, an extensive set of analytic and advisory activities will inform
and shape the proposed PRSC series (see Figure 2). Analysis completedto underpinPRSC Iincludes,
in the poverty area, a Poverty Assessment, Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA), a HLSS, a
CWIQ, and a Food Security Survey. Analysis in the fiduciary area includes the FARAP, a PER, a
PETS, a PEMR, and the CPIP. Sector-specific studies include a Country Status Report for Education
and a Country Status Report for HealthandNutrition.

68.     For PRSCs 11and 111, analytic underpinnings are expected to include, among others, PERs, a
second PETS, a Country Economic Memorandum focusing on sources o f growth, a labor market

                                                   22

survey in health, a Demographic and Health Survey, a Living Standard Measurement Survey, and
PSIA. An IntegratedFramework trade diagnostic is under way and an Investment Climate Assessment
i s planned. An exercise to assessprogress inimplementingreforms in follow-up to the FARAPand to
address any gaps inthe financial management area will be undertaken. Energyand water sector studies
will be conducted to inform reforms in these sectors. A social analysis will also be conducted to
improve knowledge o f social and institutional issues in the macroeconomic policy environment in
PRSC targeted sectors and the country's capacity to manage social concems. The proposed study is
aligned with the innovative Country Social Analysis approach (currently being piloted in five
countries), which uses stakeholder analysis, institutional analysis, and social risk assessment.

                         V.       ProposedPRSC andReformProgram

69.      The overarching objective of the proposed PRSC series is to support the GoR in its effort to
implement its PRSP along its six broad priority areas (see Figure 3). The proposed PRSC series
focuses on a set o f policies and reforms intended to (a) create a favorable private sector investment
climate that would promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; (b) improve
quality, coverage, and equity o f basic service delivery through improved expenditure efficiency; and
(c) support overall improvement ofpublic expenditure management and governance, with an emphasis
on transparency and accountability to citizens' voice and participation. Policy actions aimed at
achieving these ends are captured in the PRSC policy matrix (see Annex 2), which includes prior
actions for PRSC I(remainder FY04 and FY05) and indicative triggers for the appraisal o f PRSC 11
(FY06) and PRSC 111(FY07). Eachoperation buildsonthe previous one, with annual readjustments of
specific operationalobjectives and amounts after the first year, withinthe context o fthe GoR's MTEF.
70.      Under the proposed PRSC series, it i s expected that the GoR would make progress in
(a) creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, supporting the development of
exports, creating a favorable environment for business and private enterprises, and deepening the
reformo f the financial sector, thus contributing to reversing the dependence on external financing; (b)
advancing its reform agenda and expenditure program in four key service sectors that contribute to
economic and human development; and (c) continuingreforms inpublic expenditure management and
governance, to improve basic services by strengthening MTEFs so that they are results-oriented,
including the use of output-based aid approaches (e.g., using performance-oriented contracts),
strengthening fiduciary management, and strengthening accountability mechanisms that enhance
citizens' voice andparticipation.
71.      Overall expected outcomes at completionofthe proposed PRSC series include:

a    Continued macroeconomic stability, maintenance o f low number o f days to open a business, and
     increasedexports to GDPratio;
a    A monitorable, increasedproportiono fchildrenhaving completedprimary school;
a    Measurable reductiono funder-five mortality andimpact o f communicabledisease;
0    Measurable increasedaccess to clean water and sanitation facilities;
a    A clear regulatory framework for the energy sector, including a transparent regulatory tariff
     setting mechanism.
72.      Recognizing that benefits can accrue from acting on issues as soon as preparationpermits, and
that current capacity imposes limits on actions, the GoR's implementation strategy focuses on making
progress, without delay, in the most advanced areas, while developing supportive measures in other
areas. The approach is therefore to address issues in a sequenced manner. As such, actions in the
education and health sectors are fully integrated into the proposed PRSC I,    while for the water and
energy sectors the focus i s on preparatory work (e.g., strategy development, costing scenarios,
regulatory framework). PRSC 11is expected to engage all four sectors fully, and PRSC 111would aim
to scale up service delivery in these sectors. Under each o f the proposed PRSCs, the GoR would
address issues of macroeconomic stability and growth; budget development, management, and
execution; andtransparency andaccountability aimed at empoweringcitizens.

A. Area 1: Private Sector-Led Growthfor Poverty Reduction
73.       Current Issues.     Agriculture contributes approximately 41 percent of GDP. The sector
employs about 90 percent o f the active population, with 90 percent o f the overall population living in
rural areas. The dominant economic activity is smallholder, rain-fed farming, largely for subsistence,
with an average farm size of less than one hectare per household. Thus, in the near term, Rwandan
agriculture, and apculture transformation, iskey to growth andpoverty reduction.
74. The Bank-financed Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP) is helping the GoR to address
agriculture transformation. Recent studies undertaken by the GoR as input to its rural sector strategy
(formulated with RSSP assistance) identify the following constraints to supply response from the rural
economy: declining soil fertility because of over exploitation and low utilization o f critical inputs,
particularly fertilizers and improved seed varieties; low factor productivity because of lack of
appropriate technologies; inadequate infrastructure, especially roads, energy, storage, preservation,
and processing facilities; inadequate advisory services, especially research and extension; weak farmer
organizations and poorly-developed social capital; lack o f smallholder access to financial services;
lack o f landtenure security; and a fragile agricultural environment. Since the GoR's export promotion
strategy will rely on increased agricultural exports inthe near term, RSSP support to the GoR inthese
areas is key to achievingPRSC objectives.
75.       Micro-enterprise activities are the second largest source of employment after agriculture. As
such, the GoR i s also concentrating on fostering private enterprise to stimulate private sector-led
growth. There are an estimated 69,000 micro-enterprise units in Rwanda, providingroughly 321,000
jobs (of which close to 200,000 are full time positions). A recent review o f micro-enterprises found
that half o f the activities in the sector involve retail trade and exchange; the remainder involve
handicrafts and services (ie., hair dressing, restaurants), carpentry and furniture making, tailoring and
textiles, buildingmaterials, repairs, andmaintenance. The study highlighted the need for more ago-
business-related micro-enterprises, to help fuel agricultural productivity and increase farm incomes to
stimulate demand for non-farm products and services. Increased rural incomes could also lead to an
increased variety o f services. Several small businesses, such as training centers for secretarial and
computer workers, mobile telephone kiosks, photographers, internet cafds, car wash stations, medical
laboratories, and dry cleaning shops, have developed in Kigali, demonstrating the potential o f the
sector. Another potential area identified in the micro-enterprise study includes local consultancy
support to micro-enterprises for business development services Promotion o f tourism activities,
coupledwithmeasuresto stimulate localincomes while ensuringlinkages between farm and non-fam
activities, should also help to sustain service sector growth.
76.       The ability o f micro-enterprises and small farmers to access sources o f finance i s an issue.
Analysis o f the 2000/2001 householdconsumption survey found that rural households engaged inthe
non-farm sector rely on savings and parental loans. Among those who had access to credit, the
majority identified the banquespopuZaires and other micro-finance institutions as the main source of
credit. To improve the soundness and supervision o f micro-finance institutions, and as a first step
toward facilitating accessibility, the NBRis establishing a databaseonmicro-finance institutions.
77.       Inthe caseofbusiness start-upcosts andthe overallbusiness environment, resultsofthe 2004
Doing Business Survey indicate that there are administrative and institutional constraints. The survey
estimates that the number of procedures required to start a business was nine, which compares
favorably with the SSA regional average o f 11and the OECD average o f six. The average number of
days to open a business i s 21, compared with the regional average of 67, and OECD average of 25.
However, the cost to open a business represents 317 percent o f per capita national income (this figure
i s 238 percent on average for SSA, in contrast with the OECD average o f 8.4 percent). Inaddition,
indicators show that labor regulation is relatively more rigid inRwanda comparedto SSA as a whole.
78.       Government Sh.ategy. With a focus on ago-business and micro-enterprise, the GoR is
committed to developing and implementing an export promotion strategy, advancing privatization,
improving the overall business environment, and furthering financial and bankingsector reforms. The

                                                           27

export promotion strategy is expected to help address the current account balance and debt
sustainability issues. Inaddition, the planned Country Economic Memorandum (to be undertaken in
collaboration with the GoR and other development partners) will focus on sources o f growth.
79.     To oversee the elaboration and implementation o f an export promotion strategy, the GoR, with
support from the proposed PRSC, formed an inter-ministerial Export Promotion Commission,
including representatives of the private sector. The export promotion strategy elaborated focuses on
increasing traditional exports of coffee and tea, intensifyingpyretheum exports, and diversifying into
non-traditional agro-pastoral, high-value crops, such as cut flowers, hides and skins, and macadamia
nuts. The GoR also aims to improve the competitiveness of traditional exports while increasing the
value added (e.g., by improving process efficiency along the supply chain, from production,
transformation, and marketing, to trade and exports) to address constraints posed by high transport
costs.'  Given the importance of agriculture in the near to medium term, the GoR is addressing
productivity constraints and focusing on intensified input use to increase production for domestic and
export markets. The GoR's strategy i s to target the specialty coffee market, replenish aging coffee
trees, privatize remaining public tea estates, increase horticulture, intensify fertilizer use, and
reformulate agriculture research, advisory, and extension services so that they are more demand-
driven, client-responsive, andcomplementary.
80.     Measures to improve the business environment aim to complement ongoing or existing
reforms to promote domestic and foreign investment and improve competitiveness o f f r m s through
privatization. The objective is to reduce the cost o f startingand runningbusinesses and identify areas
of comparative advantage andcompetitiveness for long-term growth. With PRSC support, the GoR is
puttinginplace the legal and regulatory framework to promote domestic and foreign investment and
improve competitiveness o f firms through privati~ation.~Actions focus on establishing accounting
standards, promoting regional integration and trade partnerships, increasing foreign and domestic
investment, and improving information communications technology. In addition, an Integrated
Frameworktrade diagnostic is under way and anInvestment Climate Assessment isplanned for 2005.
81.     Reforms to strengthen the financial and banking sector aim to facilitate improved financial
intermediation in the micro-finance sector, to increase access for micro-enterprises and farmers,
reduce transaction costs, support ongoing banking sector reforms, and support the establishment o f a
housing finance institution. The fkamework for supervision of micro-finance institutions i s being
strengthened with the NBR's microfinance database and on-site inspections, which are slated to begin

84.       CurrentIssues. Rwanda's success inreviving its education system after the 1994 genocide i s
demonstrated by rapid acceleration inthe primary gross enrollment ratio-at     108 percent in 2000/01,
it exceeded the SSA average of 75 percent. The higher education enrollment ratio (at just above one
percent) was comparable to the SSA average, but for secondary education Rwanda was only slightly
more than half as high as the SSA average (11 versus 20 percent). About 90 percent o f all children
enter grade 1,but the completion rate is low by internationalstandards, and the repetition rate remains
high(reportedly 17percent in2002/03, down from an extremely high34 percent in2001/02). Girls'
share o f enrollments inhigher education is especially low and urban-rural and income gaps are wide,
particularly insecondary and higher education (see Tables 5a and 5b).
85.      The GoR's recurrent spending on education, at about 3.3 percent o f GDP in 2001, i s
comparable to the level in low-income countries, but higher education claimed an exceptionally high
share o f the GoR's education budget at 37 percent (reflecting high costs and blanket student welfare
subsidies), while primary education's share o f the education budget was 45 percent. The impact o f this
skewed distribution i s evident in Rwanda's high pupil-teacher ratio (56 compared with a
recommended average o f 40) and the fact that teachers in grades 1-3 generally teach two shifts of
pupils, with each receiving only three hours of instruction daily. Decentralization has begun, but
institutions are nascent and implementation capacity weak. Roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities
are being clarified. Staffing gaps remain to be addressed. And the mechanism for timely resource
transfers from the central budget needs to be determined in such a way that there is minimal loss
duringtransmission to communitiesand schools.

86.       Challenges include to (a) universalizeprimary school completion by 2015 or earlier, and make
progress toward universalizing nine years o f basic education; (b) improve access to post-primary
education, especially among girls, orphans, rural children, and children from poor families; and (c)
raise the quality of services (including teacher development) which, at lower levels of education,

                                                   29

wouldshow upinsteady gains instudent learning, and at the secondary and higher education levels, in
graduates' smooth transition to modem sector jobs for which they were prepared. An effective
response to these challenges requires the GoR to see that (a) its sector development plan is fiscally
viable based on a systematic evaluation of tradeoffs inthe targets for coverage and options for service
delivery (with PRSC support, the GoR has undertaken modeling of various scenarios and their cost
implications); (b) public resources reach schools to support effective teaching and learning, an
objective that entails giving provincial and district authorities the mandate and incentives to build
schools, allocate teachers, supply learning materials, and motivate, through financial or other means,
needy children to enroll and remain in school; and (c) mechanisms established to boost accountability
for results (i.e., definitionof measurable outcomes, roles and responsibility for achieving them, and
collection and use of data for monitoring and evaluation).       The GoR's fiscal strategy for sector
development particularly needs to (a) manage the pace of universalizing nine years o f schooling (a
commitment made by the GoR); (b) cap the expansion of publicly-financed post-basic education; (c)
reduce drastically government spending per student in public higher education; and (d) avoid new
high-cost investments invocational andtechnical education.
87.      Government Strategy. Achievements include establishing a new legal framework for
education (i.e., the Organic Education Law o fAugust 2003) andcorresponding three-year (2005-2008)
Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP), which provides the basis for the sector's annual budget
request under the MTEF; the regular stock-taking conducted jointly by the Ministry of Education
(MINEDUC) and provincial and district authorities on ESSP implementation (this also includes
donors as it is a regular feature of the SWAP); and the creation of school-level bodies (e.g., parent-
teacher associations in primary schools). The GoR abolished school fees for primary education
beginning in2003/04 and made a public commitment to treat lower secondary education as part of the
basic cycle, pledging eventually to eliminate its fees as well. A system of capitation grants (currently
300 RwFper pupil) is nowthe basis for transfer o f government resources to districts to cover the loss
infee income previously collected byprimaryschools. The GoR has also created District Education
Funds to intensify public support to particularly needy students. In higher education, the GoR has
encouraged financially independent private institutions to grow, moved toward increased financial and
managerial autonomy and accountability inpublicly-subsidized institutions (e.g., throughthe creation
o f the National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) and the Student Finance Agency o f Rwanda
(SFAR)), andreduced the cost of overseas studies by financing fewer students abroad and diverting
scholars to lower-cost host countries.

B.1.b. Health Services
90.      CurrentIssues. The health care systemhas demonstratedremarkable resilience followingthe
genocide, which resulted in a massive loss of health professionals and a destruction o f the health
infrastructure. The ratio of population to nurses is favorable, though the ratio of doctors is still very
low. Geographical access to health services is high compared to SSA standards. Availability of
essential drugs has been maintained at close to 90 percent over the past few years due to community-
managed revolving drug funds and an independently managed Central Purchasing Store. Innovative

                                                           30

approaches to service delivery have been developed, including the piloting o f performance-based
contracts and the progressive extension of micro-insurance schemes, to which 25 percent o f the
population have access.
91.         Current health indicators are testimony to the progress made by the health sector over the last
decade, but equally highlight the enormous challenges that remain ifhealth MDGs are to be met. The
average rate of decline o f under-five and maternal mortality since 1995 is relatively slow and
insufficient to reach the MDG target by 2015. The major causes of mortality for children under five"
are largely avoidable. Coverage rates with highimpact interventions addressing causes of infant, child,
and maternal mortality have started to gradually improve within the last few years, with some
remarkable successes in immunization and containment of the HIV epidemic. But utilization of other
high impact health services remains low, particularly among poor people. According to the 2001
CWIQ, the majority o f respondents who were sick but did not consult a health clinic indicated that it
was because ofhighconsultation fees.
92.        Financing for health services i s low by international standards. In 1998, total health spending
was about US$12.7 per capita, or 5 percent of GDP, out of which only 10 percent was financed
through domestic public revenue. The remainder was largely funded by donors (50 percent),
households (33 percent), and private enterprises."                Between 1995 and 2001, public spending
progressed slowly, remaining at an average of about one percent. Despite an approximate increase of
98 percent in real terms between 2003 and 2004, the Ministry of Health's (MINISANTE)                                  budget
represents only 4.6 percent o f the government's total budget, and about 1.6 percent of projected 2004
GDP, at a significantly lower level than low income andother SSA countries. Health service provision
and financing remain largely inequitable, with large gaps between the poor and non-poor interms of
health outcomes and coverage. Benefits distribution is biased in favor of urban areas and richer
groups (see Figure 4).
93.         The GoR's challenge is to address systemic institutional andreform issues that undermine the
effective use of budget allocations for better serving poorpeople; stimulate utilization of high-impact
services; and reduce financial access barriers to health care. The health sector remains extremely
project based. Existing innovative approaches to service delivery need to be further articulated into a
policy reform framework that is compatible with fiscal and administrative decentralization. Currently
budget increases may not lead to intended goals. Hence, MINISANTE'Sintentionis to have resources
progressively shifted to administrative districts, provinces, autonomous agencies, and health facilities
on the basis of performance agreements.

94.       GovernmentStrategy. The three main areas outlined inthe PRSP for improvinghealth sector
performance are:
     Improving the Management and Governance of the Health System. This includes resource
     allocation and purchasing, and equity and efficiency o f government health expenditures.
     MINISANTE committedto use the PRSP implementation processto improve coordination among
     donors and adopt a government-led "second generation" SWAP, spearheadingthe development o f
     the Health Sector Strateac Plan. To improve the accountability and efficiency o f the health
     system, the GoR would (a) use a results-oriented MTEF to guide the planning, budgeting, and
     monitoring process; (b) support autonomy of health facilities, with co-management by users and
     communities; and (c) introduce perfonnance-based transfers from the center to districts and
     provinces so that local authorities may purchase specific services for a targeted population.'2
     BroadenResourcesfor theHealth Sector through PooledMechanisms and External Resources.
     This objective aims to improve vulnerable groups' access to health care for vulnerable groups,
     reducing the financial burden on households and fostering broader participation in health care.
     This will require an increase ingovernment financing o f health services and an expansion of risk
     poolingmechanisms. Specific actions would include to (a) expand and strengthen community pre-
     payment and financial protection schemes (mutuelles) to increase access to health care and
     improve civil society participation in their management; (b) foster a gradual and sustained
     increase inpublic sector financing of health care relative to total government expenditures and on
     a per capita basis; and (c) support community-based, cost-sharing systems through standardization
     o f user fee policies and revision o f fee structures so that basic services are affordable to poor
     people.
     Improving Deliveiy of High Impact Health Services. This objective covers a series o f measures
     to address systemic issues and specific policies for basic health care and control o f communicable
     diseases. With respect to humanresources, the goal is to improve the availability o f personnelby
     introducing financial andnonfinancial incentives to encourage staffto work inrural areas. This i s
     to be managed at the decentralized level, so that local authorities can effectively monitor the
     impact o f financial incentives on productivity. Another priority i s to support health promoters
     (animateurs) by providing them with appropriate incentives. The use o f the Common
     DevelopmentFundmechanismwill be expanded to support delivery o f highimpact, community-
     based interventions (e.g., community outreach, social marketing, safe and simple water systems,
     nutritionactivities).
95.      Expected Outcomes. The proposed PRSC is expected to contribute to Rwanda's improvement
inhealthoutcomes, reducingunder five mortality by 32percent andmaternalmortality by 10percent
by 2007. Program outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC is expected to contribute
include:
     Immunization coverage (DPT3) will increase to 85 percent in2006 and 90 percent o f the districts
     will attainat least a 80 percent DPT3 coveragerate.
     Use of insecticide treated bednets bypregnant women will increase from 10percent in2003 to 30
     percent in2006 andpercent o f children under five increases from 18percent to 40 percent.
0    Assisted deliveries will rise from 30 percent in2003 to 40 percent in2006 nationally.
     Public spending on health increases from 6.2 percent o f total budget in2003 to 9 percent in2006
     and block grants to districts are introduced to allow for contracting o f accredited mutuelles to
     provide expandedaccess to health care to the poor.
0    Expansioninmechanisms and strategies for community and civil society participation.

  Block grants are expected to be transferred from the center to districts andor provinces conditioned on compliance of
  certain actions as established in contracts agreed between MINISANTE and corresponding local authorities. Only upon
  verification of compliance of contract clauses will MINISANTE request the transfer of resources by MINECOFIN to
  either the district, province, or facility, as the case may be. This mechanism makes MINISANTE accountable for the
  verification of contract compliance, while the provinces, districts, and hospitals are accountable to MINISANTE for
  contractcompliance.

                                                    32

96.      PriorActionsfor PRSCI.h o r actions for Grant and Credit effectiveness include:

0   Carry out performance based payment schemes for highimpact services in Butare and Cyangugu
    with donor funding; make provisions for transferring at least 50 percent of the cost to 2005
    budget; increase DPT3 coverage to 80 percent.
B.I.c. WaterServices
97.      CurrentIssues. The provision o f clean drinkingwater is a PRSP priority because water-borne
diseases and inadequate hygiene are main causes of morbidity and mortality in Rwanda. Access to
improved water supply and sanitation (WSS), accompanied by hygiene education, could improve
health, productivity, and quality o f life, and provide increased opportunities for education and
employment, especially for women and girls. Water i s also a key element for development in other
areas, such as agriculture, energy, education, health, and the environment.
98.      In 2002, the rural safe drinking water coverage rate was estimated at 57 percent, versus an
average of 46 percent for SSA. However, it is estimated that 30-35 percent of existing rural water
systems are not functional, which puts effective access to safe water inrural areas at about 40 percent,
with 4.0 of the 6.8 million rural residents having no access to potable water. The access rate to
traditional household sanitation facilities is about 85 percent. The counw's objective for ruralWSS is
to provide sustainable, user-owned and managed, safe facilities within easy reach of 66 percent of the
rural populationby the year 2010,80 percent by 2015, and 100percent by 2020. In2004, urbanwater
supply coverage is estimated at 73 percent. However, distribution networks are old and unaccounted
water levels reach 40 percent of gross supply (the deficit in Kigali City has reached a level of more
than 50 percent). The GoR's target for urbanWSS is to increase effective coverage to 80 percent by
the year 2010 and 100 percent by the year 2020 by increasing Kigali's water production capacity and
rehabilitating and extending its distribution network. In 2006, the GoR will finalize its policy for
water services delivery to urban poor people, along with a corresponding investment program. The
sector is supported by several donors who are regionally active in water resources management,
including KFW, the EU, Belgium, Austria, AfDB, and the World Bank.
99.      Building on experience under the current Bank-financed investment operation, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project, dialogue and preparatory work under the proposed PRSC Ihas
focused on output-based mechanisms coupled, as appropriate, with increased private management.
The current decentralization process provides the institutional basis for transferring responsibilities for
rural water systems to districts, on the basis ofmatching funds, while urbanwater systems remainwith
Electrogaz, the water and energy utility operating under a private management contract. The project
has tested implementation o f Rwanda's national rural water supply strategy using a community
demand-driven approach. Districts elaborate, in a participatory manner, a Community Development
Plan, selecting priority projects, including in WSS. Implementation is managed at the district level,
with or withouttechnical assistance fromthe private sector (WSS specialists attached to the provincial
administration provide technical assistance to districts to design, implement, and manage water
projects, and to monitor and evaluate support). Districts may access funding through conditional
grants available directly from projects, NGOs, the Common Development Fund, sector budget
allocations, and so forth. Users are responsible for maintainingsystem operations and for recovering
costs. In the past, community based-organizations have managed water systems, but a 2004
Directorate of Water and Sanitation (DEA) assessment concluded that this process was largely
unsuccessful. The survey highlighted successful experience for the management of WSS systems with
contracted private operators on a full cost recovery basis. Thus, further decentralization and
privatization of water services feature high on the GoR's agenda, though it is recognized that in the
short term full cost recovery may not be achievable and subsidies would be required to maintain a
safe, affordable water supply. With PRSC support, output-based aid schemes for increasing access to
safe drinking water would be explored and promoted as a mechanism for improving performance
under decentralized schemes, with or withoutprivate participation.

                                                    33

100.     The national Water Resources Management Policy o f July 1998 also noted several issues in
the sector, including inter alia (a) lack o f framework legslation and regulations governing water
planning and management; (b) insufficient technical professional staff at national, provincial, and
district levels; (c) incomplete inventory of water resources &e., lack of a water information system);
(d) increasing industrial pollution and lack o f adequate waste water treatment facilities; (e) lack of
water course development, including potentially navigable lakes; (0 inadequate watershed
management, high level o f soil erosion, and increasing variability o f flow volumes; and (g) pollution
of water courses and lakes, especially by water hyacinth. While water resources management policies
have since been established, there i s little evidence o f successful implementation as this i s dependent
on external support. Rwanda, assisted by the Bank, i s preparing a second investment operation, the
National Water Resources Management Project, whose main objectives-promoting           economic growth
through integrated management of water resources, alleviatingpoverty by allowing the poorest people
access to water, and strengthening environmental and water resourcesmanagement capacity withinthe
government and national institutions to ensure sustainability o f water resources-would       complement
support provided under proposed PRSCs.
101.     GovernmentStrutegy. The PRSP supports the development o f more efficient management o f
existingwater supply systems through private operators. This can only be achieved through a more
coordinated approach in the sector. As such, the GoR and donor partners are moving to a SWAP,
progress toward which is supported by the proposed PRSC and includes (a) improvement in sector
coordination through the participation o f all stakeholders inthe annual sector review; (b) development
o f a strategic framework by the Ministryincharge o f water (MINITERE) and main sector stakeholders
to increase direct financing to districts to implement water projects; (c) preparation of a results-
oriented MTEF; (d) strengthening of provincial-level water and sanitation units to provide improved
technical support to districts; (e) preparation and dissemination o f a district WSS manual, including
policies and guidelines, standard designs, model contract documents, tendering instructions, and
construction supervision guidelines; and (0 optimization o f options to reinforce the water production
capacity o f Kigali City. Improved coordination is also expected to improve the GoR's capability to
strengthen links between sectors, for example to implement the planned initiative to improve hygene
inschools (e.g., through a hand-washing initiative). Inaddition, the GoR, supported through a Bank-
administered PHRD grant, is preparing a new legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the
sector and plans, with PHRD and PRSC support, to strengthen institutional and human resource
capacities inthe sector and develop a sound water information base. Per the Environmental and Social
Analysis (see Annex 6), the Bank will work with the DEA to incorporate integrated environmental
management and protection o f water resources into the new policy. Most importantly, in 2005,
MINITEREis expected to adopt a coordinated program of policy interventions and investments (the
latter to be addressed through project support) focused on sustainable development o f water resources
and protection o f the environment, andwould integratethis planinto its 2006-2008 MTEF.
102.     Expected Outcomes. Outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC (complemented
bythe investment operations) is expectedto contribute include:

0    Increased access to safe drinkingwater inrural areas from about 40 percent of the population in
     2003 to 56 percent o fthe populationby2007 (66 percent of the populationby 2010).
0    Increased functionality ofwater supplysystems from 65 percent in2003 to 75 percent in2007.
0    Increased coverage rate of water supply in Kigali City from the present 73 percent to 78 percent
     by2007.
0    Adoption in 2005 and subsequent implementation (from 2006 onwards) o f a program o f
     coordinated interventions and investments inthe sector, focused on the integrated and sustainable
     development of Rwanda's water resources and protection o f its environment, along with the
     establishment o f a comprehensive water information system.
103.     Though there are no prior actions for effectiveness o f PRSC Iin the water sector, milestones
focus on enhancing the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework through development o f an

                                                      34

updated Water Policy and Water Law, and initiating the development of models, guidelines, and
standardsto assist districts incontracting private operators for localWSS systems.

B2. Energy Services

104.     Current Issues. Rwanda has among the lowest per capita electricity or petroleum products
consumption in the world. Only about 65,000 (6-8 percent) households have access to gnd-supplied
power, almost entirely inthe main cities. Diesel remains the primary fuel for self-generation inrural
areas, and for backup in urban areas, and kerosene is used for lighting by the vast majority o f the
population. All petroleum products but kerosene are heavily taxed. A combination o f strong demand
growth, with unexpectedly low lake levels in the hydropower sources-further         exacerbated by high
technical losses and unreliability o f Electrogaz's dilapidated network-have      led to extensive and
lengthypower cuts. Despite re-commissioning of an old diesel plant, load shedding has increased to
more than a thirdo fpeak demand, with serious adverse consequences.
105.     Inaddition, rapidurbanizationandindustrialdemandare stressingwood fuel supply systems
which, combined with the limited access to electricity and high cost o f petroleum products, has
recently led to rapid growth in urban charcoal demand. Retail prices o f wood fuel, and particularly
charcoal, have increased in nominal terms very rapidly during the past few years; in real terms,
charcoal i s now more expensive than ever (see Figure 5). Severe deforestation during the conflict
period, inpart by internally displaced persons andreturningrefugees, has been further compounded by
the large-scale demand for charcoal. Reforestation programs o f the 1970s and 1980s have essentially
halted. Inline with the Environmental Assessment, proposed PRSC support will aim to help the GoR
buildthe RwandaEnvironmentalManagement Agency's capacity to prepare environmental guidelines
for the energy sector.

106.     Sector reforms have accelerated, though much remains to be done quickly. The combination
o f highelectricity supply costs, hghlosses, low tariff levels, and low collection rates has persisted for
some years, with the result that Electrogaz is practically bankrupt. Its has massive debts to the GoR
and SINELAC (a consortium o f electric utilities o f the DRC, Rwanda, and Burundi), which are not
realistically serviceable. Inaddition to the five-year performance management contract with Lahmeyer
International to improve Electrogaz's efficiency, a multi-sectoral regulatory agency, Agence
Rwandaise de Regulation, has been established and recruitment o f key staff has begun. Both
Electrogaz and the Ministryincharge o f energy (MINIFRA)need sustained expansion and training o f
staff to meet planningand implementation needs. Support for policy actions, creation o f an appropriate
regulatory and licensingregime, and capacity buildingactivities are areasto be addressedwith support
of the proposed PRSC. Bank support for other activities inthe sector, such as investments inoff-grid

                                                   35

electricity and wood fuels management, wouldbe addressedthrough an investment operation, which i s
currently under preparation.
107.     Government Strategy. Energy was identified as a priority area for public action within the
PRSP, particularly rural electrification. Two main objectives were set (a) to reduce the cost o f
electricity by increasing domestic production; and (b) to begin rural electrification to promote
economic activities. The PRSP also pledged to promote improved stoves, biogas, solar photovoltaic
(PV) and solar thermal technologies, and improvedforest management as well asreforestation. Inlight
of evolving circumstances, especially the unforeseen energy supply crisis, these objectives have been
reformulated in the GoR's updated PRSP policy matrix. Inaddition, while the PRSP recognized the
need for "investment in new power generation," a new objective, "mitigating environmental, health
and safety impacts of energy production and use," was added. The PRSP foresaw the private
management contract for Electrogaz andthe creation o f a multisectoralregulatory agency. Other PRSP
activities that have begun include a study on rural electrification policy, pre-feasibility studies for
several micro-hydro sites, and a study on the use of solar PV systems for rural, public institutions.
Lack of finance has limited action on most other PRSP actions. As such, the GoR i s keen to have
broad-based engagement of donor partners and foreign private investors in the sector. A workshop,
planned for November 2004, will bringstakeholders together to discuss key issues andpolicy options.
108.     To address current grid supply shortages, Rwanda has developed an emergency action plan,
which has been adopted by the Cabinet and i s under implementation; a near-term plan is also under
preparation. Inthe near term, Rwanda will increasingly have to rely on higher-cost diesel power. At
end-June 2004, as part o f the emergency action plan, Eiectrogaz placed orders for about 12.8
megawatts of diesel generation capacity; when it i s brought on line (expected in October 2004), the
monthly fuel bill i s likely to increase up to US$1millionper month. Lookmgto the medium-term, the
GoR i s committed to expediting the development o f Lake Kivu's dissolved methane gas, initially for
power generation, withprivate sector participation.
109.     Expected Outcomes. Outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC (complemented
bythe plannedinvestment operation) is expected to contribute include:

0    Alleviate, theneliminate gridpowershortages.
0    Create a functional, predictableregulatory framework.
     Strengthen institutionalandhumanresource capacity.

110.     Though there are no prior actions for effectiveness o f PRSC Iinthe energy sector, milestones
include the development and initiation ofimplementation ofthe emergency action plan.
C. Area 3: Public Sector Underpinnings for Improved Service Delivery
Cl.Public ExpenditureManagement
111.     Current Issues. The MTEFwas formally introduced with the 2001 budget, however the link
between resources, policies, and public spending outcomes that it seeks to reinforce remains weak.
Budget allocations to priority areas are often inadequate to achieve objectives, as illustrated by the
PRSP costing exercise and corresponding financing required in relation to available b~dget.'~        In
addition, public spending does not always benefit poor people. For example, in 1998 and 1999, the
bulk of schools' non-salary, operational expenditures were financed by contributions from parents,
putting poor segments o f the population at a disadvantage. To strengthen the MTEF, and overall
public financial management, priority actions for 2004 and 2005 include to (a) improve the ability o f
the MTEFhudget system to provide predictable funding, most importantly to priority activities;
('0) integrate the development and recurrent budgets; (c) improve identification and monitoring o f
outputs and outcomes; (d) improve coordination o f public financial management reforms; and (e)
mitigate the potential for "reform fatigue," especially inline ministries.



l3See PRSP, Chapter 1, paragraph 1.44.

                                                           36

112.      The biggest medium-term challenge i s to develop a decentralized, integrated, high quality
accounting system, an area of weakness highlighted in the recent AAP.14 The Organic Budget Law
before Parliament provides the legal framework for the shift from a system that i s highly centralized
and focused on ex exante control of expenditures to a decentralized system inwhich control i s exerted
predominantly ex post through the Office of the Auditor General. This i s consistent with the modern
approach to public administration, inwhich service managers are given greater budget autonomy so as
to reduce administrative delays and place budget decision-malang closer to the point o f service
delivery. The operation of such a system in Rwanda depends crucially on the establishment of
ministerial accounts. Inaddition, inthe context o f decentralization, the mechanism for linkingbudget
transfers to district performance needs further scrutiny. In2005, the Bank plans to undertake analytic
work inthis area to help the GoR make informed choices. Questions pertain to (a) the nature and size
o f block grants to be transferred to districts, and related performance indicators; (b) the optimal
balance between central guidance and local flexibility over the near and long term; and (c) the move
away from historically basedto aneeds-basedbudget allocation^.'^
113.       Government Strategy. Regarding predictability o f resource flows to priority areas (as
identified in the PRSP), allocations have increased by more than the 0.1 percent o f GDP per year
agreed under the PRGFand, as a proportion o frecurrent spending, have risen from 38 percent in2001
to a programmed 46 percent in 2004. However, the 2000 PETS suggests that, at the district level,
spending i s considerably less than budgeted.I6 Moreover, line ministries report that budget releases
are either less than planned in aggregate terms or funds are received late. Based on findings o f the
2003 PEMR and second PRSP Progress Report, the problem revolves around the fact that there are
significant re-allocations between ministries within the budget year and that financing flows,
particularly budget support from development partners, are uneven, leadingto late expenditure release.
The level o f re-allocation points to a problem inbudget preparatiok-either activities and outputs are
under-costed or there are new activities introduced. For the preparation o f the 2005-2007 MTEF,
efforts are being made to improve the quality o f budget costing for education, health, water, and
energy. The problem o f late disbursement has been discussed fi-equently between the GoR and its
development partners; the HarmonizedBudget Support Framework i s expected to help addressthis.
114.      Integration of the recurrent and development budgets was initially planned for 2003 (so as to
be effective for the 2004 budget), however, with the elections and other disruptions, it was agreed to
postpone this. A standard structure for the development andrecurrentbudgets i splanned for 2005, and
an integratedpresentation o f the two budgets may also be possible. It i s certainly expected for 2006.
Development o f SIBET IIsoftware (now being piloted) should facilitate integrated monitoring o f the
development and recurrent budgets during the course o f 2005. (SIBET I,Syst2me du Budget et de
1'Etut, was originally designed to capture the majority o frecurrentbudget expenditures.)
115.      Regarding the identification and monitoring o f outputs and outcomes, the MTEF action plan
includes annual training on strategy development and costing o f outputs. MINEDUC and
MINISANTE are at the forefront-for             the 2005-2007 MTEF their budgets will be prepared on the
basis o f the unit cost o f outputs, and the same may be possible for water and energy over 2006 and
2007. The education and health sectors are also the most advanced in terms of data collection for
monitoring outcomes. The GoRe GoR has established an inter-ministerial committee to focus on
improvedcoordination o fpublic financial management reforms, though the fiamework for reporting to
this committee needs to be clarified. To mitigate the potential for reform fatigue, the GoR can
implement a more formalized communication strategy to manage ministries' expectations. This should




l4The AAP concluded that Rwanda fulfilled eight of the 16 benchmarks of the tracking exercise-a result which places it
  within the middleperforminggroup of HIPC countries
  The CommonDevelopmentFundi s developingan allocationformula that maybe adapted to this purpose.
l6It should be pointed out that these surveys covered expenditures in 1998 and 1999. More recent communications with
  district officials suggest some improvement,but releasesfromprovinces are still significantly lessthanbudgeted.

be feasible given technical as~istance'~and other resources available to support public financial
management reforms.
116.     Regarding the accounting system, a complete set o f accounts for 2003 has been completed and
submitted to the Auditor General. The Auditor General's report will provide a sense of progress to
date and additional resources needed to further strengthen the accounting system. A significant
program o f training has been initiated, and the SIBET 11system includes an accounting module in
which an integrated financial management system can be established. Regarding budget transfers
based on performance agreements, public sector entities in each PRSC-targeted sector have been
developing policies and strategies articulating the incentives framework that will be used to purchase
specific sectoral outputs.      Public sector entities have already been entering into partnerships with
autonomous providers and the private sector, whether through parastatals (e.g., Electrogaz's private
management contract) or directly (e.g., water-user committees, NGO-run health centers). These
relationships need to be integrated into a policy and legal framework, and expected results enshrined
incontractualarrangements.
117.     Expected Outcomes. Outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC is expected to
contribute include:

0   FiscalRevenue is at least 11percent o f GDP duringFY2004-2006.
0   Public spending onPRSP priorityprograms increase at faster rate thanoverall expenditures.
    Public Spending onHealthincreases from 6.2 percent in2003 to 9 percent in2006.
0   Public Spending onprimaryeducation increases from21.4 percent in2003 to 24 percent in2006.
118.     PriorActions for PRSCI.Prioractions for Grant andCredit effectiveness include:

0   Implemented adequate macroeconomic framework.
0   2005 Budget Framework Paper available, consistent with macro-framework, 2005-2007 medium
    term expenditures framework and PRSP priorities; and detailed output oriented medium term
     expenditures frameworks for education andhealth.
0   2003 budget execution report submitted to Auditor General and presentedto Parliament.
C2. Transparencyand Accountability
119.     Current Issues. According to the PRSP, key challenges to good governance in Rwanda
include national reconciliation; political legitimacy with popular political participation; justice and
humanrights; andtransparency and accountability inpublic actions. The PRSP states that without an
end to the mentality o f exclusion and impunity, and an acceptance by all social groups that
development is possible only if all work together toward common goals, good governance would be
out ofthe question.
120.     On political legitimacy and participation, decentralization o f the state was designed to
encourage grassroots democracy and broad participation indecision-makmg, and foster accountability
and transparency at all levels of government. Improvingtransparency will require strengthening the
fiduciary  framework and increasing the leverage of Rwandan citizens' oversight of the government
and service providers. With decentralization, local authorities will be accountable to the people inthe
districts and not to the central government. Regardingjustice andhumanrights, the country is dealing
withthe adjudication ofcases ofthe over 100,000 genocide suspects injail. The Gacaca (community-
based tribunal) process was adopted to deal expeditiously with over 80 percent of suspects, and the
Human Rights Commission, established in 1998, i s dealing with the remainder. The GoR must also
raise the population's awareness, particularly the awareness of public servants, police, and the
military,ofresponsibilities inthe observance ofhumanrights.
121.      Modernization       o f the country's fiduciary framework began in 1998. The Office of the
Auditor General andthe NTB were established and the process of revising the laws, regulations, and
guidelines governing public financial management initiated. The GoR revived the Office of the

Inspector-General of Finance and Audit, with responsibility for coordinating the internal audit of
government agencies' finances, including the Public Accounts Division o f MlNECOFIN.
Improvements to the cash management system, preparationo f an Organic Budget Law, completion of
a FARAP, further strengthening o f the Auditor General's Office, and issuance of guidelines for
opening, closing, and monitoring government bank accounts were undertaken. In2002, the Office of
the Auditor General conducted audit missions o f 10 ministries (including defense) and 13 projects.
Professional audit standards were put inplace, and a new Auditor General Act drafted. Inaddition, a
new Division of Public Accounts was set up in MINECOFIN, to develop accounting structures and
systems inline with the MTEFandthe budget.
122.      Government Strategy. The PRSP stressed the need for the GoR to ensure transparency and
accountability in public actions; work in partnership with civil society, communities, the private
sector, and development partners; and prioritize public actions through a consultative approach to
policy making. This new role requires a fundamental reorientation o f the state, to function in a
facilitative rather thanimperialmanner.
123.      The FARAPis the main diagnostic study o f the public financial management environment in
Rwanda. In follow-up to the FARAP's findings, a detailed action plan (constituting the PRSP
implementation and reform program) was agreed between the GoR and donors. Support has been
offered, most notably from the EU, to help the GoR implementFARAPrecommendations (see Box 5).
Commendable efforts have also been expended to establish a mechanism to coordinate and monitor
reforms inpublic financial management, with the establishment of a special purpose National Steering
Committee. With regard to decentralization, there are encouraging signs in the area o f financial
management. Training programs for local government staff, supported by donors, have been carried
out and a Manual o f Financial Management Procedures for Local Administrations was issued by
MINALOC. The GoR intends to continue training programs to upgrade local level capacity on a
regularbasis.
124.      The CPIP found that Rwanda has managed to perform reasonably well in the absence o f a
recognized legal framework underpinning the public procurement system. The procurement process i s
fairly transparent and corruption is considered limited. This has been possible because of the GoR's
prevailing pragmatism, political will, and commitment to good governance. The NTB has performed
satisfactorily since its inception in 1997, and was instrumental inthe organization and modernization
o f Rwanda's public procurement system. However, the NTB is now struggling to reconcile its
operational role and its policy making, oversight, and capacity buildingfunctions. Lack o f proficient
procurement staff i s also being exacerbated by decentralization. An action plan, following on the
CPIP, i s under discussion with the GoR. It i s expected to focus on design and implementation o f a
broad training program for all procurement entities and rationalization o f the NTB's functions,
ensuring that it is empowered to concentrate on policy formulation, guidance, and capacity building
while procuring entities take the lead in handling bidding documents. In compliance with the
Constitution, the legal and institutional framework for public procurement is expected to be
institutionalizedwith the adoption o f a new Public Procurement Law.

Box 5. FARAPFindingsandRecommendations




125.     To enhance government accountability, citizen report cards will be initiated and
institutionalized as part of the Poverty Obsewatoire's regular activities. The role of users in
monitoring accountability, particularly for quality o f and access to basic services, translates sectorally.
Inhealth policy, this includes the community based micro-insurance schemes, health management
committees, and consumer organizations; in education, it includes establishment of parent-teacher
associations; in energy and water, it includes the development of users' groups and increased
involvement of users in utilities' governing bodies. Feedback from such groups will serve to inform
government entities whether policies match the population's needs and whether sector strategies for
policy implementation are being carried out effectively.
126.     Expected Outcomes. Outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC is expected to
contribute include:
    Improved adherence to Finance Law inbudget execution.
    Improved management, supervision, and transparency in financial management as assessed by
    annual PRS Review.
0   The Public Procurement Law and national standard biddingare adopted and enforced.
    At least 80 percent of the amount in value of public contracts are awarded through competitive
    process.

0   At least 50 percent of the contracts contained inthe procurement plans of 2006 have been signed
    within the time schedulesindicatedinthe plans.
0   An independent appealmechanism iseffectively available to aggneved bidders.
127.    PRSCIPrior Actions. Prior actions for Grant and Credit effectiveness include:

0   Organic Budget Law adopted by Cabinet and submittedto Parliament.
0   Public Procurement Law and recommendations of the CPIP (Country Procurement Issue
    Paper) are adoptedby Cabinet and submitted to Parliament.
0   Law establishing the Ombudsman office is published in the Official Gazette and mediators are
    elected inall cellules and sectors.
C3. Monitoring
128.     Current Issues. InRwanda, capacity to identifymeaningful indicators as well as to generate,
analyze, and use data is limited, especially at the local level. There are also uneven levels o f
understanding o f monitoring and evaluation functions, and analflcal capacity to draw linkages across
indicators and sector strategies is often laclung. A particular challenge i s represented by the need to
assure the effective utilization o f information by policy-makers and service providers, and its timely
feedback to these and other stakeholders, including service users and civil society actors. Downward
information flow can significantly empower people, particularly community based organizations,
enhancing awareness of rights and increasing transparency and accountability. In the context of
decentralization, there is also an urgent need to integrate poverty data with financial data at different
levels inthe context o f decentralization. Inaddition, as discussed, significant challenges are associated
with the need to better linkprograms, the budget, and the MTEFprocess, and to better integrate the
recurrent and development budgets.
129.     Every sector i s expected to develop its own monitoring and evaluation fiamework, including
indicators and targets, to establish an effective management information system to generate routine
data. Significant advances inthis area inthe education andhealth sectors, where the SWAP and sector
working group approacheshave functioned particularly well, confirm that the development o f a good
monitoring and evaluation framework i s based on sound strategy design, a well plannedprogram, and
good coordination. Inaddition, at the end o f 2003, MINECOFIN and MINALOC, in collaboration
with other ministries, piloted data collection in eight districts. The aim is to develop monitoring and
planningcapacity at the district level andto track a core set of indicators allowing district agenciesto
make decisions taking local needs and pnorities into consideration. There i s a strong commitment to
bringingthis district-level monitoring system to the national scale, andresources havebeenearmarked
for this initiative inthe PRSP Trust Fund. For this system to generate information that can be used at
different levels, the establishment o f a simple computerized database (managed at the district level, but
accessible to all) i s being studied. Such activities are an integral part o f the sector strategy design
process andmustbe ledwiththe participation o fkey stakeholders.
130.     The most critical challenge i s aligning ministries' initiatives with those taken by donors. A
range o f monitoring and evaluation approaches and systems has been developed independently o f one
another for particular purposes, few o f which are harmonized or build upon completed or planned
work. The danger is a proliferation o f approaches and systems, none o f which provide a holistic,
thorough picture o f the GoR's interventions to reduce poverty. This complicates reporting, especially
for local authorities who have limited staff and scarce resources to deal with this. The central priority
now isto establish a common monitoring and evaluation fr-amework.
131.     Government Strutegy.         The GoR has launched several initiatives to monitor PRSP
implementation. In 1998, a monthly "flash report" on actual and budgeted expenditures was
established by the budget department, to monitor the cash flow o f the recurrent budget. At the same
time, CEPEX was created to improve the coordination o f investment projects. CEPEX has initiated a
computerized financial monitoring system (Public Books) to monitor the development budget. This
system, which is still under development, has been adapted to SIBET, which was designed to capture
the majority o f recurrent budget expenditure on inputs. The joint monitoring system, piloted in

                                                     41

MINEDUC, MINISANTE, MININTEREand two provinces beginning in 2002, aims i s to strengthen
the link between the MTEF and budget execution by monitoring, on a quarterly basis, achievement o f
outputs as outlined in the MTEF, and it seeks to combine reporting requirements for recurrent and
development budgets and the PRSP. The system is now being re-piloted in MINEDUC and
MINISANTEand, basedon the pilot phase, will be extendedto involve all ministries in2005.
132. The SPPRMD was created in 2003 with the responsibility for overseeing implementation of
PRSP core programs, assuring coherence between the budget and the PRSP, and monitoring poverty
outcomes. The latter i s one o f the central tasks of SPPRMD's Poverty Observatoire, which conducts
annual reviews at the ministerial level, including data from the provinces and districts (SPPRMD has
also been providing support to ministries and districts in developing monitoring and evaluation
systems and indicators). The PRSP also stresses the need to monitor trends in well-being as well as
performance o f policies and programs. A broad consultation process with donor partners and other
stakeholders was initiated by the Poverty Observatoire to select indicators, determine data
requirements and sources, and define institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluation. The
centralpriority now i s to establish a common monitoringand evaluation framework.
133.     The main result o f the Poverty Observatoire's work i s the annual PRSP Progress Report, in
which priorities for the coming year are identified based on the data and experience logged. Currently,
project data i s collected and analyzed manually, but the possibility o f establishing a computerized
system i s under scrutiny. MINEC0FI"s department of statistics is responsible for the standardization
o f data from different sources, as well as the coordination o f surveys (e.g., EICV, CWIQ, DHS,
population census) and research. The department will soon be replaced by the Rwandan National
Institute o f Statistics. Legislation governing its activities, which has been approved by the Cabinet, i s
now with Parliament.
134.    The Poverty Observatoire promotes the use o f participatory approaches in M&E to gain a
dynamic picture o f poverty and to monitor the access to, and usage o f public services. This includes
monitoring o f users' satisfaction with service delivery as measured by annual Citizens' Report Cards.
The traditional Ubudeheprocess involves communities at the cellule level inneeds assessments, using
social mapping techniques, and w c i p a t i o n in the planning, implementation and monitoring o f
community-based projects.
135.    Expected Outcomes. Outcomes to which support under the proposed PRSC is expected to
contribute include:

0   Design a comprehensive and integrated monitoring and evaluation system based on existing and
    planned systems.
136.    PRTCIPrior Actions. Prior actions for Grant andCredit effectiveness include:

0   PRSP Progress Report (APR) reviewing 2"d year o f PRSP implementation completed and
    published.

138.    MINECOFIN is responsible for implementing the proposed PRSC and for coordinating the
completion of actions. MINECOFINwould rely on the SPPRMD and CEPEX to assure that component
sector spending plans are incorporated into the national MTEF and subsequent budget. Progress in
implementing the PRSP and the GoRs expenditure program, as well as outcome objectives, are to be
assessedaccordingto the PRSPmonitoring cycle (see Figure 6).

C. Fiduciary Aspects
139.    Financial Management. The status o f public financial management in Rwanda has been well
examined in several studies including, most importantly, the FARAP, but also the PEMR, PETS, and a
Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes. Furthermore, the GoR commissioned an appraisal of
its overall decentralization policy and implementation, including financial management aspects. This
resulted inthe Appraisal of theDecentralisationProcess in Rwanda, issued in Septeniber 2003 with the
five year DecentralizationImplementation Program. Together these reviews, which will be supplemented
inter alia by annual PERs, HIPC tracking assessments, and IMF Fiscal Transparency Reviews, provide
operational knowledge o f the GoR's public financial management system, includingbudget development,
budget execution and monitoring, external fiscal reporting and transparency, internal and external
auditing, and legislative scrutiny ofbudget execution. Infollow-up to the FARAP, donor partners andthe
GoR have agreed that an exercise will be undertaken in FY05 to assess progress in implementing the
reforms, consolidate existing knowledge on the status o f financial management in Rwanda, and address
any existing gaps inavailable analytx information.
140.    A time-bound implementation action plan to address the FARAP's recommendations has been
elaborated and implementation i s under way with EU support. Strengthening the legal and regulatory

                                                     44


framework includes presentation o f the Organic Budget Law to the National Assembly. Within this
framework, Financial and Accounting Instructionswill be elaborated together withmanuals for budgeting
accounting, public accounting, and internal audit. Technical assistance will be procured to support the
GoR to prepare these documents, and capacity building programs will be instituted to help staff learn
about the law and instructions.
141.     Procurement. The proposed PRSC is supporting the strengthening o f Rwanda's legal and
institutional procurement framework. A new Public Procurement Law and related procurement
documents, such as standard biddingdocuments, manuals and guidelines, are expected to be adopted. In
such a regulatory environment, the NTB is expected to progressively abandon prior review of bidding
documents and focus on its policy function and capacity building activities, as weak capacity o f the
country's procurement staff is the greatest riskinthis area. To t h s end, the CPIP Action Plan, supported
under the proposedPRSC, has a strong focus on capacity buildingactivities.
D. Disbursement,ImplementationArrangements,andAuditing
142.     The proposed PRSC Iwould follow the Bank's simplified disbursement procedures for
adjustment operations. The untied balance o f payments support would be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the program and not tied to any specific purchases and therefore no arrangements
would be needed. Once the Credit and Grant are approved by the Board and become effective, the
Borrower would open andmaintain a dedicated deposit account inU S Dollars at the Banque Nationale du
Rwanda for the Borrower's use. All proceeds o f the Credit and Grant would be deposited by IDA inthis
account at the request o f the Borrower. If,after depositinginthis account, the proceeds o f the Credit and
Grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA would require the
Borrower to either: (a) return the amount to the account for use for eligible purposes, or (b) refund the
amount directly to IDA.
143.     The administration o fthis Grandcredit would bethe responsibility o f the Ministry o fFinance and
Economic Planning. The financial statements o f the deposit account are to be produced in forms
acceptableto IDA.Although an audit of the deposit account would not be required, IDAreserves the right
to require audits o f the deposit account at any time by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Insuch a
case, the audit report would be submitted no more than six months after the date o f IDA'Srequest. The
audit would be conducted in line with intemational standards and would provide comfort that an amount
equivalent to the Credit andGrant proceeds was recordedandpassedonto the Treasury Single Account.
E. PovertyandSocialImpacts
144.     Rwanda's PRSP, andthus the proposed PRSC, focuses on inter alia ensuringthat poor people are
not marginalized. As such, a mainfocus o f the proposedPRSC is to ensure increased-and         increasingly
equitable-access    to basic services. Poverty and social impact analysis will be undertaken to inform
reforms supported under the proposed PRSC series. For example, PSIA o f privatization o f the tea sector
is soon to be complete.
145.     Social Diversity and Ethnicity. In the post-genocide climate, and with the support o f donor
partners, the GoR has pursued a policy o f "national unity and reconciliation." Ethnic categories have
been officially removed from legislation in favor o f regulations promoting a unified Rwandese identity.
Any'discussion along ethnic lines is discouraged and data collected inthe country are not disaggregated
along such lines. However, ethnic distinctions remain inmany people's minds. To better understand this
important social phenomenon, DFID has proposed that joint social and institutional analysis be
undertaken. The analysis and recommendations would inform PRSC I1 and public sector capacity
building activities aimed at addressing this difficult area. The GoR is also committed, at the highest
levels, to ensuring that traditionally marginalized groups, such as women and persons from the Batwa
ethnic group, are represented ingovernment. The president has recently confirmed that, early in2005, he
wouldnominatepersons from the Batwa group to fillsome open Senateposts.

146.      Gender. InNovember 1999, the GoR adopted a revised civil code, giving women the right to
inherit and own property and reserving seats for women in the National Assembly and elected local
councils. Rwanda i s now the country with the highest level o f parliamentary representation o f women in
the world: following the 2003 elections, 40 percent o f elected members were women; the number o f
women parliamentarians in Rwanda has now reached 49.2 percent. The GoR also launched a Gender
Budget Initiative, to facilitate the promotion o f gender equality and improve the effectiveness o f the
budget process. The Ministry o f Gender and Women in Development has forged a strong coalition with
local women's NGOs to champion the integration o f women into the development process and give them
a strong voice in society. The challenge ahead is to eliminate all gender disparities from existing laws
andtranslate the legislationinto tangble institutional and cultural changesthat make the laws effective. In
this regard, the GoR has adopted the National Gender Plan of Action (2000-2005), designed to meet
obligations under international conventions on the rightso f women, andthe Comprehensive Legal Action
Plan for the elimination of all gender disparities. These planswere prepared with the full participation of
key stakeholders, and the revision o f existing laws and drafting of new laws and regulations is also
expected to follow a participatory approach.
F. EnvironmentalAspects
The proposed PRSC was prepared under the Bank's Operational Directive 8.60, Adjustment Lending
Policy, under which it was considered a sector adjustment credit. As such, Operational Policy 4.01,
Environmentd Assessment, applied."               For purposes o f environmental assessment, the operation was
designated category B. Duringthe preparation o f the proposed operation, an Environmental Assessment
andSocialManagementAnalysis (see Annex 6) was carriedout to identify potentialpositive andnegative
linkages between actions under the proposed operation and environmental and social impacts. The
assessment analyzed the environmental and social issues associatedwith the four PRSC-targeted sectors
and, incorporating environmental and social analysis undertaken for other Bank operations, examined
national and local public sector agencies' roles and responsibilities to manage such issues. The broader
purpose of the assessment i s to assist the GoR in identifylngand eventually establishmg the regulatory,
administrative, and technical capacity within Rwanda to ensure that for each development program or
project undertaken in the counw, environmental and social impacts are identified, mitigated, and
monitored as part o f the sustainable use and management o f Rwanda's natural resources and the
environment. The proposed PRSC supports this objective, particularly through buildingthe capacity o f
the recently established Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA). Budget has been
allocatedfor REMA'Sactivities in2005.
147.      The assessment identified Rwanda's key environmental concems as: land degradation,
deforestation, water contamination, loss o f biodiversity and habitats, and wetlands degradation. It
identifies an indicative set o f key measures to help guide the GoR in public sector management and
monitoring in each of these areas, particularly inrelation to PRSC targeted sectors. The assessment also
examined the Bank's safeguards definition o f social impacts in regard to involuntary resettlement,
indigenous peoples," and cultural property. Though the potential for land acquisition, resettlement, and
effects on cultural resources cannot be ruled out under the proposedPRSC, such effects are expectedto be
limitedgiven that large-scale construction is not required to fulfill its objectives. Any potentially adverse

l9Note that in context of Rwanda's history, particularlyin the aftermath of the 1994 genocide, the term `indigenous peoples' is
  extremely ambiguous as it implies that some ethnic groups were established in Rwanda before others. The basis of this
  assumption was widely usedtojustify the genocideis therefore extremely sensitive. The Govemment'scurrentpolicy, as part
  of the national unity and reconciliation process, is based on equal rights for all without distinguishing between ethnic or
  regional affiliations in the country. The new Constitution states that all persons are equal before the law and shall enjoy,
  without any discrimination,equalprotectionofthe law. Inthat context, the Governmenthasmade it clear to donors that it will
  not acceptfundingthat will directlyor indirectlyencourageRwandansto identifythemselves along ethnic lines.

                                                     46


environmental impacts are deemedto be sufficiently addressedby the safeguard measuresincorporated as
part of ongoing Bank investment operations, which Rwanda's environmental management institutions
(REMA and the Ministry of Lands, Environment, Forestry, Water and Natural Resources) are
increasingly supporting.
148.    The Rwandan National Environment Policy (October 2003) sets out overall and specific
objectives as well as fundamental principles for improved management o f the environment at the central
and local levels, in accordance with the current policy o f decentralization and good governance. The
policy sets out institutional and legal reforms with a view to providing the country with a coherent and
harmonious framework for coordination o f sectoral and cross-cutting policies. It called for the
establishment of REMA, as well as the provincial, district, and lower level committees responsible for
environmental protection. The policy recognizes that environment as a sector i s a new concept in
Rwanda, requiring true awarenessand coordination of actions at all levels. An Environment Billhas been
formulated and is before Parliament; when passed, it will lay the legal framework for environmental
management inRwanda.
149.    The following environmental management assessments, undertaken in the context o f other Bank
projects, are also helping to address potential environmental and social impact concerns under the
proposedPRSC:

0   A detailedEnvironmental and SocialManagement Framework has beenprepared inthe context of
    the DCDP; it will inform actions under the proposed PRSC aimed at expanding and ensuring
    equitable access to education andhealth services.

0   As part of the HIVIAIDS MAP, the GoR developed an environmentally sustainable Medical Waste
    Management Plan, which i s under implementation. This will benefit proposedPRSC support to the
    health sector.

0   The RSSP elaborated an Environmental Mitigation Plan, which takes into account potential
    environmental impacts inthe area o f rural development. This will support actions under the proposed
    PRSCrelatedto the implementation o fthe GoR's export promotion strategy.

0   An Environmental Assessment was carried out as part o f the Emergency Reintegration and
    Demobilization      Project.  Issues and actions identified in the social analysis (e.g., regarding
    community reintegration, landmanagement, and gender considerations) reinforce PRSC objectives.
G.Risks andRiskMitigation
150.    The Bankrecognizes that risks inRwanda are high, however, the GoR has demonstrated a strong
commitment to pursing the goals outlined in its PRSP, and the Bank i s equally committed to working
with the GoR to support its efforts in this regard. Rwanda's successll development is crucial to
maintaining stability inthe Great Lakes region. Major risks to achievement o f PRSP goals fall into three
main categories, whch are outlined below.
 151.    Country Risks. Rwanda's recent history and its location in the highly unstable central AfXcan
region pose a potential threat to the GoR in achieving its development objectives. However, Rwanda's
internal security andpolitical situation remain stable. Though there has been an increase inthe risk o fre-
mobilization of ex-FAR and interahamwe elements in the DRC, there have also been positive actions
taken by both parties to minimize risks, including enhancing the joint verification mechanism as
previously agreed by the parties in November 2003, and multiplyingpolitical and security initiatives to
mitigate current tensions. There i s also an increasingwillingness o f the international community to put in
place the security framework necessary to preserve peace inRwanda andneighboring countries, as shown
bythe internationalsupport offeredto the Rwanda for elections heldin2004, strengthening ofthe United
Nations Operation inthe DRC, and deployment o f the UnitedNations OperationinBurundi.

                                                       47


152.     Although there have been accusations and counter accusations of violation o f the Pretoria
Agreement between the Governments o f Rwanda and the DRC, regional and international diplomatic
efforts have been deployed to prop up the agreement andrestore mutual trust. The two heads of state met
inAbuja, Nigeria inJune 2004 andset upmechanisms to conduct border surveillance, as well as resolve
future conflicts through diplomatic means and discussions. Finally, withthe support ofthe Government o f
Belgium, it was recently agreed to revive the defunct CPGL (Communaute des Pays des Grands Lacs), of
which Rwanda andthe DRC are bothmembers.
153.     The relationship between the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda is back to normal following
tensions in2000, and the two countries are keeping regular diplomatic contact to examine various issues
of mutual interest. Bilateral economic activities have resumed, especially in the field o f transport and
commerce. The repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Uganda has registered positive results and is
ongoing. Rwanda is now a full member of COMESA, one of the most active sub-regional economic and
trade organizations.
154.     In addition, Rwanda's internal security and political situation remains stable. Following the
peaceful presidential and parliamentary elections in 2003, the GoR continues to demonstrate its
commitment to good governance. A minister incharge of good governance was appointed, the Office o f
the Ombudsman was established, and elections of mediators and national women councilors were
successfully completed inJuly 2004.
155.     ProgramRisk. Risks to the programinRwanda are related to predictability of donor funding, the
GoR's ability to mobilize further grant financing, and debt sustainability concerns. Without the leverage
that all donors bringto the table, it will be difficult for the GoR to implement fully its program, including
contingent expenditures that are only realized if all donors disburse on promised commitments. The
November 2003 MOUsigned between the GoR and donors providingbudget support aims to increase the
timeliness and predictability of funding and should help to mitigate this risk; a similar MOU is under
preparation for donors providing sector investment/project support. The ability to mobilize further grant
financing, due to debt sustainability concerns, will present a real challenge for the GoR. The Bank is
prepared to be as responsive as possible (withinthe limits o f IDA grant allocations), and to try to help the
GoR inits appeals to the international community inthis regard. However, the long-term goal of reducing
dependence on foreign aid should also be pursued. To this end, it will be crucial for the GoR to
implement its growthstrategy as quickly and efficiently as possible (though inthe near term, the strategy
itself is particularly subject to exogenous shocks arising from weather conditions and international
commodity prices for coffee and tea). Though Rwanda is expected to reach its HPC Completion Point
by end 2004, debt sustainability is likely to remain a concern, and this area will require vigilance going
forward.
156.     OperationRisk. The main risks to successful implementation of the proposed operation include
weak capacity and the need to strengthen the fiduciary framework. The ambitious targets set by the GoR
indicate its optimism and commitment. However, under the proposed PRSC, additional funds are to be
transferred to the district level, where weak capacity, particularly in local administration, is a recognized
risk. To mitigate it, the Bank and the GoR designed the recently approved PSCB. The project aims
specifically to buildthe capacity of ministries andlocal staff involved inPRSC implementation, primarily
throughtargeted training. The recently approved DCDP also includes capacity buildingactivities, at the
local level. Regarding the fiduciary     framework, based on carefbl review of available diagnostics, the
Bank finds it to be adequate for implementation of a PRSC. However, there are several areas inneed of
strengthening as identified in the diagnostic studies, and the GoR has shown its commitment to
addressing them by beginning to implement the FARAP action plan. Similarly, the GoR is expected to
implement an action plan following up on the CPP's recommendations, to improve the country's public
procurement system andprocurement capacity.

 DearMr. Walfensohn,



      1. The Government of Rwanda (GoR) has developed its Poverty Reduction Strategy
          through extensive national consultatiom. The resultant Poverty Reduction Straiegy
         Paper (PRSP) waq endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and International
          Monetary Fund on August 12,2002. The actionsoutlined in the PRSP fit within the
          overallVision ofRwanda'sdevelopmentas set out in Vision 2020; which identifiesthe
         key objectives that Rwandaneeds to attain to become a middle income country by
         2020. A firstPRSPProgressReport(coveringtheperiodh mAugust2002-June2003)
         was ckulatedto the WorldBank's BoardinJune 2004. It notedsubstantialprogressin
         human development (education and health), govemnnce, and WiwWwh~
          development, as well as ihe continued commitment of authorities to structural and
         policyreforms. We haverecentlycompleteda secondPRS ProgressReport(reGewing
          the period from July 2003-June 2004) which will be circulated to the World Bank
          Board in due course. Significant progress has been made toward improved m i c e

          reforms. In the case of education net enrollment rate for pr*
          delivery in the educationand health sectors, as well as institutionaleducation
                                                                                and structural
                                                                                          has
          surpassed PRSP targets and is currently estimated to be at least 95 percent. In the
          healthsector, therehasbeenanincreaseinenrollmentinthe micro-insuranceschemes
          (mutuelles). Progress in s t " l       reforms include the demobilization arid
          reintegration of ex-combecants resulting in a reduction in defense spending, in real
          terms, h m3.3 percentof GDP in2001to 2.7 percentof GDP in2003. Inthe areaof
          governance, presidentialand parliamentaryelections have been held, and the process
          of decentralization will aim to build local capacity, to promote increasedvoice
          participation of locnt communities. There have also been measures adopted       T!

  Cabinet's recent adoption of the draft land law is one of the key actions that will
  contribute toward increased agricultural productivityfor poverty reduction, 21s well as
   the improvedpotential for revenue generation at the local level. Finally, there have
  beennlajorjudicial andlegalreformsto improvedue recourseunderthelaw.

2. The PRSP targets halving poverty by 2015 tlrrough a private sector and rural-led
   growth strategy. The PRSP outlines six priority areas: (i)rural development and
   agriculturaltransformation;(ii) development; (3)economicinfrasarcture; (iv)
                                   human
   govemance; (v) private sector development; and (vi) institutional capacity building.
   GoR in collaboration with budget support donors, and after consultarion of other
   development partners, elaborated a Partnership Framework for budget support
  harmonization which has formed the basis for harmonization efforts during
   preparationofthe PWC. Followingthe publicationofthe PRSP and inthe process of
   preparing for the proposed first Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC I)for
   Rwanda, the GoR has been working with all donor partners, including the World
   Bank,to further develop the PRSP policymatrix into amoredetailed, implementable
   action plan to achieve the GoR' s goals in eaeh of the PRSP priority areas. PRSC f
   supports this agenda, the PRSCpolicymatrix is adirect subset ofactivitiestakenErom
   the GoR's updated PRSP policy matrix. In line with the GoR's objectives, PRSC
   support is targeted toward: private Sector fed growlh, selectively focusing on PRSP
   areas (if (v); improving sc?rvicedelivev, particularlyineducationandhealth(with
            and
   preparatory activities in water and energy), focusing on PRSB meas (ii)and (3);and
   publicsectorunderpimiings,focusinganPRSPareas (iv) and(vi).

3.  Inthe areaofprivate secfur fedgrowth,the GoRcontinues to moveforwardwithits
   privatization agenda, with the recent sale of P h d a tea factory, and the bid for
   Mulindi tea factory will soon be relaunched, along with the privatization ofCNPE
   Wuye. Similarly, privatization of the tea industry, and privatization of
   telecommunications, and other public enterprises will continue in 2005; the coffee
   sector has already beencompletelyprivatized. An export promotion strategy hasbeen
   developed nnd adopted by Cabinet, and an export promotion coinmission has been
   established with the responsibilityfor implementingthe strategy. inthe criticalareaof
   agricultud transfonmtion, the GoR has launched a study to inform a comprehensive
   agriculture and rural development strategy. In addition, the Agriculture Guarantee
   Fundhas been appropriatedinthe budget and a disbursement malmdsm to support
   agriculturalexportsin2004designed.

4. In the area of improving service deliveiy, we have made siguificant progress in
   education, though much remains to be done. To map out the forward actionsneeded,
   particularly inregardto our commitmentto universalizeprimaryschool completionby
   2015 or sooner, and to make progress in introducing fee-he, nine-year bask
   education, we have, inclose consultationwith dldonorpartners(who rire involvedin
    our sector-wideapproachto education), devcloped a comprehensive EducationSector
    Strategic Plan. As outlined in the Plan, we have reviewed alternate scenarios for
    funding the achievement of universal primary completion and have chosen w 4
    appropriate one. Other actions taken includeidentifying commendations for teacher

  development and management; reflecting our Curriculum Development Plan and
  Textbook Plan in our medium-term expenditure bnework (MlXF); completing a
  study on fmancing of higher educationand setting up BNational Council for Higher
  Educationand a Student Finance Agency for Rwank and operationalizinga system
  to transfer capitationgrantsto Primary schools to help coverthe loss infee incomeas
  we moveto fee-free basiceducation. We havealso determinedthe membershipofand
  agreed on term of reference for a task force that will plan for the Monitoring of
  LearningAchievement so thatwe are ableto measure andtrackprogress inoutcomes

   We have introducedsalary supplements for healthworkers assigned to remote areas.
   Inaddition,DPT3coveragehasincreasedto 80percent.

6. Repding water and energy services, support under PRSC Ihas been channeled to
  preparatory activities and dialogue to support the establishment of appropriate
   regulatory frameworks in these sectors and identification of capacity buitding
   activities. In the energy sector, PRSC support has also helped us to develop an
   emergeiicy action plan of newterm measures to address the current energy crisis.
   PRSC IIis expectedto deepen support inthe water and energy sectorsby helpingto
   focus on implemmtationof recommendarionscoming out of the PreParafQry work.

7. In the area ofpublic sector mdepinnings, PRSC support is helping us to achieve
   objectives related to three key issues: public finance and cxpenditurc:management,
   transparency rrnd accountability, and monitoring and evaluation. Regarding the first
   two, afkr a difficult year in 2003 inwhich we e x p e r i d several exogenousshocks,
   we have been able to get our macroeconomic fmmework back on track We have a
   2005 BudgetFrameworkPaperthat is consistentwith this maGIoeconomj,cfitmework
   and with P U P priorities. The Organic BudgetLaw has beensubmittedto Parliament
   as kas the 2003 budget execution repa which was also submitted to the Auditor
   Generaf who has certifiedthe 2003 accounts. We have adopteda budgetctassification
   system that harmonizesrecurrent and development expendituresand minstituthqa
   second generationcomputer program that will allow us to integrate them. A standad
   Dis$rict finmcial report has been developed, to be published amually. The 18w
   establishing the Ofice of the Ombudsman was passed and mediators have been
   electedat local administrativelevels(i.e., sedeut and cdde). Furthermore,dlsenior
   public officials have declaredtheir wealthas partofrequirementfor service. A Public

The Executive Boardofthe International MonetaryFund(IMF) has completedthe second
andthirdreviews ofRwanda'seconomic performanceunderthe PovertyReductionand
GrowthFacility(PRGF) arrangement. As aresult, Rwandawill be eligible to draw an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.14 million(about US$1.68 million), bringingthe total amount
disbursed under the arrangementto SDR 2.29 million (about US$3.38 million).

The Boardalso reviewed Rwanda'sAnnual ProgressReport onPovertyReductionStrategy
Paper andconcluded that it provides a sound basis for continued access to Fundconcessional
financial assistance. Inaddition, the Executive Boardapproved additional interim assistance
underthe enhancedHeavilyIndebtedPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative ofSDR 4.482 million
(about US$6.6 million) throughJune 8,2005.

Incompletingthereviews,theBoardgrantedwaivers forthenonobservanceofquantitative
performance criteria for end-June 2003 and end-December 2003, and structural performance
criteria for end-December2003, end-January 2004 and end-March 2004.

Rwanda's PRGFarrangement was approved on August 12,2002 (see PressReleaseNo.
02/36), for SDR 4 million (about US$6 million).

The PRGFisthe most concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs isbasedon country-owned poverty reduction strategiesadopted ina participatory
processinvolvingcivil society and developmentpartners, and articulated ina Poverty
Reduction StrategyPaper (PRSP). This is intended to ensurethat PRGF-supported programs
are consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social
policies to foster growth andreducepoverty. PRGF loans carry an annualinterest rate o f 0.5
percent andare repayable over 10years with a 5 '/-year graceperiod onprincipal.

Incommenting onthe ExecutiveBoard's discussiononRwanda, Agustin Carstens,
DeputyManagingDirector andActing Chair, stated:

                                            - 2 -




"The wide rangeofchallengesfacedbyRwanda in2003, includingthe adoptionof anew
constitution andnational elections, stretchedits limitedcapacity. Macroeconomic
performance andpolicy implementation fell short o fthe standardsthat hadbeenmaintained
inpreceding years. However, the authorities' renewedcommitment to the program's
objectives has been accompaniedby some improvements ineconomic indicators in2004.

"With the politicaltransition completed, strengthenedpolicyimplementation will beneeded
to achieve the program's objectives during2004. Underthe program, real GDP growth i s
expected to accelerateto 6 percent, while monetary policywill aim at limitinginflation to 5
percent by year's end. Fiscal policy will center on consolidating recent gains inrevenue
mobilizationandtake advantageo f increasedexternal budgetarysupport to address critical
social needs, includingfree primaryschooling and extendedhealth services, inline with the
Poverty ReductionStrategy Paper. Spending underthe programwill be carefullymonitored
to ensure transparency andtightenedmanagemento fpublic resources, as well as the
appropriate fundingo fpriority sectors, andwill be complementedby a strengthening o f
procedures for public procurement. Inaddition, giventhe highdebt burdenthe authorities
will limitnewexternalborrowingandpromote higherdomestic savings.

"Structural policieswill focus onpromoting growth by encouragingprivate investment,
improvingthe legal framework, andstrengtheningpublic financial administration. Priority
will also begivento privatizationofstate enterprises-including inthe telecommunications,
tea, banking, and hotel sectors-export promotion, and addressingweaknesses infinancial
sector supervision. Itwill be essentialthat the authorities work closely with external and
domestic partners to achieve these objectives, tackle the serious capacity constraints facing
Rwanda, andimprove social conditions. Inaddition, growth and social progresswill require
Rwanda's continued commitment to securing a lastingpeace inthe Great Lakes area," MI-.

Annex 5: RWANDA:ProposedComprehensiveHarmonizationFrameworkand
ActionPlan



Consultative Group Meeting, December 4,2003

This Harmonization Framework and Action Plan proposed by the Government o f Rwanda
builds on the achievements of the Strategic Partnership for Africa (SPA) budget support
harmonization initiative. The framework outlines immediate and medium-term proposed
actions for harmonization o f donor procedures and practices at sectorlprogram and project
levels, for discussion, review and feedback. Giventhe achievements andagreements reached
between donors at budget support level, Budget Level Harmonization will be incorporated in
the revised draft to reflect the comprehensive nature ofthe proposedplan.

The proposed actions are based on practices and procedures identified by the Government o f
Rwandaandin-country donor practitioners as those:

0   That represent high transactions costs; and

0   Where flexibility indonor practices may allow for "quick wins" interms o f harmonized
    practices andproducts.

The framework also takes into account the status of donor coordination and extent o f donor
engagement across sectors and programs. The proposed actions rely on: (i)  the OECD-DAC
and MDB Working Groups' Best Practice hnciples (see:               Harmonization of Donor
Practicesfor Effective Aid Delivev, OECD-DAC Guidelinesand Reference Series, January
2003); and (ii)  country-level harmonization implementation experience in similar settings.
An annexed table, outlines ongoing and planned country-level harmonization initiatives, also
for review comments, and suggestionsfor improvement.

Introduction

The proposed PRSC I(see Project Information Document, Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet, and
forthcoming Program Document) will provide budget support to the Government o f Rwanda (GoR) to
help the Government implement the goals outlined in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of
July 2002, andmeet MillenniumDevelopment Goal (MDG)-related PRSP objectives. PRSCIwill bethe
first inaplannedseries o fthree PRSCs through the period 2007.

This Environmental Assessment (EA)' analyzes the cross-cutting environmental and social issues facing
Rwanda in each of the four PRSC-targeted sectors, i.e., education, health, water, and energy, and
identifies ways in which the GoR can enhance its capacity, with support under the PRSC series, to
manage potential environmental and social impacts. The analysis takes into account EA and other
relevant assessments and ongoing or planned Bank activities inRwanda. It also proposes key measures
that the GoR can take so that sector ministries, local governments, and other institutions develop the
capacity to manage environmental and social issues during the preparation and implementation o f
development programs and projects, irrespective o f the source of financing.

This EA i s comprised of the following sections: Program Description, World Bank Environmental and
Social Compliance Requirements, Analyses o f Environmental and Social Issues, and Environmental and
Social Management Capacity.

I.ProgramDescription

A. Overview ofPRSCProgram

The objective o f the proposed PRSC series i s to support the GoR in its efforts to implement its Poverty
Reduction Strategy aimed at: (a) creating a favorable private sector investment climate that would
promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; (b) improving the quality, coverage,
and equity in the delivery o f basic human development services, and increasing expenditure efficiency;
and (c) enhancing public expenditure management and governance, with an emphasis on expanding the
voice andparticipationof citizens.

Actions in the education and health sectors are fully integrated into the proposed PRSC I,           while for the
water and energy sectors the focus i s on preparatory work (e.g., strategy development, costing of
scenarios). PRSC I1would be expected to engage fully inactions inall four sectors, and PRSC 111would
aim to scale up service delivery in these sectors. In each o f these sectors, results-orientated budgeting,
through the use of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), public expenditure management,
andtransparency and accountability would be addressed. The proposedPRSC will be complementedby
several ongoing and/or plannedWorld Bankprojects inRwanda (see Table 1).

B. PotentialEnvironmentaland SocialImpactsofPRSCI

Because the proposed PRSC Iwill provide direct budget support to the GoR, it will not be feasible to
identify activities financed by PRSC funding, separately and distinguishable from other sources ofbudget
financing. Therefore, adverse environmental and social impacts specifically associated with the PRSC are
not distinguishable. Thus, the purpose o f this EA i s to assist the GoR in identifying and eventually
establishing the regulatory, administrative, and technical capacity within Rwanda to ensure that for each
development project undertaken in the country, environmental and social impacts are identified,
mitigated, and monitored as part of the sustainable use and management o f Rwanda's natural resources
and the environment.

11. WorldBankEnvironmentalandSocialComplianceRequirements

As PRSC Ihas been designated a Sectoral Adjustment Credit, in compliance with OD8.60, the
requirements o f OP4.01 apply.* Environmental and social issues are broadly defined according to the
scope o f OP4.01, i.e., the natural environment (air, water, land), human health and safety, and social
aspects including, but not limited to, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property.
The World Banks Safeguards Policies are:

1. Environmental Assessment (OP4.01, BP4.01, GP4.01)
2. Natural Habitats (OP 4.04, BP4.04, GP 4.04)
3. Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36)
4. Pest Management (OP 4.09)
5. Cultural Property (OPN 11.03)
6. Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
7. InvoluntaryResettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
8. Safety of Dams (OP 4.37, BP4.37)
9. Projects onInternational Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50)
10. Projects inDisputedAreas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60)

The EA Category assigned to PRSC Iis Category B.Therefore, inthis EA:

a) An analyses o f the environmental and social issues potentially raised by PRSC I, with the   associated
    four targeted sectors of education, health, water and energy, has been undertaken.
b) Based on this analysis, the roles of public sector agencies (sectoral and central, national and
    decentralized) to manage these issues i s examined and responsibilities for monitoring and managing
    these issues arising from proposed activities under PRSC Iand other ongoing, Bank-supported
    operations are assigned.
c) Also based on the above analysis, an indicative set of key measures has been identified to help guide
    the GoR in public sector monitoring and management of the environmental and social issues
    discussed.

The applicability of other safeguard policies listed above will be discussed in the context of sectoral
PRSC Iactivities and ongoing Bank-supported projects, and recommendations to manage relevant issues
will be harmonized with the b) andc) above. Incompliance withthe Bank's Disclosure Policy3, this EA
will be disclosed both in Rwanda and at the World Bank's InfoShop in Washington, DC and via the
WorldBank's web site (www.worldbank.org).

111. Analysis ofEnvironmentaland SocialIssues

A. BriefOverview ofKey Biophysical Environmental Features

Rwanda is a small, mountainous, landlocked country located in Central Africa, bordering Burundi,
Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with Kigali as its capital. Rwandahas
a total surface area of 26,338 square lalometers, of which the total landarea is 24, 948 square kilometers,
and 1,390 square lulometers is water, with the lowest altitude o f 950 meters at Rusizi River and the
highest altitude of 4,5 19meters at Mount Karisimbi. The average altitude is 1,250 meters above sea level.
Rwanda can be divided into six topographical regions:

e   From west to east is the narrow Great RiftValley, which slopes sharply to Lake Kivu.
e   The Volcanic Virunga Mountains, whose highest peak, the snow capped Mount Karisimbi, towers
    over the highnorthwestern lava plains.
    The steep north-south rise ofthe Congo-Nile Basins divide, whose width averages 25 kilometers.
    The ridge of the Congo - Nile Basins divide, with an average elevation of 2,750 meters above sea
    level.
    The central plateaus east o fthe mountains, which are coveredby rolling hills.
e   The savannas and swamps of the eastern and south eastern border areas, which cover one-tenth o f the
    nation's landarea andinclude the vast Kagera National Park.

Rwanda's hydrology is characterized by a dense hydrographic network of lakes, rivers, andwetlands. The
country is divided into two major drainage basins, the Nile to the east and the Congo to the west. The
Congo River Basin covers 25 percent ofRwanda and receives 10percent of the total national rainfall. The
Nile River Basin covers an area o f 75 percent of the territory and receives 90 percent of the national
rainfall. The waters o f the Nile Riverbasin flow out throughthe Akagera river system, which contributes
between 8 and 10 percent to the Nile drainage system. Rwanda's high altitude accounts for its tropical,
highland climate. Daily temperatures typically reach 25 degrees Celsius. There are two rainy seasons, one
from Octoberhlovember to January and the other frommid-march to the end ofMay.

Rwanda has some 28 lakes of significant size. Six among the largest are entirely within the national
territory: Runhondo, Muhazi, Mugasera, Ihema, Rwanye, and Burera. Three others, Rugwero, Cyohoha,
and Kivu, are shared with neighboring countries. The largest is Lake Kivu which lies at 1,460 meters
above sea level and is 90 kilometers long (north-south) and 49 kilometers wide (east-west). From an
average depth o f 220 meters, it plunges to a maximum depth of 475 meters. Lake Kivu has a rough,
jagged coast and contains numerous islands, the largest of which is Idjwi. Lake Kivulies on the border
with Congo in Western Rwanda at the foot o f the Virunga Volcanoes. Kivu's shores are densely
populated and the principal town on the Rwandan side is Gisenyi. Although it is supplied with fish, the
lake is poor in fauna, but rich in volcanic substance. Great volumes of dissolved methane gases that may
be developed as an energy source exist in its deep waters.       Lake Kivu drains to the south into lake
Tanganyika by the swiftly descending Ruzizi River. The Central Plains are drained by the Nyabugogo,
and Akanyaru rivers. Rwanda's eastern border is formed by the Akagera River on its way to Lake
Victoria. The rivers and lake cover some 135,000 hectares, or 5 percent ofnational territory.

The dense high altitude forests of Volcanoes National Park is home to about half (320) of the world's
remaining population (650) of MountainGorillas. Mountain.The gorillas eat large amounts of vegetation
frommore than 70 different plant species and spend about 30 percent ofeach day foraging for food. They
consume roots, leaves, stems of herbs, vines from trees, shrub-sized plants, wild celery, gallium, vines,
berries, barks, andbamboo shoots. Among the 12 species of primates inthe Nyungwe National Park, are
the black and white Colobus monkeys that wonder around inhuge troupes, some o f which are made up of
over 300 agile individuals. There are also known to be 275 species of birds in the Nyungwe. In the
Akagera National Park is the largest variety of wildlife species, which includes buffalo, zebra, antelope,


                                                                                                          4

warthog, chimpanzee, lion, elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus as well as rare species such as the
giant pangolin, or anteater. The mainthreat faced by these animals i s the destruction o f their habitats and
poaching.

        anda's Environmenta Policy, Law, andInstitutio

The Rwandan National Environment Policy (October 2003) sets out overall and specific objectives as
well as fundamental principles for improved management ofthe environment, both at the central and local
levels, inaccordance with the current policy o f decentralization and good governance inthe country. The
policy sets out institutional and legal reforms with a view to providing the country with a coherent and
harmonious framework for coordination o f sectoral and cross-cutting policies. It called for the
Establishment of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) and the provincial, district,
and lower level committees responsible for environmental protection. The policy recognizes that
environment as a sector is anew concept inRwanda, requiringtrue awarenessand coordination o f actions
at all levels.

An EnvironmentBillhasbeen formulated andis currently (July 2004) before parliament; when passed, it
will lay the legal framework for environmental management in Rwanda. The main institutions with
responsibility for the environment in Rwanda are the Ministry o f Lands, Environment, Forestry, Water
and Natural Resources (MINlTERE) and the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA).
The latter was only recently established. Within the MINITEREi s the Directorate of Environment, which
i s broadly responsible for policy issues, monitoring policy implementation, and the budget, whereas
REMA is the technical arm of MINTEREresponsible for implementing environmental policy. At the
local level, the District i s an autonomous decentralized administrative structure with a legal status and
financial autonomy. Ithas two principalpoliticalbodies:

a) The District Council. This entity i s responsible inter alia for enforcing the laws of Rwanda,
     promoting governance based on democracy, preparing regulations governing the District,
     implementing Government decisions, adopting the District's development action plan, adopting the
     District's budget, fixing the maximum amount to release from the District's funds, following up on
     the activities o f the Executive Committee (see below), coordinating activities o f the sectors,
     approvingany grants, bequests, and credits that the District may receive.
b) The Executive Committee. This entity is responsible initer alia for administration o f the District,
     preparation o f the District Development Action Plan, implementation of the district budget,
     preparationo f quarterly and yearly reports, and examinationandresolutipn o f problems not solved at
     the Sector level.

     C.1.Analysis of K qEnvironmentalIssues ConcerningtheEducationSector

     On the hardware side, the construction andrehabilitation of school buildings and sanitary facilities under
     the Human Resources Development Project and/or the Decentralization and Community Development
     Project i s not expected to cause significant adverse impacts. Most impacts are local and can be easily
     mitigated. The funding of school construction under these operations is subject to comprehensive


                                                                                                                                    a

screening (usingstandardized checklists), negative environmental impacts are identified and mitigated by
adjusting architectural designs and civil works contractual obligations, and implementation o f mitigation
measures is monitored at the district level with support from the project.

On the software side, the absence o f environmental awareness among Rwandese i s among the root causes
o f many environmental concerns affecting the country. The Government is cognizant of the need to
address this situation and is determined to introduce environmental education through the primary and
secondary school curricula, through study of the need to protect the natural environment for sustainable
economic income from suitable management o f natural resources and for increased awareness on the
direct impact onpublic health. Key measures to guide the GoR to address these issues include:


0    MINEDUC (Ministry o f Education) to develop environmental education curricula for primary and
     secondary school education.
0    REMA to develop training manuals in environmental education for primary and secondary school
     teachers.
0    Issue o f standard design guidelines for primary and secondary school construction necessitating at a
     minimumthe inclusion of: (i)    sanitary facilities with sewage systems and water provided from wells
     or by water harvesting; (ii)  canteen/school kitchens to have standpipes; and (iii)   schools to have
     energy-saving cooking stoves or ovens to ensure efficient use ofbiomass fuel.

C.2. Analysis of Key EnvironmentalIssues ConcerningtheHealth Sector

The construction andrehabilitation o f health care facilities under Bank-finance operations is not expected
to cause significant adverse impacts. More serious environmental concerns are likely during the day to
day operations of these facilities. The greatest risk comes from the ineffective management o f medical
and human waste. The Bank-hded Multi Sectoral HJY/AIDS Project (MAP) prepared a Waste
Management Plan. The challenge for the MAP project is in finding affordable and appropriate
technologies for incineration o f medical solid waste. MAP is considering the use of locally constructed
clay ovens that can acheve the hightemperature required and along withminimumoperational (including
maintenance) costs. This Waste Management Plan forms the basis for addressing waste management
throughout the health sector in Rwanda. Regarding broader sector issues, the Ministry of Health has
developed, as part of its Health Sector Strategy Plan, an environmental public health plan. Key measures
to guide the GoRto address these issues include:

0    Directorate o f Planning at the MINISANTE (Ministry of Health) to prepare Public Health Guidelines
     for useby institutions with responsibility for public health (inwater andfood supply).
0    REMAto preparemanual for environmental public health awareness campaign.
     Training o f Public HealthInspectors for postingto Districts.
0    Training ofPublic HealthNurses for posting to Districts.

C.3. Analyses of Key EnvironmentalIssues Concerningthe WaterSector

Regarding water as a natural resource, and its cross cutting implications for the sustenance of all forms o f
life, the main environmental issues are contamination and pollution of its sources and storage areas due
primarily to pollution from lack of suitable sanitation and drainage facilities, and also from water
weedhyacinth infestation. These issues severely affect the quality o f water available for human
consumption, agriculture, energy, andthe maintenance ofnatural habitats and ecosystems inRwanda. The
Government is committed to its Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy, with its main objective being to
provide a sustainable, safe water supply andsanitation facilities based on management, responsibility, and
ownership by users.




                                                                                                          9

The national rural water supply strategy, implemented and tested under the Bank financed Rural Water
and Sanitation Project (RWSP), i s based on the concept o f a community demand driven approach and the
national decentralization policy. An EA was carried for this project to ensure proper environmental
management o f the project. At the time the EA was conducted, REMA did not exist; Thus REMA will
now get involved inmonitoring the RWSP. The Government has committed itself to finalize and publish
its Water Policy and to pass a new law to provide the legal and regulatory framework for the
implementationo f this policy. Keymeasuresto guide the GoR to address these issues include:


0    Directorate of Water, MINITERE, to incorporate integrated environmental management and
     protection o f water resources into the new policy and law.
0    Directorate of Water, MINITERE, to work closely with REMA, and the Ministies o f Health and
     Education, to ensure effective monitoring andpublic awarenessofpublic health issues.
0    REMAto monitor implementationofRWSP.
0    Directorate o f Water, MINITERE, to conduct a Sectoral Environmental and Social Assessment
     (SESA) for the water sector basedonthe new policy and law.

C.4. Analyses of Key EnvironmentalIssues ConcerningtheEnergy Sector

At the present time, most of Rwanda's power needs are the responsibility o f Electrogaz, the national
parastatal, whose main source of generation i s hydro-power. Even though this i s a renewable source, the
water reservoir levels are low, thereby affecting power output. To meet the current shortfall in demand,
plans are underway for thermal generation in the medium term and for purchasing power from
independent power producers (IPP's), particularly those usingLake Kivumethane. Inaddition, most rural
and many urban households depend on biomass fuels for domestic energy needs. This places great
pressure on forest resources.The sustainable management o f Rwanda's naturalresources lies at the centre
o f its ability to provide energy for socio-economic development. Part o f the Government's national
energy policy i s to mitigate environmental, health, and safety impacts o f energy production and use. Key
medium-term measuresto guide the GoRto addressthese issuesinclude:

0    REMAto prepare EnvironmentalGuidelines for the Energy Sector.
     MINMFRA (Ministry responsible for Energy) to conduct a Sectoral Environmental and Social
     Assessment (SESA) for the sector based on the energy policy and rural electrification policy so as to
     informthe planning processas new electricity generation isbrought into service.
0    Buildcapacity of Electrogaz throughtraining andtechnical assistanceand at the provincial levels for
     environmental management ofnatural resources.
0    Conduct EL4for the Generation Master Plan and the Extension o f Kibuye-Karongi transmission line
     to connect to the methane plant.
0    MININFRA to review wood fuel related legislation and to draft new legislation to bring it into
     compliance with new policy.
0    MI"FR4 and REMA to launch Public Awareness Campaign for energy efficient use of
     woodcharcoal awareness.

D. BriefOverview ofKeySocialIssuesAffectingRwanda

Rwanda remains one o f the poorest counties inthe world. Its population o f 8.2 million in2000, made up
o f Hutus, Tutsis, and Batwas, i s growing at between 2.5 to 2.9 percent per annum. Its population density
of 337 per squarekilometer in 1999is inthe top ten inthe world, nearly 50 percent o fthe population is 16
years old or younger, and 90 percent live inrural areas. Agriculture is the primary economic activity for
this 90 percent. Rwanda ranout of new arable land almost 20 years ago and agricultural productivity has



                                                                                                        10

been on the decline. The severe degradation o f scarce land, forests, and water resources that support
agnculture has become a challenge to the revival of the rural economy.

The legacies o f the genocide continue to weigh heavily on the social and economic recovery o f Rwanda.
The genocide and the preceding civil conflicts impoverishedRwandese and increased their vulnerability,
particularly widows and orphans of the genocide, recently returned refugees, resettledinternally displaced
persons (IDPs), and the families of the detained 120,000 (at the peak) suspects o f crimes o f genocide. In
2000,40 percent o f children between the ages o f 7-14 were orphans (have lost at least one parent). Mental
health problems, largely the result o f the horrors o f the genocide and its aftermath, are widespread in a
society that i s not well-equipped to deal with it. A 1995 UNICEF survey found that 96 percent witnessed
violence during the genocide, 88 percent saw dead bodies or parts o f bodies, and 70 percent witnessed
someone beinghlled or injured.

A recent survey ofthe populationfound that poverty/economic hardship, security, healthcare, andlack of
trust/sincerity are the major social problems. The loss o f social capital and community solidarity that help
to cope with poverty has increased social and economic vulnerability. The rebuilding o f the social fabric
will take time; continued assistanceto reintegrate the vulnerable populations and the rapid expansion o f
economic opportunities will acceleratethe process.

Despite these difficulties, over the last decade the country has been steadily moving out o f the post
conflict phase. Many refugees have returned and the reconciliation process has significantly progressed.
Rwanda has taken huge strides toward pro-poor measures aimed at improving social services, reducing
gender disparities, and initiating a serious effort to fight HIV/AIDS. Health indicators have improved
steadily after the genocide and are reaching close to pre-genocide levels. Enrollment has increase at all
levels o f education, with net and gross enrolments surpassingpre-genocide levels, and enrolment of girls
i s at with that ofboys.

D.1. Characteristicsof Poverty

The PRSP benefited from a number o f recent surveys (completed in 2000 and 2001) in this area,
including the Household Living Standards Survey (HLSS), the Core Werfare Indicators Questionnaire
(CWQJ, and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHg. These confirmed that living conditions in
Rwanda, while slowly improving since 1994, continue to be very poor, particularly in the rural areas.
Rwanda's per capita income o f US$230 is still much lower than the US$370 it was in 1990; in addition,
60 percent o f households live below the poverty line, compared to about 40 percent in 1985. Ninety
percent o f the population live rural areas and depend on agnculture for their livelihood. The HLSS
showed a significant change in income inequality, with urban populations doing much better than rural
ones. Basedon these surveys and the results o f the in-country consultations with local communities, local
and central govemments and civil society members, during the preparation o f this EA, the following
characteristics o fpoverty were derived:

Who are thePoor?
0    Ruralhouseholds.
0    Female headed households, other households with less than two adult-members, elderly and
     handicappedpersons.
0     Large households.
0    Recently resettled internally displacedpeople (IDP's) andreturned andreturningrefugees.
0     The Batwa People.
0     The "assetless," i.e., landless, those withno livestock, etc.

These groups are not mutually exclusive.



                                                                                                           11

Why are they poor?
   RuralHouseholds
    low agricultural productivity, declining soil fertility and environmental degradation.
    lack of access to land, land fragmentation, insecurity o f landtenure.
    lack o f access to markets, absence of rural commercial activity and alternative income earning
    opportunities.
    social and economic isolation due to hightransport costs and insecurity.
   poor health services and health standards and rise in HIV/AIDS incidence, impacting negatively on
    productivity.
    loss o f capital stock ( livestock and other animals) inthe genocide.
    poor agricultural extension services, lack o f accessto andknowledge o fthe use of improved inputs.
    lack of access to low cost capital or micro-credit or micro-grants.
    lack o f access to affordableand sustainablehousehold energy sources.

    Female-headed households

    declining soil fertility
    many women have to take care o f husbandsand sons inprison, dependantparents,         orphans,
    handicapped husbands andchildren, returning refugees, and other dependents.
    low education attainment, poor access to land, paidemployment and credit
    poor social services, e.g. water, health, education etc.

    Recentlv returned refugeesand resettledIDPs
    lack o fpermanent housing.
    access to social services, water, healthcare andeducation
    lack o f landand other assets
    loss o f capital stock- livestock, coffee bushes, bananaplantations, farm implements and supplies.
    lack o f social support due to disconnection with or dislocation from originalhuclear families as
    resettlement was arbitrary and not to original home base.

    UrbanPoor
    rapidincrease inurbanpopulation.
    no employment opportunities particularly among poorly educated young people.
    poor basic social services and infrastructure.
    lack o fhousing.
    lack ofland.
    high food prices due to low agricultural productivity, hightransport costs and restrictions on petty
    trade.

Where are the poor?

Poverty continues to be essentially a rural phenomenon inRwanda. All the provinces suffered reductions
inhouseholdandindividualincomes overthe lasttwo decades.

0.2. Analysis of SocialIssues: Land andInvoluntary Resettlement

Issues affecting landreformand administration remain a very emotive and sensitive issue and was seen as
one o f the major sources o f unrest in the past. Therefore, the Government has approached this issue
wisely, with sensitivity, and appropriate consultative and participatory processes. Key measures to guide
the GoR to address these issuesinclude:


0   LandLaw Policypassedby Cabinet.


                                                                                                       12

0    Land Law submittedto parliament.
0    Development o f Land RegistrationSystem through the development o f a Cadastre System.
0    Buildcapacity ofnew LandCenter throughtraining andtechnicalassistance.
0    Train of UrbanandPeri-Urban LancUTown Planners.

In general, development programs/projects in both the public and private sector that contain activities
which have an adverse impact on people or communities, as defined by the Bank's Involuntary
Resettlement OP 4.12, will be avoided. In such cases where this i s not feasible, affected people and/or
communities will be identified, participate in relevant project/program activities, be fully compensated,
and have entitlements delivered before the activities causing the impact are started. Affected
persons/communities must also have the gnevance mechanisms explained to them and assisted to use
these mechanisms when they believe they are grieved. Particular attention should be paid to identified
vulnerable groups, and their post resettlement condition must be monitored to ensure successful
mitigation.

In ongoing or planned Bank projectdprograms where a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was
prepared by the GoR and publicly disclosed, affected persons would be treated in ways and manners
consistent with that WF. For programs/projects that did not envisage involuntary resettlement and hence
an RPF was not prepared during project preparation, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for each case
would be prepared consistent with the laws o f Rwanda and the World Bank's OP4.12. Additional key
measuresto guide the GoR to addressthese issues include:

0    Prepare a country wide strategy to manage involuntary resettlement due to public and private funded
     investments projects.
0    Buildcapacity at the central andlocallevelto implement this strategy.

0.3. Analysis of Key Social Issues:Education Sector

Rwanda has achieved remarkable progress in reviving its education system that collapsed during the
genocide. The challenge now is for Rwanda to make the transition from recovery o f the system to
sustained long-term development. To achieve ths, higher quality o f service mustbe provided as improved
access to post-primary education among those at risk of being left behind, particularly children from rural
areas andthe lowest income groups, and among girls andorphans i s increased.

Primary and SecondaryEducation. Progresshasbeenunevenacross socio-economic groups. Although
girls are as likely as boys to enroll inprimary and secondary education, they make up only about a third
o f the students in higher education. Gaps between urban and rural populations as well as across income
groups are modest in primary education, but they widen considerably in secondary education and
deteriorate evenmore inhigher education. For example, in2000 the secondary gross enrollment rate ratio
(GER) was only 6 percent inrural areas compared with 30 percent inurban areas; and the ratio among
children from the highest income quintile was 29 percent comparedwith 3 percent among those from the
lowest income quintile. While gross enrolment rates for primary education are impressive across the
gender, income and locality, the transition rate to secondary education is low. This is due in part to a
combination o f higher than normal (34 percent in 2000-2001) primary school repetition rate, less access
to secondary school due to greater travel distances, and higher costs to parents o f secondary school
students. Key measuresto guide the GoR to addressthese issuesinclude:

     GoR implements its pledge to abolish school fees for lower secondary education (i.e., the tronc
     commun cycle).
     MINEDUC to closely monitor ("follow the money") Capitation Grants, valued at 300 RwFper pupil,
     to Districts to ensuretargeted areas are reached.



                                                                                                        13

    GoR to increase funding to District EducationFunds and monitor them to ensure and intensify public
    support to particularly needy students.
    MINEDUC to increase access to secondary schools.
0   Improve quality o f service at primary schools to reduce repetitionrates.

Higher Education. Access to higher education is generally very low inRwanda. Inurban areas the gross
enrollment ratio is 8.3 percent, but only 0.5 percent in rural areas. The Government's strategy includes
encouraging financially independent private institutions to grow, and promoting greater financial and
managerial autonomy and accountability in publicly-subsidized institutions (e.g., through the proposed
creation o f the National Council for Higher Education and the Student Finance Agency o f Rwanda. Key
measuresto guide the GoR to addressthese issues include:

    Set upNational Council for Higher Education.
    EstablishStudent Finance Agency for Rwanda.

0.3. Analyses of Key SocialIssues: Health Sector

Health indicatorshave improved steadily after the genocide and are reachingclose to pre-genocide levels,
which, while impressive, are still low in comparison to Sub-Saharan Africa. There are also large gaps
between the poor and higher income groups in terms o f health outcomes and coverage. Benefits
distribution i s biased in favor o f urban areas: urban dwellers capture twice as much public spending on
hospitals as rural inhabitants. With regard to HIV/AIDS, the Barik-funded MAP i s providing assistance
for public awareness campaigns and community sensitization, testing, anti-retroviral drugs, and health
and vocational care for those living AIDS. Key measures to guide the GoR to address these issues
include:

     Increase access to andparticipationinmicro-insurance schemed"mutuelles" inrural areas.
     Improvingand broadening participation o f civil society inhealth committees at the grassroots level,
     ensuring gender balance inthe composition o f these groups.
     Expanding use o f Community Development Fund (CDF) mechanism for financing cost effective
     health care interventions (e.g., community outreach, social marketing, safe and simple water systems,
     nutrition activities).
     Ensuringa gradual and sustained increase inpublic sector financing of health care bothrelative total
     government expenditures and on a per capita basis.
     Supporting the transfer of block grants in the context o f the decentralization process to introduce
     mechanisms that target areas o f the greatest need with a view to improving equity in coverage and
     healthoutcomes.
     Standardizing user fee policies andrevising fee structures to ensure that basic services are affordable
     to the poor while monitoringthe financial impact o f fees onhouseholds.

0.4. Analysis of Key SocialIssues: Water andSanitationSector

Collecting water inrural Rwanda is a time consuming, energy demanding, and expensive daily task for
most people. According to the last national inventory of the water supply infrastructure carried out in
2001by the Directorate o f Water and Sanitation, the coverage rate for safe drinkingwater was estimated
at 57 percent inrural areas and at 60percent inurban areas. However, it i s estimated that 30-35 percent o f
the existing rural water systems are non-functional, which puts the effective access to safe water inrural
areas at about 40 percent across the country. The access rate to traditional household sanitation facilities
i s about 85 percent. The country's objective is to provide sustainable safe water supply and sanitation
facilities. Most o f the responsibilities to provide water supply and sanitation services to rural areas are

being devolved to the District level with technical support from the provincial level. Key measures to
guide the GoR to addressthese issues include:

0   Expand water production capacity inthe City of Kigali.
0   Construct hygiene facilities ina certainpercentageof schools.
0   Finalize urban Water and Sanitation Strategy, along with the corresponding investment plan.
    Ensure all 11 provinces and provincial support units (to advise districts) to be fully staffed with
    trained personnel.
0   Increase percentage of water supply systemsmanagedby local private operators.

D.5.Analyses of Key SocialIssues: EnergySector

Rwanda has among the lowest per capita electricity consumption in the world, with only 6-8 percent o f
households having grid access, almost entirely inthe main cities (with Kigali alone accounting for nearly
two-thirds o f total electricity consumption). Power and energy supply for rural households i s almost
entirely biomass for cooking and heating whereas petroleum (paraffinkerosene) i s mostly used for             ,
lighting. Reliable power supply is also a significant constraint faced by district hospitals and most
primary andsecondary schools do not have access to any form o fpower. Key measuresto guide the GoR
to address these issues include:

0   Implement strategy to addresscapacity generation constraints inthe short-term.
0   Develop andimplement strategy to addresscapacity generation over the medium- and long-term.
0   Intensify energy conservation campaign.
0   Adopt low costs standards.

IV.     ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY

Rwanda's primary institutionsresponsible for management o f environmentalissues are:

0   The Directorate for Environment in the Ministry Lands, Environment, Forestry, Water and Natural
    Resources (MINTERE).
0   Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA).

The responsibility of the Directorate for Environment has changed following approval of the new
Environmental Policy and the establishment o f REMA. The Directorate for Environment is responsible
primarily for formulation o f policies relating to the environment, the budget for the sector, and for
monitoring policy implementation.        REMA is the technical arm o f MINITERE responsible for
implementing environmentalpolicy.

The sector ministries involved inpreparation o f the proposed PRSC I,     i.e., education, health, water, and
energy, have cross-cutting responsibility with MINITERE, as does the decentralized administration at the
Provincial and District levels. Under decentralization, the Provincial and District administrations have
primaryresponsibility for the provision ofpublic services. Therefore, as the decentralization process rolls
out, the District and Provincial governments will need to assume more responsibility for environmental
management of natural resources and investments within their jurisdictions. For this to be successfid,
decentralized local governments must enhance capacity and draw on technical support from the center,
via adequatepolicies, legislation, and qualified personnel. Thus, the linkagesbetweenthe center and local
governments must be strengthened. To this end, the capacity o f the central institutions (Directorate for
Environment, REMA) must be built, and the linkages between the local and national entities
strengthened.



                                                                                                          15

    Synergies and complementarity between the PRSC and the UNDP co-financed Decentralization and
    Environmental Management Project (DEMP) should be pursued to ensure effective coordination o f all
    environmental capacity buildingefforts inRwanda.

    The Directorate for Environment has been successful is getting its environmental policy approved by
    cabinet and has the supporting Iegislation before the national parliament. The efforts to build capacity
    gaps at the Directorate for Environment are therefore minimal at this time. However, REMA is a new
    institution facing restrictive budgetary constraints that have rendered it unable to recruit required
    personnel (the only staff in place i s the Director General). Support provided under the proposed PRSC
    will be usedto help staffREMA andbuildits capacity to carry out itsmandate.
