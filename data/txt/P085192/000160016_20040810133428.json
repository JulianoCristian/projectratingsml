environmental assessment and social\n            management analysis for the Rwanda Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project analyzes the cross-cutting environmental and\n            social issues facing Rwanda in each of the four\n            PRSC-targeted sectors, i.e., education, health, water, and\n            energy, and identifies ways in which the Government can\n            enhance its capacity to manage potential environmental and\n            social impacts. The report also proposes key measures that\n            the Government can take so that sector ministries, local\n            governments, and other institutions develop the capacity to\n            manage environmental and social issues during the\n            preparation and implementation of development programs and\n            projects, irrespective of the source of financing.\n            Rwanda's key environmental challenges concern soil\n            erosion, soil exhaustion, and overgrazing; deforestation;\n            impacts from water contamination including health and\n            sanitation impacts, and water weed infestation; loss of\n            biodiversity and habitats; and wetlands degradation. Adverse\n            environmental impacts in the education and health sectors\n            will be mitigated through developing an environmental\n            education curricula for students and teachers; including\n            sewage systems in sanitary facilities and providing water\n            from wells or water harvesting; building standpipes in\n            canteens and school kitchens; providing energy-saving\n            cooking stoves; preparing public health guidelines\n            concerning the water and food supply; preparing manuals for\n            public health awareness; disposing of medical and human\n            waste using locally constructed clay ovens; and training\n            public health inspectors and nurses. The Government will\n            address environmental impacts such as water\n            pollution/contamination by committing to the Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Strategy, which aims to provide a\n            sustainable, safe water supply and sanitation facilities\n            based on management, responsibility, and ownership by users.\n            In the Energy Sector, impact mitigation comprise preparing\n            environmental guidelines, conducting a Sectoral\n            Environmental and Social Assessment for the sector; building\n            the capacity of Electrogaz, the national parastatal, for\n            environmental management of natural resources; reviewing\n            wood fuel policy; launching a public awareness campaign for\n            energy efficient use of wood/charcoal awareness; and\n            introducing new technologies/design for energy saving\n            cooking stoves that use less firewood for more output."}, "docdt": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
