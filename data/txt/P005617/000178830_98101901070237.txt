APPRAISAL OF THE GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In mid-1972, the Government of Tunisia asked the Bank to assist
in the expansion of the phosphate rock mining and beneficiation facilities
of the majority State-owned Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer de
Gafsa (GAFSA), in southern Tunisia some 230 km west of the port of Sfax. The
Company's operations and investment plans were reviewed by Bank missions in
November 1972 and April 1973 and it was concluded that GAFSA would have to
carry out additional preparatory work; take several organizational, administra-
tive and financial steps; and define more clearly the plans for improving its
existing operations, before a Bank loan could be considered. Less than a year
thereafter, GAFSA with the support of the Government had advanced with this
work to a point which allowed an appraisal oT the project in February 1974.
ii.       This report appraises the proposed Sehib project as one part of the
Company's major expansion and modernization program to be undertaken during
1974-1978. The Sehib project, which is based on ore reserves sufficient for
more than 20 years production, involves developing a new underground mine em-
ploying the longwall method, with an annual output of 2 million tons of phos-
phate rock upgraded by washing to produce 1.6 million tons per year of market-
able product for export; the project includes all necessary auxiliary facilities
such as for water and power supply, workshops, offices and housing and some
minor roads. In addition STEG, the public power company, will provide the
needed electricity supply and SNCFT, the national railways, a 13 km spur line,
additional rolling stock and some upgrading of the main line to Sfax to handle
the increased production from both Sehib and GAFSA's modernization program.
iii.      The modernization program is to improve the efficiency and safety,
lower the costs and increase the profitability of GAFSA's phosphate production
from four of its existing mines which are all in the same general area as the
new Sehib mine arnd which have been suffering from lack of investment over the
past 20 years. The program is also to increase mine output by about 20% to
reach a level of close to 3.9 million tons per year of saleable product by
1977. While the Bank has been asked to participate only in the Sehib project
and the modernization program is not directly linked to it, the Bank from the
outset has considered all these investment plans in their entirety and as
absolutely essential for improving the Company's financial viability which--
until the recent sharp rise in phosphate prices--had been poor.
iv.       Production and sales of phosphate rock in the world have generally
been closely in line with one another during the 1960's but towards the end
of 1972 a serious shortage developed, resulting in a draw down and deplet-
ion of stocks and price hikes in late 1973 of between two and three times for



- ii -
Florida and North African rock respectively. Phosphate rock will be in short
supply over the next couple of years but supply is likely to balance demand
from 1977 onward, with future rock equilibrium prices expected to settle at
about 20 to 30% below the January 1974 price levels. GAFSA accounts for 95X
of Tunisian rock production of which, despite the planned expansion over the
next few years, a decreasing proportion will be available for exports. This
is on account of the expansion plans of the local producers of fertilizers
and phosphoric acid, which by 1978 will take more than 45% of GAFSA's output.
At least in the short and medium-term, there is every indication that Tunisian
phosphate sales will be restricted by production and not by insIfficient
market outlets.
v.        Total financing required for the Sehib project, including interest
during construction and working capital, is estimated at DT 28.8 million
(US$64.2 million), 70% of which is needed in foreign exchange.  The project
would be financed by the proposed Bank loan of US$23 million equivalent and
the Company's internally generated cash (US$41.2 million). GAFSA itself would
thus make a major contribution to the financing of the project. The Bank loan
would be made to GAFSA, cover approximately 52% of the project's foreign ex-
change cost and finance imported equipment and spares to be procured according
to Bank Guidelines. The loan would be for 15 years including 3 years of grace,
at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4% plus a guarantee fee of 1-3/4%, bringing
the total cost to GAFSA to 9%.
vi.       Project costs are based on price levels in February 1974 and contain
reasonable contingencies. Nevertheless, should a project cost overrun occur
and the Company be unable to meet it out of its own cash flow, the Government
has agreed to provide such funds as may be necessary to assutre speedy comple-
tion of the project. A similar overrun guarantee was agreed for completion
of the modernization program.  This program is expected to cost DT 23.0 mil-
lion (US$51.3 million) and be financed by a US$11.5 million equity increase
provided by the Government; a US$6.9 million loan from the Kuwait Fund (at
8% interest, for 12 years including 2 years grace) and the remainder (US$32.9
million) from GAFSA's internal cash generation. The scope of the program is
not as yet as precisely defined as that of the Sehib project and costs may
therefore be subject to change as further studies could dictate some altera-
tions in the program.
vii.      Overall responsibility for project implementation will rest with the
Company, with construction to be carried out under the supervision of HEURTEY
supported by SOFREMINES, two well-known French consultant firms, which have
also played a major role in project preparation and preliminary engineering.
Conversion from construction to the operational phase will be gradual, with
production building up as the mine is being developed. The major changeover
will come with completion of the washing plant, scheduled for mid 1977, at
which time control will pass from the project manager (Heurtey) to GAFSA's
operating staff. At testing and start-up of both mining and surface instal-
lations, Heurtey and equipment suppliers will assist the Company's staff.
A major training effort forms part of the project. These arrangements are
satisfactory.



- iii -
viii.     The management and performance of the Company have suffered in the
past from successive organizational changes and lack of motivation, initiative
and cost consciousness of workers and staff. GAFSA, which employs about 10,000
people, has been having a chronic shortage of mine face workers but an over-
supply of non-productive labor which inflates labor cost. The partial mechani-
sation of the mines, together with GAFSA's new manpower reduction and training
program (in toto a net reduction in employment for about 860 people over 5 years
is envisaged), is designed to improve working conditions and productivity, hence
competitiveness. This is the reflection of the Company's determined efforts
to improve its effectiveness and further steps are being taken to strengthen
the planning function and coordination within the Company.
ix.       The Sehib project has an estimated financial rate of return of 25%
assuming a future price for Tunisian phosphate rock of US$25/toa, fob Sfax in
1977 and is forecast to produce phosphate rock at operating costs 10-15% lower
than GAFSA's existing mines. The project's economic rate of return is 28%
with a drop below 16% being unlikely. Annual net foreign exchange benefits
from the project are expected to reach approximately US$55 million at full
production almost equal to the total foreign exchange portion of the capital
cost. Although close to 70% of the Company's investment during 1974-78 will
be financed by internal cash generation, GAFSA's long-term financial position
is strong and no liquidity problems are foreseen even for early years of
operation.
x.        However, the project also has definite risks, the major one being
the future development of phosphate prices. As noted previously, the current
high prices are not expected to continue. This report assumes a level in 1977
of 30% below January 1974 prices,; however, if a more severe drop of say 40%
were to occur, it would start to adversely affect the Company's financial
position. However, were such price drop in fact to take place in 1977 it
would be equivalent to a decline in real terms to a level about 15% below the
price levels of the late 1960's that clearly did not give the phosphate
industry worldwide enough of a return to expand capacity in line with market
demand. While such a price decline is therefore unlikely, it is nonetheless
true that, since Tunisian costs of producing phosphate are above those of its
two major North African competitors (Morocco and Spanish Sahara) primarily
on account of its lower rock quality and geological formation, it would be
Tunisia that would first feel the effects of any such price squeeze. This
makes execution of the Sehib project and the modernization program, therefore,
a matter of highest priority and urgency.
xi.       Based on the agreements reached, as summarized at the end of this
report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan equivalent to US$23 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In mid-1972, the Government of Tunisia asked the Bank to assist in
its efforts to rationalize the Tunisian phosphate sector and more specifically
in the modernization and expansioin of the mining facilities operated by the
Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer de Gafsa (GAFSA).  To this end a
mission visited Tunisia in November 1972, to conduct a preliminary review of
the sector and the Company. The findings and recommendations were forwarded
to the Government in a report in February 1973.
1.02      On the basis of these recommendations, a second mission visited
Tunisia in April 1973 to ascertain in precise terms the assistance required.
Particular attention was paid to the desirability of opening a new mine at
Sehib (taps IBRD 10003 and 10273) as a major step in the rationalization of
GAFSA's operations and in the development of the overall phosphate sector.
It was concluded that attainment of these goals should include all GAFSA
production facilities and required strengthening of GAFSA's management,
planning and control. A report covering the marketing, technical, financial,
organizational, management and planning aspects of the Company was prepared
and transmitted to the Government and GAFSA in May 1973.
1.03      Significant progress on implementation of these recommendations which
included reorganization, establishment of a planning function, and formulation
of a modernization program for the existing facilities, permitted appraisal in
early 1974. Between February 18 and March 3, 1974 a mission coisisting of
Messrs. Bosson (Chief), Diop and Miss Haug of the Industrial Projects Depart-
ment and Mr. Weber, a mining engineer of the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
who has had considerable earlier experience with GAFSA's operations, visited
Paris and Tunisia to appraise the project which consists of the Sehib mine
and beneficiating facilities. A glossary of technical terms is given in
Annex 1.
II. THE GAFSA COMPANY
A.  Ihistory
2.01      The GAFSA Company was formed in 1887 as a "Societe Anonyme" with
headquarters in Paris. In 1960 after Independence, the private shareholders
voted unanimously to offer the Tunisian Government a 50% equity participation.
The Government accepted and paid the required DT 2.5 million between 1961-64.
As a result of several subsequent adjustments, the Government since June 1974
holds 98% of the share capital. In 1962, the company headquarters were trans-
ferred from Paris to Tunis, and after a short move to Gafsa in 1968, are now
again established in Tunis. A more detailed description of the Company's
history is contained in Annex 2-1.



- 2-
B.   Organization and Management
2.02      After several years of organizational and personnel changes, the
Company's organizational structure has been consolidated under Mr. T. Amira,
a mining engineer and experienced administrator who became General Manager in
1960. Annex 2-2 further discusses the Company's legal position, organization
and management and gives an organization chart. Recruitment and retention of
qualified and experienced Tunisian personnel for the area continues to be
a problem which the Company has been trying to overcome by offering to all
employees higher salaries and better work conditions; it also employs
expatriates on fixed term contracts.
2.03      Spurred by its poor financial performance in the past, the Company
is making a determined effort to improve its managerial effectiveness: cost
accounting and inventory control have been introduced; the Modernization
Program has been formulated; and new mine developments (Sehib, Kef Eschfair)
are under way. The Production Department, the major unit within the organiza-
tion, has been reorganized under a new manager. As a result a better coordina-
tion among the operating units, increased staff motivation and productivity
consciousness have been achieved. Several functions such as training, safety,
budget control and planning have been expanded.
2.04      With the formulation of the Modernization Program and the activities
of the Development Department, GAFSA has initiated some planning, but the
Company is still far from attempting an integrated or even adequately coordi-
nated planning approach. The Company has agreed to (i) present to the Bank
for its review, annually updated 5-year investment programs for all its
operations, and (ii) review with the Bank not later than July 1, 1975 the
specific steps it intends to undertake to improve project and corporate fi-
nancial analysis within GAFSA, and thereafter implement such plan of action.
C.   Operations
2.05      The Company operates four long established mines, and has four other
deposits in various stages of development. The extracted phosphate rock with
grades between 58 and 65% BPL is processed in 4 washing plants and 3 air
classification plants, before being shipped by rail to Sfax some 230 km
distant for export and fertilizer manufacture and to Gabes (300 km) for
domestic phosphoric acid and fertilizer manufacture. Pertinent data for
these facilities are presented in the following table:

2.06      Ore Resources (Annex 2-3):  The Company has presently proven and
probable (recoverable) ore reserves of about 120 million tons and another
56 million tons of possible reserves which are more than sufficient for 20
years operation at the projected production rates as indicated by the
indi-idual mine lives in the above table. In addition, deposits yet to be
precisely outlined, are estimated to be adequate for at least a further 20
years. It is important to note that these reserves are low grade compared
to those of the major phosphate rock producers, such as Morocco, the USA and
USSR.
2.07      Mines (Annex 2-4):  Except for the small open-pit operation carried
out by a subcontractor, all existing mines are shallow underground extending
not more than 150 meters below the surface, using room and pillar methods
with manual loading. These methods are inefficient, productivity is low,
working conditions are poor, supervision is inadequate as are safety proce-
dures and costs are high. The sub-level stoping being employed at M'Rata
and the proposed longwall method at Sehib, the two new mines under develop-
ment, are both much more efficient and safe methods, with vastly improved
working conditions. The Kef Eschfair deposit now under study will be mined
by low-cost open-pit methods.
2.08      Processing Plants (Annex 2-5):  Hand sorting, washing and air
classification are the three simple enrichment techniques currently in use
at GAFSA. Washing effects a grade increase of about 5% BPL with a 65-75%
weight recovery, whereas the air classification results in only a 2% BPL
grade increase with a 60-65% weight recovery. The plants are in a fair to
poor state of repair and lack of control and measuring devices make it dif-
ficult to evaluate plant efficiency. The use of high sulphur fuels in the
dryers and the absence of dust control equipment provides very poor working
conditions. The intended improved maintenance and control form part of the
Modernization Program and will lead to better performance and working condi-
tions.
2.09      Infrastructure (Annex 2-6):  Transport between the mines and
processing plants is by the Company's own rail, conveyors and trucks. The
poor state of repair of these facilities forms a bottleneck in operations and
further investment is required. Transport to Sfax and Gabes is carried out
by the State railway company SNCFT, which has almost reached full capacity
with the existing equipment. GAFSA has one month's storage capacity avail-
able at the port, with facilities for loading up to 25,000 dwt ships. However,
shipments are generally made in smaller vessels as dictated by size of the
facilities at the receiving port. No additional investment is required in
port facilities. Water is supplied from wells located in the area and except
for Sehib and M'Dilla is more than adequate to meet expected future require-
ments; this is also true for the power supplied by the state power company
(STEG) although new transformer and transmission facilities will be required
to meet GAFSA's needs. Maintenance is conducted by underground crews and in
workshops located at each mine. Poor maintenance has in the past led to
significant loss of production; hence, improvement is necessary. Moves to
centralize the workshops and improve warehousing operations are already underway.

D.   Manpower
2.10      The Company's labor situation and policy as well as past and
future manpower requirements are discussed in Annex 2-7. The major labor
problems are (i) lack of underground face workers, and (ii) an oversupply of
nonproductive workers resulting in low productivities. To attract sufficient
miners and decrease the present level of absenteeism (20-40%), the GAFSA
Company has taken steps to revise the salary structure to include special
incentives, improve working and safety conditions underground, introduce
on-the-job training, and mechanize the existing mines. To reduce the over-
supply of nonproductive workers GAFSA has (i) restricted new employment to
meet short-term requirements and transfers from underground jobs; (ii)
regulated closely new hiring practices; and (iii) plans to introduce a system
of early retirement. A recent manpower study (Annex 2-7) indicates a net man-
power surplus of 860 men during the 1974-79 period; this projection takes
into account new employment created by Sehib and M'Rata as well as manpower
reductions due to mechanization, rationalization, natural attrition and the
closing of Moulares. To ensure an orderly transition, GAFSA agreed to submit
annually to the Bank for comment, (i) a plan of action setting forth measures
to be taken in respect of manpower reduction; (ii) a detailed training pro-
gram and (iii) an expansion program of the social and health facilities for
the labor force. In addition, the Government has undertaken to conduct a
regional development study to seek means for rational employment of new job
seekers (para 9.04).
E.   Past Performance and Financial Results
2.11      GAFSA's financial and operating history has been poor since 1967
(Annex 2-8) and during this period it was only in 1972 that mine production
surpassed the 1966 output. The Company's net income dropped from DT 1.7 mil-
lion in 1966 to a record loss of nearly DT 4 million in 1972. The following
table gives some principal indicators of operations and income of the Company
since 1970.

The basic reasons for GAFSA's substantial losses have been: the declining
prices for phosphate rock during the 1960's and early seventies (Annex 3-1);
the 1972 US dollar devaluations; subsidized prices to one domestic consumer,
which have now been removed; GAFSA's high productions costs and the virtual
absence of cost saving investments for nearly two decades; sharp increases
in railway tariffs; and a 30% production shortfall in 1969 due to floods in
southern Tunisia. As a result of the recent more than tripling of phosphate
rock prices and to a lesser extent increased production, but not due to
decreases of GAFSA's unit costs, the Company is expected to realize in 1974
a net income before taxes of DT 34.1 million.
F.   Recent Financial Position
2.12      Balance sheets for the past 5 years (1968-72) are given in Annex 2-9

2.13      GAFSA's past poor position is clearly reflected in a lack of work-
ing capital and the unfavorable debt/equity ratio. To cover part of the cash
losses, the Government as majority shareholder, increased GAFSA's equity by
DT 1.35 million in 1970 and DT 3.0 million in 1971. In order to place the
Company on a sound financial basis and to permit implementation of the Sehib



-7-
project and other urgently needed investments, the Government is undertaking
a finincial consolidation of GAFSA which includes a DT 5 million equity sub-
scription and the conversion of a loan of DT 6.5 million into equity. This
combined with the forecast after-tax profit for 1974 of DT 19.8 million, is
expected to put the Company in a strong capital position at the end of 1974
with a debt/equity ratio of 10/90 (Chapter VIII).
III.  THE MARKET FOR PHOSPHATE ROCK
3.01      The world supply and demand for phosphate rock, its price structure
and the specific market for Tunisian rock are discussed at length in Annex 3-1.
The structure of the Tunisian phosphate industry, its contribution to the
country's economy and future development prospects are given in Annex 3-2.
Attention is also drawn to the appraisal of the Maroc-Phosphore project 1/
which describes the interrelated market for phosphoric acid.  The following
gives only a brief summary of the major conclusions.
A.   International Supply and Demand
3.02      World reserves of phosphate rock are estimated at more than 120
billion tons of saleable concentrates - more than 100 years supply. Morocco
holds 38% of these reserves, Spanish Sahara 225, the USSR 13%, the USA 11%,
and Tunisia 4%. The USA, the USSR and Morocco alone accounted for about 80%
of the 1972 world production of 89.0 million tons; Tunisia accounted for 3.7%
or 3.3 million tons.
3.03      Over the period 1960-1972, world production of phosphate rock grew
o9, average at 77%/year reaching the 89.0 million tons just noted; world trade
grew at 6%/year reaching 44 million tons in 1972; and consumption at 7.3%/year
attaining 91.0 million tons in that year.
3.04      Production and sales of phosphate rock were generally closely in
line with one another during the 1960-70 period; however, small supply surpluses
in the late 1960's and early 1970's turned into a tight supply position by
late 1972 and a serious shortage by late 1972, resulting in a draw-down and
depletion of stocks, and a sharp rise in prices. The projected supply-demand
position is indicated in the following table:
World Supply and Demand of Phosphate Rock (million tons)
1970   1972   1973   1975   1977   1980
Production                81.1   89.0   97.0  115.1  129.5  166.0

Phosphate Project' dated April, 1974. (Report No. 351 MOR).



- 8 -
Additional capacity for 1974-76 is expected to keep in line with additional
demand taking into account restocking requirements and, in 1977 and beyond,
additional new capacities are expected to ease the tight supply situation
and to lead to a return to more rational market behavior, with a potential
excess of production over consumption, of 5-10%, - a situation similar to,
but not as severe as in, the late 1960's.
B.   Phosphate Price Structure and Evolution
3.05      During the 1966-72 period, surplus capacity in the world encouraged
the concession of substantial discounts of up to 20% of the listed price. In
1973, prices increased steadily until in November 1973 prices announced for
1974 jumped 2 times for Florida rock, and about 3 times in the cases of Morocco
and Tunisia. Following Morocco's lead, GAFSA increased the price of 65/68 BPL
phosphate rock from a 1973 average of US$10-11 to $36/ton fob Sfax, effective
January 1974, for all contracts, foreign as well as domestic. The price for
60/62 BPL ground rock for direct application increased to US$32/ton fob Sfax.
On July 1, 1974 the prices were further increased to an average of US$42/ton
fob Sfax and US$38/ton for 65/68 BPL rock and 60/62 BPL rock, respectively.
3.06      It is estimated that world phosphate rock supply and demand are
likely to balance from 1977 onwards, with future rock equilibrium prices
stabilizing at about 20% to 30% below the January 1974 price levels, increas-
ing thereafter at a rate close to the prevailing world inflation rate. On this
basis, the Tunisian 65/68 BPL grades which account for 90% of GAFSA's total
sales, are expected to stabilize at a price of about US$25/ton in current
terms in 1977 and to increase thereafter with general inflation. The estimated
future price for 60/62 BPL is US$20/ton fob Sfax. With the present uncertainty
of the phosphate supply situation it is difficult to predict future prices
with much measure of confidence; nevertheless present predictions of the
prices from a variety of sources are reasonably consistent.
C.   The Market for Tunisian Phosphate Rock
3.07      Besides another small phosphate rock producer, STEPHOS, which is
wholly Government-owned and which accounts for about 5% of Tunisian supply, the
GAFSA Company is the sole producer of rock in Tunisia. The following table
shows how Tunisian production of phosphate rock, its share of world production,
and its domestic sales and exports are expected to develop between now and
1980.

Exports as % of Production               64.0%        57-64%     44-56%
/1   Under GAFSA management.
The above table indicates that Tunisian production of phosphate rock will
keep its share of expected world demand for rock, but that domestic offtake
of rock for the production of fertilizer and phosphoric acid will increase
rapidly and will thus reduce the share of Tunisian rock available for export.
3.08      Considering the expansion plans of the local producers of fertilizers
and phosphoric acid who produce mainly for export, it is expected that in 1978
about 50% of GAFSA's saleable rock will be disposed of domestically and there-
f,re enjoys, for all practical purposes, a captive market.  As to the remainder
which will have to be exported, Tunisian rock is considered the world's best
phosphate for direct application because of its softness, high reactivity
and solubility.  In 1972, GAFSA supplied about 0.8 million tons of rock for
direct application - about one-fourth of its sales - out of a total world
market of 1.5 million tons for this type of rock.  The future of the ground
phosphate market is promising. Many of the other export markets are also
considered captive because of plants designed for the lower grade Tunisian
rock and long-standing arrangements. In the short to medium term, therefore,
there is every indication that Tunisian phosphate sales will be restricted
by production and not by insufficient market outlets.
D.   Marketing
3.09      The marketing function is directed through the Marketing Department
in Tunis. A marketing office has been maintained in Paris for its contacts
with the European and Asian buyers. The Company relies on agents for sales
to Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria and Greece. In January 1974 all long-term
and fixed-term contracts with domestic as well as international customers were
denounced by the Government and GAFSA. The new sales contracts were valid only



- 10 -
for six months but were renewed for a further six month period in June with
price increases of about US$8/ton. All domestic customers and those from
clearing and nonclearing countries are put on the same footing with only one
prire being quoted for all customers. International buyers must pay for
their purchases in hard currencies and assume the full foreign exchange risks.
Presently the major buyers of GAFSA phosphate are:

IV. THE SEHIB PROJECT
4.01      The investments that the GAFSA Company intends to carry out in
the next few years can be divided into two parts: (l) the Sehib project and
(ii) the Modernization Program. While the Bank has been asked to participate
only in the Sehib project and the two project portions are not physically
interrelated, the Bank has from the outset looked at them together and has
considered them of equal importance, since both are essential for improving
the Company's financial viability. This is of particular importance in the



- 11 -
longer run if international competition in phosphates were to bring down phos-
phate prices below the level presently expected. Should that occur, Tunisia
with its relatively low grade of rock (other than that for direct application)
is more vulnerable than for example the Moroccan production which benefits
from rock of higher quality. The Sehib project, its implementation and fi-
nancial analysis are discussed below.
A.   Technical Description
4.02      A detailed technical description and evaluation of the project is
presented in Annex 4-1. Essentially, the project includes the installation
of new mining and treatment facilities with all necessary infrastructure and
utilities, based on the extraction of the Sehib-Djellabia deposit, for an
annual mine production of 2.0 million tons BST, or 1.6 million tons of market-
able ore after washing.
i.  The Mine
4.03      The Sehib - Djellabia deposit contains 38 million tons of proven
mineable reserves which have been conservatively estimated and assure an
operating life of 20 years. The mining method selected is that of the "long-
wall"; it combines a high extraction rate with maximum safety and is used widely
in coal mines around the world and particularly in Western Europe. While a
more mechanized method than previously employed at the Company's mines, the
longwall will effect vast improvements in the underground working conditions
over those experienced in the other GAFSA mines using the traditional room
and pillar methods. Annual production of 2 million tons will be provided
from 4 longwall faces, each capable of producing at full capacity 450,000 to
50n,000 tons, plus 100,000 to 150,000 tons from annual mine development. It
is not expected that full mine output will be reached until 1980.
4.04      In selecting the longwall method, GAFSA has conducted extensive full
scale trials with the extraction of more than 450,000 tons from 2 panels in
Sehib between 1970 and 1974. These trials demonstrated the technical viability
of the longwall method but pointed out the roof problems prevalent in Sehib,
and the need to modify the equipment for use there. As the next step, a second
longwall system incorporating the modifications indicated in the first trial is
to be installed in late 1974 at the expense of the equipment manufacturers, for
a two month trial. The equipment manufacturers are sufficiently confident to
offer roof control and production performance guarantees, which if not met,
give GAFSA the option to return the equipment free of charge. While there is
some technical risk involved in using the longwall method, this has been mini-
mized by the extensive trials, and the equipment should have little difficulty
reaching and even exceeding the production target of 2 million tons per year.
The major limitation will be in the training of the operating crews, hence, the
expected slow build-up to full production.

2.   Processing Plant and Auxiliary Facilities
4.05      The proposed beneficiation method is based on the classical grinding,
sc_eening and washing process, used over the last 20 years for upgrading the
GAFSA phosphate. Here the particular processing method selected, such as:
washing, air classification, and calcination is very important. The Company,
therefore, made its choice only after extended semi-industrial tests with Sehib
ore and the selection can be supported on both technical and economic grounds.
The new beneficiation plant will incorporate the latest technical improvements
and controls so that its efficiency and performance are expected to be much
superior to the existing plants. An 80% weight recovery is planned and should
be possible given careful control and maintenance of the plant.
4.06      As shown in Annex 4-1, Chart 1, the beneficiation plant will be some
6 km away from the mine. This is the optimal location taking into account
the topography of the area and the already existing and newly to be provided
infrastructure investments. The surface installations, therefore, include
a conveyor system between the mine and the plant site and also provide
adequate storage facilities, open and covered, for run of mine ore and con-
centrates respectively; service and repair shops for the maintenance of
surface and underground equipment; and offices at the plant site.
3.   Infrastructure
4.07      The required infrastructure will include the provision of water,
road and power connections and housing, all financed by GAPSA as part of the
project as well as power supply and rail facilities which will be provided
by the state-owned companies (Societe Tunisienne Ae 1' Electricite et du Gaz
(STEG) and Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT)) respectively.
4.08      An adequate source of water is known to exist at Gouifla, located
32 km southwest of the plant, and its exploitation will require new pumping,
pipeline and electrical transmission installations. The water is considered
too saline for agricultural use and the Ministry of Agriculture has given
assurances that GAFSA will be granted a concession to exploit the water.
Before applying for the concession, however, GAFSA is exploring the technical
feasibility of two alternative sources with potentially lower costs. The
Government has undertaken to grant such a concession agreement to GAFSA by
July 1, 1975. An existing 9 km dirt road connecting Sehib with M'Dilla
will be upgraded into an all-weather road, and a new road (7 km) constructed
between the mine and the plant site. Practically the entire personnel for
Sehib can be accommodated in the neighboring township of M'Dilla with no
need for additional housing, except for 100 units which will be constructed
in M'Dilla for the supervisory staff. Rail transportation will be provided
for the workers by the Company. Sufficient power generation capacity is
available from STEG (para. 4.07) but additional transmission and transformer
facilities are needed for the project; these also will be GAFSA's responsi-
bility. Engineering and design work is almost complete.



- 13 -
4.09      A 13 km rail spur line from M'Dilla to the Sehib plant; up to 450
additional ore cars; minor upgrading of the Metlaoui-Sfax track; and some
additional locomotives will be necessary to service GAFSA's increased output.
The ore cars have been ordered and the necessary financing (US$4 million) will
be available from the African Development Bank (ADB). Design and specifica-
tions of the Sehib spurline and the rehabilitation of the existing track has
been completed and ADB is currently considering financing this railway sub-
project estimated to cost US$6.9 million. To ensure timely implementation
of thE railway component, SNCFT will carry them out in accordance with an
implementation schedule to be agreed with the Bank by December 31, 1974. The
Government has also agreed to provide funds required for the timely carrying
out of the railway component in case ADB should not make available the
residual financing required.
B.   Ecology
4.10      The Sehib project itself poses no major ecological problems.  The
deposit and the plant are located in a desert area some 250 km from the coast,
and some 30 km from the closest oasis. The land is not used for agricultural
purposes and the lack of adequate and suitable water make it unlikely that it
could be so developed in the future.
4.11      The longwall mining method results in caving, and subsidence of the
surface over the deposit by half to one meter; but no structure or infrastruc-
ture facilities overlie the deposit. Waste products from the washing plant
are in two forms: (a) coarse marl which is stockpiled adjacent to the plant
site; and (b) the sludge containing fine marl and phosphate which will be
dumped in the seasonal river basin. The nature of the marl, the arid climate
3-i lack of water make forestation of the tailing dumps impractical. The
slimes are dumped in a secluded area and pose no safety hazard. During the
dry season, the slimes are dried out but during tile rains part of the deposit
is washed downstream. This, however, creates no adverse effect. The only
other discharge from the plant is that from the dryer stack. Adequate dust
collection equipment will be installed to collect fines and other particulate
matter.
C.   Organization and Management
4.12      A more detailed description of the organization and management
during constnrction of the Sehib project (including an Organization Chart)
and its subsequent operation is contained in Annex 4-2.
C oonstruction Phase
4.13      Construction of the Selhib project will be carried out under the
supervision of Heurtey, a French consulting firm, which will provide the
project manager and supporting engineers. Overall responsibility for project
implementation will be through the Development Department of GAFSA to which



- 14 -
Heurtey will report. Heurtey conducted the feasibility study of the project
and prepared preliminary engineering. Under a new contract expected to be
signed in July 1974 Heurtey will complete the detailed engineering and
sup rvise procurement, in addition to on site supervision, of both underground
and surface installations. While Heurtey is fully qualified to supervise
construction and installation of the surface facilities, and handle the
bidding procedures, it will need assistance for supervision of both underground
development and equipment installation. In addition to the use of GAFSA's
own staff, SOFREMINES, an internationally well known French mining consulting
finm, will also provide assistance as it did for the feasibility study.
Assurances have been obtained that such assistance will be obtained promptly.
2.   Operational Phase
4.14      Conversion from construction to the operational phase will be gradual,
with mine production building up from that of the trial longwall to be installed
in early 1975 to the four longwall faces planned for late 1976/ early 1977.
The major changeover will come with the completion of the washing plant, sched-
uled for mid 1977. At that time the operational organization (Annex 4-2) will
become effective, and control will pass from the project manager (Heurtey) to
the GAFSA operating staff. At start-up and testing of both mining and surface
installations, the construction engineers and manufacturers' representatives
will assist GAFSA's operational staff; this will be specified in the equipment
purchase contracts.
3.   Personnel Requirements, Staffing and Training
4.15      As indicated in the organization chart (Annex 4-2), the project
will employ 660 people at full production, 428 for the underground operation,
93 in the washing plant and materials handling facilities, 131 for services
and maintenance, and 20 for administration.
4.16      An important aspect of the project is the need for underground and
maintenance personnel with skill levels considerably higher than those needed
for the Company's other operations. For mining, on-the-job training has been
implemented for the last 2 years and the 150 men now employed underground at
Sehib on production, development and maintenance have all been well exposed to
the new operating techniques under the supervision of foreign experts. These
men will be distributed to the new installations, to help provide on-the-job
training to the new, carefully selected miners from the other GAFSA mines.
This, combined with technical dry-run training on the surface under the direction
of Westfalia (the German face equipment manufacturer), should ensure an adequate-
ly prepared underground work force. Training of the surface personnel will be
carried out on-the-job under the dir2ction of the GAFSA training center with
the assistance of CERPHOS and Heurtey, and should not pose any problem because
of the similarity to the surface installations at the other GAFSA mines.



- 15 -
4.17      The more critical areas come with the staffing of the senior adminis-
trative posts and underground supe!rvisors.  Of the required 9 top engineering
positions only 2 people (supervis:ing the trial longwall) have so far been
assigned posts.  At least 2 more of these positions will have to be filled
with senior engineers with considerable experience.  They may be obtained
from the Company's other operations, or as foreign experts on contract.  The
remaining engineers can be more junior and the Company should have no problem
recruiting them. A very vital element will be the underground foremen. Here,
people with extensive longwall experience are needed. These are not avail-
able in Tunisia and will have to be recruited abroad. GAFSA has made tenta-
tive arrangements to second these people from the French State Mining Company
on a contract basis. GAFSA has agreed to prepare and implement a staffing
plan for its Sehib facilities in consultation with the Bank.
D.   Implementation and Production Schedules
4.18      Preliminary engineering and design has been completed and detailed
engineering started in Mid-1974. At the same time, Heurtey has begun the
preparation of the tender documents for international competitive bidding;
these were previously done in 1970 and merely require some relatively minor
modifications.  It is expected that advertising for the project will be
completed by September/October 1974, prequalification completed by December
1974, invitations to bid issued in January/February 1975 and bid evaluation
for the major equipment packages take place between March and July 1975.
Civil works for the surface plant are to be started in the second quarter
of 1975, and the plant is scheduled for commissioning in the third quarter
of 1977 (Annex 4-3).
..19      Underground development is underway and preparation of the first
panel is expected to be completed by late 1974. As mentioned in para 4.04
the first (trial) longwall will be installed in early 1975 with the other
three starting up at 2-3 month intervals between mid-1976 and early 1977.
With this schedule, the build-up of the project's phosphate rock production
is expected to be as follows:
Build-up of Output of the Sehib Mine
1974   1975   1976   1977   1978   1979   1980
Mine Output
('000 tons BTS)         340    760    950  1,540  1,790  1,960  2,020
This schedule reflects low productivity of the longwall faces in the early
years of operation, primarily due to lack of operator experience, building
up to full capacity only in 1980. This is a conservative but realistic target.

V. SEHIB PROJECT - CAPITAL COST, FINANCING
PLAN ANI PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost
5.01      Capital costs for the development of the Sehib mine during the
period 1974-1977 are detailed in Annex 5-1 and are summarized below.
Sehib - Summary of Capital Cost (1974-1977)

TOTAL FINANCING REQUIRED   8.94  19.84   28.78    19.93   44.31  64.24 100.0
5.02      The project scope and design were reviewed in September 1973 and
capital cost estimates obtained from suppliers' quotations received between
December 1973 and February 1974 for orders for late 1974, including the
prevailing administrative fee of 2.5% on the c.i.f. value (Tunisian border)
of imported equipment. These prices reflect the effect of the large increases
in energy cost and include a 40% price escalation over mid 1973 prices.  Civil
works are based on inquiries among potential Tunisian contractors obtained
in February 1974 and include a 20% price escalation over mid 1973 prices.



- 17 -
The transport and erection costs reflect Heurtey's recent experience in Tunisia,
while the estimate for pre-operating cost and engineering expenses is based
on the price quotation of February 1974 for the consulting contract with
Heurtey. Physical contingencies of 10% of the civil works, mine development,
equipment and infrastructure cost have been added. Further, the cost estimate
includes annual price increases cf 10% per annum for locally procured items
and civil works and 13% per annum for imported goods and services. Since
project preparation and engineeriig are well advanced the physical contingency
should be adequate to cover errors and changes in project design. Also GAFSA
has already placed orders for one longwall machine, the single most expensive
piece of equipment, and intends to place orders for most of the remaining
underground equipment and surfaco installations by late 1974/early 1975.
Consequently, the price escalations are expected to be adequate, and the
overall estimates considered realistic.
B.   Working Capital
5.03      Incremental working capital for Sehib during the 1974-1977 period
is estimated at DT 858,000 (US$1.9 million) in 1976 prices as detailed,
together with the assumptions made, in Annex 5-2.
C.   Financing Plan
5.04      Financing required for the project during 1974-1977 of DT 28.77
million (US$64.24 million) including incremental working capital and interest
during construction is expected to be covered as follows:
Sehib - Financing Plan
DT million   US$ million
GAFSA Internal Cash Generation          18.8        41.2        64%
IBRD loan                               10.0        23.0       36%
28.8       64.2       100%
GAFSA itself would thus make a major contribution to the financing of the
project, with the Bank loan to cover the remainder of the financing require-
ments, or about 52% of the project's estimated foreign exchange expenditures
of US$44.3 million. It is proposed that the Bank loan be for 15 years in-
cluding 3 years grace, at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4% plus a 1-3/4%
guarantee fee to be paid to the Government.
5.05      The financial projections for the GAPSA Company as a whole indicate
that the Company ought to have enough retained earnings to cover any reason-
able project cost overrun and also have a sound liquidity position at the end
of construction. Nevertheless, the Government has agreed to provide any
additional funds needed - whether local or foreign and irrespective of whether



- 18 -
the need for such funds is caused by a cost overrun or shortfall in internal
cash generation--to: (a) complete the Sehib project; and (b) meet the require-
ments of the Modernization Program (paras. 7.05, 8.04).
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      All equipment and machinery--independent of whether or not fi-
nanced by the Bank--will be procured through international competitive
tender following Bank guidelines. Domestic suppliers will be given a
preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is the lower,
in bid evaluation. An exception is the longwall face equipment and the
drifting equipment, which however will not be financed by the Bank. Because
of the special nature of the long#all equipment and the need to standardize
and adapt it to Sehib's specific mine conditions, it will be purchased from
Westfalia (Germany)--the manufacturer supplying identical equipment for the
trial phase. The drifting equipment will be supplied by Austria for purposes
of standardization. A detailed list of the items, all to be imported,
to be financed by the Bank loan is given in Annex 5-3 and summarized below:
Allocation of the Bank Loan
US$ million
Mine and Surface Conveyor System                         6.0
Washing Plant, Dryers, Stockpile and
Miscellaneous Surface Facilities                      14.5
Unallocated                                              2.5
23.0
All civil works will be carried out by Tunisian contractors selected after
local bidding.
5.07      The Bank will disburse against 100% c.i.f. value.  The disbursement
schedule for the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5-4 and summarized below. It is
based on estimates of order placements, payment schedules and expected
delivery times for equipment and spare parts in line with the construction
schedule.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE SEHIB PROJECT
A.   Revenue and Production Costs Projections
6.01      Detailed assumptions for the financial projections and operating
costs are contained in Annexes 6-1 and 6-2 and the assumed build-up of re-
venues is shown in Annex 6-3. The forecasts are based on a realistic period
between start-up of the mine and surface facilities in mid 1977 and full
production of 2 million tons (BTS) in 1980, taking into account possible
initial training and operational problems 1/. The Sehib output of 65/68 BPL
ore, one of the highest of GAFSA's operations, is likely to be exported at
an estimated average export price f.o.b. Sfax in 1976/77 of US$25/ton of
washed rock (in 1977 prices), equivalent to US$24.1/ton after the customary
3.5% rebates. This price has been escalated at 3% per annum for the rest
of the forecast period (up to 1985).
6.02      Operating costs have been estimated by Heurtey on the basis of
projected material, fuel, energy, consumable and spare parts consumption
as well as personnel requirements for each production unit of the Sehib
facilities. All costs have been taken at late 1973 rates and adjusted for
actual and possible further changes prior to start-up and general price
escalation varying between 3% and 12% per year as shown in Annex 6-1. These
costs are considered realistic.
6.03      Unit operating costs at full production, excluding depreciation, in-
terest and finished products' transport and handling are detailed in Annex 6-2
and summarized below at late 1973 and 1976 prices.
Sehib - Unit Operating Costs at Full Production

1/   Production and revenues of Sehib before the start-up of the washing
plant are included in the projections for the M'Dilla mine center
(Annexes 6-1, 6-2).



- 20 -
The operating costs (at 1973 prices) are low compared to those of the exist-
ing mines which average DT 2.9/ton of washed ore (Annex 2-6), but are still
5-10% above other comparable North African producers, primarily on account
of Lhe lower grade of ore, the higher weight recovery losses and less favor-
able geological conditions. About half of the above operating costs are
fixed.
6.04      Traisport and handling costs to Sfax of DT 1.0-1.2/ton have been
assumed for the 1974-75 period. Thereafter likely tariff increases have
been taken into account in the financial analysis as detailed in Annex 6-1.
B.   Financial Projections
6.05      Detailed income and cash flow forecasts over the first nine years of
operation are shown in Annexes 6-3 and 6-4 aid summarized below:
Sehib - Selected Operating and Income Indicators

/1   Washed ore.
6.06      The projections show profits from the beginning of operations.  The
Company benefits from an exemption of all major taxes until 1981, so that net
income after taxes decreases significantly thereafter. However, Sehib's net
cash generation after taxes will be sufficient to cover debt service, the
substantial investment for replacement and extending the workings to the
adjacent Djellabia deposit expected in 1981, and additionally will provide
GAFSA with an annual cash surplus of DT 4-8 million during the 1977-84 period.
A 1977 unit cost f.o.b. Sfax of DT 7.0/ton for the Sehib ore is projected;
it is expected to decrease to DT 6.3 when close to full production is reached
in 1979. This compares favorably with the average cost of DT 7.4 per ton
and DT 7.9 per ton, in 1977 and 1979, respectively, which is estimated for
GAFSA's existing mines after modernization (Annex 8-1).

C.   Financial Rate of Return
6.07      The project provides an incremental financial rate of return of 25%
at real prices. The assumptions for the calculation and the incremental cost/
benefit streams are given in Annex 6-5. An analysis has been carried out to
determine the sensitivity of the project's rate of return to various changes
in basic assumptions. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in
Annex 6-5 and summarized below.
Sehib - Sensitivity Tests on Financ:ial Rate of Return
Case   Description                                   Rate of Return/%
1      Base Case                                          25
2      6 Month Construction Delay                         23
3      Capital Cost Increase 20%                          22
4      Operating Cost Increase 20%                        24
5      Sales Revenue Decrease 10%                         22
6      Sales Revenue Decrease 40%                          7
7      Combination of 2, 3, 4 and 5                       12
Although the project continues to show high financial returns under possible
operating cost increases of 10-20%, a drop of sales revenues by 40%, i.e., a
drop of phosphate prices to US$20/ton in 1977 prices (or US$15/ton in 1974
prices) would make the development of the Sehib mine a marginal project.
However, in the light of the market analysis (paras. 2.05-8) such an event
is improbable. It would in fact mean that if such a price drop were to occur
in, say, 1977 it would be equivalent to a decline in real terms of about
1%Z vis-a-vis the price levels of the late 1960's that clearly did not give
the phosphate industry worldwide enough of a return to expand capacity in
line with market demand. Even under extreme adverse conditions of increased
construction and operating costs, construction delays and a small decline in
prices, the financial return still remains at an acceptable level. Therefore
the financial risk of the Sehib project is acceptable.
D.   Break-Even Point Analyses
6.08      The profit break-even point decreases slightly from an annual pro-
duction of 625,000 tons of washed ore in 1978, the second year after start-up,
to 600,000 tons (37% of full production) in 1980. The cash break-even point
is even lower, since the Sehib project will be 64% equity financed; it starts
with 366,000 tons in 1978 and declines further thereafter.
E.  lMajor Risks
6.09      The risks of the project fall under three categories:  market, pro-
duction, and infrastructure.



- 22 -
6.10      There is little risk in finding a market for Sehib's output; how-
ever, a major element of uncertainty lies in the future price of phosphate
rock. As noted previously the currently high prices are not expected to
continue and there is a general consensus within the industry that, as supply
more adequately balances demand again in 1977, prices will drop. The new
price level and subsequent developments are difficult to determine at this
time.  This report assumes a level in 1977 of 30% below early 1974 prices
and subsequent annual increases of 3%. It is possible, although not likely,
that a more severe drop of 40% or even 50% below early 1974 prices could
occur, which then would seriously affect the Company's financial position.
Under those conditions the Company would be able to service its debt satis-
factorily but might be forced to postpone modernization and replacement of
some operating assets.
6.11      Extensive testing has been conducted on the mining method.  Never-
theless it is in the nature of such underground mining operations that it
cannot be said with certainty that the capacity mine production of 2 million
tons/year can in fact be obtained on a sustained basis, although in terms of
the theoretical capacity of the equipment it should be possible to even exceed
this extraction rate by a significant margin. Roof control and labor training
problems could lead to loss of production and it is for these reasons that
only a slow production build-up has been assumed. Furthermore, although no
major technical problems are expected in the beneficiation plant, the assumed
recovery rate of 80% may not be achieved. Nevertheless, a 75% rate would be
the minimum attainable even under adverse conditions and this would still not
seriously affect earnings.
6.12      As to infrastructure, adequate steps have been taken for the pro-
vision of water. Power also is not expected to present a problem. On the
other hand, it has taken the Government and SNCFT a long time to prepare an
investment proposal and obtain financing for the needed railway infrastructure.
Failure to observe the required timetable for the start execution of the
works could create a bottleneck during the early years of operation of Sehib,
especially with the projected increased production from the modernization of
the existing mines.
VII. MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
A. Objectives
7.01      A detailed description of the modernization program and its objec-
tives is given in Annex 7-1.  The overall purpose of this program is to im-
prove the efficiency and safety, lower the costs and increase the profitability
of GAFSA's phosphate production which has suffered from lack of investment
for the past 20 years. The program was started in 1971, but on an ad-hoc
basis, and it was only in 1973 at the request of the Bank that a fully in-
tegrated investment plan was prepared and documented. The major components
of the program are:                           .



- 23 -
(a)  Mines:  improving working conditions, ventilation and safety;
mechanization of extraction and haulage operations; and expand-
ing capacity;
(b)  Treatment Plants:  process modification and equipment replacement
to increase efficiency and capacity of the washing and air clas-
sification plants;
(c)  Infrastructure:  replacing and upgrading the railway rolling
stock and track; upgrading workshops and materials handling
facilities; and
(d)  Social Facilities:  expansion and upgrading of housing.
The modernization program will also provide for production increases of about
20% to an output of close to 3.9 million tons of saleable product by 1977
from GAFSA's mines other than Sehib.
B.   Implementation
7.02      A more detailed description of how the program will be implemented
is contained in Annex 7-2. It was started in 1971 when SOFREMINES (France)
was entrusted with the responsibility of studying and improving the under-
ground working conditions. In 1973 SOGREAH (France) was engaged to review
and overhaul the washing plants. However, the first major step to coordinate
the modernization program came with the reorganization of the Production
Department in mid-1973 incorporating a planning function, instituting planning
responsibilities at the production unit level and setting up a new unit to
identify projects, coordinate planning, conduct studies and implement the
different projects of the modernization program. This was followed by the
preparation of a preliminary modernization plan and course of action. While
this unit has shown drive and enthusiasm in pursuing its new functions, its
staffing is still incomplete and additional qualified and experienced per-
sonnel are required if the program is to proceed on schedule. GAESA has
agreed to take the necessary steps to strengthen its staff for planning and
implementing the modernization program.
C.   Capital Cost and Financing Plan
7.03      Annex 7-3 gives detailed capital cost estimates for the moderniza-
tion program which are summarized below:

TOTAL FINANCING REQUIRED        8.0    15.0    23.0   17.7    33.6    51.3  100
7.04      The capital costs have been estimated by GAFSA's Production Depart-
ment in cooperation with SOFREMINES, SOGREAH and CERPHOS, French consulting
firms which have been providing continuing technical assistance to GAFSA, and
are based on 1973 quotations of potential suppliers and recent experience
with civil construction costs in southern Tunisia. Adequate price escalation
in line with that for the Sehib project and physical contingencies have been
applied to account for: (i) the early stage of preparation of some components
of the program, and (ii) the long implementation schedule which foresees
placing orders for some of the equipment only in 1976. The program costs will
be subject to change as further studies may dictate some alterations in its
content.
7.05      The estimated DT 23.0 million (US$51.3) financing required for ex-
ecution of the program (1974-78) is to be covered by: (i) a DT 5.0 million
equity increase provided by the Government; (ii) DT 3.0 million loan from the
Kuwait Fund; and (iii) DT 15.0 million from GAFSA's internal cash generation.
As has been pointed out earlier the modernization program is essential for
GAFSA to become a financially viable phosphate producer again, particularly
when rock prices decrease from theic presently high level. GAFSA has under-
taken to carry out the program. The Government has agreed to make any addi-
tional funds required available to GAFSA to complete the program.

D.   Benefits
7.06      The effects of the program, the resulting production build-up in
the different mines affected (Redeyef, Metlaoui, M'Dilla and M'Rata) and
operating costs are discussed in Annex 7-4. The major benefits of the pro-
gram are: (a) mine output will increase by about 20%; (b) beneficiation plant
recoveries will increase 2-4%; (c) with improved efficiency of mining and
processing, operating costs will drop by 10-30% in the mines, and 10-20% in
the plants; (d) interplant transport and communication bottlenecks will be
eliminated; (e) working conditions and safety practices will be improved;
and (f) skill levels will be upgraded and labor productivity raised throughout
the operations. Because of the preliminary stage of some of the program
aspects, exact quantification of the benefits is difficult. Nevertheless,
tentative estimates of the net effect of the program are included in the
income and cash flow projections of the Company as a whole as presented in
the following chapter.

/1   The projections do not take into account the costs and benefits of the
Kef Eschfair mine project which is scheduled to be implemented during
1977-1980.
8.02      For the first time since 1966 GAFSA is expected to realize in 1974
a positive net income estimated at DT 34.1 million. It will decline to
DT 17.5 million in 1977 due to the projected drop in phosphate prices and
increased current operating costs, in particular railroad tariffs. The cost
reducing effect of the modernization program is illustrated by the constant
unit cost fob Sfax of DT 7.4 per ton for the 1975-77 period despite infla-
tionary cost increases of 4-8% per annum. The importance of the contribution
of the existing mines to GAFSA's operations can be judged from the fact that
at full production of Sehib, these mines will still contribute about 71% of
sales although less than 60% of operating profit.
8.03      GAFSA's capital position remains satisfactory throughout the life
of the loan, because of the Government's new equity contribution in 1974 and
high annual earnings projections. At present, the net working capital level
with a current ratio of 0.7 is unsatisfactory, and GAFSA's accounts payable
are excessive, accounting for as much as its annual operating costs. This
situation should be rectified with the high cash generation of 1974. To
maintain GAFSA's sound financial structure, agreement was reached that the
Company would at all times maintain a debt-equity ratio not exceeding 55:45
and a current ratio of not less than 1.3:1. GAFSA also agreed not to distribute
dividends, other than a dividend provided for by its statutes, unless full
provision has first been made for the investment needs of both Sehib and the
modernization program in addition to meeting the current ratio test.



- 27 -
8.04      In addition, GAFSA agreed to consult the Bank before making invest-
ments in any year exceeding: (i) US$5 million (other than for Sehib, the
modernization program and normal renewals), until the Sehib project and the
modernization program have been completed; and (ii) US$15 million thereafter.
B.   Debt Service Coverage and Auditing,
8.05      Long-term debt service coverage is good and illustrates the Company's
relative independence from outside financing sources after completion of the
Sehib project and the modernizatikn program. Consistently during the life of
the loan net cash generation after corporate taxes is expected to cover at
least three times and up to 10 times GAFSA's interest and principal repayment
obligations.
8.06      GAFSA's annual financial statements have been audited by the Cabinet
Bouricha, a well-known Tunisian auditing firm. Auditing methods followed
correspond to Bank requirements. The Company will continue to be audited by
the Cabinet Bouricha or another independent auditing firm acceptable to the
Bank.
IX. ECONOIIC JUSTIFICATIONS
A.   Economic Rate of Return of the Project
9.01      The economic rate of return of the project is 28%.  Even with a
20% increase in capital and operating costs and a 6 month delay in project
& art-up the return declines only to 16%. In the unlikely event tiat prices
in 1977 drop 40% below those assumed (i.e., to US$15/ton f.o.b. Sfax in 1977
prices) or alternatively production level drops by 40%, the rate of return
will fall to 8-9%. The detailed return calculations and sensitivity tests
are given in Annex 9-1.
B.   Foreign Exchange Effect
9.02      The net export earnings from Sehib reach DT 17-19 million (US$39-
43 million) per year after the project attains full capacity in 1980. The
total foreign exchange component of the capital costs will therefore be
recovered within two years of project start-up, and thereafter the annual
net foreign exchange earnings will equal this component. In addition, the
modernization program will allow increased sales from the existing operations,
to the extent of DT 12-15 million (US$27-34 million) per year, almost equal
to the total foreign exchange cost of the program. While much of this increase
will not be exported as rock but will be processed locally into phosphoric
acid and fertilizer for export as higher value products, it is evident that
the modernization program too will have a major impact on export earnings
(Annex 9-2).



- 28 -
C.   Impact on Employment and Working Conditions
9.04      The working and safety conditions in the Sehib mine will be a vast
improvement over the conditions in the existing mines. This has been reflec-
ted during the trials by a major drop in the rate of absenteeism of face
workers from 20-35% in the other mines to about 2% in Sehib. Similarly the
modernization program is expected to have a major impact on underground
working conditions. The work environment, including transport facilities to
and from work, will improve, underground temperatures and humidity will be
lowered, work will be less arduous, and the atmosphere improved by reducing
dust and gaseous content. Both jrojects require the upgrading of skill levels
from laborers through to the underground and plant supervisors and an impor-
tant part of them is the improvement in safety conditions and awareness. The
Sehib project will create employment for 650 people but the modernization
program will necessitate reducing the existing labor force after natural
attrition by 860 people (Annex 2-7) over the 1974-79 period. On a short-term
basis, the Company plans to effect the reduction by early retirement, re-
training and temporary employment until opening of the Kef Eschfair mine.
With a view to the long-term, however, because of the lack of apparent employ-
ment opportunities within the region, the Government has undertaken to carrv
out a regional development study to seek means for rational employment of
new job seekers.
X. AGREEMENTS
10.01     The Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement will record the following

(j) GAFSA will strengthen its staff for planning and implementing
the Modernization Program (para. 7.02);
(k) the Government will provide any funds necessary to complete
the Modernization program (paras. 5.05 and 7.05);
(1)  GAFSA will maintain a current ratio of 1.3 and will not dis-
tribute dividends unless full provision is first made for the
investment needs of both Sehib and the Modernization Program
(para. 8.03);
(m)  GAFSA will not incur debt if this would raise the Company's
debt/equity ratio above 55:45 (para. 8.03);
(n) GAFSA will consult the Bank before making investments in any
year exceeding: (i) US$5 million (other than for Sehib, the
modernization program and normal renewals), until the Sehib
project and the modernization program have been completed; and
(ii) US$15 million thereafter (para. 8.04);
(o) GAFSA will have its accounts audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank (para. 8.06); and
(p) the Government will carry out a regional development study
of the Gafsa area (para. 9.04).
10.02     With these agreements and assurances the project forms a suitable
basis for a loan to GAFSA equivalent to US$23 million, for 15 years including
a 3 year grace period.
