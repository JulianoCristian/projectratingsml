TUNISIA- GAPSA PIIOSPHIATE PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS TSED IN THE TEXT
Apatite              -    The major nlhosDhorus minerals of most phosphate
rock including Tunisian rock are in the aoatite
group and can be represented by the formula
Ca5(P04)3 (F Cl OH). The (F Cl OH) radical mav be
all fluorine. chlorine, or hvdroxyl ion or any
combination thereof. The (P04) radical can be
partlv replaced by small quantities of V04, AsO4,
Sif4 and C03. Also small ouantities of calcium
can be replaced bv many elements, such as magnesium,
manganese., strontium, lead, sodium, uranium, cerium,
and vttrium.
Air Classification  -    Classification is the process of separating particles
of various sizes,densities and shanes.  This can be
done by screening or by gravity methods. Gravity
methods use the concept of different settling rates
of particles of different size, shape and density
in a fluid media (water, air or slurry) to segregate
them.  With the air classification of phosphate rock
the particles gravitate against a rising current of
air, the flow rate of which is so adjusted that the
desired heavv or coarse particles fall to a botton
discharge, while the lighter ones are upswept at a
higher speed than is compensated by their falling
rate and overflow.
Beneficiating        -    The dressing or processing of ores for the Purpose
of (1) regulating the size of the desired product:
(2) removing unwanted constituents: and (3) impro-
ving the quality, puritv of assav grade of the
desired product. The seDaration and accumulation
of economic minerals from waste material.  Benefi-
ciation of phosphate rock can be done by washing,
air classificationr, calcination, flotation, or
electrostatic separation.
BPL                  -    Bone nhosphate of lime.  Th{s is the enuivalent of
the tri calcium DhosDhate content (Ca3(PO4)2) in
the rock nhosphate. One BPL unit is equivalent to
0.458 units of phosphorus pentoxide (P20 ), and one
P905 unit is ecuivalent to 0.436 units of phosphorus
(P). Alternatively 1 unit of P is equivalent to
2.2912 units of P205 and 5.007 13PL units. BPL is
the terminology most used when referring to the
qualitv of rock phosphate- but P105 is most often
referred to when discussing the phosphate content
of fertilizers and acid.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
BTS                  -    Bruttes Triees Seches - gross sorted drv tons.
This is the unit used to refer to run of mine ore
after sorting out waste by coarse screening and/or
hand sorting. It is a calculated figure based upon
the weight of the wet run of mine ore adjusted for
an assumed moisture content of 12%.
Calcination          -    Heating ores, concentrates, precipitates, or residues
to decompose carbonates, hydrates, or other compounds.
When carbonates are heated sufficiently they decom-
pose, evolving C02 and leave behind the corresponding
oxides. The temperature of dissociation depends upon
the carbonate. Calcining of nhosphate rock results
in dissociation of the mineral aDatite, with the
CO2 being dissociated from the carbonate which is
combined to the calcium. In addition, the organic
material contained in the Dhosphate rock is burned
off.
Epure                -    This is ground nhosphate rock ungraded bv the addi-
tion of phosphoric acid. GAFSA produced a 71-72
BPI, Epure bv adding phosphoric acid to their low
grade 60-65% BPL rock.
Filterabilitv        -    In the context used in the report, this refers to
the ease and speed with which the phosphate rock
can after digestion with acid be filtered in a
Phosphoric acid plant. Because of the high organic
content the GAFSA rock has a slow filtration rate
which restricts acid nroduction or requires that a
larger filter area be installed.
Flocculation         -    The gathering of suspended particles into aggrega-
tions. The addition of a flocculant greatly
improves that rate of filtration (i.e., filterability)
of the GAFSA phosphate.
Gypsum               -    A natural hydrated calcium sulDhate CaSO42H20.  This
is produced from the anatite mineral contained in
the phosphate rock during the digestion phase of
phosohoric acid production, and seDarated from the
solution during filtration.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Hyperphosphate       -    Phosnhate rock ground to less than 150 micron and
sold for direct application as a fertilizer.
MAP                  -    Monoammonium phosphate - a nitrogen phosphate
fertilizer made from ammonia and pure phosphoric acid
with a formula of NH4H2PO4, and an analysis of 12% N,
61% P. DAP or Diammonium phosphate has an analysis
of 21% N, 53% P.
Oolite               -    A sDherical to ellipsodial body, 0.25 to 2 milli-
meters in diameter. In the Tunisian phosphate rock
this is made up of apatite with a small amount of
included organic material.
Superphosphate       -    Anv of various commercial phosphate fertilizers
obtained as white to gray granules or powders by
acidulating grotnd insoluable phosphate rock; as
(SSP)                     (1) Simple sunerphosphate - a product made by
acidulating with sulfuric acid, consisting essen-
tially of soluable primary calcium phosphate, calcium
sulphate, and small quantities of secondary calcium
phosphate and containing usually about 20% of avail-
(TSP)                     able phosphoric acid, (2) Triple supernhosphate -
a product made bv the addition of phosphoric acid,
to phosphate rock, consisting essentially of primary
calcium Phosphate and containing usually 40 to 50%
of available nhosnhoric acid.
Tailing              -    The part of any ore separated by processing and
treated as inferior in quality or value; the ganque,
sand, ,ravel, slimes, and other refuse material
resulting from the w7ashing, beneficiation or treat-
ment of ground ore. Those portions of treated ore
regarded too noor to he treated further.
R3ashing             -    In phosDhate technology this means removing slimes
from the relativelv coarse ore by washing, tumbling,
scrubbing. Prior to washing in a nhosphate washing
plant, the very coarse ore is separated bv screening,
hence, the final Droduct after washing is the middling.

TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
HISTORY OF THE CAPSA COMPANY
1.        Phosphate reserves were discovered in 1886 near Metlaoui by the
geologist Philippe Thomas. In 1896, the authorities granted a concession
for 60 years (a) to exploit the phosphate reserves in the south of Tunisia
located between the oasis of Gafsa and the border of Algeria, and (b) to
build a railway between the mines and Sfax. The mining concessions heve been
renewed for 99 years whereas the right to operate the railway was not renewed.
The GAFSA Company "Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Fer" was established
in 1887 as "societe anonyme" with headquarters in Paris. M. de Robert, one of
the co-founders, received 50% of the share capital for bringing in the concession
and a 30,000 hectare olive estate (Domaine de Chaal).
2.        In 1896, exploitation began in the Metlaoui mine, and Metlaoui
has remained since then GAFSA's center of mining operations.  The railway
Metlaoui-Sfax has operated since 1899 and was later extended to Moulares and
Redeyef. GAFSA's output increased rapidly through opening of new deposits,
i.e., Redeyef (1906/12) and Moulares (1919/23). The phosphate rock was dried,
handsorted and marketed. The beneficiation plants are later additions; air-
classification units in Redeyef (1950) and Moulares (1928), and 3 washing
plants in Metlaoui dating from 1952, 1954 and 1966/69.
3.        Beneficiation of the Tunisian phosphate rock (58-65% BPL, run of
mine ore) became essential when the Moroccan mines started exploitation in
1929 producing high grade ore (70-75% BPL). Until then, Tunisia had domi-
nated the world phosphate market and the GAFSA Company exported 2 million
tons of rock in 1926. The Company joined the marketing organization CPAN
(Comptoir Phosphatier d'Afrique du Nord) in 1930 which remained in effect
until 1960; this cartell restricted the Company's exports to 1.5 million
tons/year and regulated prices and sales conditions.
4.        In 1938, the Company bought back and anulled the share capital of
M. de Robert. Subsequently, the ownership of the Company was dispersed among
small private shareholders excepting a 6-7% participation of the Banque de
Paris et des Pays-Bas. In 1960 after Independence, the private shareholders
voted unanimously to offer the Tunisian Government a 50% equity participation.
The Government accepted and paid in 2.5 million DT between 1961-64. After
several equity capital adjustments, the Tunisian Government now holds 83% of
the share capital.
5.        In 1964 the olive estate Domaine de Chaal was nationalized; addi-
tionally, the Government did not renew the railway concession in 1966, but
merged the GAFSA-SFAX line with the state-owned railway company SNCFT. The
compensation question between the Government and the Company has finally
been settled: the phosphate mining company CIPHOS (Compagnie Nouvelle des
Phosphates du Djebel M'Dilla) was given to the GAFSA Company as part of the



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
settlement. CIPHOS had been managed by GAFSA since 1961. It owned one
operating mine, M'Dilla, located about 20 km south of Gafsa, which had been
exploited since 1924, one calcination unit (1928), a washing plant (1952),
and loading facilities in Sfax. In addition, CIPHOS had concessions for newly
discovered reserves in Sehib, Kef ed Dour and Sra. El Quartane.
6.        In 1962, the Company headquarters were transferred from Paris to
Tunis and again to Gafsa in 1968. However, the Company moved back to Tunis
after one year due to the difficulties encountered. To increase the produc-
tion, the Company has been developing new mines (M'Rata and Sehib) and sub-
contracted the exploitation of some outcrops near Kef Es Schfair.

ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
A.   LEGAL POSITION
1.        The GAFSA Company has been established as "societe anonyme" with
headquarters in Tunis - 83% of its-share capital (8.85 million dinars) is
presently owned by the Tunisian Government. The general assembly of share-
holders, each of them representing 20 shares or more, elect a Conseil
d'Administration (Board of Directors) consisting of at least 3 and at most
12 members. The representatives are elected for 6 years and can be re-
elected; they choose annually among themselves the President of the Company.
At present, the Conseil d'Aministration is conmosed of 6 Tunisian Government
appo'ntees (T. Amira, President and General Manager, H. Achave, A. Abassi,
A. Slama, S. Mbaika, A. Boukhris) and two French representatives of private
shareholders, J. Peccio-Galetto and H. Basset.
2.        The general assembly of shareholders nominates every 3 years an
outside accountant as "commissaire aux comptes" who investigates annually
the financial statements according to the requirements of Article 83 of the
Tunisian Code of Commerce.
3.        The Company statute regulates the distribution of profits as
follows: (i) 5% of profits have to be allocated to "legal reserves" as long
as those reserves are less than 10% of equity capital; (ii) the general
assembly can, upon suggestion by the Conseil d'Administration, allocate any
part of the profit as retained earnings or special reserves. 7% of the
remaining amount is distributed to the members of the Conseil d'Administration
betere lividends are paid.
B.   ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
1.   Recent Development
4.        The organizational structure of the GAFSA Company has changed
successively since 1966 because of the transition of managerial staff and
a shiort-lived transfer of the Company's headquarters to Gafsa in 1968.
4r. Jaussaud left GAFSA as General Manager in 1966 and he was succeeded by
k!essrs. Abassi, Bahri and Boukhris and, at the same time, five technical
-iainars followed:  Messrs. Pescio, Boukhris, El Bongi, Bele Aid and Akrout.
The present organization is shown in Chart 1.  GAFSA also manages
STEPVIOS (Societe Tunisienne d'Exploitations Phosphatiers) which operates
mines and beneficiation plants at Kalaa Djerda and loading facilities at
1,.3 Goulette. Mr. Tahar Amira, a graduate of the Paris mining school, has
1:--en President and General Manager since 1969. He is assisted by four
itirectors: Mr. Chebbi, head of the commercial department; Mr. Naccache, in
ehar-, of Administration and Finance; Mr. Ben Debba, in charge of the Develop-
me~nt Department; and Mr. Nabbi, head of the Production Department in Metlaoui.
Geographically and administratively, the GAFSA Company consists of two
d±stl>nct un_ts:



ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
(i)  The Production Department comprising all mining
beneficiation and support facilities in the Gafsa
region and Kalaa Djerda; and
(ii) The Direction Generale which includes the offices
in Tunis and Paris as well as loading facilities
at Sfax and La Goulette.
6.        During the past two years, there have been no major functional
changes in the Company's organizational structure. Recently, however, and
as elaborated below, the production, development and financial control
functions have been strengthened and an attempt has been made to improve
short- and medium-term coordination and planning within the Company. In
mid-1973, GAFSA commissioned SOTUETEC, a Tunisian management consulting
firm to undertake an organizational study. The First Phase, which reviews
the corporate organization structure, has been completed; SOTUETEC is
currently formulating an internal management reporting and planning system
which is scheduled to be implemented during a Third Phase at the end of 1974.
2.   Financial Control
7.        GAFSA's financial accounting had seriously been neglected during
and after the move of headquarters to GAFSA (1968). In 1971, the Company
initiated a determined effort to improve the situation by (i) introducing
the standard accounting classification, (ii) starting the internal revision
of all accounts for the 1966-70 period, and (iii) in 1972, contracting the
assistance of a local accounting firm. To date, about 95% of the accounts
have been cleared and the remaining inconsistences are expected to be
reconciled by end 1974. The greater emphasis on financial control is high-
lighted by the recent appointment of a deputy director in charge of accounting.
8.        A new cost accounting system has been set up under the direction
of an experienced accountant and has operated since January 1973. Initial
problems and adjustments in connection with the inventory control system
which was designed and implemented by SOTUETEC, a Ttnisian consulting firm,
have been overcome. As a next step to improving cost control, GAFSA is
computerizing its accounting system. Since operating costs are collected and
evaluated in Metlaoui, it is expected that the computer system will narrow
the existing conmunication gap between Tunis and Metlaoui.  In addition, the
concept of separate cost centers operating under budgetary restrictions is
being developed for the operating and service units of the Production Depart-
ment. After cost accounting and budgetary standards have been established,
it is however, essential that cost control is actually implemented. The
present high level of phosphate prices should not distract from the fact that
GAFSA is one of the highest cost producers of phosphate rock. Increasing cost
consciousness of staff and foremen, is, therefore mandatory.



TNMEX 2-2

3.   Production (DEM)
9.        With the appointment of Mr. Nabbi as Director, the Production
Department underwent a substantial personnel and organizational revivement.
Chart 1 illustrates the new functional set-up. The reorganization has
centralized greatly the various geographically dispersed activities of the
Production Department by:
a)   aDpointing one Deputy Director for Exploitation, wlho is
in charge of and coordinates production, planning, train-
ing and safety activities for all mine centers;
b)   concentrating the several consulting contracts with
SOFREMINES, the French consulting firm, and forming one
team which assists in the implementation of the Company's
training and mechanization plans;
c)   establishing a planning division as well as a training and
safety division under the Deputy Director for Exploitation;
d)   strengthening the role of the head of the mine center by
making him responsible for mining as well as treatment and
auxilliary services.
10.       The mission has the impression that the major objectives of the
reorganization, i.e., better coordination among the production units and
increased productivity consciousness of all operating units, is being
achieved. The moral among the staff appears to be excellent. The present
effort should be encouraged and continued.
4.   Planning, Programming and Budgeting
11.       One of the major shortcomings of the GAFSA Company has been erratic
planning which was partly due to (i) the non-existent medium and long-term
planning on the production unit level and (iii) frequent staff changes.
12.       Over the past 3 years Mr. Ben Debba has built up and continues
to strengthen the Development Department. He is in charge of the develop-
ment of new mines such as M'Rata, Sehib and Kef Eschfair, geological surveys,
computer activities and general studies connected with the Company's equip-
ment, construction, infrastructure and services needs. The Department is
located in Tunis. This geographical separation from the mines and other
production facilities has the advantages of facilitating (i) long-range
planning by being separated from the day-to-day problems of exploitation,
(ii) improving the contact with potential suppliers and consultants and
(iii) facilitating the recruiting of qualified staff who would be unwilling
to live in the south. On the other hand, the separation of the Development
Department in Tunis from the Production Department in Metlaoui has definite
shortcomings; (i) to familiarize themselves with the short and medium term
investment needs of the mining centers, to elaborate studies and to implement



ANNEX 2-2
Page 5
solutions staff from Tunis has to visit the mines for frequent and extended
periods; (ii) in regard to new mine development the assistance and close
cooperation with experienced production engineers--in contrast to planning
oriented engineers--becomes crucial during pilot production. An early inte-
gration of new mines in the organizational structure of the Production
Department is, therefore, important.
13.       The newly established Planning and Study Division at the Direction
d'Exploitation Minieres in Metlaoui fulfills an important function by coordi-
nating, and analyzing the short and medium term investment requirements.
This division is not to substitute the initiative and planning responsibility
of the mine manager, but to supplement their work by (i) studying alternatives
for given investments, (ii) advising and elaborating on solutions and assist
in investment implementation. At present, the division is understaffed. It
is recommended to strengthen the effectiveness of the Planning and Study unit
in Metlaoui by:
a)   assuring sufficient staff and supplies; and
b)   formalizing the coordination with the Development
Department in Tunis
On this basis, the division could function as study, implementation
and coordination unit for the modernization program which urgently needs
follow-up actions.
14.       At the request of the Bank, the Company has formulated a moderniza-
tion program (Annexes 7-1, 7-4). Although the modernization program presents
adequately the investment needs of the production centers, it does not take
into account the financial implications of such a program for the Company as
a whole. Clearly, the Company is making a determined effort to initiate some
planning, but GAFSA is still far from attempting an integrated or even a
coordinated planning approach. This shortcoming is partly due to inadequate
communication between the technical and financial departments as well as the
lack of financial analysis capabilities within the Company. Certainly, until
very recently GAFSA's financial department was preoccupied with (i) the
regularization of its accounts, (ii) the introduction of a cost accounting
system and (iii) with cash management during continuing losses. However,
after the basic system of financial control has been established, the Company
should give a higher priority to the analysis of the financial repercussions
of its programs. This becomes particularlv relevant now, since GAFSA can
expect to realize profits. The considerable projected annual cash surplus
(Annex 8-1) multiplies GAFSA's investment opportunities within and outside the
Company. It is, therefore, essential for the future that financial data are
prepared which analyze and facilitate investment and corporate strategy
decisions.

15.       The Bank fully supports the Company's effort to improve its plan-
ning function. To strengthen and expand planning programming and budgeting,
GAFSA agreed to present to the Bank for its review:
a)   annually updated 5-year investment programs; and
b)   no later than July 1, 1975 a plan of action to
improve project and corporate financing analysis
methods and thereafter implement such plan of action.
C.  MANAGEMENT
16.       The managerial and supervisory staff of the Company totalled 660
or 6.2% of personnel including 17 expatriates. The staff and employees
were divided as follows among the centers (1973):
Employees /1   Professional  Total

/1   Employees are all monthly paid personnel other than
professionals. However, they do not necessarily hold
supervisory positions.
17.       The Company has had continuing difficulties to recruit qualified
staff for its Productions Department in the Gafsa area. To attract managerial
staff to the south, GAFSA revised recently its salary scales and now offers
about 30% higher salaries and fringe benefits than comparable employers in
Tunis.  Nevertheless, the majority of Tunisian engineers at Metlaoui expect
to stay for not more than 2-3 years. At present, only 24 of 55 Tunisian
4taff members of the Production Department have been witIr the Company for
more than 3 years. Such fluctuation disrupts the continuity of working rela-
tions and impedes planning and project implementation.
18.       The Company is aware of the lack of experienced staff in the south,
in particular the lack of mining engineers. It, therefore, continues to hire
experienced and qualified expatriates on 3-year contracts and employs consult-
ing firms for specialized tasks (SOFRFI'fNES, SOCREAH).  Clearly, the personnel

problem is unlikely to be solved with the increased availability of qualified
Tunisian staff. The location of the mining activities will continue to be a
definite. disadvantage. The Company has to make a perennial effort to main-
tain the quality of its staff in the south.

mTNISIA:      GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
TRE GAFSA COMPANY: GEOLOGY AND ORE RESERVES
A.   Geology
1.        The phosphate beds worked by GAFSA outcrop from a synclinal basin
which covers an area some 80 km long from east to west by 35 km wide from
North to South; extending into Algeria (Map IBRD: 10273). It is divided
into two main synclinal folds; the Northern fold which carries the Moulares,
M'Rata Redeyef and Kef Eschfair deposits, with a potential area of some
300 km , and the Southern fold which carries the Metlaoui, M'Dilla, Sehib-
Djellabia deposits with a potential area of some 600 km2. The old estab-
lished mines are situated on secondary folds where the dip is minimal,
around 100. The phosphate beds continue to a depth of 900 m in the middle
of the syncline, and are overlain by a series of moicene sands, marls and
limestones which drilling has shown to be water-logged some 100-300 m below
the surface.
2.        The phosphate formation is from 15 m to 25 m thic1, with an average
of 20 m. It contains nine beds, interlain with marls and limestones. Four
of these are consistently too narrow for mining. The phosphate rock consists
of oolites of tricalcic phosphate of lime (BPL), calcite and quartz from 50
to 800 microns in size, embedded in a clay matrix. The grade of the beds vary,
either because the BPL content of the oolites changes or because the dilution
of the oolites in the matrix changes. The maximum content of the Tunisian
oolites in 68% BPL, lower than in Morocco, Florida or the Pacific. This is
the reason why Tunisian phosphate cannot be concentrated above 68% BPL by
classical washing methods. The run of mine ore averages 58-60% BPL in the
present mines. Uysually the grade decreases with depth.
B.   Ore Reserves
3.        The Gafsa phosphate field extends over 900 km2 of surface area,
and is estimated to contain some 11,000 million tons of phosphate rock.
Ilowever, the greater part of the formation is several hundred meters from
the surface below a permanent water table and thus is of no economic value
for the time being. Most mineable reserves occur along some 50 km of out-
crop length.  At 100 - 150 m below the surface, the formation enters a
waterlogged area which is presently taken as the limit of the economic
reserve tonnage.
4.        Exploration in the area is incomplete and the figures for reserves
as presented below have been established on a conservative basis and are
clearly a minimum. The figures are based on dry sorted ore (BTS). The
difference between ore "in situ" and "recoverable" is due to ore left in
pillars. Depending on the mining method, the recovery varies from 60%



ANNEX 2-3
Page 2
in conventional hand mining to over 80% with certain longwall techniques. The
cut-off grade for ore reserves is 57-58% BPL, and the deposits have been
limited in depth by the water level, established or inferred. The reserve
tonnages below were calculated in December 1972; the "marketable" value is
based on a conservatively estimated 70% benefication recovery.

Total Mine Life a) 5.5 million BTS/yr (4 million saleable product)-32 years
b) 7 million BTS/yr (5 million saleable product)-25 years
c) 9 million BTS/yr (6.2 million saleable product)-20 years
6.        As indicated above the total reserves presently delineated are
sufficient for about 20 years even vith major production increases, however,
continued full production can only be achieved if several new mines replace the
depleted deposits. Moulares with a life of 2-3 years is being replaced by M'Rata.
M'Dilla and Sehib have sufficient reserves to support production for more than
20 years. However, the above would indicate that Metlaoui and Redeyof have a
life of around 10 years which could be interpreted to mean that if GAFSA is to
maintain output it must open up a new project such as Kef-esh Schfair before 1983.
Further exploration can realistically be expected to extend the Rbdeyef reserves
down dip and to the East in the Chouabine deposit; a 15 year life can realis-
tically be expected but this will require substantial investment for developing
the Chouabine deposit. It is very possible that the life of the Metlaoui
mine could be extended up to 20 years by exploitation of seams V and VI under-
lying the worked out seams I and II. These seams are the same as those to be
worked in Sehib, and could increase reserves by 8 million tons. Little ex-
ploration work has been done to delineate these reserves or to ascertain the
economics of working them.
7.        In addition, it can be reasonably safely assumed that more than
250 million tons BTS recoverable phosphate deposits are available for future
exploitation. These include:

Only outcrop mapping has been conducted;
(c) Kef e Dour - This deposit, west of Redeyef, has been exten-
sively drilled by a team of experts from Bulgaria. A favorable
central zone contains 10 million tons' BTS recoverable; the less
favorable structures contain close to 30 million tons;
(d)  Secteur 100 - This deposit has been explored   by drilling,
trenching, pitting, and inclines, in 1967 with Polish assistance;
(e) Oum el Krecheb - Adjacent to Secteur 100, this has only been
extrapolated from the knowledge of the latter (Heurtey conducted
a prefeasibility study);
(f)  Alima Sud - Drilled by Bulgarians;  shown to be a steeply dippling
deposit.

MINES: DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE
1.        There are four old established mines:  Metlaoui, Moulares,
Redeyeff and M'Dilla. Four other properties are in various stages of
development; M'Rata, Sehib, the open-pit operation and Kef esh Schfair.
The major performance characteristics of these mines are presented below:

2.        Metlaoui is the oldest mine of Gafsa and has been in operation for
86 years. It also serves as the administrative and operational center for
the Gafsa field. It employs the traditional room and pillar extraction meth-
ods; with mining done by hand, using hand auger or electric drills, blasting,
picks and hand loading with shovels.  The method is slow, inefficient (as in-
dicated by above table) and dangerous, providing for an overall extraction
rate of only 60% of the deposit. The present work sites are near the water
table level where the phosphate rock's humidity increases and its grade dimi-
nishes. Metlaoui has a low overall productivity and the least valuable ore.

3.        At Moulares, the depletion of ore reserves is acute, and the mines
remaining life span is 2 - 3 years. Recently, maintenance work has been cut
down to a minimum   (the M'Rata mine, 10 km away, is being prepared as a
replacement). It employs both the traditional roan and pdllar methods as used
at Metlaoui but also a sublevel method in the steeper parts of the seam.
4.        Redeyeff is the company's main producing unit and has the highest
output and efficiency even though employing the traditional room and pillar
extraction method. The present production rate will deplete the proven re-
serves within 9 years, however, adequate additional reserves not yet proven
are available down dip, and to the West in the Chouabine deposit. The Rede-
yeff ore is particularly soluble and has a well established market for direct
application.
5.        The M'Dilla mine using the traditional room and pillar methods
displays a comparatively poor performance due to a chronic lack of productive
labor and water supply problems. Remedies for these problems are being sought.
6.        The new M'Rata mine began operations in 1973 employing sublevel
stoping for extracting the ore. The mine equipped by Romanian credits, is
expected to reach a production rate of 1 million tons per year in 1974
from the near vertical seam (as opposed to the gently dipping seams in most
of the other mines), and is expected to attain a productivity of 6 tons BTS
manshift for the entire underground personnel.  (Double that achieved in the
other mines.) In addition the method should be much safer.
7.        A small deposit near Kef-Esh-Schfair is being mined under contract
by open-pit methods, to supply the Metlaoui washing plants some 9 km distant.
All nine seams are being mined and the marl or clay interlayers are cleanly
stripped and dumped nearby. Several other small surface deposits have been
studied and will be extracted following depletion of the first deposit.
Sufficient reserves exist in these deposits for 3-4 years operations at the
present rate of 1 million-tons BTS/year. The operation has clearly indicated
that all the phosphate seams can be extracted cleanly and selectively by sim-
ple open-pit stripping methods.
8.        The underground development of the Sehib mine has been partially
completed and a trial longwall face has been operating - though intermittently -
for almost two years. Full scale developmnent is the subject of this loan. The
Kef Eschfair deposit has been the subject of several prefeasibility studies. The
orebody is low grade when the extraction of all nine seams by open pit methods
is considered.  This, nevertheless, would appear to be an attractive proposition
and uill most likely be the next development after Sehib.
Operating Cost
9.        Table 2 presents the mining costs per mine, indicating an average
unit cost varying between DT 1.4/ton for M'Rata and DT 2.1/ton for Metlaoui.
The unit cost for Sehib is not representative since (i) the trial longwall



ANNEX 2-4
Page 3
was operating less than 50% of the time, (ii) no treatment facilities are
available at the site, so that the ore has to be shipped to M'Dilla for
beneficiation, and (iii) auxiliary services have to be provided by other
mining centers, thus inflating the overhead cost. The cost structure of
the old established mines (see table below) clearly shows that face extraction
(drilling, blasting, supporting, loading and underground tramming) form the
major portion of the mining cost. It is these activities to which the major
attention is being directed in the modernization program.

TWNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHIATE PROJECT
PLANT:  DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE
1.        GAFSA phosphate is low grade compared with other major producing
centers. It also has the highest CaO/P205 ratio in the world market which
catuses hiigher consumption of sulphuric acid in fertilizer manufacture. On
the other hand, the Tunisian ore is among the most reactive phosphates on the
market:  it is highly soluble,and the rock finely ground, can be used for
direct application as a fertilizer without further treatment. As a result,
Tunisian phosphate was largely sold without beneficiation until 20 years ago,
when increasing competition from other producers and the decrease in BPL
grade made it necessary to install treatment plants.
2.        Hand sorting, washing and air classification (locally called ventila-
tion) constitute the 3 simple enrichment techniques presently in use. The
first is done near the mine after which the ore is transported to washing
plants at Metlaoui and M'Dilla or to ventilation plants at Moulares, Redeycf
and also M'Dilla. Physical beneficiation is closely tied to the granulometry
of the phosphate rock. In the Cafsa ore the phosphate grains or "oolites'
are found in the range 70 microns and 2-6 mm, depending upon the deposit.
In washing the oolites are separated from the marls and clays by agitated washing,
and then isolated by sizing with screens and cyclones. The same principle follow-
ed in air classification. The ore is crushed and screened to eliminate oversize
and then dropped through an updraft of air from which the oolites are recovered
as an underflow and the fine waste is carried away. The capacities and 1972
performance records of these plants is shown below.

3.        The present lack of controls made it difficult to evaluate the
ef£iciency of the various treatment plants and methods.  The plant input
cannot be neasured for lacl of weighing machines and is '"guestimated' on
the hasis of mine cars, not always full, an assumed moisture content and
e7oibht reduction by hand sorting.  As long as the input is uncertain, all
subsequent determinations are of doubtful value, excepting treatment costs
wren related to output. Recovery (by weight) figures vary considerably from
one 1lant to another; from 65% to 79% for the various washing units, and
frorm 61% to 68% for the ventilation plants.  These figures should be treated
vxith caution. The ore enrichment values are quantitative measurements and
can tlius be accepted: they indicate a 5% improvement in the BPL content
rvith !ashed ore and around 2,. for ventilated material.  A time study covering
all of 1972 indicates that the plants operated an average of 75%. of the time
available.  rhis compares with a widely accepted norm of 852 for plants of
this type.  M'uch of the down-time, however, about 2,000 hours per plant, was
Odue to lnalc of feed.
17.       The present GAFSA beneficiation methods are basically simple,
cheap and reasonably effective. Tmprovements in the washing plants would
nrobably lead to a better recovery rather than to a higher phosphate content.
The air-classification plants might lend themselves to more spectacular
im'provenents both in recovery and in upgrading.
iS.       Operating Costs:  These make up only 18% of the total production costs,
;.'ith mining costs making up 69% and overheads 13%.  The operating costs of the
l -ash4ng plants are 2 to 2-1/2 times those of the air-classification plants (see
tollowing Table 1), but as seen from the earlier table the results are much in-
ferior. The scope for reducing these costs is minor compared with scope for an
improvement in operating results of the mines.

TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
THE GAFSA COMPANY: INFRASTRUCTURE
A.   WTater Supply
1.        The phosphate mines need water for two purposes:  first, for the
local population at Metlaoui, M'Dilla, Redeyef and Moulares; secondly, for
the washing plants located at Melaoui and M'Dilla.
2.        At the present time Metlaoui washing plants use around 400 m3/h
and the MWDilla (without recycling) 180 m3/h. The township of Metlaoui uses
192 m3/h and M'Dilla 75 m3/h (l m'/h = a.2 & l/s).
3.        The water is currently supplied:
(a) for Moulares-Redeyef by various wells along Tabeditt oued and
Garaetsed Douza wiLh a total supply of 33 l/s and bv one well at
Tarfaia supplying 20 l/s. The water contains 3.2 g/l of solid
matter;
(b)  for Metlaoui from 4 wells located at Ras el Aioun, northwest of
Mtetlaoui. Since the beginning of the century the outflow has been
constant. The solid matter content varies from one well to
another from 1 to 7 g/l. Current supply is around 200 l/s;
(c) for IM'Dilla from a shaft located at the southeast of Cafsa,
near the Chott el Guettar, produces 70-90 l/s. However, the
reliability of this supply is uncertain, and the water table
has dropped significantly over the past 3 years. Further
drilling is being conducted to replace this source.
4.        GAFSA is responsible for locating and exploiting its won water
supplies but must receive approval from the Ministry of Agriculture. To
date, the companv has experienced no difficulties with water supply with the
exception of that for M'Dilla, but has now reached a position where several
of the wells need replacing (the life of a well is 7-10 years).
B.   Power Supply
5.        STEG (Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite et du Gaz) supplies the
electric power to the Cafsa company through the Metlaoui main transformer
with 150,000 volts. There are two main power lines supplying the Metlaoui
substation; one through Sfax and the other through Tadjerouine in the western
part of the countrv. Power is produced in thermal plants located at La
Goulette and Gabes. In addition, there is a connection with a 90,000 volt
line coming from Algeria at Tadjerouine.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 3
6.        STEG does not expect any power shortage in the future and is devel-
oping an adequate program of production to support the demand. All the small
power vlants of GAFSA are no longer operating and are considered as scrap.
7.        The GAPSA Company currently consumes about 7,200 KVA (maximum)
under a 10-vear contract with STEG which was renewed in 1972. An estimated
break6own of the consumption is presented in the following table.

3.        Average consumption per marketable ton was, therefore, 1.33 kwh
for 3.15 million tons with an average price of DT 9.86 mill based upon
tariffs of UT 5 mill/kwh during the night, UT 10 mill/kwh during the day
ind PT 15 mill/kwh for the peak demand periods.
9.        At the substation in Metlaoui the voltage is stepped down from
150,000 to 30,000 volts and distributed via 30 kv lines to 5 transformer
stations located at Metlaoui, Moulares, Redeyef, M'Dilla, M'Dilla II (Sehib).
At these transformers, the voltage is stepped down to 5,500 volts.
10.       eith the implementation of the rehabilitation program and mechani-
zation nf the mines, the power consumption is expected to increase markedly
as indicated in the following table.

ANNEX 2-6

C.   Transportation
11.       There are two kinds of transportation to consider:
(a)  Internal transportation of ore from mines to plants; and
(b) transportation of saleable products from the plants to
Sfax and Cabes.
12.       In the first case the company is responsible.  In the second case
qNCFT (Societe Nationale des Chemins de Per Tunisiens), the national railway,
is in charge of the transport.
1.   Internal Transport
13.       For internal transport the conpany uses:
(a)  42 ore cars, 142 PY 24-ton cars and 100 PX 28-ton cars with
capacities for phosphate rock of 18 tons and 24 tons,
respectively, plus 52 PH 12-ton and 20 Bottom Dump 17-ton
cars. The company also has tank cars and passenger cars.
The PY cars are in a good state at repair but the remainder
are more than 50 years old and tend to be in a poor state
of repair.
(b)  14 Whitcomb Diesel 40-ton locomotives (24 years old); three
32 ton diesel electric locomotives (2 years old); one 25-ton
diesel electric locomotives, 18 vears old, and 6 electric
trolleys. All are in a poor state of repair due to age and
lack of spares.
Both cars and locomotives are the property of the company.  Report-
edlv, the company has ordered 7n new PX 28-ton cars.  The rails which have
an average a-e of more than 50 years are in poor repair despite frequent
m'aintenance
1L.       >t'rmal maintenance is performed at lTftlaoui and general revision
r-o:-l -ilou1d 1e dore at Sfax in the SNCFT lorkshops.  Overhauling at Sfax
ot'r  10Co7otives is currently not performed satisfactorily because SNCFT
; isiZFicient personnel and narts. Seven locomotives should be overhauled
every vear, however, only 5 were overhauled in 1968, 6 in 1969, 3 in 1971
.nc 7 in 1972.  To help alleviate the situation which has become critical,
the .ompanv has ordered a sufficient quantity of narts but SNCFT still has
prohleris implementing the correct maintenance, mainly because the workshop
is not adequate, too small, dirty, etc. The railwav track itself is
maAntained by the company for the part located between mines and plants.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 5
15.       The internal transport does at present create a bottleneck in
CAFSA's operation, most importantly due to lack of locomotives rather than
shortage of cars. Most of plant downtime is due to lack of transport rather
than lack of mine production. The loading and unloading facilities are
inefficient and create delays.
16.       The internal transportation between Moulares and Metlaoui is carried
out by SNCFT at a charge of DT 0.3-0.4 per ton of ore.
2.   SNCFT Transport
17.       The SNCFT transportation starts from the plants, at Redeyef,
Metaloui, Moulares and M'Dilla with a dispatching to Sfax at the Metlaoui
station. At M'Dilla the trains go directly to Sfax after being dispatched
bv the Gafsa station.
1X.       Equipment available for the transportation between Sfax and Gafsa
consists of:
Ore Cars                            Nos.
3-axle, 18-ton cars           1,344
2-axle, 18-ton cars /1           49
2-axle, 24-ton cars             350
Total                    1,743
/1   They will be transformed into 24-ton ore cars.
However, only 1,300 of these wagons are in good working conditions, the
remaining 443 are in the workshops under repair.
There is nresently some difficulty in fully utilizing the new heavy
locomotives since they must stop at Metloui main station and other lighter
locomotives used to haul the trains to the mines and plants. However, this
situation will be improved when the present program being conducted by SNCFT
for upgrading the track and marshalling yards at Redeyef and Moulares is
completed.
3.   Problems and Constraints of the Metlaoui-Sfax Transport
19.       There is presently no problem with transporting the phosphate rock
from the GAFSA plants to the port facilities and the fertilizer plants at
Sfax and to the ICM plant at Gabes. 1/ However, if production increases above
the present level of 3.2-3.4 million tons, additional ore cars will have to
1/ 1,300 cars available for 350 days/year, with average turn-around time of
2-1/2 days, carrving on average 18 tons per trip = 1,300 x 3 to 5/2.5 x 18
3-4 million tons/year.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 6
be made available. To cope with the planned production for 1975 of 3.6 to
3.7 million tons of phosphate rock, an additional 50-100 ore cars xill be
required, in addition to renewing up to 100 of the existing ore cars each
year. Furthermore, for the system to be able to handle the planned 1975/76
production of 4.2 million tons per year, a total 200 additional new cars 1/
will be required (i.e., a total of 1,500 cars). Reportedlv, the track,
loading and unloading facilities are adequate to handle this extra tonnage,
and sufficient locomotives are available. The two crucial factors are the
availability of sufficient ore cars and the turn-around time.
2`n.      The 200 ore cars would cost in the order of TJSS2.4 million and require
1S-24 montlhs delivery time. Pence, it is very important that the arrangements
for financing and ordering these cars be made innediately. The alternative
of fabricating the cars in the SNCFT workshops was suggested and has apparently
been done in the past. This should be reviewed further.
21.       A turn-around time of 2-1/2 days was considered by the Bank Railway
Supervision Mission 2/ to be required. Hlowever, to maintain or improve the
figure, it w,ill be necessary that GAFSA, SNCFT and the fertilizer companies
fully cooperate and do not needlessly hold cars at the loading and unloading
facilities. Undue delay is evident both at the mine where cars wait an
average of 14 hours between arrival empty and dispatch to Sfax full, and
at the fertilizer plants, where cars are often used as storage facilities,
and after unloading kept at the plant for loading fertilizer for delivery
to the port. It is conceivable that the turn-around time and, hence, the
capacity of the railway could be improved by 10 to 15,%' (i.e., 3.8-3.9 million
tons) by improved control.
22.       Apart from ore cars, it was reported that insufficient flat cars
and tank cars are available for transporting supplies to the mines. Materials
(oil, wood, etc.) are being held up at the port of Sfax for extended periods,
and the companv has had to use truck transportation to solve the difficulty..
These nroblems are being given due attention.
4.   Stockpiling Facilities
23.       The level of stockpiles at the various supply and distribution
points are specified in relation to the transportation capacities. These
include both internal and external storage facilities.
24.       Internal:  There are no stockpiles apart from loading bins of
limited canacity at the Redeyef, Moulares and Metlaoui mines since internal
transport facilities are readily available. For M'Rata, Kef Eschfair,
1/   200 new cars available 350 days with turn-around of 2-1/2 days carrying
an average of 24 tons = 100 x 365/2.5 x 24 - 700,000 tons/year.
2/   See "Tunisia, First Railway Loan" Supervision Report, May 1973, Messrs.
MacDonald and Alston.



ANNEX 2-6
Page 7
M'Dilla and Sehib mines which are located at around 7 km from the plants,
there are 20-30,000 tons stockpile for each mine. At the entry of every
beneficiation plant, excepting the future plant of Sehib, the old drying
site, dating fron the time when the run of mine was only hand sorted and
dried, is used as stockpile. These storage capacities are large, often
exceeding 500,noo tons. Since this is mostly uncovered storage, these
capacities can obviously be significantly enlarged; the major restriction
being the loading capacity. At the exit of the plants, the saleable product
is stockpiled in bins (30-80,000 tons) and, if necessary, can also be stock-
piled as a sprayed material on a site near the plants.
25.       The following table summarizes the storage capacities:

Rail at M'Dilla
/1   Experimental Panel.
26.       External:  The storage capacitv at the port (discussed below) and
the fertilizer and acid plants also importantly affect the efficiency of the
transport network. Generally, these storage capacities are small but adequate
nroviding from 7 to 10 days operation (i.e., ICM has 10,000 tons or 7 days,
SIAPE has 13,000 tons or 10 days, NPK has 6,000 tons or 8 days).  Thile these
small storage capacities can cause some delays in unloading, the major cause
of delav is the unloading equipment. For instance, NPK has an unloading rate
of 150 tons/hour or 8-10 hours per train; but has no plans to increase this
with the planned increase in plant capacitv. SIAPE facilities can unload at
the rate of 100 tons/hour or 12 hours per train. The situation here is
aggravated by the track layout and small shunting locomotives which require
that each train be divided in 2 parts for unloading. The possibility of
improving this situation is being reviewed.
D.  Port Facilities
27.       The production from GAPSA Company is shipped from Sfax.  There are
three loading points at Sfax in the port area owned by the company. The first



ANNEX 2-6
Page 8
is used by SIAPE, the second used formerly only by CIPHOS (before 1960), and
the third used traditionally by the company. The loading capacity at Gafsa
and Ciphos piers are respectively 1,400 and 1,200 ton/hr.
28.       The total covered storage capacity of the company is 250,000 tons
or a little less than one month of production at the current rate of output.
At present the phosphate rock is stored according to the mine of origin and
the processing (i.e., 7 groups). In the future this will be changed to
storino only three qualities, a ventilated phosphate, a washed low grade
nhosphate (60-62%) and a middle grade phosphate (65-68%). This will increase
the stockpiling capacity and is expected to be sufficient for the increased
production from the rehabilitation and the Sehib project. Part of the area
owned by the companv is used by the Port Authority.  SIAPE rents 2n,nO  tons
of the company's storage capacity.
29.       Port facilities can receive 25,000 ton ships (the pier has a draft
of 33 ft), which is sufficient for the clients of GAFSA. Many ships trans-
porting phosphate are much smaller than this--the size of the ship being
dictated more by the depth of the receiving ports and the storage capacity
of the client.
F.   Vorkshons
30.       Under the present operational technology most of the equipment is
located at the plants, consisting of electrical motors, cyclones, screens,
thickeners, lo. washers, ovens. In the mines, there is presently very little
equipment: electrical drilling machines, diesel and electric locomotives, few
convevors and small ore cars (600 liters). However, in the new Sehib mine,
more sophisticated equipment is encountered like shearing machine, hydraulic
supports, continuous miners and with implementation of the rehabilitation
progran, equipment will become an important factor in the mines. Other major
equipment items are the diesel loconotives and ore cars used for surface
transport, plus haulage trucks, loaders and surface conveyors.
31.       NIaintenance for underground equipment is performed underground by
special crews, but for major overhauls the equipment is brought to the surface.
There is a workshop at each mine; the one located at Metlaoui is considered a
central workshop. In each workshop there are four sections (iron, wood,
electrical, garage), two diesel sections for the surface locomotives are
1-cateO in the 1"Pilla and zfetlaoui workshops.  Htowever, most important
maintenance work on the locomotives is done at the SNIOFT workshop in Sfax.
CAPSA has no foundry or casting facilities, but has adequate facilities for
sheet metal. working, fabricating underground mine cars. Electric motors are
repaired in Sfax. The shops are very old and not well equipped for the new
mechanizedI mining methods.

32.       rTimployment in these shops is as follows:
Employment         Employment

Total                   720                 116
In addition, crews for maintenance of housing, plants and offices
total 1q7 persons (Mfetlaoui 10; Redeyef 20n  Moulares 41; WT?illa 27).
33.       Less than 25T of these workers are skilled and turn out quality
work.  lhence, an important program for training this group is underway.
Poor maintenance has in the past led to significant loss of production.
Ilence, improvement is very necessary. A recent revision of the warehousing
operation has had readily apparent effects, However, there still remain
r'ross inefficiencies in the maintenance functions, and attention should be
given to the possibility of centralizing repair facilities, probably in
*letlaoui; leavinc only sufficient facilities at the mines and plants for
small emerqencv repairs. This should allow better utilization of existing
repair shop equipment, and skilled labor force, which will become much more
important as the mines are increasingly mechanized.

1.        Over more than one decade the Company's manpower policy was charac-
terized by maintaining or increasing the labor force in order to create
employment opportunities in the south, (ii) a neglect of training for all job
categories, (iii) a neglect of preventive safety regulations and work condi-
tions and (iv) a lack of labor-saving or productivity-increasing production
techniques. The tiresome and dangerous work of face workers, which in the
past was not coupled with sufficient pecuniary incentives, lead to high turn-
over, absenteeism and finally a lack of face miners. For the surface and
other underground workers, however, the above policy resulted in an over-
supplv of unproductive workers.
B.   LABOR SITUATION
Recent Development
2.        The GAFSA Company employs about 10,200 people of which 95% or 9,738
work at the production facilities in the south. Table 1 of this Annex gives
a detailed labor breakdown by operational unit for the 1969-73 period. Al-
thiough production has been fluctuating around 4 million BTS/year, the number
of people employed by the mining centers has risen substantially in 1968/69
when the labor force increased by 10% reaching 10,015 in 1969. Subsequently,
the number of people employed at the production facilities declined again to
9,738 in 1973. However, increases in wages and fringe benefits have been
relatively high, so that labor costs account now for about 40% of the
company's operating costs as compared to 36% in 1968.
3.        The development of personnel in the mines during the 1963-1972
oeriod is characterized as follows:
a)   Metlaoui:  The number of underground workers increased by 57%, i.e.,
fro- 513 to 963 men, whereas the workers at the mine surface facilities nearly
cnubled.  At the same time, about 27% more workers were employed at the plants
and central services, whereas the number of "employees" 1/ increased four times.
Overall, the labor force at Metaloui increased by 68% compared to a 0.5%
increase of BTS output during the 1968-73 period.
b)   Redeyef : The labor force increased by 28% compared to a 43%
lncrease of mine extraction.  New personnel were primarily added to the under-
ground work force and the employees at the mine.
1/   Monthly paid personnel not including staff.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 3
c)   Moulares:  Production and labor force have developed parallel to
each other and have a 20% and 19% increase respectively. The personnel at the
mine has been decreased from 2,253 in 1970 to 1,741 in October 1973, since
the production will be phased out by 1976/77.
d)   M'Dilla:  The number of underground workers increased from 1,253 in
1963 to 2,137 in 1966 and subsequently declined again to 1,601 in 1972. How-
ever, the number of "employees" more than doubled in 1968 and has remained
since then at about 250 men. Nevertheless, overall M'Dilla's 1972 output
lies 78% above 1963 extraction, whereas the manpower increased by 26% only.
4.        High absenteeism, i.e., unexcused non-appearance at work has tradi-
tionally been a problem at the GAFSA Company. This phenomenon contributes to
relatively low productivity and additional cost burdens. On the average
about 18-20% of underground workers do not appear at work compared to 3% of
the workers holding surface jobs. Such periods of absence can be considerable;
e.g., in 1972, 49% of absent mine workers stayed away for 4 days or more per
month. The major reasons for this work pattern and the particularly high rates
at Metaloui and M'Dilla (see Table 2) are (i) the hard and tiresome work at the
face, (ii) dangerous work conditions underground, (iii) insufficient motivation
and pecuniary incentives for face workers and (iv) supplementary employment in
agriculture, if weather permits. In M'Dilla about 30% of the work force comes
from Gafsa and El Guettar by company trucks and workers tend to stay home on
Mondays, Saturdays or rainy days. In Metaloui about 20% of the mine workers
have been recruited from the north and return to their families for extended
visits during the agricultural season and weekends.
5.        Although manpower problems vary among the different mine centers
according to the particular working conditions, accident record and compensa-
tion of the labor force, Gafsa's manpower situation is characterized by (a)
a lack of permanent face workers and (b) a large number of unproductive
workers and employees. This situation which developed progressively over the
past two decades has stabilized since 1970 as the result of the Company's
ad hoc measures against further labor force increases.
2.   Labor Policy and ad hoc Measures
6.        The Company is well aware of the existing labor problem and has
initiated a number of steps which are designed to increase productivity,
improve work conditions and normalize its labor cost structure.
7.        In particular, to attract face workers, the company introduced:
a)   an incentive-based salary system which gives 35% higher
salaries to face workers than other workers.
b)   an assiduity premium for face workers who are absent
for less than 3 days per month.



ANNEX 2-7
Page 4
c)   special productivity premiums and production campaigns.
d)   on-the-job training and opportunity to participate in the
Gafsa center training program.
e)   a better safety and accident prevention system which should
decrease the Company's high accident record.
However, the long term labor policy of the Cafsa Company is to mechanize the
existing mines, thereby, decreasing the demand for face workers, increasing
total production and decreasing labor as well as total operating costs. As
outlined in the modernization program (Annex 7-1. 7-4) Gafsa plans to intro-
duce the scraper method in its existing mine. This technique is a step
towards mechanization from the present "room and pillar" method however, it
is relatively labor intensive compared to other forms of mechnization
(continuous miners, longwall, etc.) and does not require a highly skilled
labor force.
3.   Training
8.        In 1971, GAFSA initiated a training program to upgrade the skill-
level of its workers and facilitate the mechanization of its mine operation.
The program included:
(a) upgrading of underground supervisory personnel (about 320
people) in three 5-week courses;
(b) training of scraper teams under the supervision of SOFREMINES;
(c)  formulation of a 4-year training program by SOFREMINES;
(d) establishing of safety instructions on the job and in the
Gafsa Training Center;
(e) expansion of the Gafsa Training Center.
9.        The new emphasis on training and safety measures has been illustrated
by the creation of a training and safety division. At present, GAFSA relies on
4 training teams: (i) a team of 13 instructors for the Gafsa Training Center;
(ii) 3 training advisors from SOFREMINES who assist in the preparation of train-
ing programs and supervise directly the training of new scraper teams; (iii)
2 underground foremen in each mine center who are in charge of on-the-job
training; and (iv) 8 general training officers who select and prepare workers
for specialized training at the Cafsa Training Center. The Gafsa Training
Center, which is funded by GAFSA, provides three 18-month courses and follow-up
training for foremen, technicians such as mechanics, electricians, diesel mecha-
nics and electro-mechanics as well as safety instructions. The center is expected
to train about 120 men per year, of whom 62 would be foremen and 58 technicians.
Besides the instructions at the Gafsa Training Center, on-the-job training is
an important part of GAFSA's training effort. The company expects to reach
by these measures about 850 employees per year; this includes in particular



ANNEX 2-7
Page 5
525 underground workers who require basic instructions and/or an increase
of skill-level.
10.       GAFSA's training program is still in the formulation and trial stage.
Nevertheless, it is essential that this training program is not considered as
a short-term effort necessary solely for underground mechanization. In con-
trast, if GAFSA wants to maintain a stable, motivated and productive labor
force, a continuing training program, which includes upgrading of all skill-
levels and follow-up training, will be prerogative.
4.   Future t,anpower Requirements
1 1.     At the request of the Bank GAFSA has studied its future manpower
requirements and current surplus labor in order to quantify tne goals of a
necessary manpower development aad reduction program.  The study includes the
1974-1979 period and takes into account (i) the present surplus of unproductive
labor, (ii) projected manpower reductions due to mechanization of M'Dilla,
Redeyef and Mletlaoui, as well as the phased closing of the Moulares mine,
(iii) natural attrition by retirement at 55, and (iv) the additional manpower
required fo ' full production at Sehib and M'Rata. However, the projected
manpower supplies detailed below does not yet account for auditional labor
needs for Kef Esclhfair, which may start production during the 1977-1979 period.

12.      GAFSA expects a net labor surplus of 860 men over the 1974-79 period
which reaches its peak in 1975 and 1976 with excess employment of 242 men and
603 men, respectively. Alternative employment opportunities for GAFSA's
surplus labor is a major problem, since GAFSA is the dominant employer in the
south and nearly all concerned workers are unskilled and will not find ready
employment abroad or in other parts of Tunisia where un- and underemployment
rates range generally between 25%-40%.
13.      At the request of the Bank, and in cooperation with the Government,
che company is formulating an action program for orderly manpower reduction
which would provide for alternative jobs, compensation, retraining and early
retirement.  In particular, GAFSA is currently exploring the feasibility
of an early retirement sclieme and creaLing employment through construction
and mnai.ntenanice crewis.

A.   World Supply and Demand
1.  W,i'orld Reserves of Phosphate Rock
1.        Thel world reserves of phosphate rock are generally believed to be
uniderestimated. In 1971 the world resources of phosphate rock were esti-
mated at 292 billion metric tons for 45 BPL 1/ grades and above; excluding
rocks grading 45 BPL and less which may be assumed to he uneconomically ex-
ploitable.  Total reserves grading 52 BPL and above are estimated to amount
to 172 billion tons in 1971 (Table 1).  A recent study 2/ commissioned by
tl'e Bank- puts fonTard 120 billion tons in terms of saleable concentrates. (i.e.
7, of 172 billion tons, corresponding to recovery ratio.)  Or    Ucli>d all
rock with ^ grade above 45 BPL and assuming a weighted average grade of 53
EPL the 292.2 billion tons of phosphate rock wvould be equivalent to 154.8
billion tons of BPL; or 71 billion tons of P205 equivalent distrihuted as
hoIn h,elow.  Because of the confidentiality of data pertaining to ore reserves
and grade, the above figures can only be considered order of magnitude esti-
mates.

Preliminary estimates for the 1973 world production amount to 97 million tons,
ain increase of 9"' over 1972. Whereas Iforocco is essentially an exporter of
rock, the US and USSR have large domestic markets and Tunisia is in the
process of transforming larger quantities of phosphate rock locally (37% of
production or 1.1 million tons in 1973 as compared to about 20% or 0.5 million
.:ons in 1965).
Production of phosphate rock grew on average at 7.0;' per annum
,ic.2H 1960 rind 1972 rising from 39.8 million tons in 1960 to 89.0 million
ronq in 1972.  Growth was particularly rapid in the USSR (10.9% per annum).

Installed capacity 1/ rose from 45.6 million tons in 1960 to 98.4 million tons
in 1972. Capacity is often difficult to estimate and figures are usually
confidential. The production constraint is not always at the mine level but
frequently at the inland transportation and harbor facilities levels. World
capacity utilization has fluctuated since 1960 (Table 2) reflecting the
variations in the world supply/demand situation. (See para 11).
5.        The expected major additions to existing capacities between 1972
and 1977 will be in Morocco, Spanish Sahara, the U.S. and USSP.  Morocco is
oxpected to increase its capacity to 25 million tons of rock. The Spanish
Sahara -- a new supplier of high grade 75 BPL -- started production in 1973
and is likely to have an installed capacity of 6 million tons by 1977; the
U.S. and the USSR's objectives are to reach 50 and 30 million ton capacities,
respectively, by 1977, but the lack of information makes it difficult to
ascertain% whether this objective can be attained.  In particular, for example,
the likelv future IJ.S. rock production is difficult to assess because: (i)
the cnverage grade produced is decreasing which might affect export potentials;
(ii) environmental protection and land reshaping obligations might increase
the production cost of rock and reduce production in marginal mines.
3.   11orld Trade
6.       1World trade increased from 29.2 million tons plhosphate rock in
1965 to 43.4 million tons in 1972. The major exporters of phosphate rock
are Morocco: ITSA, TJSSR and Tunisia.  Those four countries account for about
80% of world exports.  About 65% of the world imports of phosphate rock goes
to W1est, South and Eastern Europe.  Canada, Japan and Brazil also import sub-
stantial quantities of rock.  The trade matrixes for 1965, 1972 (Table 3)
show that world trade is expanding rapidly (an average growth rate of 6Z per
annum). In the 1965-72 period, the share of the IJ.S. in world trade increased
from 24% to 30% whereas the share of Morocco and USSR remained stagnant (30%.
and 15" respectively). Tunisia's share amounted to 5% of the world phosphate
trade in 1972 and is declining as its sales have been stationary in the
period considered.  However, it should be pointed out that Tunisia's sales
potential has been constrained more by its production possibilities than by
market outlets; nonetheless Tunisian phosphate producers remain secondary
exporters on the world market.
1/   In--dalled caT)arity in the oontext of this report is a comprehensive con-
cept whicl includes, (a) mine production capacity, (b) rock transportation
systenr capacity from mine to beneficiating facilities, (c) processing

7.        In the late sixties the emergence of the IJ.S. as a major exporter
of rock had caused some changes in trade patterns. North African exports
had been increasingly directed to Eastern and South Europe and to some devel-
oring countries where markets were expanding faster.  Western Europe obtained
"s' of its phosphate roclk requirements fror 'Uorth Africa in 1965 and only 447'
in 1972.  -owever, since 1973 the export policy of US producers has been
alterec1 gradually.  The major reasons are, on thne one hand, an effort of IN
pnroducers to maintain prices vis-a-vis rising costs for environmental pro-
tection in Florida and increasing freight rates 1/; on the other hand, a more
conservative export policy of the US Government in view of (i) improving the
balance of payment, (ii) an increasing awareness to minimize a country's
dependence on foreign raw material sources, and (iii) the growing US demand
for phosphate based fertilizer. In the future the US is expected to maintain
its export in absolute terms, but to be able to cover a diminishing share of
the international phosphate trade gap.
8.        A tentative Trade Matrix for 1975 (Table 4) shows: (i) a likely
decreasing share of the US in the world trade; (ii) an increased share of
Morocco (to about 37% of the world trade) which is likely to remain the
leading exporter in view of its locational advantages and the average high
quality of its rockl; and (iii) at the best a likely stagnant share for the
USSR. The Spanish Sahara will, however, become a major exporter and the most
important competitor of Morocco, particularly because its sales will be
concentrated on high grades (75 BPL and above) and directed to the sane
markets.

9.        Table 5 shows past and projected consumption of rock on a regional
basis. Rock consumption doubled between 1960 and 1970 and is likely to double
aaain between 1970 and 1980.  However, developing countries, which consumed
less than 10% of the world total in 1960, raised their share to 12.5% in
1970 and 15% in 1972, and are likely to increase their share further to 19%
ln 1980:
Consumption of Phosphate Rock

World Total          39.6    81.0    91.3   115.1   129.4   155.1
The world consumption grew at about 7.3% per year over the 1960-1972 period
(11% for developing countries and only 7% for developed countries).  World
consumption is expected to increase by 7.5%7 per annum in the 1972-1975 period
and by 6.1" per annum thereafter. The manufacture of fertilizers has accounted
on the average for 86% of all phosphate rock demand between 1968 and 1973
(Table 6).  Since a high rate of capacity utilization in existing finished
P205 manufacturing units is projected, the demand for phosphate rock will
mostly result from high levels of operations in additional phosphoric acid
capacity that will come on stream in the next five years.  Such large
phosphoric acid units can have a marked impact on the pattern of phosphate
rock imports since each unit can consume up to 1 to 1.5 million TPY of rock.
10.       The medium term demand of phosphate rock for fertilizer production
'7ill depend on the lead time for delivery of fertilizer processing plants;
furthermore the impact of rising petroleum prices on the cost of steel and
plants -uhen compounded with the recent major increase in phosphate rock
deliverecl price is very likely to provoke a downward trend on roclc demand.
The following table was established in June 1973 and may not be operational
any longer, it is given lhere to display the potential demand stemming from
increased fertilizer processing capacity.

5. I!orld Supply and Demand Balance
11.       Production and sales of phosphate rock have been generally closely
in line with one another durinp the 1960-70 period.  Between 1964 and 1969
production exceeded sales by a cumulative qaggregate of 11.5 million tons,
mostly accounted for by additions to producers' stockpile in Florida.  Since
1970) sales have outstripped production and stock withdrawals have supplied
alr.ost 6 million tons reducing stockpiles to a level generally considered
dangerously low. In 1972 worldwide stockpiles were depleted further by 2
million tons to accommodate a rapidly growing market. The main factor behind
this situation was the Florida producers' inability to operate at nominal
capacity rates of production (35 million tons a year); this situation was
worsened by the impact of a number of technical problems that considerably
slowed down production.

/4   See Table 5, Annex 3-1 for breakdown of consumption.
12.       In 1973, preliminary estimates show that world production and sales
of phosphate rock both rose by some 8 million tons, a 9% increase over 1972;
stockpiles were depleted for a third year in a row. The tightening supply
demnand situation was in effect aggravated in 1973 by major transportation
bottlenecks in the Florida rock industry, and by the failure of the Spanish
Sahara to fulfill its 1973 production target of 2 million tons, producing
only 700,000 tons. These two factors and the USSR's stagnation left Morocco
as the only major producer disposing of enough flexibility to increase its
exports to meet world requirements and at the same time to influence phosphate
rock FOB prices. The medium term (1975-76) demand for phosphate rock will
include a rebuilding of the depleted world stockpiles. The projected addi-
tional capacity for 1974 previously put at 11 million tons has now been re-
vised downnward to a more probable 6 million tons in view of the uncertainties
suirroundinR the Spanish Sahara and the Florida industry. The additional
capacit:- for 1974-1976 is expected to keep in line with additional demand
taking into account stockpiling requirements.
13.       In 1977 and beyond, additional new capacities are expected to ease
the tigllt supply/demand situation and to reverse to a more rational market
1behaviour.  It slhoulcd be stressed haowever thaat presently no reliable forecast
is either availalle or even possible. Phosphate consumers in the fertilizer
industry are eagerly accepting conditions imposed by suppliers in fear of
sccinu- thcir plants idled by laclc of raw materials.  Tne future price level
and freight structures will not just depend on a balanced supply and demand
or a-i ovorcapacity sittuation for phosphate rock.  Other factors, such as
petroleu.n and other cormodities price levels, as well as political and eco-
noaic consicerations in phosphate producing developing countries (including
Xpanish Sahara) will be determinant.



ANNEX 3-1

B.   Loading Cost, Freight and Price Structure
1.   Loading and Shipping
14.       Phosphate is delivered dried and requires covered storage wherever
there is risk of rain. Such a requirement limits the tonnage to be trans-
ported to about 20-25,000 tons owing to limited storage space in recovery
ports. Storage for over 50,000 tons is exceptional. Mediterranean ports for
instance, except the future port of FOS, are unable to receive phosphate
cargo of more than 20-25,000 tons. Buyers prefer to order small quantities
in order to save on stockpile cost.
15.       Nearly 75% of the GAFSA Company's phosphate rock shipments rely
on 3-5,000 dwt ships, although the port of Sfax accommodates vessels of
25,000 dwt. Considering the location and compodtion of its clientele the
Companv helieves that the advantages of smaller ships outweight the relatively
high freight cost/ton. Particularly, smaller ships can
(a) reach many small Mediterranean ports close to the customers,
(b) avoid costly stockpiling at the destination.
16.       The Company maintains loading facilities in the port of Sfax.
Shipments are handled by the Chartering Party "AFRICANPHOIS" which charges
as of January 1, 1974:
(a) US$0.55/ton for cost of loading (up from $0.25 in 1973),
(b)  US$0.16 CRT/day for demurrage (GRT   Gross Rail Ton),
(c)  TJS$0.08/CRT/day for despatch money, and
(d) agencv fees of
US$60 up to 99 metric tons loaded
US$90 from 1,000 up to 2,499 metric tons loaded
US$125 from 2,500 up to 4,000 metric tons loaded
US$160 from 5,000 up to 7,499 metric tons loaded
UTS$200 from 7,500 up to 9,000 metric tons loaded
US$250 from 10,000 up to 14,000 metric tons loaded
US$310 from 15,000 up to 19,999 metric tons loaded
US$370 from 20,000 metric tons loaded and upwards
2.   Freight Rates
17.       Freight rates have an important effect on the cif price of phosphate
rock since freight amounts to upward of 100% of the fob Costs. Freight rates
have been fluctuating widely depending on size of ships, charter arrangements
and shipping route: (see Table 7 and the following summary):

ton in the US Atlantic route in January 1974 versus $7.50/ton in June 1973,
and 511.50/ton in September 1973; the North Africa-Europe route has also
registered a more than 100% increase between 1972 and 1973. This increase in
freight rate has further deteriorated the competitiveness of US producers.
Comparing freight rates between Casablanca and Sfax, respectively and North-
european ports the Moroccan route is now from $6.0 to $4.00/ton less expen-
sive. On the other hand Tunisian phosphate producers have an equivalent
freight advantage when shipping to Mediterranean ports. The increasing
freight rates should not affect Tunisian phosphate rock competitiveness as
over  0,'% of its exports are carried to Mediterranean ports.
3.   Phosphate Rock Price Evolution
17.       The major factors affecting the price of phosphate rock are:
(a) its quality (P205 contents, CaO content, impurities), (b) the internation-
al supply/demand situation, (c) the requirements of end users and (d) freight
charges. Since practically all the rock traded in the world is under short
and medium-term contracts whose terms are kept confidential, prices can only
be estimated. The industry publishes listed FOB prices which are indicative
of world prices and were close to actual prices in 1973/74. Those prices are
summarized in the table below:

19.      During the 1966--1972 period, surplus capacity in the world encouraged
the concession of substantial discounts (up to 20% of the listed price).
Listed prices nave remained stagnant during the period because of an over-
supply situation. Rock supplies became tighter in 1972; prices are now closer
and probably equal to the listed ones. In the middle of 1972, the US producers
raised their listed prices by $1.00 per short ton after having formed (in 1971)
an export organization ~Phosrock" whose purpose was to reduce the competition
ar.ong exporters.  The increase in US prices was followed by a similar increase
s  er ton) in -Moroccan prices by late 1972.  The 1972 price recovery can
;e attributed to bothi a tighter supply/demand ratio and a better understanding
among producers. Using the early 1973 listed US prices, the price per BPL
percent was 12.64/BPL percent/ton for 68 BPL rock and 14.7i/BPL percent/ton
for 75 iPL rock.
20.      In 1973, phosphate rock prices increased sharply world wide.  In
?arch 1973 fob prices increased by US$1 - 1.5 per ton. Further major price
iicr.c,ses were announced in November 1973 for 1974; prices increased 2 times
for Florida rock, and about 3 times in the case of lMorocco over their Mlarch
1`73 level. The main reasons were: (i) a current tight supply/demand situation
in Lhe world; and (ii) an understanding among major producers to realize a

necessary price recovery to improve the profitability in the sector following
a lasting depressed prices situation over most of the last decade. The level
of actual rock prices (delivered to Europe) remained constant in current terms
over the period 1963-1973. Prices in constant US$ therefore dropped over the
period, though fluctuations in prices (plus or minus US$1 - 2) were recorded
during the period and a two to three years up and down price cycle seems to
have been in force:

4.   Tunisian Phosphate Prices - Post Development and Future Prospects
21.      The development of prices for the GAFSA Company generally followed
the international price cycle. The 1972 US dollar price increase has been
completely absorbed by the US dollar devaluation. As a result average DT
prices between 1971 and 1972 declined. however, the Company benefitted fully
from the rising price trend by 1973: to counterbalance the Miarch 1973 dollar
devaluation the Company signed all contracts (i) with French and Belgian
companies in FF: (ii) with German, Austrian and Swedish firms in their local
currency and (iii) included renegotiation clauses in case of parity changes
in British contracts; due to the tight supply/demand situation, all companies
from clearing countries accepted an 11.25/ price rise after the devaluation.

areas where leading prices are likely to be related to the large trade of
70/72 BPL; in particular, Europe, the world major rock importer has played an
important role in the formation of world prices. In the long run, future
delivered prices of phosphate rock in Europe will depend on: (i) the growth
of the demand by types of rock; (ii) the ability of the US producers to ex-
port substantial amounts of rock which in turn depends to a large extent on
the status of the US domestic market; (iii) the build-up of the exports of
Spanish Sahara; and (iv) the price policy among the different producers.
24.      Considering a future price level for Tunisian phosphate rock, the
factors affecting future world supply and demand levels (paras 10-12) shall
be determinant, although the direction of effect is not always clearly
identifiable. It still remains to be seen, whether the repercussion of
increasing raw materials prices on the production cost of fertilizers,
and hence on the selling price of the latter, will be accepted lightly by
farmers the world over. In other words phosphate prices may be rolled back
should the demand for phosphate fertilizer products register a sharp decline.
Such an eventuality would further enhance the local processing industries
utilizing available phosphate rock at a premium price in Tunisia, 'Morocco and
other North African producing countries.
25.      The following fob and fas price projections in current US dollars
must be considered only tentative. The impact of petroleum prices on steel
and fertilizer plant costs, and on freight rates has not yet been firmly
assessed; the future price of phosphate based fertilizers and the likely
switch to substitute nitrogen and potassium based fertilizers will also play
a major role in the determination of future rock prices whatever the supply
and demand relationship of the latter may be. Finally the future world mone-
tary situation will determine the marketing policies of the rock producers in
developing countries.

'6.      It is estimated that the world rock supply and demand are likely
to balance from 1977 onwards, in particular owing to (i) renewed interest in
investing in phosphate rock mining, (ii) the coming on stream of major addi-
tional facilities in Florida, .Iorocco and Spanish Sahara, and (iii) a likely
slight relative drnp in th-,e use of phosphate based fertilizers in favor of
nitrogen and potassium based fertilizers. Under the combined pressure of these
tllree factors, rock equilibrium prices are expected to stabilize at about 20%o
to 30, below the January 1974 price levels and to increase thereafter at a rate
close to the prevailing world inflation rate. For the Tunisian 65/68 BPL grades
which account for 80% of total sales, fas Sfax prices are expected to stabilize
at a minir,um $25.00/ton 1/ in current terms in 1977-78 and to increase there-
after as indicated above.
C.   The Market for Tunisian Phosphate Rock
1.   Characteristics of Tunisian Phosphate Rock
27.       Crade:  BPL content of Tunisian phosphate rock varies from 40-66
3PL for run of mine ore and averaging 58-60% BPL for the present mines.
Higher grade rock vields certeris paribus higher productivity in fertilizer
production and is sold at a premium.
composition: Besides the relatively low grade, the Tunisian rock
has two major disadvantages:
(a)  The CaO/P205 ratio is higher than in other phosphates (Table 9),
which results in higher consumption of sulphuric acid for
phosphoric acid production.
(b)  The rock contains organic matter (about 3%) which impedes the
filtrability of the phosphate by sulphuric acid and produces a
great amount of foam.  To overcome this difficulty CFRPHOS 2/ has
developed and tested a flocculant process which improves the
filtrability and the clearness of the phosphoric acid. The process
has been applied satisfactorily on an industrial scale by SIAPE and
rosts about $0.12/ton phosphate rock.
28.       In contrast, Tunisian phosphate rock is well known for its:
(a) Softness: This characteristic reduces grinding costs and facilitates
the reaction with certain organic acids compared to the semi-hard
Florida rock and the hard Kola rock. Softness accounts for the
special nutritive power of GAFSA Company ground phosphate for direct
application.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 15
(b)  Peactivity:  This quality accelerates on the one hand the process
of phosphoric acid production; on the other hand, the reactivity
of ground phosphate directly applied as fertilizers is excellent
with acid and neutral soil.
(c)  Solubility:  In citric acid and formic acid, none of the competing
phosphate qualities give a comparable solubility (Table 8) , and
therefore can be used as direct fertilizers with such high effici-
ency. The solubility increases with finer grinding. The phosphate
rock from the Redeyef and Moulares mines reaches the highest degree
of solubility and has been sold as ground phosphate for direct ap-
plication.
29.       Tunisian phosphate rock is considered the world's best phosphate
for direct application because of its softness, high reactivity, solubility.
It can be used directly in acid soils (pH content less than 7), tropic, sub-
tropic, sandy and clayish soils, but should be dissolved in water if applied
on limestone and soils with a pH content of more than 7. Paddy fields,
pastures and forests have been reacting well to the GAFSA ground phosphate.
The Tunisian ground phosphate can be mixed with potash- or nitrogen-based
fertilizers without loss of reactivity and efficiency.
30.       Quality of Phosphate Rock Sold:  The company sells traditionally a
standard quality of 65/68% BPL rock which accounts for about 90% of sales
volume.

' Epure" quality is a 70/73% BPL rock which is enriched by phosphoric acid.
The process has been discontinued. The company emphasizes now the ground
phosphate market (58/63% BPL and 65/68% BPL qualities) and does not intend
to compete in the high grade market segments. Small quantities of "epure"
are still produced for sale to an old Austrian customer. Phosphate rock sold
to the domestic fertilizer manufacturers is classified as 65/68% BPL. Chem-
ical analyses, however, show an average of 62.5% BPL (Table 9).
2.   The 'riinisian Share of the World Market
31.       Tunisian phosphate rock dominates the market segment for ground
phosphate since it is undoubtedly the best quality for direct application.
In 1972, the GAPSA Company supplied about 0.8 million tons of rock for direct
arplication out of a total market of 1.5 million tons. The future of the
ground phosphate market seems promising. In the recent past world demand for
ground phosphate has been determined by:
(a) "rice fluctuations and demand/supply cycles of fertilizers; over-
supply in developed countries had a decreasing effect on ground
ohosphate demand because developing countries could or had to buy
fertilizers through bilateral aid arrangements;
(b) The closure of the Suez Canal; ground phosphate is applied very
successfully on paddy fields in Southeast Asia: however, as long
as the Suez Canal remains closed, prices are not competitive com-
pared to Japanese or foreign aid supported fertilizers;
(c) Tegal restriction in user countries; for example, FR of Germany
and Austria require a minimum P205 content when ground phosphate
is applied to neutral soil.
32.       Recent Developments:  After the sharp production and sales drop in
196q due to a devastating flood, the Company reached again in 1971 the 1968
sales volume of 3 million and sales increased to 3.3 million tons in 1973.
'Tne company signed contracts for deliveries of 3.8 million tons in 1974.

Vie major recent development is the increasing dor.estic uJse of phosphate rock.
Considrcring the exp)ansion plans of local Fertilizer companies, about 42°,' of
GAFSA's saleable rock (2.1 million tons) will be sold domestically by 1978.
Whereas exports to clearing countries have been maintained at about 1/4 of
total sales, the boost of the domestic market counterbalances the declining
demand for Tunisian low grade phosphate for fertilizer manufacturing in
Western Europe.
33.       In addition to changes in total export patterns among clearing and
non-clearing countries during the past 9 years, structural changes among
areas and customer countries occurred (see Tables 10 and 11).
(a) Of the primary importing countries in 1966 (France, Greece, Italy,
India, Yugoslavia) only France and Greece are important in 1973.
Prance will continue to be the first ranking export country for the
Company; deliveries of 400,000 tons/year are projected solely for
a new customer of ground phosphate (TIMAC). Yugoslavia prefers
higher grade rock which the Company cannot supply, whereas export
to India has been fluctuating and might cease permanently after the
opening of the Rajasthan phosphate rines.
(b) Exports to South America, i.e. deliveries of rock to Brazil and
Uruguay for direct application increased since 1970 and accounted
for 9% of total exports in 1972; however this market registered a
slight decline in 1973, accounting only for 6% of total exports.
(c) Amona the clearing countries, the exports to Czechoslovakia increased
wqith decreasing sales to Yugoslavia. At the same time the company
has established new regular supply patterns to Bulgaria, Rumania
and German DR.
34.       The Company considers at least 40% of its exports as captive markets.
This includes: (i) Greek customers using the SIAPE process (265,000 tons
in 1973); (ii) Poland which imports phosphate rock (184,000 tons in 1973) in
exchange for sulphur deliveries to Tunisia; (iii) A Danish firm using
20-30,000 tons of M'Dilla rock per year; (iv) Phosphate rock for direct appli-
cation. Major consumers are TIMAC (France) and the Reno group which maintains
branches in FR of Germany, Austria, France, Great Britain, Brazil, Uruguay,
Chile, Cambodia and Indonesia. The ore must be ground or granulated before
sold as ground phosphate; (v) Several old customers (fertilizer companies) in
France which import up to 20,000 tons per year.
35.       Market Projections:  lncertainty about the Company's future produc-
tion level impedes meaningful sales projections. The company may produce
3.6-4.9 million tons of saleable product in 1975 depending on the success of
the mechanization experiments and opening of new mines; up to 1980 a maximum
production level of 5.0-6.0 million tons per year is projected.

In the short to medium term (i.e. 1976-77) sales prospects are deemed very
good for Tunisian phosphate rock for the following reasons: (i) the pres-
ently tight world supply demand will not ease before 1976 when new mining
and processing facilities are expected to come on stream; (ii) the probable
reopening of the Suez Canal by the end of 1975 combined with the traditional
freight advantage of Tunisia will make it possible to recapture Southeast
Asian Markets lost in 1967 and to secure new outlets; (iii) the local phos-
phate processing industry in Tunisia is likely to develop its production
caoAcit-ies at a faster pace in order to enter the promising market of phosphate
nl--;:-dia._s (MAP, DAP); (iv) captive processing industries in the
Mediterranean Basin are expected to increase their production capacities using
the same phosphate rock. The prospects for greatly increased ground rock
sales in V'estern Europe and South American appear good: in W. Europe the
reduction in basic slag supplies will he the most important factor in the
next 6 to 7 vears. In South America it is expected that a growth rate of
n,c per annum will be achieved during the 1974/1980 period.  Elsewhere sales
of ground rock and rock for grinding will be determined by the promotional
efforts deploved by phosphate rock producers. 1/

36.       The present high level of phosphate rock price make investments in
heretofore marginal mines quite attractive. However mining and beneficiation
costs are expected to be much higher in these new facilities, and the rock
produced will be of lower average grade. The competitive position of these
new mines will depend on future rock price behaviour. The Tunisian industry
which is a high cost industry is currently undertaking a reorganization and
modernization of its production and management systems, and is expected to
be in a better position in 1977 to face the new competition as its cost of
production should be more competitive with the new mines.
37.       Mlarket projections above and in Table 12 reflect possible contracts
and indicate a market for 7.0 million tons by 1978. Clearly, Tunisian phos-
phate sales are restricted by production and not by insufficient market
outlets. In view of a maximum production level of 5 million saleable tons
per year and a domestic demand of 2.1 million tons per year by 1978, the Com-
pany should have no difficulties to allocate and export about 3 million tons
per year among its traditional customers.
3.  Marketing Organization and Policies of GAFSA
38.       In 1930 the three Tunisian mining companies (GAFSA, STEPHOS, CIPHOS),
together with the Moroccan (OCP) and Algerian producers, formed a marketing
organization (Comptoire Phosphatier d'Afrique du Nord) with headquarters in
Paris. The organization determined the terms and conditions of sales
agreements and restricted the export quota of the Company and CIPHOS to 1.5
million tons/year and 0.3 million tons/year, respectively. When OCP (Morocco)
decided in 1960 to directly commercialize its phosphate rock, the Tunisian,
Algerian, Toga)esandSenegalese mining companies established a separate mar-
keting organization (Union Phosphatiere Africaine - UPHA). In 1965 GAFSA and
the other Tunisian producers left the UPHA <nd started direct marketing.
Despite the transfer of the Company's headquarters to Tunis in 1962, the
Comranv maintains a marketing office (TUNIFOS) in Paris. GAPSA stresses the
importance of its Paris office, since (i) France has traditionally been the
largest customer, (ii) all African phosphate mining companies are represented
there, and (iii) contacts to Eastern European and Asian countries have been
established in Paris.
39.       Marketing Policies:  Prior to the recent price increases of
phosphate rock, which became effective in January 1Q74, the GAFSA Company
implemented a sales and marketing policy geared to three different types of
markets: (i) Countries with convertible currencies; (ii) Clearing countries;
and (iii) Domestic market.
40.       Sales to these markets were made through annual contracts
renegotiated in October/November and valid for the calendar year. Contracts
for domestic and clearing countries provided for preferential fixed prices
which resulted in (i) price differentials between customers of clearing and



ANNEX 3-1
Page 20
non-clearing countries ranging from $0.15 to $0.50/ton; (ii) price subsidies
to domestic customers who benefited from prices lower than in the world market
for comparable consumers.
41.        Since January 1974 all long-term and fixed-term contracts with
domestic as well as international customers were denounced by the Goverrnent
of Tunisia for clearing countries and the local processing industries, and by
the GAFSA Company for non-clearing customers. All domestic, clearing and non-
clearing countries are put on the same footing and international buyers must
pay their purchases in hard currencies and assume all exchange risks. Price
differentials are suppressed and only one price is quoted for all customers.
Ouantities to be delivered and previously agreed upon are not affected.
42.        Contracts:  The new sales contracts, although valid only for six
months can be renewed for another six months upon notification by the customer
and acceptance by the Company. This policy reflects the uncertainty surround-
ing the present level of phosphate rock prices, and the Conpany's concern not
to be tied up by prior commitments in the likely event of another price hike.
More than 90% of total sales is contracted on FAS basis. Exceptions are
deliveries to Austria (cif). The Company relies on agents for sales to
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Austria and Greece.  Average commission now amounts to
$0.25/ton.
43.        The Company uses a standard contract which stipulates among other
conditions:
(a) Quality: At the time of shipment, the phosphate shall contain in
the natural state, about:
69.5% of tricalcium phosphate for the quality 'epurd'
64%   of tricalcium  phosphate for the 65/68%  quality
55%   of tricalcium  phosphate for the 58/63% quality
which is to say in the dry state approximately 71%, 65%, 57.5%.  The content
of sesquioxide of iron and alumina combined shall not exceed, in natural state
1.50% for the "epure" and 65/68% qualities and 2% for the 58/63% quality. It
will not contain more than 3% moisture for the "epure" quality, and not more
than 5% moisture for the 65/68% and 58/63% quality.
(b) Penalties and Allowances: Should the arbitral analysis, performed
on the sample drawn during the loading, show that the content of tricalcium
phosphate in the natural state falls:
below 69.50% in the natural state for the "epure" quality
or below 64%    in the natural state for the 65/687 quality
or below 557    in the natural state for the 58/63%> quality



ANNEX 3-1
Page 21
the buyers will nevertheless take delivery of the goods unless this content
should be below:
68%   in the natural state for the "epure" quality
62%   in the natural state for the 65/68% quality
53.5% in the natural state for the 58/63% quality
but a price rebate will be made to them on the basis of 2% of the selling
price per unit:
below 69.5% in the natural state for the "epure" quality
or below 64%   in the natural state for the 65/68% quality
or below 55%   in the natural state for the 58/63% quality
and proportionately for fractions.
On the other hand, should the arbitral analysis show the content in
tricalcium phosphate in the natural state exceeds the minimum guaranteed, the
price stipulated as basis would be increased by an amount calculated on
similar basis to the one indicated hereabove for the reckoning of the allow-
ances. Should the arbitral analysis show that the content of the sesquioxide
of iron and alumina combined exceeds the maximum stipulated the buyers would
nevertheless take delivery of the phosphate, unless this content should be
higher than 3%, but a rebate would be made to them on the basis of 4% of the
selling price per unit of sesquioxide of iron and alumina combined above the
said maximum and proportionately for fractions. Should the arbitral analysis
show that the content of moisture of a parcel exceeds the maximum stipulated
the buyers would nevertheless take delivery of the phosphate, but a rebate
would be made to them on the basis of 2% of the selling price per unit over
the maximum stipulated and proportionately for fractions.

TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
TIIE TUNISIAN PHOSPHATE INDUSTRY
A.   Structure of the Industry
1.        The Tunisian Phosphate Sector consists of two mining companies,
one phosphoric acid producer and five fertilizer manufacturers.
1.   Mining
2.        The mining sector is dominated by the state controlled company,
Compagnie des Phosphates et du Chemin de Per de Cafsa (CAFSA) which currently
produces between 3 - 3-1/2 million tons per year of beneficiated product,
from six mines in the Gafsa area. A wholly state-owned company, Societe
Tunisienne d'Exploitation Phosphatieres (STFPHOS) produces about 250,000 toris
of beneficiated rock phosphate (6-7% of Tunisian production) from two mines
north of Kasserine. 1/ STEPHOS is managed by GAPSA. All mines except for
the Kalaa Djerda open pit mine operated by STEPHOS and a small surface deposit
mined by open pit methods by CAFSA are underground mining operations.
2.   Processing
3.        Six companies share this activity:  Industries Chimiques Mahgrebines
(ICM) in Cabes: Societe Industrielle d'Acid Phosphorique et d'Engrais (SIAPE)
in Sfax; NPK Engrais in Sfax; Societe Tunisienne d'Engrais Chimiques (STEC)
in Sfax; Societe Tunisienne Industrielle de Produits (STTPCF) in Tunis, and
Granuphos, the most recent firm.
4.        ICM was incorporated in 1962 as a mixed company with 45% foreign
ownership and 55° Tunisian public ownership: anc brought into production in
February 1972 a phosphoric acid plant with a rated capacity of 220,000 tons/
year of 54%" P205 phosphoric acid (120,000 tons of P205).  STAPE, formed in
1049 by GPFSA as a societe anonyme, was originally owned 88% by GAFSA with
the remainder foreign private ownership.  GAFSA nows oxwns 73% of the equity
in SIAPF w1hich started production in 1952, producing 260,000 tons of TSP in
1972. STAPE produces chiefly for export, but sells small cuantities for
domestic use, and some phosphoric acid to GAFSA for upgradinp 65/687 BPL rock
to Epure 70/72% BPL.  Ilowever, the production of Epure is being discontinued.
v'r:, formed in the early 1960's, as a joint venture between Tunisian Government
and Swedish interest, began operations in 1964, producing 160,000 tons of TSP
(45% P2C5) in 1973.  NPK produces solely for the export market.  STEC formed
in 1968 aF a joint venture between CAFSA, Moroccan and German interests produced
F0,0O0 tons of pulverized hyperphosphate, 50,000 tons of SSP, and 8,000 tons
1/   See Map IBRD 10003 for locations.

of complex fertilizer in 1973.  SEPC1, a subsidiary of STEC located in Megrine,
produced 6,000 tons of complex fertilizer in 1973. STIPCE, formed in 1954,
oroduced 4,000 tons of complex fertilizer in 1973 and 1,500 tons of organic
fertilizer. Granuphos, a subsidiary of STEC, will produce 90,000 tons/year
of granulated phosphate by 1975 replacing the pulverized hyperphosphate from
STE C.
3.   Contribution of the Phosphate Sector to the Tunisian Economy
While Tunisia is, in world terms, a small producer of phosphate
rock and its derivatives (accounting for about 4% of world production), the
phosphate industry has an important place in the Tunisian economy. This is
very particularly the case in the regional context, and the phosphate industry
is of crucial importance to the poorly endowed regions of the south where
phosphate production is virtually the only source of employment outside of
agriculture.
1.   Production and Sales
6.        As indicated in Table 1 of this Annex, total mine output of
saleable rock has fluctuated between 2.6 and 3.4 million tons over the past
8 years. Over this period exports remained constant at 2.3 million tons of
phosphate rock, while domestic consumption has almost doubled, being more
than 1.1 million tons in 1973. Production of hyperphosphate decreased over
the Deriod to negligible quantities while that of superphosphates increased
at an average annual rate of 10% almost reaching 500,000 tons in 1972. The
1973 production decreased to 419,000 tons owing to a month long shutdown at
NPK in IMarch 1973.
2.   Exnort Earnings (Table 2)
7.        Export earnings from the phosphate sector have declined slightlv
since 1967, despite the increase in exports of superphosphates and the fact
that exports of rock have remained constant. The contribution of the
Phosphate sector to the total Tunisian export earnings declined from 25-30%
to less than 20'%. This situation can in part be attributed to a drop in
t}e export nrices of both nhosphate rock and fertilizers bv more than 207
over the period 1966 to 1972.  With the recent start up of the TCM phosphoric
ocid plant, and the overall increase in phosphate price levels, the export
earnings improved in 1973 to the order of 27-28 million dinars (US$65 million
equivalent) and will reach a record high in 1974.
3.   Emplovnent
S.        As indicated in the following table, the total phosphate sector
provides employment for more than 13,000 persons; 11,000-11,500 by the two
mining companies; and 1,800-2,000 by the phosphate processing plants.

M4ost of this employment (10,000) is located in the south near Gafsa, providing
the onlv emoloyment opportunities in this area other than agriculture.  Employ-
ment by the mining companies over the 1960's increased significantly with
little increase in production. Hence, productivity declined substantially.
Emplovment in the fertilizer plants increased in the early part of the 1960's
with the increase in productive capacitv, but levelled off towards the end of
the decade.  Further increases are noted in the earlv 1970's with the com-
-issioning of the ICII acid plant.
4.   V7alue of Production
9.        The value of the output by the phosphate sector remained constant
at about 23 million dinars between 1966-71, while the GDP grew at 9-10%/year,
reducing the contribution of the phosphate sector to the GDP from 5-1/2% in
1966 to 3-1/2% in 1971 and about 3% in 1972 and 1973.
5.  Profitability of the Industry
10.       Inadequate information was made available to the mission for an
overall evaluation of the profitability of the industry.  Mowever, on the
basis of the data collected, it would appear that: (a) for the period
1965-66 both the mining and processing facilities operated with small profits
--a period of high export prices; (b) during the period 1967-73 the mines
operated at a loss with losses averaging DT 2.0 million/year; and (c) for
the period 1967-70 the fertilizer plants operated with losses but showed
improved profitability with surpluses in 1972-73 almost cancelling out thle
losses of the mining companies. This put the overall industry at close to
a profit breakeven position. With the planned increases in production, the
recent increases in prices, and reductions in the ming production costs,
the industry can in the future be expected to show increasing profits, and
hence be considered a viable and competitive industry, particularly in the
short-term with the present high prices.
C.   Future Development of the Industry in Tunisia
11.       The potential for future development of the sector is significant
wiith numerous opportunities for investment. In the following paragraphs and
Tables 4 and 5, the investmient and production plans for the 5-year period
1972-76 are summarized on the basis of data obtained from the Ministry of
Plan and the companies.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
1.   Investment
12.       Plans for investment in the phosphate processing sector call for
total investment of 18-1/2 million dinar over the 1973-76 period, of which
2.3 million is for equipment replacement, 12.4 million for new and expansion
projects already approved and 3.8 million for new and expansion facilities
still in the early planning stages (Table 4). Over the same period, invest-
ment in mining and beneficiation facilities are expected to be in the order
of 29-30 million dinars; 18 million for the Sehib Project (GAFSA); 10-11
million dinar for the GAFSA modernization program; and 1-2 million for
equipment replacement in STEPHOS.
2.   Production Increases
13.       If conducted according to plan, this investment should result in
35,  increase in the production of TSP by 1976 over the 1972 production, a
doubling of the phosphoric acid production capacity plus some increases in
the production of hyperphosphates and complex fertilizers (see Table 5).
This will double the domestic consumption of phosphate rock by 1976 (to 2
million tons). Sone very tentative plans for installing an MAP plant would,
if carried forward, increase domestic consumption even further, and restrict
rock exports to below 2 million tons.
14.                  hate:  While having a productive capacity for 75,OW0 tons/
year of pulveizd7hyiphosphate, STEC's output in 1972 barely reached 10,000
tons due to marketing difficulties which have resulted from the closing of the
Suez Canal.  This position was, however. reversed in 1973 and the output reached
60,000 tons. A recent market study conducted by the company has indicated
that an export market of between 50,000-70,000 ton/year of granulated hyper-
nhosphate is available, hence STEC set up Granuphos as a subsidiary to install
facilities to convert the output from pulverized to granulated hyperphosphate.
Bv doubling sulphuric acid storage facilities and installing an additional
£'rinder, STEC expects to increase single superplhosphate (SSP) capacity to
50,0n0  tons from 40,000 tons in 1972.  All SSP can be sold on the domestic
market. In addition, STEC plans to increase its production of complex
fertilizer.
ir.       Triple Superphosphate:  Modifications to both the SIAPE and NPK
plants should increase production of TSP by about 25w' by 1976.  .ew productive
capacity at ICM will increase total capacity a further 10%.  By 1976, total
production of TSP is expected to reach 570,000 tons of which 45,000 tons
should be absorbed by the domestic marlet, leaving 525,000 tons for the export
market.  With the implementation of ICM3 or SIAPE2, two projects now in the
very preliminary planning stage, the productive capacity for TSP could reach
760,000 tons by 1977/78 (NPK 220,no0; SIAPE 1 300,000; ICM2 75,000: IC?13 or
SIATPF2 165,010).



ANNEX 3-s
Page 5
16.       Complex Fertilizers:  Each of the producers of complex fertilizers
have nlans to increase productive capacity. STEC will increase production
from 6,000 tons/year in 1972 to 30,nO0 tons/year by 1976, mainly by install:Lng
new facilities to produce granulated fertilizer. SEPCM will double the 1972
capacity of 6,000 tons to 12,000 tons, and STIPCE will add 10,000 tons to
its capacitv for powder fertilizers. All complex fertilizer is produced for
the domestic market, hence active production will depend upon the absorption
capacity of this market. In 1972 existing capacity was underutilized.
17.       Phosphoric Acid:  Modifications of the existing ICM1 plant will
increase acid capacity to approximately 140,000 tons of 547O P205 acid by
1975. The new ICM2 plant now under construction is expected to come on-
stream in 1975, reaching full capacity of 130,000 to 140,000 tons by 1977/78.
If, in addition, the ICM3 or SIAPE2 projects go ahead, the acid capacity
could be increased a further 50-60,000 tons by 1977/78.
13.       MAP:  Several possibilities are now under consideration for the
possible production of mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP). Several alternative
projects have been considered: Windmill of 'rance, a subsidiary of Central
Resources Corp.isconsidennga project for the production of 100,000 tons of
MAP; ICM3 could possibly be designed to produce 100,000 tons of MAn starting
with 30,000 tons in 17V'1; NPK have considered the installation of a 200,000
tons year plant;U.S. Steel have indicated interest in a MAP or DAP plant.
Thp maximum MAP capacity by the late 1970's could be about 400,000 tons.
M!AP would be manufactured exclusively for export.  Plans for MAP production
are at present very tentative and would have to be based upon imported
ammonia which will influence considerable their economic and financial in-
ability.
10.       tMJhile appearing ambitious this growth rate can realistically be
achieved because much of it will be the result of past investment (i.e., IC41)
and of investment decisions already taken.  The above projects mentioned
(paras. 14, 15, 16 and 17), if implemented, will require a maximum demand for
2.1 million tons of rock by 1976, and if the present level of exports is to
be maintained at about 2.3 million tons (a ready market exists for this quan-
tity), then mine production must increase to 4.5 million tons or by 1.5 million
tons (almost 50%) by 1976. If ICM3 and MAP projects are also implemented, the
mine production will have to be expanded by up to 1 million tons more, if ex-
port levels of rock are to be maintained.
3.   Exports
20.       The domestic market for phosphatic fertilizers plays a very minor
role, hence, most of the increase in production will be destined for exports,
representing an average annual growth in export sales of 10-15% (in constant
prices), compared with the zero growth situation between 1966 and 1972.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 6
4.   Employment
21.       The new investment in phosphate processing facilities will provide
additional job opportunities for 200-250 people, most of which are accounted
for by the ICM2 facilities (120 people), and the expansion of STEC facilities
(50 people). On the other hand, the modernization of the mining facilities
will over the long term result in a reduction in employment by up to 1,000
people, so that in the future, despite the large increases in capacity, the
phosphate industry will provide less jobs than at present. Total jobs are
expected to be reduced to about 12,500 versus 13,200 now provided.

A.   Geology and Ore Reserves
1.   Geological Reserves
1.        The Sehib is the western continuation of the M'Dilla deposit and
extends into the Djellabia deposit beyond which there is the M'Zinda field.
The formation dips northwards, initially at 10-15° and flattens to 7-8°.
Of the nine seams in the phosphate structure, only 1 and 2 are considered
workable on the grounds of thickness and grade, and they constitute the ore
reserves, as indicated below.

Djellabia              16.6      1.8        20.7                     37.3

2.        Criteria used for reserve estimates were briefly:
(a) Only seams or parts thereof, from which a 65% BPL product could
be produced by washing were considered workable. This applied
only to Seam 2 and the lower part of Seam 1 in the Djellabia
field;
(b) Seam thickness should be greater than 1.50 m. Seam 2 met this
criteria over the entire field along with the lower part of
Seam 1 in the Djellabia field;
(c) The seams are divided by a layer of marl of varying thickness.
The upper or lower part of the seam was considered workable
only if the ratio of thickness of phosphate in that part/
thickness of marl layer is higher than 1.5. This qualified
all Seam 2 in east Sehib and the lower part of Seam 1 in
Djellabia. However, following the early results of the trial
longwall, it was decided to only exploit the upper part of
Seam 2 over the entire Sehib deposit.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 3
(d) The reserves are limited bv the estimated location of the water
table, very conservatively taken at 100 meters above sea level,
even though drilling has revealed that water only appeared at
the 73 meter level.
3.        This rigorous criteria has led to a very conservative reserve
estimate. Exploration of the Sehib field entails 22 drillholes at 500 meter
centers, supported by some tunneling and shafts. Recent mine development
has confirmed the drillhole results. Exploration on the Djellabia field
entails 25 drillholes at 800 meter intervals, which should be supported with
additional drilling and/or tunnelling.
2.   Recoverable Reserve
4.        The reserve estimates provided above refer to "In Situ Reserves"
(i.e., reserves that can be exploited). Ilowever, no provision is made for
the method of extraction and the inherent recovery losses. The long wall
method selected for exploitation requires large areas without any major
tectonic disturbances. This reduces the area exploitable particularly in
Thjellabia where many faults are known to exist. The proposed use of conveyors
necessitates panels with rigid geometry which do not always fit the faults,
pillars and seam characteristics, resulting in additional loss of reserves.
eIoreover, the lonR-wall equipment now proposed will not permit exploitation
of seams more than 2.3-2.5 meters thick. Consequently, the tonnage in the
seams is reduced in areas where this thickness is greater. Pillars required
to protect the inclines and work places result in additional loss of reserves,
as does a pillar 100 meters wide, underlving the non permanent river (Oued
Djemel) running across the northern part of Sehib. This pillar is left to
avoid flooding of the workings during the rainy season. lhile the above
measures can be considered conservative, the consultants further assumed a
2rC' logs of reserve as a result of problems during exploitation.  This has
led to a very conservative estimate of "recoverable losses" as shown below,
which accounts for 34%, and 75% of the in situ reserves of Seams 1 and 2,
respectively, or 607 and 50% of the Sehib and Pjellalia fields, respectively.

5.        These figures wqhich ensure a mine life of 17 years are very conser-
vative, and there is little doubt that the reserves will be extended to
provide rore than 20 years life.
6).       The average grade of the run of mine ore is 60-62% BPL in the upper
part of the deposit (Seam 1 and 2) near the outcrop, decreasing to 58-60% BPL
as it nears the water table.
B.   Mining
1.   Selection of the Mining Method
7.         ^ fully rechanized mining method--the lon-wall method--was selected
bv the company for exploiting tlie deposit.  Vhilc no detailed evaluation was
made of the alternative mining methods, the mission supports the selection of
the longwall method. The two major alternatives, namely: room and pillar mining
using, scrapers; and fully mechanized room and pillar mining with continuous
miners, iJere ruled out on the following grounds:
(a) Poom and pillar, using scrapers, still has many of the nitfalls
of the traditional manual room and pillar methods. Explosives
Ire used for breaking the rock. Productivity is relatively
low compared to the longwall method and operating costs are
considerably higher.
(b)  Room and pillar, with trackless continuous miners, even though
competitive with longwall methods in coal and other ores, has
rot proven to be satisfactory at the tests conducted in the
I' Dilla mine.
(c)  Longwall methods have an extraction rate of 80o, compared to
(.0  for the room and pillar methods.  With Sehib being a
nremiun quality ore by GAFSA standards, this is important but
it does not take into account the large reductions in recoverable
reserves which result from the selection of the longwall method
(see nara. 4 above).
A' test has been underwav for two years using the longwall method.
2.   The Longwall Method
8.        The proposed nlan of extraction is as follows:
(a) Tnclines will be driven from the surface 1,200-1,400 meters to a
(lepth of 150-180 meters, at 1,200 meter intervals. One incline
has already been completed for the experiment.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 5
(b) Two sub-levels at 100 meter intervals will delineate the panels.
The panels will be 1,000 meters long, with pillars of 20 meters
between the panels.
(c) Each panel is extracted by opening up a 100 meter longwall
face up the dip of the deposit between the 2 sub-levels. The
longwall equipment will consist of: a plow which cuts the
rock from the face with a plane (chisel) like action; a
100-meter double chain armoured conveyor; and hydraulic
powered self-advancing shield-type support. The hydraulic
props grouped 3 per unit are located along the face at 1 meter
intervals supporting the roof with steel caps. After several
passes of the plow and props are walked forward. As the face
advances, the roof is collapsed behind. Ore from the face
conveyor is loaded onto a retractable conveyor in the bottom
sub-level of the panel, and in turn onto the main incline
conveyor.
(d) It has been estimated that 4 oDerating longwall faces, loading
onto 2 inclines, will be able to attain full production of
2 million tons BTS run of mine ore/year (see comments in
paras. 21 and 22).
(e) An overhead monorail system is proposed for material supply to
the working face.
(f) All inclines and sub-levels will be driven in the ore by conti-
nuous miners loading onto retractable conveyors, feeding onto
the main incline conveyors.
3.   Mining Program
9.        The Sehib and Djellabia fields extend laterally 6 km to the east
of the treatment plant conveyor and 5 km to the west, respectively (see
Chart 1).
10.       The proven ore reserve has been divided into 8 ore blocks of which
five constitute the Sehib section. They are numbered I to V from east to
west starting at the dividing line. The Djellabia section is made up of
three ore blocks, denoted 6, 7, and 8 from west to east. The ore blocks
are of similar dimensions, approximately 1,000 m wide and extending down-dip
from below the outcrop line to the presumed water table level. They contain
the following reserves of mineable ore (million tons BTS).

11.       In the Sehib sector, the western incline of each ore block will
serve as outhaul adit while in the Djellabia field the ore will be hauled
out through the inclines to the east of each block. In broad outline, the
mining program stipulates for the extraction to proceed from the outcrops to
the water table level, and from the lateral extremities towards the central
dividing axis along which the mine-plant conveyor is located. The start-up
of full production will be based on simultaneous operations in Sehib East
and West, respectively. In the east, two longwall machines will extract
adjacent panels of ore block V, and in the west, ore block II will be mined
the same way (see Chart 1). After block II has been extracted (in 2-1/2 -
3 years), the two teams move westwards and start mining block I. Block I
is estimated to take 3-1/2 - 4 years after which the two teams will move to
!,lock ITTI. The two teams operating in block V will complete the block in 4
';ears lefore moving to block IV.  Blocks III and IV will take production
through to the 10th and 11th years. Mining activity will then move into the
Djellabia Field. A modification of this scheduling is now being considered.
12.       The outhaul inclines will not be driven to the bottom from the
start but will be extended downwards in stages.  Similarly, the main level
gathering conveyor will be displaced down dip according to operating require-
ments, probably in two stages. Its effective length will also vary with the
location of the ore blocks being mined.

13.       To reach full capacity, the following development work is required:
(a)  Drifting (Refer to Chart 1)
Inclines B           =       400 m (initial)

(b)  Ventilation Shafts                450 m
(c)  Conveyor Installation
Each longwall stope is serviced by its own level conveyor,
carrying the broken ore to the outhaul incline. To attain
full production, one level conveyor in addition to that
installed for the trial longwall is required for block V
in Sehib East, and two new installations for bloclr TI in
Sehib WTest wqhere an outhaul incline conveyor is also required
for mine adit B (Chart 1). In addition, each development
heading will be serviced by a retractable conveyor, linking
upt with the adjacent main level convevor.

ANNEX 4-1
Page 8
The initial drifting, sinking and conveyor installations will be
executed over a period of 4 years to have all four faces equipped and
operational.
14.       This development work currently being carried out with 2 Alpine
continuous miners will be stepped up with the purchase of a third and, perhaps,
fourth Alpine. Past experience has shown that the Alpines average 150 meter
advance per month, hence 77 machine months are required to advance mine
development sufficient for the installation of the 4 longwalls.
15.       As discussed below under "Results of the Trial Panel" the first of
the four longwalls will be installed on a trial basis by the end of 1974/
early 1975. The development work for this panel will be completed by the
third quarter in 1974. The development for the second longwall on Incline E
is scheduled to be completed by early 1976, ready for installation of the
second longwall equipment when it is delivered on site in the second quarter
of 1976. For the remaining two longwalls on Incline B the schedule calls
for completion of the development by mid-1976 to allow installation of the
third and fourth longwalls in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 1976,
respectively. This provides total lapsed time of 24-25 months for development
drifting, hence, at least 3 alpine machines are required. A fourth machine
would provide added assurance that the schedule will be met.
16.       Apart from the initial development needed to bring the mine to full
production, development is a continuing exercise, with each longwall requiring,
somewhat more than 2,200 meters of gallery--15 machine months of work. That
is one and one half Alpine machines will be required for each longwall unit,
meaning that at least 6 plus a standby will be needed to maintain full
production.
5.   Mine Production Schedule
17.       On the basis of the above mine development schedule, the mine
production schedule is tentatively estimated as follows:

18.       The existing trial longwall will complete the panel; it is presently
working but its future operation is as yet undetermined, hence, no production
is shown for 1976 onwards, even though it could continue to produce in those
nanels along the outcrop. The new trial longwall to be installed in early
1975 can, if the trials are successful, be expected to continue on a full
Droduction basis.  The other 3 units will 1e installed as mentioned under the
mine development schedule in mid-late 1976. As indicated, some of the earlier
production will be used for bedding the stockpiles, and depending upon the
free capacity available processed in the M'Dilla plants; the remainder will
be stockpiled until the Sehib washing plant comes on stream in late 1976.
19.       It is planned to produce 2 million tons/year BTS or (2.35 million
tons of wet run of mine ore), which amounts to 7,017 tons BTS/day for a 285
work day/year. The mine will work 4 shifts/day (3 production, 1 maintenance),
6 days/week or 312 days/year less 12 days for holidavs leaving 300 days less



ANNEX 4-1
Page 10
15 days for unforeseen closures due to strike or flooding of roads leaving
285 work davs/year. Allowing 300-400 tons/day from development work (3-4
Alpines producing 120-150 tons/day), this means a daily production from the
longwall faces of approximately 6,700 tons BTS (or 1,700 tons BTS per face/
day). This compares with a maximum figure of 1,500 tons BTS/day achieved
with the trial longwall. However, based upon detailed studies of the perfor-
mance of the trial longwall, the manufacturers have undertaken to install a
new trial longwall system with modified support using a plow instead of a
shearer, free of charge, and guarantee a daily production of 2,000 tons,
for a period of two months. At this rate, a typical panel 100 m x 1,000 m
would be worked out in 180-200 work days (360,000-400,000 1/ tons t 2,000 -
180-200). The breakdown and reassembly for each move requires (25-40) days,
meaning that each panel requires a total of 210 to 240 work days (i.e., an
average daily production of 1,600-1,700 tons BTS).
20.       In summary, to produce 2 million tons BTS per year with 4 longwall
units, the longwall units must be able to consistently produce 2,000 tons/
day. According to the manufacturer, the plow should advance along the face
at 1.5 to 1.7 meters/second or take approximately 50-70 seconds/cut of 2 cm
to 10 cm, expected to average 5 cm. With an average cut of 5 cm, 20 cuts
are required to advance 1 meter or 30-35 minutes cutting time. The remainder
of the hour would be used for moving forward the supports, providing a
theoretical advance of 1 meter per hour. An advance of 6 meters per day
(6 hours) is required to obtain the 2,000 tons BTS/day. Even with the slower
advance of 1.5 m/sec and a cut of 2 cm with 50% cutting time, 50% support
time, the required 6 meter advance could theoretically be achieved in 12-14
hours. Theoretically, therefore, the target of 2,000 tons BTS/day appears
conservative, but past performance with the shearer and experience of the
longwall in Morocco indicate that a realistic target figure and performance
of more than 80-90% of this figure should not be counted on for the early
years of operation. After sufficient experience has been gained in the use of
this equipment in Sehib production in excess of 2,000 tons/day is a reasonable
expectation.
21.       As indicated in para 17, 70-80% of rated production is expected in
the early years 1976, 1977 increasing in 1978 and 1979 until full capacity is
reached by 1980.
6.   Results of Trial Longwall
22.       The longwall method has been well tried and provided in coal mines,
but its use on harder rock such as phosphate is limited. Two longwall faces
have been used for 5 to 6 years in Moroccan Phosphate mines. For this reason,
GAFSA purchased the necessary equipment and began operating a trial 70 meter
longwall face in December 1970. The experiment continued to October 1972,
with several interruptions to modify equipment. After a stoppage for equip-
ment modification, a second trial face 120 m long was started in February
1973. After a further stoppage, the second trial face was shortened to 50 m
in early 1974 and the trial continued.

23.       The major problem experienced during the trials was roof control.
A 20-25 meter layer of marls and phosphates lies above the phosphate seam,
topped in turn bv a 20-30 meter bed of hard limestone. After extraction
the marl caves as soon as the props are walked forward. However, the lime-
stone breaks only after some time creating high pressure at the face. Early
in the trials excessive pressure caused caving at the face and sliding of
the support, endangering the safety of both personnel and equipment. However,
after replacement of the 70 ton props with 100 ton and 150 ton props, the
conditions improved and fewer problems were experienced during the operations
in the first nanel. When opening up the new 120 m panel roof, problems were
again encountered. The marl beds was crushed into small blocks above the
supports and caved between and from the front of the caps onto the cutting
machine and face conveyor, making it necessary to stop the operation to
clear away the marl. 1/ An attempt at installing cribbing on top of the caps
effected marginal improvements, but the problem remained and it was decided
to shorten the face to 50 m. This effected an increase in the rate of advance
reducing the roof problems considerably; however, poor floor control lead to
riding up of the face conveyor and further stoppages.
24.       While roof control constituted the major problem, some mechanical
problems were also experienced. Breakdown of the shearing machine due to
abrasivity of the phosphate halted production for many weeks during the early
part of the trials because of unavailability of spare parts not normally
required in coal mining operations. However, increasing the stock of parts
improved performance. Installation of large motors and other modifications
also improved performance. The results of the trials are briefly summarized
in the following table.
I/   Professor Wohibier and Dr. Natau of the Clausthal Technical University
and Professor Tincelin from l'Ecole de Mines, Nancy, visited the site
to conduct extensive rock mechanic tests.

25.       The major conclusions of the trial are that the longwall is a
suitable method for exploiting Sehib but that modifications to the initial
equipment design are needed:
(a) a system of closed supports (shield) with double acting posts,
rigid caps and a flexible front bar will provide better roof
support, eliminating the problem of having the marl cave onto
the equipment;
(b) a plow will replace the shearer as cutting machine. The
shearer was originally selected over the plow because it
was hoped to mine the Seam II selectively cutting the layer
of marl separately. This was not found practical, hence,
it has been decided to only mine the top part of the seam.
The plow is simple, more easily maintained and operated than
the shearer, and it is capable of better floor control. In
Morocco, better results were obtained in phosphate with the
plow than with the shearer; and
(c) the conveyor will be strengthened and made narrower (a wider
conveyor is needed for the shearer) for better control.
26.       Westfalia have signed a contract to equip and operate a longwall
using this modified equipment for 2 months. Westfalia will provide direct
assistance of 1 engineer and 6 mechanics. The equipment is to be delivered
at the end of October 1974, and requires 2 months for shipping and instal-
lation. Start-up will be in early 1975. Westfalia have guaranteed an average
daily production of 2,000 tons BTS over a 2 month period or the equipment will,
at the option of the Company, be dismantled and shipped back to the manufac-
turer free of charge. Preliminary results of this trial face will not be
known until March/April 1975.
Personnel Requirements
27.       The faces are planned to be operated at 3 production shifts and 1
maintenance shift/day. Since shift rotation is envisaged, it is planned to
train personnel of each shift in such a way that they can perform production
operations as well as maintenance.
The personnel per shift would be:
Function                           Number
Supervision                           1
Plough operator                       1
Plough operator helper                1
Electrician                           1
Hydraulician                          1
Support advancers                     3
Top gate road-workers                 3
Bottom gate road-workers              3
Conveyors attendants                  2
Pump attendant                        1
17



ANNEX 4-1
Page 14
The daily requirements with 4 faces operated on 4 shifts would be
4 x 4 x 17 = 272.
Requirement for drifting would be 6 men/shift on 4 shifts, i.e.,
24 men/heading. Since 6 headings would have to be operated simultaneously
the requirements would be: 6 x 4 x 6 = 144.
In addition to the people on actual production some 40 will be
needed underground and 60 for the mine surface installations. This brings
the total for the mine to:
Longwall faces operations       272
Preparatory workings            144
Various underground              40
Mine surface                     60
Total                      516
C. Beneficiation
1.   Basic Conceot
28.       The ore is delivered from the mine by the incline conveyors onto
6,000 ton (2 days' production) stockpiles from where it is delivered to the
100,000 ton stockpile (2 weeks' production) at the entrance of the plant,
over 6 km of belt conveyors. The ore will then be passed through a conven-
tional washing plant (see attached flowsheet Chart II); crushed to 10 mm;
snlit according to size by screens and cyclones, filtered, dried and stock-
piled for shioment to Sfax. Covered storage of the washed ore will be 30,000
tons (6 days' production) to compensate for railway deficiencies.
2.   Selection of the Process
29.       Selection of washing for upgrading the Sehib rock was decided after
extended tests on a semi-industrial scale and can be supported both on economic
and technical grounds. While washing is twice the cost of air classification
methods, air classification could not produce a product fitting into the
65/68% BPL market except from the higher grade ore near the outcrops.  In
addition, a higher recovery of the ore body is obtained with washing, hence,
the  Bank   supports the selection of washing over air classification.  However,
washing requires considerable amounts of water, a scarce resource in the Sehib
region. Nevertheless, according to the information obtained by the Bank,
the use of the water sources proposed would not compete with agricultural
operations because of the high salt content of the water. The company has
discussed this issue with Government authorities and obtained assurances for
obtaining the exploitation rights.
29.       GAFSA has in the past conducted considerable research into the
possibilities of calcining the Tunisian phosphate rock and clearly proved
the technical feasibility of calcining. With calcination of the washed



ANNEX 4-1
Page 15
Sehib ore a product of 75/76 BPL can be produced--a readily marketable
product. However, the economics of the proceeding with this course of
action appear doubtful. The incremental benefits gained from upgrading the
washed ore are estimated to be less than the incremental costs.
3.   Process Design and Expected Performance
30.       Design of the washing plant closely follows that of the well proven
Metlaoui plants, but with several major modifications; a trommel will replace
the longwasher, a double deck shaking screen will replace the traditional
fixed screen, automatic weightometers, density and flow meters will be
installed for improved process control, and better cyclone and thickener
control will improve water recovery from the slimes. Laboratory tests have
shown that a product with a grade in excess of 65 BPL can be readily produced
with a weight recovery ratio (washed product/BTS) of more than 80% (an over-
all P205 recovery of 85%). This is a weight recovery ratio equivalent to
68° washed product/wet run of mine ore.  Laboratory and pilot plant tests
indicate that while 80% or even higher weight recovery is achievable under
closelv controlled conditions, the  Bank   considers that a 77-78% weight
recovery is a more reasonable expectation under normal plant conditions.
4.   Plant Location
31.       The plant is located directly over the deposit between the Sehib
and Djellabia fields but slightly north of the mine limits, making it
necessary to leave a large pillar in the ore to protect the plant from soil
subsidence. This choice of location was based on the need for a large con-
venient surface, relative closeness to the center of the field to minimize
ore transport over the expected 20 year life of the mine, and most importantly
on the accessibility by a railroad spur line. While the evaluation of the
alternative plant locations was poor, the  Bank  finds the location selected
acceptable.
5.   Personnel Requirements
32.       Personnel requirements for all surface installations, besides
administration and workshops, are estimated to be 110 workers, plus 13 super-
visors and 4 engineers. Because of the similarity between the plant design
and that of the Metlaoui washing plants, the availability (or lack of)
suitably skilled labor is not expected to pose a problem. Nevertheless,
some training to upgrade skills would greatly assist in improving operational
efficiency over that of the existing plants.
D.   Service and Maintenance
33.                             The project includesworkshops for hydraulic
and electrical repair. These facilities would be located near the treatment
plant. Other maintenance will be carried out in the central Metlaoui work-
shops.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 16
34.       It is estimated that 52 people will be required for maintenance
and service and 15 for general administration.
E.   Infrastructure
1.   Water Supply
35.       At present, GAFSA can consider 3 alternative sources of water for
Sehib. At Tarfaoui, located 16 km from Sehib, the Company has drilled down
700 meters to intersect water bearing strata. Preliminary electrical logging
indicate a potential supply of 30 liters/sec per hole. Pumping tests are
being conducted to confirm this. This would, therefore, require 5 holes in
the area to supply the needed 150 liter/sec. The second alternative source
is Gouifla some 32 km southwest of Sehib. At this location, drilling done
by the Ministry of Agriculture, clearly demonstrates the adequacy of supplies.
One hole produces an artisian flow of 75 liter/sec (a pumped draw off could
be double this). A second hole produced 75 liter/sec through pumping tests.
That is 2 holes in Gouifla would more than adequately meet the Sehib require-
ments. The third alternative, not yet given serious consideration by GAFSA,
is to drill a deep hole on the Sehib site to intersect water bearing strata
at 1,700 meters below the surface. This same aquifer produces more than 200
liter/sec/hole in Algeria to the West of Sehib and in an area 50 km inland
from Sfax to the East of Sehib.
36.       In each case, the water has a high salt content and is unsuited
for agriculture use and, at present, has no alternative use. The Ministry
of Agriculture gave assurances that they would issue water rights to GAFSA
when the source has been selected. Because the source at Gouifla has assured
supply and is the highest cost alternative, it is used as the basis for
appraisal, pending final selection of source. This alternative, estimated
to cost DT 1.3 million, includes pumps, reservoirs, a 34 km pipeline, elec-
trical transmission facilities and access roads.
2.   Electric Power
37.       The power consumption for Sehib is expected to be as follows:
Categories                    Kwh/h
Mine                           1,730
Mine-Plant Conveyor              900
Plant                          1,750
Facilities                       550
Pumping                          830
5,760
Hence, a planned installed capacity of 8 MVA should provide a sufficient
safety factor.



ANNEX 4-1
Page 17
38.       The public power company, STEG, will have no problem meeting this
demand. STEG will supply 30 KV to the Sehib plant site from the substation
at Metlaoui. This would mean installing new 150,000/30,000 volt trans-
formers at Metlaoui, plus 2 km transmission lines to Sehib. GAFSA will
finance the required transformers and transmission lines.
39.       STEG operates on indefinite term contracts with negotiated tariffs.
The tariffs are adjusted periodically by the Government. STEG indicated that
they have no intention to incr(izue tariffs in the near term because of the
increased fuel costs.
41.       Power requirements during construction can be supplied through
GAFSA and M'Dilla.
3.   Roads
42.       At present, a 9 km dirt road from M'Dilla provides the only acess
to Sehib. M'Dilla is linked to GAFSA and thence to Metlaoui by a paved
highway system. New road requirements include the provision of a permanent
all-weather highway between M'Dilla and Sehib-Djellabia and an access road
from Sehib to the water source on the Tarfaoui. A new direct highway from
Sehib to Metlaoui would be highly desirable and even essential if some of
the personnel and services are based on Metlaoui. The present travelling
distance from Metlaoui to Sehib, via Gafsa and M'Dilla, is 70 km. This
would be nearly halved by a road link from Sehib to the Metlaoui-Gafsa
highway, 12 km to the north.
4.   Rail Facilities
43.       A 13 km spur line will link the Sehib plant to the existing MetalouiL-
Gafsa track. SNCFT has completed a full study and the design of this spur,
but has yet to make arrangements for financing the track. It is important
that steps be taken to arrange this finance.
44.       Additional investments required to service the Sehib project are:
(a) railway and loading station at Sehib;
(b) 450-489 ore cars; 1/
1/   1.6 million tons, 24 ton/car with 2-1/2 day turn-around time (1.6 million
-t 24 (350 -t 2.5) = 450 - 480 cars).



ANNEX 4-1
Page 18
(c) locomotives (the number needed is still under question); and
(d) main track upgrading; additional signalling and communication
system; additional passing loops.
44.       Financing for this equipment is being arranged through the
African Development Bank.
5.   Housing
45.       The project will provide houses for 83 employees at a total esti-
mated investment cost of DT 446,000.  19 houses for engineers at a unit cost
of DT 10,000 and 64 houses for other employees costing DT 4,000 each have
been planned; however, the project includes no quarters for workers. Sehib
will not be developed as an urban center but the required accommodations will
be built in M'Dilla since (i) M'Dilla is located only a few kilometers north-
west of Sehib; (ii) the total Sehib labor force at 660 men would not justify
the required investment in utban infrastructure; and (iii) the route and
rail link between M'Dilla and Sehib which is included in the project will
provide sufficient means of transportation between the centers.

ANNEX 4-2
TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
THE SEHIB PROJECT - MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION
A. The Corporate Structure
1.        With the present organization, the identification, study, financing,
construction and implementation of new projects is the responsibility of the
Development Department, and the project is only turned over to the Production
Department after it reaches full commercial production. The actual timing
and criteria for the changeover is not clearly defined, and may as exDressed
in Annex 2-2   create some difficulties if not carefully handled.  Nevertheless,
because of the shortage of qualified staff in GAFFA, the division of responsi-
bility will help to prevent the diversion of engineers to other company oper-
ations and may serve to advantageously stabilize the management of Sehib.
B. Management of the Construction Phase
2.        Organization Structure:  The major responsibility for supervising
the construction and start-up of Sehib will be contracted to an outside comr-
pany; since GAFSA does not have sufficient staff resources to assign full tiiae
to Sehib, and the GAFSA staff can be more usefully assigned to implementation
of the modernization program. The proposed organization for managing the
construction phase is presented in Chart 1 below.
3.        Contractor:  The French consulting firm 1EUnI'wL' will be the contractor
for the Sehib project.  HEURTEY has considerable experience and is adequately
qualified in supervising the construction of processing plants but has little
experience in underground mine development, hence assistance from another
French consulting group SOFREMINES will be sought.  HEURTEY will provide an
experienced construction engineer as Project Director.
14.       Engineering:  HEURTEY undertook the feasibility study and preliminary
engineering a`sign of  the project with some assistance from SOFREMINES and
will be responsible for completing the detailed engineering and design. rhis
work is well advanced and will be carried out in their ?-is office.  No diffi-
culi>T is seen in the timely completion of the engineering design as now proposed.
H-TRE2Y ,ill be assisted in detailed equip-ment specifications by the equipm;'mt
suppliers who will be required to provide such d-ata as a part of their supoIy
con;ract.
5.        Procurement:  HB-EURTEBY will supervise and control the procurement of
all goods and services for the project; all of which will be subjected to com-
petitive bidding. HEURTEY's role includes preparing the bid documents, invit-
ing bid proposals, evaluating bids, awr6rding contracts (after consultatioin
with the GAFSA company), and follow-up on purchase contracts.  HEU' IEY hbs
considerable experience in internabional bidding procedures and has beer. aler;ed
to the Bank requirements.  HEURTf-i will also act as expediters of equipment
deliveries and has inspectors visit the manufacturers to ins-pect specif.cations,
schedules and costs.

6.        On-Site Supervision;  On-site-supervision will be effected by a
combination of GAFSA company and contrac-tor personnel. A Site M4anager
experienced in similar projects -will be provided by tho. Contractor.  The
Site Manager will be assisted by specialized engineers (with discplines in
mining, civil, structures, electricity and mechanics) who will be provided
both by the company and the contractor depending upon the availability of
the company staff. This will more particularly apply to the underground
development. These engineers will be supported by junior engineers, super-
vision foremen, site surveyors, draftsmen and clerks.
7.        cuDoliers Assistance:  The suppliers will be required to provide
on-site assis- `anceT6Lr erection and more importantly start-up and testing of
the equipment. In general the suppliers will provide training for operators
and maintenance crews; particularly for the long-wall equipment underground
where extensive assistance will be required from the supplier, not only during
installation, but also for start-up and the first year of operation.
Training:  Starting early in the construction phase the engineering
and supervisr  s aff for the operstional chase will be engaged to participate
in the construction phase: particularly in the mining activities. Selected
engineers and suoervisors will be sent for short periods of training in the
long-wall mines in France and Germany.  Training of the maintenance crews will
take place during construction under the supervision of the supplierts repre-
senta tives. Training of the surface workforce will be in the form of on-the-
job training during start-up and is not expected to pose a problem.  Training
of the underground workforce is alread]r well in hand with the past twqo years
operation of the trial face. Underground development wrill be stepwise in
which each new long-wall will be staffed by experienced and inexperienced
operators. An active on-the-surface training program is planned for these
operators before they are taken underground.  All training will be coordinated
wiv.h tLe training center in. Gaf sa.
C. Manageo,ent of the Operational Phase
9.         Organizational Structure:  In the initial years of operation the
Se.hib project sill fall under the control of che Development Department.  It
will later be transferred to the control. of the Production Department. Th.
*r>;nizction structuare will be as shosn in Chart II below.
1.       This is considered to be a suit.ble organization for the oper-tion
of tehio; the crucial issue being more the recruitment of adequately qua-lified
persorinel.
Personnel Requirements and Recruitment- Ais shown in the orga-nization
chirt, three senior en-ineers -will b       ireu d, supported by five junior
en3tneers.  Mr. Ben Ali presently responsible for the tri.l face will fill one
of the three top positions, the other two have yet to be recruited, either
extern.lly or from the Production Departmnent.  Either way they should  be ex-
periencedi and it may be necessary to obtain some outside technical as. stance
for assis-tance at this level.  The five junior engineers will be recrt ted,
to the extent possible from Tunisian graduates, as early as possible; hopefully
by la-te 1974.  These engineers will be trained both on-the-job by ass'sting in
the supervision of nine and plant construction, and by site visits    foreign
_nstaltations; particularly for the mining engineers.

12.       Perhaps the most crucial element is to obtain sufficiently qualified
Section Foremen for overall supervision of the underground production faces,
development headings and maintenance. These people (nine in all) are not
available weithin Tunisia and will therefore have to be recruited from outside.
GAFSA has established contacts with the French State mining company for the
purpose oV obtaining experienced personnel on three to five year contracts.
The next level of supervisors, the face supervisor, development supervisor,
safety supervisor, maintenance foreman, shift supervisors, etc. (64 total)
will be recruited from the existing workforce within GAFSA, and trained on-
the-cbh aY suppliers representatives and at the Gafsa training center.  Ex-
natri .tes sill be contracted if found necessary.

Infrastructure (Item 4)
4.        Infrastructure requirements for the project include (i) rail links
which will be provided by SNCFT (for details see Annex 4-1, paras. 37,
43), and (ii) water, rail, road and electricity connections which will be
financed by the GAFSA Company. The cost estimate for the railway between
the mine, plant and SNCFT loading facilities is based on information obtained
from SNCFT in late 1973. The investment estimate for roads includes an asphalt
road of about 12 km between M'Dilla and Sehib. As to water, the cost estimate
takes into account the investment for pumping facilities and water supply
from Gouifla, about 34 km west of Sehib (see Annex 4-1, para. 35). STEG, the
national electricity company will supply sufficient power for Sehib after GAFSA
has installed the required tranwformers and transmission lines.

Transport and Erection (Item 5)
5.        A transport cost of 3% cif value Sfax of all equipment items has
been added and amounts to DT 321,000. According to experience with similar
plants in Tunisia, erection cost amounts to about 21% of the CIF equipment
cost (DT 1,135) million, of which about 41% (DT 460,000) is in local currency.
Eerection cost for under ground equipment includes only installation of
incline conveyors and fixed electrical equipment to the extent as expenses
are not added as operating costs.
Duties and Taxes (Item 6)
6.        According to an agreement dated June 21, 1973, the GAFSA Company
has been exempt from duties on materials, supplies, and equipment for a ten-
year period starting 1971; however, the Company pays a 2.5% administrative
charge.
Pre-operating, Start-up and Engineering Expenses (Item 7)
7.        This item includes only costs which will be incurred after December 31,
1973 (para. 10) and are unrelated to the current production in Sehib. The
quoted detailed engineering and construction supervision estimates are based
on the contract GAFSA is currently negotiating with HEURTEY, a French consult-
ing firm.

Total           401        865   1,266
It has been assumed that 70% of the engineering cost and 40% of the
cost of construction supervision are in foreign exchange.
Contingencies (Item 8)
8.        Physical contingencies of 10% of the civil works, mine development
equipment and infrastructure cost have been added to the capital cost estimate.
Project preparation and engineering are well advanced, so that a 10% physical
contingency should be sufficient to cover errors and changes in project
design.
Price Escalation (Item 9)
9.        Annual price increases of 10%for local items and 13% for imported
goods and services have been assumed and applied to the following payment
schedule:

Sub-total             480   4,580   11,320      655    17,03-
The annual rates give a total price escalation of 8.5% for local.
cost and 17.5% for foreign currency investments.  GAFSA has already placed
orders for one longwall "Westfalia" in December 1973 and expectes to si-,n
the remaining contracts before the end of 1974. Consequently, the price
contingencies should be adequate.

B.   PAST SEHIB INVESTMENTS
10.       The capital cost estimates detailed on page 1 reflect only invest-
ments during the 1974-1977 period. However, a pilot longwall has been
installed in 1970/1971, and a new hydraulic support system added in February
1973.  Total past investment includes:
DT

8.  Other equipment                                       321,005
Total              1,811,544
For financial projections and rate of return calculations, the
investment costs during 1970-1973 are taken into ascount at the end of 1976
(i) at their depreciated value of DT 400,000 for equipment and mine develop-
ment investments, and (ii) at their total cost of DT 220,566 for studies
and technical assistance which had not yet been amortized.
C.   REPLACEMENT INVESTMENTS
A major part of the underground mining and handling equipment will
have to be renewed periodically and a 5-year replacement period has been
assumed. Costs (including erection, taxes and transport at 1973 prices) are
estimated as follows:

Equipment for one longwall and miscellaneous rolling stock totalling
DT 780,000 (at 1973 prices) has to be replaced in 1979, 1984, etc. The
remaining equipment estimated at DT 2,643 million will be replaced in 1981,
1986, etc. For the purpose of financial projections (i) DT 100,000 (at 1973
prices) has been added for miscellaneous replacement investment beginning
1978 and (ii) the costs given above are inflated by 10% p.a. until 1976,
and 7.5% p.a. thereafter.
D.   DJELLABIA
The Sehib deposit is expected to be exploited by mid-1980, so that
the adjacent deposit "Djeliabia" will be developed during the 1981 - 1983
period. The investments include:

The requirements for new surface installations are relatively high
since storage facilities at the Djellabia mine entrance and transport equip-
ment to the washing plant will have to be installed. The quoted 1973 invest-
ment costs are inflated by 10% p.a. until 1976 and 7.5% p.a. thereafter.

SEHIB PROJECT - ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        The financial projections are based on the Sehib production plan
outlined in Annex 4-1, para. 17 and begin in September/October 1976 when the
washing plant is scheduled to start operations. To account for the pilot
production up to September 1976, the sales, operating, and investment costs
have been included in the company's financial statements of the relevant
periods (Annex 8-1, 8-2, 8-3). The investments in the Sehib mine prior to
January 1, 1974 are depreciated as required by law and enter the Sehib
financial rate of return calculation with its residual value as of end 1976
(Annex 5-1, para. 11). In order to adequately reflect the projects real
rate of return as well as the company's future cash flow position, all projec-
tions are given:
a)   in 1976 prices, i.e., real terms and
b)   in current prices, i.e., nominal terms.
2.        Net Sales are given net of 3.5% rebates for export sales; the total
Sehib mine production will be exported assuming the following prices (Annex 3,
para. 24 - 30):

3.        The Sehib operating costs are detailed in Annex 6-2.  All costs
are inflated from 1973 figures as follows:
Haterials and supplies:         12% in 1974, 5% p.a. thereafter.
Utilities:                      10% for the 1973-74 period, 5% p.a. thereafter.
Labor:                          3% p.a. for 1973-76, 1978-79, 1981-82 and
1984-85; 10% p.a. in 1977, 1980, 1983.
Administrative expenses:        5% p.a.

8.        Financial Charges - see notes 4 and 5 above.
9.        Fixed Asset - see Annex 5-1 for the Sehib project and Annex 7-3
for the modernization program.
10.       Working Capital requirements - see Annex 5-2.
11.       Taxes - As part of the last "assainissement", GAFSA received a tax
exemption for all major taxes including corporate income tax, taxes on
production and services as well as duties and import taxes. The exemption
became effective 1971 and has been extended for a ten-year period.
Generally, industrial enterprises in Tunisia pay a corporate income tax of
40.1% on profits, of which 1% of gross sales is payable at the end of the
fiscal year as direct tax. However, there are a number of special tax advan-
tages which may be applicable to the GAFSA Company during the implementation
of the Sehib project and modernization program, if the present tax exemption
were not in effect:
a)   if the investment is approved by the Government, the
40.1% income tax applies only to that portion of gross
profits which is not reinvested;
b)   a 5-year income tax exemption according to the 1968 law
for investments in the south;
c)   a 5-year income tax exemption on the basis of a "lettre
d'etablissement";
d)   3-10 year income tax exemptions according to the Tunisian
Code des Investissement;
e)   partial income tax exemption of enterprises which export
more than 20% of their sales.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 4
All Tunisian enterprises can carry forward 3 years of cash losses and 5 years
of depreciation and amortization allowances.
For the purpose of the financial projections, it has been
assused that:
(A)  no corporate income tax will be due until 1981; thereafter,
no income taxes on the reinvested portion of profits but
40.1% on profits on domestic sales and 10% on profits on
export sales will be paid;
(B)  the maximum income taxation, i.e., 40.1% on the portion of the
Company's profit which is not reinvested.
No assumptions have been made as to the possible level of other
direct taxes and duties for which the Company has received a 10-year tax
exemption.
12.       Dividends - Although no dividend policy has been decided, it has
been assumed for illustrative purposes that a dividend equal to 10% of paid-in
capital, will be paid out after the company has fulfilled its financial obliga-
tions under the loan agreement and the "Statutes": the "Statutes" require a
payment of 7% of the annual projects to the members of the conseil d' Adminis-
tration.

A.   OPERATING PROJECTIONS PRIOR TO START-UP OF THE SEHIB WASHING PLANT
1.        Until the start-up of the Sehib washing plant scheduled for September/
October 1976, the entire Sehib output will be treated at the M'Dilla washing
plant or used for bedding stockpiles at the Sehib mine and plant sites.
Based on the GAFSA Company budget for 1974, the following operating schedule
is projected:
Jan-Sept.
1974        1975           1976
PRODUCTION (000 BTS)                  280         640            830
Stock Pile (000 BTS)                   60         120            120
Sales (tons saleable product)         145         340            230
An average weight recovery ratio of 66% has been assumed for the
M'Dilla washing plant, whereas a 80% ratio is expected at the Sehib plant,
thus improving considerably GAFSA's unit cost after start-up of the Sehib
facilities.
B.   OPERATING COST PROJECTIONS AT FULL PRODUCTION
2.        Labor cost, as summarized in Table 1, includes cost items for the
personnel working productively in the mine or surface facilities.  The wage
bill for maintenance, repair and administrative personnel (72 men) are
allocated to materials and supplies and administrative and selling expenses,
respectively.  Assuming 285 work days/year, average daily wages of DT 2.-for
workers and DT 3.5 for foremen, average monthly salaries of DT 250 for
engineers and other staff as well as 35% social social charges, total labor
cost of DT 510,650 at 1973 prices has been estimated as detailed below:

At the present tariff of 0.01 DT/KWH the average annual electricity
consumption of 34 million KWH will cost 348,000 DT.
III. Fuel
5.        The 1973 fuel cost of DT 253,300 includes annual petrol require-
ments for the car park and 25,600 tons at 9.2 DT/ton of a special fuel to
operate the dryer of the washing plant. The recent increases in fuel price
is expected to increase fuel costs (in 1976 prices) to DT. 688,000/annum.
Fuel cost for underground equipment has been estimated as part of materials
and supplies (para. 6).

the 6 mine centers--Metlaoui, Redeyef, Moulares/M'Rata, MtDilla, Kalaa Dierda
and Sehib--will have to cover pro rata (1/6) of the administrative exnenses.
In addition, Sehib should supnort about 20% of M'Dilla's overhead exnenses.

MODERNIZATION PROGRAM - TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
A. Introduction
1.         There has been little evaluation of the underground mining
techniques employed in the GAFSA mines since start-up of operations at the
beginning of the century, or in beneficiation technology since the first
plants were set-up in the late 1940's. Underground mining conditions have
deteriorated, work conditions are arduous and safety precautions were almost
non-existent. This has resulted in increasing difficulties finding suitable
labor to work underground at the faces; productivity is low and absenteeism
is high. On the other hand more than sufficient laborers are on the payroll
for nonproductive underground and surface functions. Supervision has been
entirely inadequate; the supervisors lack training and are ill-equipped for
the job. Discipline of the workforce has been sadly lacking. In the treat-
ment plants, performance has been poor, recoveries are low, process control
is non-existent, maintenance has been poor and downtime is high, hence pro-
duction losses have been high. On site infrastructure facilities fall con-
siderably short of fulfilling their functions. Bad planning and lack of
training has lead to inefficient and excessive decentralization of maintenance
operations. Lack of investment and poor repair leaves the internal rail
facilities unable to cope with the existing output, leave along future in-
creases. The social facilities have deteriorated and need upgrading.
2.         This has led to GAFSA being one of the highest cost phosphate rock
producers in the world, while producing the lowest grade rock. From 1966
to 1973 GAFSA operated at substantial losses requiring Government support.
In order to improve the operations, the company in 1971 embarked on an
extensive rehabilitation and modernization program. Initially this was
pursued on an ad-hoc disjointed basis and did not fit into the framework
of an overall plan, timetable or budget. At the request of the Bank a
detailed program of modernization was drawn-up and will form the basis for
a rational approach to modernizing the existing GAFSA operations. This,
however, still falls far short of an operational program and requires sub-
stantial additional work and study; particularly in the economic cost benefit
analysis of each subproject. The program as now prepared forms a good
framework for modernization, but must be supplemented by a series of feasi-
bility studies. This will require that additional personnel be assigned to
its preparation.
B. Content and Objectives of the Program
3.         The overall purpose of the program is to improve the efficiency
and profitability of GAFSA's phosphate production. The program can be
divided into the following major components.

(d) Improving loading and unloading facilities;
(e) Installing an intermine communication system; and
(f) Upgrading housing and other social facilities.
C. Project Description and Evaluation
4.         Following are very brief descriptions of the subprojects within
the overall program.
1.  tines
(a) Production Efficiency:
5.         A program for improving the efficiency of the underground operations
was initiated in 1972 under the supervision of SOFREMINES. In each of the
Metlaoui, Redeyeff and Moulares mines one pilot panel was selected and two
in M'Dilla where the operations are supervised by SOFREMINES staff. The
objective has been to improve the efficiency of the traditional work methods,
with some measure of success. Special attention has been paid to:
(a) improving the ventilation by installing fans and ducting,
driving raises to the surface and driving additional cross-cuts.
A vast improvement has been realized in the underground workplaces,
temperatures and humidity have dropped significantly. A system
for monitoring the underground atmospheric conditions has been
established for maintaining this improvement.
(b) improving and straightening the track for the sublevels;
(c) ensuring regular and timely supplies but installing underground
stores and improved control systems; and
(d) salvaging timber supports and tracks as the workings retreat.
6.         This program was supported by training of the underground super-
visors and its continued success will hinge upon the adequacy of these
supervisors. Further training is necessary.
7.         The results experienced in the pilot panels indicate some improve-
ment in productivities of 15-20% in M'Dilla, 20-30% in Metlaoui, and 5-10%
in Moulares. The benefits of the program have been realized by small increases
in production from the existing work places some reduction in underground
workforce, and improved working conditions. The inadequacy of the accounting
system in the past makes it virtually impossible to quantify the net benefits
of this program.

(b) Mechanization of Extraction Methods in Redeyeff, Metlaoui and
M'Dilla Mines
8.         Selection of the Method:  A time study of the traditional mining
method and a cost breakdown (see Annex 2-5) clearly indicates that loading
and haulage to the main levels account for more than 75% of the time and
costs of extraction. Hence, attention was first given to improving the
mining operations by improving these activities. Several alternatives were
reviewed such as; use of bucket loaders, load haul dump machines, scrapers,
conveyors, continuous miners and several combinations of these. On the basis
of some preliminary engineering studies, cost analyses and trial operations,
a method employing the use of scrapers and conveyors was selected. Preliminary
test results of the continuous miner proved disappointing and the existing
panel layouts, adit cross-sections and dip of the deposit make the use of
loaders, and load-haul-dump equipment unsuited without major trials and
modifications to panel layout. The scraper/conveyor system employs the
traditional room and pillar method of mining whereby manual loading into
small 500 liter Berlins which are hand trammed to the panel incline and then
lowered by winch and/or endless belt to the haulage level is replaced by a
slusher and scraper which is used for scraping the rock from the face back
along the sublevel onto a conveyor transporting it to an incline, and into
loading pockets on the haulage level. This method has the following
advantages:
(a) it is simple, minimizing training requirements
(b) the existing workplaces can be readily adapted without loss
of production,
(c) the equipment has relatively small delivery delays and, hence,
can be rapidly installed,
(d) the equipment is robust, requiring little maintenance and
requires little training for maintenance,
(e) the investment requirements are low;
(f) work and safety conditions are improved,
(g) production is increased with same number of face workers; and
(h) production can be concentrated in a smaller area of the mine
simplifying control and lowering development maintenance costs.
9.         Redeyeff Mine:  Two trial workplaces using scrapers were set-up in
Redeyeff in 1972 and successfully operated to date. From the results of these
trials a comparison of the scraper method with the traditional manual methods
is presented below - for Redeyeff.

:Mine and Surface                  3.75       6.3           +70%
10.        Six production crews and 4 development crews will operate per
panel producing 60-65 t BTS/hour and 30 t BTS/hour respectively or 500 ton
BTS/shift or 1500 ton BTS/day. These results have been easily exceeded
during the trials, with 100 tons BTS and 80 ton BTS being obtained on
occasion. This will require 4 panels to produce 6000 tons BTS per day. The
traditional panels will be completely phased out.
11.        Implementation of the program in Redeyeff will follow the schedule,
indicated in Chart I. The equipment for the first panel 1/ has been ordered
for delivery in July/August 1974. Development of the panel is progressing
and should be completed sufficiently to install the 10 production units by
September/October 1974. Production may reach full capacity late 1974/early
1975. Orders for the second panel will be placed in late 1974.
12.        M'Dilla Mine:  GAFSA also plarsto convert the M'Dilla extraction
to scraper mining. The plan is to replace all the traditional work places
with panels equiped with scrapers.  Four panels each producing 1000 tons/day
will be installed, supplemented by production from the continuing trials of
the continuous miner. While the method employed will be the same as that
in Redeyeff, the output per panel is expected to be less because of the
inclusion of a marl layer in the seam which necessitates:
(a) blasting the face in two steps; and
(b) hand sorting the marl at the face.
The performance improvement over the traditional method is expected to be
as follows:
1/   This includes 10 slushers, 6 for depillaring, 4 for sublevel driving.  The
slushers and blocks will be supplied by SAMINA, France. The scrapers and
ramps will be fabricated in Tunisia. Cables will be supplied from France.
The conveyors and electrical equipment have been procured in France.

:Panel                       3.9              7.5          +92%
13.        Implementation of the program will follow the schedule outlined in
Chart I. Trial workplaces will be installed using the equipment from the
Redeyeff trial. In July 1974 the first panel will be started by driving 2
inclines (by traditional methods), followed by development of the sublevels.
A preliminary study has been prepared for installing scrapers in M'Dilla and
the plans call for ordering the equipment for the first panel by mid-1974 for
delivery in early 1975, and thus production by mid-1975.
14.        Metlaoui Mine:  Employing scrapers in Metlaoui may pose other
problems because of the dip of the deposit and higher roof pressures. To
ascertain the extent of these problems scraper trials will be conducted
starting late 1974/early 1975. The traditional work places will be replaced
by 2 scraper panels according to the schedule in Chart I.
15.        Metallic Supports:  An integral part of the mechanization program
is the introduction of hydraulic metallic supports in place of the wooden
props now used. Metallic supports have two main advantages: (a) the size of
the sublevels and workplaces can be increased, and (b) the recovery ratios
are much higher. Some preliminary estimates indicate only minor costs savings,
but the change is needed to realize the full benefits of the scraper operations.
(c)   Continuous Miner
16.        The earlier trials with the continuous miner did not prove success-
ful, with costs rising above that of the traditional mining methods due to
excessive problems and costs of supporting the rooms. Some of the problems
can be attributed to inappropriate panel layout and excessive machine break-
downs. The trials will continue.
(d)   Mine Haulage
17.        The major bottleneck in underground operations is that of haulage.
To help alleviate this problem, GAFSA in 1970 embarked on a program to install
in each mine, outhaul conveyors in the main inclines in place of the rope
haulage. New conveyors were installed in Metlaoui, M'Dilla and Redeyeff.
Automatic car weigher and dumps have also been installed. However, major
bottlenecks still exist in the underground haulage levels, and any mechaniza-
tion of the extraction method requires some upgrading of the level haulage.

The existing track is in poor repair, alignment is poor, it is light weight
(some is 15 kg/m, other areas have 25 kg/m track), the ore cars are small
(500 liter) and in poor repair as are the underground diesel locomotives. As
the new panels extend further from the main inclines this equipment will be
unable to meet the demand, particularly with the mechanization of the panels.
Hence, the need to modernize these facilities.
18.        Redeyeff Mine:  Redeyeff is a mine with large haul distances and
already experiences underground transport difficulties. Two alternatives
are being considered; (a) install new 3000 liter (4 ton) mine cars of the
Granby type and new diesel locomotives; or (b) install level conveyors. To
select the alternative it will first be necessary to conduct a study which
should take 3 to 4 months, and be completed ready for ordering the equipment
by late 1974. Depending upon the choice of equipment the conveyor would be
delivered late 1975/early 1976 and the mine cars and locomotives delivered
by early-mid 1976. Because of the longer haul distances, track haulage appears
more likely to be selected. The project would be implemented following the
schedule depicted in Chart II. In addition to the purchase of new rolling
stock it will also be necessary to (a) install new track in some areas; (b)
straighten the drift and in some areas increase the cross-section to provide
free passage for the larger cars; (c) develop and install new car dumping
facilities; (d) install trail phones; and (e) install new loading facilities -
as part of mechanization of extraction operations.
19.        M'Dilla Mine:  A study for solving the haulage problem is underway
and should be completed by June/July 1974. Much of the level roadways will
require straightening and enlarging, new heavy track is required, a new
dumping station is required, plus rolling stock. The proposed implementation
schedule is shown in Chart II.
20.        Metaloui Mine:  The reserves of the Metlaoui Mine are too small to
warrant major investment in new haulage facilities, hence, it is proposed to
continue to operate with the existing equipment and possibly to install some
conveyors. This problem has yet to be studied.
(e)   M'Rata Mine:
21.        This is a new mine located 10 km northwest of Moulares.  The mine
is being developed to replace the Moulares deposit which is nearing depletion.
Both mine and surface equipment have been procured and are mostly in place.
A production target of 4,200 ton BTS/day (or 1.2 million tons BTS/year) has
been set. This will be produced from 4 mechanized open stopes working the
near vertical seams. This method employs long-hole ring drilling from
sublevels and blasting into draw points above each main level. The method
is reasonably safe and work conditions are much improved over those of the
traditional methods in the other mines. The mine will supply the air cla :si-
fication plant at Moulares.



ANNEX 7-1
Page 8
22.        Development of the mine has been slow, but the full production
level should be reached by 1977. (See Annex 7-4).
(f)   Small Open-pit Deposits near Kef Eschfair
23.        These are presently being exploited by a contractor delivering the
rock to the Metlaoui Mine, at a rate of one million tons BTS/year. This
output will continue, under contract until the larger Kef Eschfair project
is brought on stream.
(g)   Development of Kef Eschfair
24.        The company is presently studying the possibility of exploiting
the Kef Eschfair deposit on a large scale. SOFREMINES is conducting a
feasibility study of the project, which should be completed by late 1974.
2.   Treatment Plants
(a)   Washing Plants
25.        The overhaul and modernization of the 4 washing plants (3 in
Metlaoui, 1 in M'Dilla) was started in 1972 with a study of the process design
by SOGREAH. SOGREAH have contracted to modernize the process design: (i) re-
placing curved screens with vibrating screens to lower recovery losses, (ii)
installing control and measuring devices, (iii) replacing pumps and piping
to provide correct flow rates, fluid speed, hence correct sizing split at
the cyclones: (iv) replacing filters to increase both efficiency and capacity;
(v) some modifications of the flow sheet to provide recycling; and (vi) re-
habilitating the existing log washers, currently in a poor state of repair.
Under the contract SOGREAH guarantees an improvement in weight recovery of
more than 6%.
26.        This program is well underway, the equipment is on order and the
project should be completed by late 1974. The program includes debottlenecking
the Metlaoui plants to provide each line with a 50 ton/hour capacity (saleable),
giving Metlaoui total capacity of 250 tons/hour. (Plant I - 50 t/h, Plants
II and III - 100 t/h each).
27.        In addition, the program includes:
(a) Expanding and modifying the receiving bins. At Metlaoui less
than 4 hours plant feed capacity is available. This will be
doubled. For improved control an automatic weightometer will be
installed;
(b) Replacing some of the screening and crushing facilities to
increase capacity;
(c) Replace some internal plant conveyors to increase capacity;



ANNEX 7-1
Page 9
(d) Improve water recovery by use of flocculents in the thickeners.
Tests are presently being conducted at M'Dilla where the water
supply is most critical;
(e) Modify the burners on most of the dryers, to reduce heat
losses, increase capacity, improve dried product, effect fuel
savings, and lower maintenance costs. This will require replacing
some of the burners, and relining with improved refractories of
others. However, further study is required before any steps are
taken to invest in this program, particularly since the costs
envisaged are substantial;
(f) Improving facilities for heating fuel supply to burners;
(g) Expanding the storage capacity and improving the loading
facilities for the dried product; and
(h) Replacing the existing system of waste disposal-whereby the
course tailings are dumped in ore cars for transport to the tailings
dump - with a system for pumping the tailings to the dump as a
slurry by pipeline. This requires further study and testing.

28.       The benefits from the above subnrojects varv and require considerably
more studv. Overall, the capacitY will be increased, maintenance should
improve, downtime should be less. It should be noted that plant capacity
will be in excess of mine capacity. Modification of process design will
improve recovery ratios (a 3-4% increase may be a reasonabte exPectation
despite the 6  % guarantee) which will have verv tangible benefits - addi-
tional revenue.  Improving water recovery will allow the M'filla washinq plant
to overate on a more contintuous basis, and hence treat more of the M'Dilla
outrut, reducinp the need to use the lower recovery air classification nlant.
Modification of the burners, is exnected to reduce maintenance costs and
downtime (i.e. increase life of refractorv from 1 to 4 years), and effect
fuel savings of tip to 10%.
29.       The SOGRFAH program should be completed by late 1974.  A new dryer
has been ordered for the Metlaoui I plant to increase canacitv from 35 t/h to
50 t/h.  Further study is reouired before the orders will be placed for the
other drvers in late 1974/earlv 1975. Deliverv will be 10-12 months, installa-
tion 3-4 months, hence, the benefits of the program will not be realized
before mid-1976.  After minimal study the orders for the new filter equiDment
could also be placed in late 1976.
(b) Air Classification Plants
30.       In 1972 GAFSA with the assistance of CFRPHOS began a program to
modernize the Air Classification plants (Redeveff, Mooulares, and M'Dilla
(2)).  The No. 2 olant at M'nilla was studied in 1972 bv CrRP101S and is
currentlv beine nut into working condition.  This plant, comrpleted in the
19h0's never onerated satisfactorily and renuired modifications to process
design. The other air classification plant at M'Dilla is now being studied
hV C(RPHOS.  Full studies are also recuired of the Redeyeff and Mfoulares
nlants.  A specific stutdy of the Moulares plant is being conducted with the
assistance of TTMAC (client) for installing facilities to produce dried rock
(without classification).  This is exrected to result in the ordering of new
drvers bv mid-1974.
31.       Ireliminarv results have nointed to the need to modiVv the process
desirn (flow sheet) of each of the plants, renlace some of the existing
eniipnent (cvclones, cones), rehabilitate the existine equinment and install
nens,rinrt and control devices.  After fuirther studies this program will be
implemented in mid to late 1975.  A verv imnDortant separate studv is about
to start on the problem of dust collection at these plants.  Renlacement of
the burners on the dryers is also under consideration.

3.   Infrastrumcture and C.eneral Services
(a) Workshops
32.       Each mine has its own senarate workshop with the Metlaoui WSorkshop
acting as Central Workshop. The sittiation is characterized bv lack of
coordination between the workshops, poor use of the workshop facilities,
obsolete facilities and poor training of personnel.  Steps are being taken
to rationalize the maintenance ftnction.  This includes, collecting all data
on equinTment, implementing a preventative maintenance program, forming mobile
maintenance teams made up of qualified Personnel based at the central workshon
for trouble shooting a- well as neriodic maintenance, upgrading the skill
levels of the crews located at each mine center, and renlacinz the obsolete
eaiuinment in the workshors with more modern equipment.  This prograT will be
conducted over a period of 5 years.
(h) Warehousing
33.       Excessive downtime due to lack of spare parts, lead to havinq
SOTJETEC (Consultant-Tunisia) conduct a study of warehousing and procurement
procedures.  A new system has and is being set up, and stens are being taken
to reorganize the staffine of this function.  New personnel have been engaged
and automatic inventorv control introduced.  The organization is also being
geared to handle procurement for the modernization and expansion program and
new nrojects.
(c) Internal Transnort
34.       See description in Annex 2-7.  The equipment is old, in poor renair
and undercapacity, forming a maior bottleneck in the comnanv's onerations.  The
different size of wagons creates problems at loading points, locomotive
availability is very low, and the internal track is not heavw enough for the
large SNCrT locomotives, renuiring shunting by smaller locomotives.  It isq
therefore proposed to implement a program for replacinR 2 locomotives per
vear for 7 vears (14 locomotives) and 20 ore care/year, along with the
replacement of 2 km of track ner year.
(d) Telecommunications
35.       Communication between Metlaoui and Tunis is poor as is that between
the different mines.  This is the result of equipment absolescence and poor
maintenance. To imnrove the situation the companv is planninp the installition
of a microwave system between all operational centers including Tunis. Procure-
ment will start in late 1974.

TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHTATE PROJECT
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM - MANAGEMFNT AND INPLEFMNTATION
1.        The modernization program will be implemented for the main part
bv the Production Department, but also some components will be carried out
under the Development Department. As mentioned in Annex 2-2 the production
denartment has been reorganized and strengthened.
2.        Under the new organization a division for studies and imDlementation
has been established, to identifv and study projects, co-ordinate planning
and implement the different projects of the modernization program. However,
GAFSA has some difficulty staffing this new division, and has onlv managed to
secure one full time qualified engineer. Two other people are available on
a part-time basis, butt additional staff are urgently needed if the program
is to be carried out as planned. This unit was primarilv responsible for
preparing the report on the modernization program with the assistance of
production nersonnel, personnel from other divisions in the department and
SOFREMINES and CERPROS.  GArSA has contracts with these two consultino' grouns
for technical assistance as needed.  SOFREMINES now has 6 people located at the
mine sites, assistinR with all aspects of the program: identification, studies
and implementation. Additional peonle can be made available if requested.
CERPHOS have made one man available part-time in the field. Additional
assistance will be required from both these consultant groups to meet the
program schedules.
3.        The study unit headed bv Mr. Budin is responsible for conducting
detailed studies (technical and economic apDraisals) of each subprolect within
the modernization nrogran. The qualitv of those studies completed to date is
adequate. The next step - procurement of eqtuinment and material - will be
the responsibility of the Division of Transnort and Maintenance where procture-
ment procedures are undergoing revamping to provide some standardization and
improve delivery time.  The final step - implementation of the prolect, equip-
ment installation, civil works, start-up, etc. - will be conducted by the pro-
duction staff under the direction of the Study Division. However, this is
not yet clear, and there is a verY definite need for GAFSA to decide the
mechanics for imnlementing these projects. This could be achieved by
strengthening the Study and Work Division by emploving 2, 3 or 4 additional
experienced engineers, and/or obtaining further assistance from the consulting
firms mentioned above.  This group would then assume primarv responsibilitv
for co-ordinating the work, which must nevertheless be carried out by the
onerational personnel.  Without such steps the program will almost certainly
slip.

4.        The modernization of the air classification plants, Moulares,
Redeyeff and M)'Dilla has apparently been assigned to the Development Denart-
ment for study and co-ordination of the implementation. The rational for
taking this responsibility away from the production Department is not clear
and such division of responsibility is not recommended. It may, however, be
justified in this case by the unavailability of sufficient adequatelv qualified
personnel to staff the Division of Study as discussed above. This situation
should be reviewed.

ANNEX 7-3
TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
MODERNZATION PROGRAM - CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
1.          The capital cost estimates given in this annex and paras. 7.12-7.13,
are very preliminar; estimates. Most of the sub-projects have not yet been
studied in detail, as various alternatives are still under consideration. The
capital cost estimates should therefore be considered as an enveloppe or guide-
line which indicate the scope and financing required for a 1974-78 moderniza-
tion program. During the forthcoming preparation and implementation of the
modernization program it is essential that capital costs estimated at the time
differentiate between local and foreign cost component and give a break-down
in civil construction, equipment, transport, erection cost and duties and taxes.
2.          The investment schedule presented by GAFSA has been established in
cooperation with SOFREMINES, SOGREAH and CERPHOS. Cost estimates are based on
1973 quotations of potential suppliers and contractors and take into account
actual costs of equipment for the washing plant and the scraper equipment which
has been ordered in 1973.  The 1973 prices have been uniformly escalated by
20% in 1974, 10% p.a. in 1975 and 1976, aDdl.7.5% thereafter.  Physical Iontingen-
cies of 10% have been added. Clearly, it is well possible that the actual cost
of the modernization sub-projects will fluctuate considerably from the given
cost estimate, since (i) some components are in an early stage of preparation
and (ii) the long implementation schedule foresees placement of orders for
some items such as additional scraper and railway equipment not before 1976.
However overall, conservative or maximum investment estimates and sufficient
contingency allowances have been assumed, so that the total cost for the
modernization program (DT 22.57 million) should be adequate and allow flexibil-
ity in the final choice and implementation of sub-projects.

ANNEX 7-4
Page 3
B. Operating Cost Comparison
1.      The following paragraphs give an operating cost comparison for
production units such as panels and treatment plants before and after the
implementation of the modernization sub-projects. The costs at 1973 prices
are compared on a per unit basis, since the available data do not allow a
more accurate analysis, based on actually used capacity and total cost.
Operating cost projections in nominal terms for each mining center have been
calculated on the basis of:
i) the direct unit operating cost after modernization
detailed below;
ii)  the production build-up, given in Annex 7-4, page 2;
iii)  the implementation schedule outlined in Annex 7-1; and
iv)  price increases as assumed for the Sehib project in
Annex 6-1.
The direct cost reduction effect of the modernization program is
illustrated in the data below. However, the modernization program is equally
justified if one considers the opportunity cost of not investing: the major
part of the modernization program represents replacement investment which
should have been undertaken several years ago and by implementing these moderni-
zations, the Company counteracts further operating cost increases.
2. Mining Cost
2.      Based on the SOFREMINES cost projections and tests in Redeyef for the
installation of scrapers in the mines and the scraper feasibility study carried
out for M'Dilla, the following direct mining costs have been projected. Annual
cost projections have been adjusted according to the scraper conversion
schedule of each individual mine (Annex 7-1).

4.             M'Dilla:  The capacity of the M'Dilla washing plant will be increased from
300,000 tons/year to 525,000 tons/year resulting in an estimated cost reduction of 11%.
As to the air classification facilities, GAFSA studied two alternatives:  the addition of
a new 300,000 ton/year plant and the expansion of the existing unit to 900,000 tons/year.
In both cases, the unit cost of beneficiation would be higher than at the existing plant.
After the start-up of the Sehib plant, a treatment capacity of 850,000 tons/year will be
required at M'Dilla. Consequently, the expansion of the washing plant should be suffi-
cient to meet future needs.

5.         Redeyef:  Two alternatives are being considered for rehabilitation of
the Redeyef air-classification facilities.  As illustrated below,  modernization
of the existing plant without a notable capacity increase would involve higher
unit beneficiation costs. In contrast, if the plant capacity were to be increased
to 1.2 million tons/year, unit treatment costs would decrease by 2%. For the
financial projections it has been assumed that the FIedeyef plant will be expanded
to 1.2 million tons/year.

TUNISIA: GAFSA PHOSPHATE PROJECT
SEHIB PDJECT - ECONOMIC TRATE OF RETURN
AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions
1.       The economic cost/benefit stream has been derived from the financial
projections and cost/benefit stream (Annexes 6-3, 6-5) and reflects costs and
benefits in real value terms. The financial cost/benefit stream should be
modified (a) to replace the commercial benefit stream with one based on the
opportunity costs of importing phosphate rock, i.e., at world market prices
(cif Tunisian border), and (b) to eliminate taxes and duties from the cost
streams.  In view of the present and projected economic situation in Tunisia
and the limited floating of the Tunisian Dinar, no shadow pricing of the
foreign exchange rate has been employed.
2.       Revenues.  GAFSA's net sales are valued at world market prices, which
are equivalent to its actual sales prices after rebates.  The Company competes
on the world market with its export and charges export prices to its domestic
clients.  Consequently, the financial and economic benefit streams are equivalent.
3.       Project Cost.  The financial project cost (in real terms) has been re-
duced by duties and taxes totalling DT
4.       Personnel Cost.  No shadow pricing of labor has been nssul  l  r-
Sehib requires primarily skilled labor, vhich is in short supply.  Huwefrer,
total labor costs have been adjusted by excluding 4% taxes and contributions
paid by GAFSA to the Government.
5.       Other Operating Cost Items.  To account for indirect taxes, materials
and supplies have been decreased by 10%. No adjustments have been made for
transport costs and other input items, except fuel, since it can be assumed
that they are valued at world market prices,
6.       All costs and revenues are expressed in real 1976 prices.  The economic
rate of return calculations are based on (i) the cost/benefit stream detailed
in Annex 9-1, page 3, (ii) a 15-year production and construiction period, and
(iii) zero scrap value.
