MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A XINJIANG HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $150 millhcn to help finance the Xinjiang Highway Project. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including five years of grace.l/ The proceeds of the loan would be onlent
to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at a rate equivalent to 90 percent of the rate payable to the Bank by
the Borrower with a 0.75 percent per annum commitment fee on the unwithdrawn
balance. Xinjiang Region would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Country/Sector Background.  China has enjoyed strong economic growth
since its opening to foreign investment in the late 19709, which has placed
severe pressure on the transport sector to such an extent that the inadequate
capacity of transport facilities is constraining development in some important
traffic corridors. Further, the diversification and structural transformation
of the economy, toward more light and agro-industry, industry generally, and
more interprovincial trade, coupled with railways' capacity constraints, is
causing an accelerating demand for road transport. In response to this situa-
tion, the Government's strategy has been to focus on the phased development of
a national trunk highway system (NTHS) consisting of 12 corridors for the
exclusive use of motorized vehicles, giving priority to those corridors with
heavy traffic and congestion and to corridors which serve the border areas and
trade with neighboring countries. Xinjiang Region depends on highways to a
larger extent than many provinces in China because it has only one rail line
and no water trinsport. Thus, in addition to ensuring adequate road m&inte-
nance, Xinjiang has given priority to improving its highway network, increas-
ing the efficiency of trucking and passenger services and strengthening the
highway institutions as well as improving the skills of their labor force.
3.        Xinjiang Region, located in northwest China, is the largest of
China's 30 provinces and autonomous regions, with a land area of 1.6 million
square kilometers (15 percent of China's total). It borders eight countries--
Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and
India. The Region's current population is about 15.3 million (1.3 percent of
China's total). The average population density is very low, about 9.2 per-
sons/km2 (10 percent of China's averare). Between 1980 and 1992, the Region's
Gross Output Value of Agriculture and Industry (GOVAI) grew at an annual rate
of 11.2 percent (in constant prices). The general trends of increasing road
1/   The loan principal would be repaid according to a revised ichedule which
is different from the Bank's standard repayment profiles but which helps
the Borrower in matching cash flow of the project with the repayment
schedule and which maintains the average loan life at 10.8 years in
accordance with paragraph 12(c) of O.D. 3.10.



traffic in China are also typical for Xinjiang, particularly around the capi-
tal, Urumqi, with a population of about 1.3 million, and the east-west corri-
dor (between Turpan-Urumqi-Kuytun) and north-south corridor (along Altay-
Dahuangshan-Urumqi-Korla) centered on Urumqi. The Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan
Highway (TUDH), the main component of the proposed Xinjiang Highway Project,
serves as the eastern and northern gateways to Urumqi. Moreover, the section
of the highway from Turpan to Urumqi (national route No. 312) is a part of one
of the 12 NTHS expressways.
4.        The TUDH corridor accounted in 1990 for about 20 percent of the
population, 18 percent of GOVAI, and 40 percent of civilian vehicles for the
whole Region. Moreover, this corridor h3s been growing at a faster rate than
the Region as a whole, and contains many touristic attractions as well as
significant oil and gas fields. In 1992, Xinjiang was granted autonomy in its
economic development matters. Xinjiang is increasing its efforts to attract
foreign investments and foster economic cooperation with neighboring and other
countries. In March 1993, the central government opened the oil and gas sec-
tor including the extensive Xinjiang reserves to fo-eign participation.
5.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) support continued development of roz4 infrastructure to facilitate mobil-
ity and increase the efficiency and safety of road transport services in the
interest of stimulating economic activity; (b) promote the development of the
Region's highway agencies for transport planning and investment prioritiza-
tion, construction and maintenance; and (c) improve highway maintenance opera-
tions.
6.        Proiect Description.  The project comprises (a) the construction of
the 283.3-km Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan Highway (of which about 101.3 km are
four-lane divided, access-controlled highways aAd about 182.0 km are high
standard-two lanes) together with toll facilities and service areas to operate
the highway as a toll facility; (b) construction/improvement of about 16 km of
linking roads that interconnect with and feed traffic to TUDH at major inter-
changes/intersections; (c) an institutional strengthening component which will
provide training and equipment for seven key agencies of Xinjiangle Communica-
tions Department; (d) upgrading of the Region's capabilities in highway main-
tenance through training; provision of equipment for laboratories, environ-
mental monitoring, highway network maintenance, and operation and maintenance
of TUDH; and a study of highway maintenance planning and implementation; (e) a
roadway safety component which includes training for analyses of traffic acci-
dent data, equipment and training for improvement of traffic law enforcement,
and identification and implementation of a pilot program on acclient black
spots improvements; and (f) a study of intercity and rural passenga-r transport
to improve efficiency.
7.        Project Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by the XK*njiang Communications Department (XCD). The project cost is esti-
mated at $317.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$139.2 m:illion equivalent (44 percent), excluding taxes and duties of about
$5.4 million equivalent which would not be financed from the proceeds of the
loan. The Bank would finance $150.0 million equivalent (100 percent of the
foreign exchange and 6 percent of the local cost or 47 percent of the total
cost). Retroactive financing of $0.4 million, $1.2 million and $0.2 million



is recommended, respectively, for: (a) consultants for supervision of TUDH
and related training, (b) laboratory and environmental equipment and vehicles
for the supervision of TUDH and communication equipment for the Project Execu-
tion Office (PEO), and (c) consultants for the study of the maintenance of the
highway network in Xin4iang. Expenditures incurred after March 1, 1994 would
be eligible for retroactive financing. The project costs and financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disburse-
ments, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
12833-CHA dated July 8, 1994, is being distributed separately.
&.        Proiect Sustainabilit,.  China has a good record in the sustainabil-
ity of its highway investments and Xinjiang Region is no exception to this.
The physical components of the project would be sustainable subject to ade-
quate budgetary and institutional support from the Region to assure an appro-
priate level of maintenance. Revenues for maintenance of the provincial road
network are expected to continue to increase with traffic, and toll revenues
from the proposed highway would provide additional resources. The significant
institutional strengthening and staff training program and equipment included
under the proposed project are regarded to be satisfactory means for technol-
ogy transfer of lasting impact and value. The study of passenger transport is
expected to lead to measures with sustainable long-term benefits to the indus-
try.
9.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.  The lessons
learned from the implementation of Bank Group-financed highway projects of
about $1.4 billior include the need for careful review of highway design with
the help of external assist.nce, adoption of stricter prequalification crite-
ria for contractors, edvance preparation of bidding documents, and early defi-
nition of the organizational arrangements for construction supervision. The
lessons learned have been incorporated in the formulation of the proposed
project. A Project Execution Office to manage all project components has been
established and staffed. Procurement preparation and the selection of fo eaign
supervisors and other preparatory work for construction supervision is under
way, assuring timely mobilization of the supervision personnel. Highway con-
tracts under the project have been sliced and packaged to ensure sufficient
competition and attract international and large, experienced Chinese contrac-
tors.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the high-
way sector is consistent with the Country Assists-ce Strategy for China, as
presented to the Board on August 1993, and with its further elaboration in a
Highway Development and Management Issues, Options and Strategies report (No.
11819-CHA in February 1994). Helping remove infrastructure bottlenecks and
development of the NTHS Are cornerstones in the Bank's country and sector
assistance strategies for China. Improving TUDH and linking roads fits well
in this strategy, given the Region's position as a border area. The proposed
project helps realize the Turpan-Urumqi highway segment of NTHS. Further,
transport development is essential for the Region's own economic development.
The civil works component of the proposed project is for high-priority road
investments. The project would, with its large institutional strengthening
and training component, also help modernize management of the road network.



-4-
The maintenance component would help improve maintenance planning and execu-
tion which would in turn preserve the Region's huge investments in highways.
Also, the roadway safety component would help reduce the large number of acci-
dents, including fatalities and injuries, on the road network. The recommen-
dation stemming from the proposed passenger transport study, which will be the
first provincial study of this kind in China, will serve Xinjiang but will
also be useful to other provinces to identify necessary reforms in road trans-
port.
11.       ARreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Borrower regarding the onlending arrangements for the proceeds of the loan to
Xinjiang Region. Assurances were also obtained from Xinjiang Region concern-
ing:  (a) the improvement of the 22.4-km road within Uru=qi connecting the
eastern section of TUDH (Turpan-Urumqi) with its northern section
(Dahuangshan-Urumqi); (b) the undertaking of a study of intercity and rural
passenger transport and a study of the maintenance of the highway network in
Xinjiang; (c) the implementation of a staff training program; (d) the execu-
tion of Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) satisfactory to the Bank; (e) reset-
tlement under the project in accordance with plans satisfactory to the Bank;
(f) monitoring of the effectiveness and socioeconomic impact of resettlement;
(g) the auditing of project accounts and the Special Account by independent
auditors; and (h) submission of recommendations regarding the rationale for
setting appropriate toll levels for the TUDH.
12.       Environmental/Resettlement Aspects.  The Environmental Assessment
for TUDH and linking roads was prepared and completed by the Eco-Environment
Research Institute of the Academy of Environmental Science during 1992/93.
The assessment indicates that the highways will not affect ecologically sensi-
tive areas and, if appropriate actions are taken, the project will result in
no adverse environmental impacts. Besed on the findings of the EA and discus-
sions with Bank staff, an Environmental Action Plan (EAP) was prepared in
December 1993 which specifies the measures and organizational monitoring
arrangements required to mitigate potential adverse effects on the environment
during the construction and operation of the highway.  The EAP was reviewed by
Bank staff and found to be satisfactory. Preventive measures incorporated in
the bid documents for execution under the civil works contracts include
actions to mitigate social disruption and potential impacts on air quality
including dust, noise, soil erosion and water management, cultural relics,
control of traffic, operation of quarries and borrow areas, and waste dis-
posal. Moreover, the highway engineering designs provide adequately for the
migration patterns of Kazakh herders and other livestock migration routes
across TUDH. Approximately 1,520 people, including persons to be relocated
due to noise pollution, will be affected by TUDH and its linking roads. All
affected people will be adequately compensated and, when necessary, resettled
in accordance with the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) which has been submitted
to the Bank and found to be satisfactory.
13.       Prolect Benefits.  The main quantifiable benefits associated with
the development of the TUDH and its linking roads include savings in vehicle
operating costs, reduced travel distances and travel time, and savings through
a reduction of traffic accidents. Benefits from the project would accrue to
road users, including the operators of freight and passenger transport ser-
vices? enterprises and farmers, in the form of lower vehicle operating costs



and reduced travel times and accidents. Many of the road users are own-
account operators for the producer enterprises and a growing segment of pri-
vately owned operators and farmers would capture the benefits of the project
directly. Public freight and passenger services are also likely to respond to
increased competition so that transport costs savings would be passed on to
the users.  At a minimum, reducing transport costs would hold future price
increases down. The estimated economic internal rate-of return for TUDH and
the linking road is 18 percent. Nonquantifiable benefits include (a) reduc-
tion in disruptions to traffic service caused by snow and flooding due to
higher standards of the new road, (b) less cargo damage resulting from the
high standard of the new road, and (a) added comfort and convenience for pas-
senger transport. In addition, the safety and institutional strengthen-
ing/training components, and provision of modern maintenance equipment
included under the project, are expected to result in substantial but unquan-
tified benefits because of more cost-effective use of investment funds, higher
quality control of road construction and more efficient maintenance of roads.
Moreover, the adoption of some of the recommendations of the passenger trans-
port study would encourage the transition of passenger transport to market-
oriented operations with good potential for long-term benefits.
14.       Risks.  One of the risks facing the project is the delay in the
improvement of the 22.4-km connection within the city of Urumqi. The leader-
ship of the Xinjiang Region at the highest level has given its assurance and
commitment to timely implementation of this connection. Moreover, its feasi-
bility study is underway ard is expected to be completed by August 1994. Even
if completion of this connection is delayed by two to three years beyond that
of TUDH, the economic rate of return of the latter would still be an accept-
able 17 percent.
15.       Based on experience with ongoing highway projects, other risks cen-
ter on (a) implementation delay and construction quality, and (b) timely and
successful implementation of training and technical assistance. Because of
the difficult topography, restricted working areas and large amounts of roc:
excavation in the Poplar Valley section of the road from Urumqi to Turpan,
there are risks in the timely completion of the highway. Also, since XCD is a
first-time executing agency for a Bank-financed projectq there are also risks
to quality of construction and smooth project implemeriation. However, proj-
ect preparation has benefited significantly from the Bank's previous experi-
ence in similar highway projects in China, as well as from the active involve-
ment of the Ministry of Communications (MOC). Moreover, the careful formula-
tion of supervision arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts and
training of local supervision staff, should help ensure regular monitoring of
implementation and effective quality control.
16.       In view of the uneven commitment typical of some implementing agen-
cies to training and technical assistance, there is an element of risk in the
successful completion of these components. To reduce these risks a full-time
qualified institutional and training coordinator was designated by PEO. He is
assisted by two qualified staff members from the Science and Technology
Departm*..t and the Education Department (responsible for training) of XCD.
The training programs are well developed and foreign experts have helped
develop the institutional strengthening program for two of the institutes.
Furthermore, PEO has already submitted a detailed implementation program for



- 6 -
the first two years of these components as well as t, selection criteria for
candidates for training and the Bank has found them to be adequate.
17.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
