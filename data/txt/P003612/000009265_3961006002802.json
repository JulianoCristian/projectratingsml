To achieve this objective the project\n            proposes the construction of a 283.3 km highway between\n            Turpan, Urumqi and Dahuangshan, as well as the construction,\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of six roads which will\n            interconnect and feed traffic to the proposed highway at\n            major intersections and interchanges.
