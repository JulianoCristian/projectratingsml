To achieve this objective the project\n            proposes the construction of a 283.3 km highway between\n            Turpan, Urumqi and Dahuangshan, as well as the construction,\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of six roads which will\n            interconnect and feed traffic to the proposed highway at\n            major intersections and interchanges. In conjunction with\n            this main objective the project also sets out to promote the\n            development of institutional capabilities of Xinjiang\n            highway agencies for transport planning and investment\n            prioritization, construction and maintenance through a\n            series of technical assistance, institutional development,\n            and training programs, which will also focus on road safety\n            and the increased efficiency of road transport."}, "docdt": "1994-07-08T00:00:00Z"}
