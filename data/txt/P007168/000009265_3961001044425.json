most\n            disadvantaged municipalities. The project will finance two\n            main components. The first component, basic services\n            development, will improve the delivery of basic social\n            services to the project area through: (a) a primary health\n            care program consisting of family planning, maternal and\n            child health care, and health and nutrition education, and\n            safe motherhood referral program; and (b) pre-primary and\n            primary school program including implementation of community\n            operated schools, provision of teaching materials and\n            textbooks, nutrition assistance and staff training. The\n            second component, institutional development, aims to: (a)\n            strengthen the Ministry of Health management and technical\n            capacity to plan and deliver health services efficiently and\n            improve cost-recovery systems; (b) increase the Ministry of\n            Education's capacity in planning and management of\n            services delivery; and (c) strengthen the Ministry of\n            Planning's capacity to develop a social sectors\n            information system, analyze social investment programs, and\n            evaluate their impact."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
