follows: Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: to prevent\n            initial project delays and to reach realistic estimates of\n            project costs and disbursements, the implementing\n            agencies' commitment and institutional capacity have to\n            be carefully ascertained and taken into account in project\n            design. It is important to design, from project onset, an\n            accounting system compatible with the requirements of the\n            government and the Bank to administer project expenditures;\n            the project coordinating unit should issue monthly reports\n            by item of expenditure, on expenditures and reimbursement\n            requests, and on available balances in each category; those\n            reports should be made available, also on a monthly basis,\n            to the executing agencies or units and to the procurement\n            agent. Joint Government and Bank annual reviews of project\n            progress enabled them to maintain flexibility in\n            implementation, while keeping in mind original project\n            objectives. The limiting of access to expert advice for\n            defining expected products and for preparing terms of\n            reference and specifications for complex studies and\n            equipment caused delays, worked against the optimal quality\n            of studies or equipment selected, and ultimately increased\n            costs. Improvement or development of management information\n            system (MIS) in all sectors is a delicate task whose success\n            does not only depend on availability of electronic\n            equipment, but on highly skilled technical expertise.\n            Although the inclusion of studies and research is important\n            in projects intended to implement changes in service\n            delivery to reach underserved groups, there needs to be a\n            clear plan defining the topics, the administration of the\n            studies and provisions for their use and dissemination."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
