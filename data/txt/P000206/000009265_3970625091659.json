      strategy of reinforcing public sector management under its\n            first three technical assistance credits, the Economic\n            Management and Public Enterprise Credit Project's main\n            objective is to help Government implement its structural\n            adjustment program by making the management of the public\n            sector more efficient.  To this end, the project hopes to:\n            (a) improve the management of the Public Enterprise Sector;\n            (b) improve sectoral and project work, statistical work and\n            the planning-programming and budgeting functions in the\n            Ministry of Planning and technical ministries; and (c)\n            improve the Public Expenditure Program process in the\n            Finance Ministry.  As a result, the project consists of\n            three components corresponding to each of the above\n            objectives with the public enterprise component as the main\n            focus of the project.  It involves financing to (i) launch\n            the operations of the National Service in Charge of Public\n            Enterprises (PEs); (ii) develop Government's planning\n            and project appraisal capabilities, provide related\n            training, and carry out the identification, preparation and\n            execution of sectoral and preinvestment studies; and (c)\n            design a unified budget system in the Ministry of Finance\n            and provide related training."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
