The credit is expected to finance the\n            installation of about 8,000 tubewells, and the purchase of\n            over 5,000 tractors, together with various tractor\n            implements and other farm machinery, as well as about 3,000\n            power tillers. As indicated in the Appraisal Report, the\n            main part of the credit is expected to be channelled to West\n            Pakistan. However, several other credits for East Pakistan\n            are presently under consideration which would finance low\n            lift pumps, tubewells and other irrigation requirements for\n            the East Wing. To remedy the problem of lack of spare parts\n            which, in the past, has caused less than optimum use of some\n            tractors, the Government has agreed to license annual\n            imports of tractor spare parts during the next two fiscal\n            years, equal to at least 10% of the value of tractors\n            imported in the preceding five years. Of the proposed\n            credit, $2.3 million would be used to import spare parts for\n            tractors financed under previous IDA credits."}, "docdt": "1969-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
