to\n            strengthen the capacity of Penmas, the government agency\n            responsible for out-of-school education, to provide\n            effective non-formal education programs by helping it\n            overcome existing problems in administration, training,\n            materials development, evaluation and budgeting in seven\n            provinces comprising the majority of the population of\n            Indonesia. In support of the above objectives, the project\n            would finance physical facilities, regular in-service\n            training for Penmas staff, non-formal instructional\n            materials development, a basic learning fund, program\n            monitoring and evaluation, and related technical assistance.\n            In strengthening Penmas, the project would provide\n            vocational training and basic education to about 2.5 million\n            Indonesians in seven provinces."}, "docdt": "1977-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
