Gambia Gateway Project intends to\n            enable The Gambia to establish itself as a globally\n            competitive export and processing center. The project is a\n            key component of the Government's strategy for\n            achieving broad-based, export-oriented, and sustained\n            growth. TThe project will be implemented in two phases--this\n            being the first phase--using an Adaptable Program Lending\n            (APL) instrument. There are five components. The first\n            establishes the physical infrastructure needed for an\n            operational Free Zone at the airport. It includes common\n            users facilities and utilities and consulting services for\n            supervising works. The second component establishes the\n            Investment Promotion and Free Zone Agency (GIPFZA) as a\n            self-sustaining entity that manages the free zones and\n            promotes trade and investment. It includes operational\n            support, technical assistance, and consulting services. The\n            third component provides technical assistance for the Gambia\n            Divestiture Agency. The fourth component finances training\n            activities for both the public and private sectors directly\n            involved in investment and Free Zone-related businesses.\n            Training includes quality managmeent and control processes,\n            the ISO certification concept, and information about US and\n            European markets' access regulations. The fifth\n            component funds for overall project management and\n            environmental studies and mitigation measures."}, "docdt": "2001-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
