F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
This project is an APL. The development goal of Phase 1 is to lay the foundation for
expanded private investment export-oriented production and employment, through the
establishment of the Free Zone and an improved institutional environment. This objective
will be achieved by

  (i). Establishing a self-sustaining Gambia Investment Promotion and Free Zone Agency
(GIPFZA)
  (ii). Marketing and facilitating local and foreign investments in well-targeted economic
sectors
  (iii). Developing a 10 ha. pilot Free Zone (FZ) at the airport
  (iv). Promoting privately financed and operated FZ-related businesses, including
teleport services
  (v). Helping the government to implement its divestiture strategy
  (vi). Mitigating any social and/or environmental impacts that could result from project
implementation
  (vii). Preparing the APL 2, including a better interface between the FZs and the
population along the Gambia River.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
A first order restructuring was undertaken, changing project components (see section
1.6) but the PDO was not changed.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.           Context at Appraisal

1.1.1   Background

From 1986 to 1993, The Gambia had a well-managed and stable economy establishing a solid
track record on policy reforms. However, a series of adverse external shocks happened between
1993-96 which led to an economic slowdown and loss of per capita income. The external shocks
like: the reinforced border control by Senegal in 1993, the CFA franc devaluation in 1994, and
the political uncertainty as an aftermath of the July 1994 military coup, significantly damaged
the re-export trade in the Gambia, seriously affecting the main source of foreign exchange and
government revenues. These external shocks also eroded the private sector confidence. The
completion of the 1997 presidential and legislative elections considerably reduced the country's
political isolation and improved its economic prospects. The Government took a number of
measures to restore economic stability and began to normalize relations with donors. On March
31, 1998, The International Development Association (IDA) Board approved its first credit to the
country's (health sector) after a hiatus of four years. On June 29, 1998, the International
monetary Fund (IMF) Board approved a Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PRGF) program.
GDP growth in 1999 amounted to 5.6 percent after several years of stagnation.

The Gambia Gateway Project was intended to enable The Gambia to establish itself as a globally
competitive export and processing center. The Project was a key component of the Government's
strategy for achieving broad-based, export-oriented, and sustained growth. The Program was to
be implemented in phases through an Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument. This
lending instrument was selected due to: (i) the apparent need to progressively build capacity for
trade promotion; (ii) the phased sequence of the investment part of the project; and (iii) the long-
term commitment of the Government to implementing the Gateway Project. The APL was to be
implemented in two phases: Phase 1 (APL1) was expected to lay the physical and operational
foundations for establishing The Gambia as a credible player in the world trade arena. Phase 2
(APL2) was expected to consolidate the FZ functions and financing, and secure managerial and
financial autonomy for The Gambia Investment Promotion and Free Zones Agency (GIPFZA).

1.1.2   Development Strategies and Rationale for Bank's Assistance

With the new drive for change, the Government of the Gambia (GoG) embarked on the
revitalization of The Gambia Incorporated Vision 2020 and the preparation of the Government
Policy Framework Paper (PFP) for the period 1998-2000. Both statements outlined visions of
transforming the country from one of the least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa into a
middle-income country with a vibrant private sector open to the world. This goal was to be
attained by expanding and deepening a fast-growing tourism sector, increasing productivity and
diversification in agriculture and manufacturing, and developing internationally linked services.
Particularly important were Free Zones (FZ) based on an improved port, airport and a modern
financial center. Hence, the Gambia Gateway Project which was aimed to urgently respond to




                                                 1
the country's need to vigorously fight poverty through employment creation and commence the
long journey towards transformation into a middle income country.

The GoG's Private Sector Development Strategy was developed to better underpin the
constraints, opportunities and understand the challenges ahead as it makes effort to embrace its
role as the engine for growth. In this regard, a comprehensive review of The Gambia's potential
for export-oriented growth was carried out in 1994, and updated in 2000 by the International
Development Ireland, Ltd., Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority and Sahel Invest Management
International1. The Strategy noted that the agribusiness and tourism sectors had the potential for
generating long-term exports and foreign exchange earnings. It further identified The Gambia as
well positioned to build on its traditional trading and tourist sectors to exploit new markets
related to telecommunications and spin-off "cluster" developments. Although the private sector
was deemed small, it was perceived to have the potential to grow and expand rapidly while
making efforts to halt the heavy dependency on transit trade. It also stated that, although
European countries like United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and the Netherlands are the Gambia's
key trading countries, it would be appropriate to explore and develop regional integration
through trade.

The Gambia Gateway Project was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors on February
28, 2002 and became effective on September 18, 2002. The Project was consistent with IDA's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)2 for The Gambia, which defined poverty reduction as its
central goal. Within its overall strategic objective of poverty reduction, the CAS defined a two-
pronged strategy: (i) more rapid, broad-based, export oriented sustained growth; and (ii) social
sustainability. There were four operational sub-areas under the first strategic area: (a) macro-
economic stability, (b) private sector development, (c) supporting infrastructure, and (d) rural
development. In its analysis of economic opportunities, the CAS underlined The Gambia's latent
comparative advantage as a potential "Gateway" center for transshipment and export processing
in West Africa and thus the importance of the Gateway Project to realize these opportunities and
vision. The Gateway Project as part of the Bank's high case scenario strategy was also expected
to complement four other Bank programs that focused on capacity building, health, and
education by creating employment through new economic activities and private sector
development. The Gateway Project was seen as an important cornerstone to the overall strategy
geared towards poverty alleviation and sustainable levels of growth.

1.1.3        Key Sector Issues

The Private Sector Development (PSD) strategy highlighted several key constraints of which
some were to be addressed by the Gambia Gateway Project. These were:

(i)          A weak institutional framework for trade and investment promotion. Previous
             interventions produced limited results due to institutional capacity constraints and

             insufficient financial resources in government agencies3 responsible for private sector
             development. As a result, GoG introduced a new act entitled The Gambia Investment
             Promotion Act of 2001 to establish a new agency, the Gambia Investment Promotion and
             Free Zone Agency4 (GIPFZA).

(ii)         Lack of institutional capacity to support private sector development. The private sector
             in the Gambia is characterized as thin and dominated by informal trading activities. It
             encounters a number of constraints including an inefficient trade infrastructure at a high
             transaction cost, inadequate utilities services, in particular power5. In addition the
             informal sector encounters limited long-term growth potential due to the then WTO
             regulations. Since 1994, the tourist industry lacked a forward long-term strategy to
             include attracting up-scale tourists.

(iii)        Poor public services in particular from the utilities. The competitiveness and
             performance of the public sector services have been poor, with a few public enterprises
             benefiting from their monopolistic position and thus imposed very high tariffs. These
             included the Gambia Telecommunications Company (GAMTEL), the National Water and
             Electricity Company (NAWEC) and the Gambia Ports Authority (GPA). In 1998, GoG
             made an attempt to improve the performance of key State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and
             signed six Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with these SOEs. It also sought to
             vigorously implement its Divestiture Program (DP) where the private sector was
             expected to participate in different forms including public-private partnerships (PPP) and
             take over operations of most of the SOEs in particular the ports.

(iv)         A narrow and shallow financial sector. The financial sector interest in commercial or
             investment ventures have been limited and offered only a few products and services.
             Commercial banks gave priority to short-term trade finance and short-term treasury bills.
             In this regard, private sector development became difficult due to lack of access to
             financial resources and banking services6. The Project did not provide direct assistance to
             the financial sector issues as they were being dealt with through interventions from the
             IMF's PRGF and UNDP national program.

1.2          Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

  As stated in the Acts, the objectives of the GIPFZA are to promote The Gambia as a trade Gateway and investment haven and to (i) provide an
attractive business environment and incentives for business activity in Gambia; (ii) be a "one-stop-shop" for investors; (iii) attract, promote, and
facilitate investments; and (iv) advise the Government on investment policy and related matters.

This objective would be achieved by:(i) establishing a self-sustaining GIPFZA; (ii) marketing
and facilitating local and foreign investments in well-targeted economic sectors; (iii) developing
a 10 ha. pilot FZ at the airport; (iv) promoting privately financed and operated FZ-related
businesses, including teleport services; (v) helping the government to implement its divestiture
strategy; (vi) mitigating any social and/or environmental impacts that could result from project
implementation; (vii) preparing the APL 2, including a better interface between the FZs and the
population along the Gambia River.

Key indicators Phase I

Private investment promotion: (i) the number of licenses delivered by GIPFZA during the period
2002 -2006: 5 per year (20 by end of project); (ii) the creation of at least 20 new firms; Export-
oriented production; (iii) the achievement of annual ton and value targets for the FZs;
Employment creation; (iv) the creation of 4000 direct new jobs; Improved institutional
environment; (v) average process time to create new enterprises is reduced to 4 weeks; and (vi)
average customs clearance time for FZ related cargoes is reduced to 1 day.

Key indicators Phase II

 Triggers for APL 2: The performance triggers for passing from APL 1 to APL 2 reflect the basic
 development objectives and expected outcomes of the first phase, which emphasized laying a
 solid foundation for sustainable future growth through concrete market-based achievements, and
 attaining self financing of GIPFZA and environmentally and socially sound development. They
 were:
   (i) Implementation of APL1, including full compliance with Environmental and Social
         Management Plan (ESMP), assessed as satisfactory by IDA, based on the project
         outcome.
  (ii) GoG divestiture plans for public enterprises related to transport and telecommunication,
         listed under Tracks I and II, are implemented.
 (iii) Phase I of the Trade and Transport Audit recommendations implemented.
 (iv) Phase I of the Customs & Excise Department Quality Audit recommendations
         implemented.
  (v)    At least 20 firms created under incentives and status of the Gambia Investment
         Promotion and Free Zones Acts 2001.
 (vi) At least 4,000 direct or indirect jobs created through the Gambia Investment Promotion
         and Free Zones Acts 2001.
(vii) GIPFZA operating costs covered by its revenues.

With regards to triggers 3 and 4, two audits would be carried out in the areas of trade and
transport and customs respectively. The action plan resulting from these audits would constitute
Phase I referred to in triggers 3 and 4, to be implemented within a three-year period. For triggers
5 and 6, the Association shall consider 80 percent compliance as fully satisfactory.

                                                4
The PDO was not changed. A first order restructuring was undertaken, changing project
components (See Section 1.6). Two indicators related to FZ were removed ((iii) the achievement
of annual ton and value targets for the FZs; and (vi) average customs clearance time for FZ
related cargoes is reduced to 1 day.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

The Project's primary beneficiaries consisted of three groups: (i) the local population; (ii) the
private sector; and (iii) the GoG. The local population was expected to benefit from the creation
of job opportunities in the Greater Banjul Area, as well as acquire improved skills and mobility
within the labor force. By addressing key policies and building institutional capacity, the Project
was expected to lay the foundation for rapid and sustained economic growth that would benefit a
broad spectrum of the Gambian population. The private sector was to benefit from (i) the
removal of major institutional and procedural constraints that hindered its activities and
development; and (ii) a more supportive environment to attract investments, including new
incentives, new economic activities, lower transaction costs, more training opportunities, and the
availability of ready sites for export processing industries. As for the GoG, the Project was
expected to attract a flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) that would create direct and
indirect new jobs, as well as transfer technology and know-how. Moreover, the new component:
Preparatory work for the Divestiture of the Groundnut sector: was expected to contribute
towards increasing the production and quality of groundnut for export. This would, in turn, help
increase the income of the rural groundnut farming population who are mostly in the lower-
income poverty bracket bringing about reduced rural income poverty.

of five years. In light of (i) a critically low level of staffing at the GDA; (ii) lack of clarity of
decision-making on the SOEs between line ministries, ministries of finance, trade and
employment; and (iii) resistance from SOEs management, the component underperformed and
was rated unsatisfactory. In addition, the component lacked political support and commitment to
move the program forward. As such, the component was dropped and formally closed.

New Component 3: Preparatory work for the Divestiture of the Groundnut sector (US$ 2.4
million). Given the Government's request to urgently provide support to the groundnut sector by
financing relevant activities and equipment used to improve the production output and its quality,
the Bank agreed to the use of credit proceeds to provide the required assistance. The assistance



                                                      6
was also meant to prepare the divestiture of The Gambia Groundnut Corporation (GGC) within a
framework that emphasized divestiture as a means to improve the sector's performance and not
as the end objective. This assistance comprised four subcomponents, as shown below:

(a)            Planning of Groundnut Seasonal Crop Activities: To provide technical assistance
          to the Agribusiness Service Plan Association (ASPA) to: (i) make immediate decisions,
          and inform all stakeholders regarding: (a) the setting of the 2008 indicative producer
          prices for delivery at various levels (depots, or Denton Bridge); and (b) the adoption of an
          adequate marketing cost structure to permit adequate operations and maintenance at all
          levels of the marketing chain; (ii) enable organization of the transport logistics with and
          its individual cooperatives; (iii) ensuring adequate and timely crop finance ­ from private
          buyers and or the GGC -- for buying the 2008 crop from the start of the season; and (iv)
          establishing a minimum quality control system to avoid Gambia exports being refused by
          importing countries (rehabilitation of depots, sorting and treatments, quick evacuation of
          the crop, etc.).

(b)      Improving the efficiency of the river transport. These activities were detailed as
         follows: (i) the rehabilitation of two tugboats and the existing motorized barges (second
         priority); and (ii) the rehabilitation of the depots loading/unloading equipment, in
         particular, at Denton Bridge (reception jetty, receiving lines).

(c)       Groundnut Crop Quality Assurance: Ensuring the minimum quality of the produce, the
          critical minimum measures that will be supported by the Project included: (i) the
          establishment of adequate physical sorting mechanisms at depot level - to segregate
          potential HPS quality from oil-crushing groundnut stocks; (ii) the establishment of proper
          handling and control techniques at the processing level (shelling, sorting, crushing); and
          (iii) the improvement of the capacity of the national production control laboratory for
          mycotoxin (Aflatoxin) and residue analysis.

(d)       Technical Assistance: Consultant services to carry out both financial and technical
          audits of the GGC. In addition to these two consultancies, the Project would finance the
          preparation of a performance-based management contract for the GGC and support the
          hiring of a short term groundnut specialist to provide the technical input to ensure timely
          and sound technical implementation of the assistance.

The Results Framework was revised to remove indicators of the closed components and at the
same time update and revise upwards the end of project indicators based on the assessment of
achievements and progress at the time of restructuring and included new indicators for the new
component. The reduction of components from 5 to 4 - narrowed the focus and allowed
resources to be channeled to well define activities and enhance achievement of the intended
impact7.


7
  Certain intermediate outcome indicators were dropped, some were revised to reflect progress made on the original framework and new ones
were added to monitor the project-performance during the implementation of the restructuring phase. A summary of the revised Results
Framework is attached in Annex 2.




                                                                   7
Re-allocation of Funds: Funds were reallocated between components and categories to support
the agreed changes. The Project benefited from the exchange rate between SDR and USD
amounting to US2.86 million and thus more funds were available for the Project's use. For
example (i) funds were increased to finance activities aimed at establishing GIPFZA's
sustainability and bringing in a private developer to manage the industrial park; and (ii)
unutilized funds were moved from closed components and re-allocated to the new Component 3:
Preparatory work for the Divestiture of the Groundnut Sector.

1.7        Other significant changes

Change in Lending Instrument: The Gambia Gateway Project designed as a phased program
through an APL instrument because of the apparent need for a systematic and progressive
capacity building interventions for trade promotion. However, the idea of an APL II was dropped
from the 2008 JAS since the instrument no longer corresponded to the country's needs in terms
of growth and competitiveness. In addition, progress towards reaching APL II triggers was
remote as only three out of seven triggers showed sign of being achievable.

Extensions of Project Closing Dates: The Project closing date was extended four times. The
first extension was from the original closing date of April 30, 2007 to August 31, 2007. The
second extension was from August 31, 2007 to December 31, 2007. The third extension was
from December 31, 2007 to February 28, 2008. All three extensions of project closing date were
necessary to enable the Project team to finalize the restructuring package for the Board's
approval since it was difficult to reach an agreement with GoG on the package. These frequent
and short extensions demonstrated the complexity of the issues, coupled with challenging
political environment of the project. The restructuring package was finally completed and
proposed an eighteen months extension of the project closing date, from February 28, 2007 to
December 31, 2009.

2.         Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1        Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Lessons from Earlier Operations

Key lessons from the past Bank projects' were taken into account while designing the project as
follows: (i) ensured that there was enough policy engagement at the highest level of Government
to get commitment that guaranteed sustainability of results. The Project team made sure that
reliable policy environment existed to support project activities, in particular, the DP and Export
Processing Zones (EPZ)8. There was an open dialogue with the Government and appropriate
policies and institutions were created to promote trade and investment in the Gambia, as well as
participatory consultations with stakeholders of the DP; (ii) based on experience of the few EPZs


8
  Many African Government ­ Mauritius, Senegal and Cameroun failed to implement FZ because eof policy related matters such as unsafe
business environment, cumbersome regulatory procedures, and insufficient institutional structures to support the FZ, labor market rigidities, poor
infrastructure and high cost of doing business.




                                                                        8
in Africa, an important lesson was that private-public partnership (PPP) brings about effective
management of an EPZ. In this regard, the design included activities to recruit technical
assistance to promote PPP; (iii) with a weak institutional capacity within both, the Government
and the private sector, the project was designed with a dedicated component to capacity building.
Therefore, the Project addressed policy and institutional reforms by supporting the creation and
financing of GIPFZA and supported GDA by providing training to increase institutional capacity
and knowledge of private sector participation in transport, energy and telecommunication
services. In addition, there was an active participation and consultation with other development
partners engaged in economic programs e.g. United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
IMF, European Union (EU) and African Development Bank (AfDB).

2.1.2 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures

The Project was rated moderate for overall risk. The Bank team took the establishment of GDA
as a strong commitment to implementation of the DP but should have still identified and flagged
the possibilities of GoG's reduced commitment to the DP as high risk and would have been able
to make provision for mitigation measures or proceed more cautiously with the DP component.
In addition, the Bank team also underestimated the risk of weak capacity in project management,
in particular, lack of overall leadership and financial management skills. This risk was rated
moderate while it should have been rated high because it took GoG a while to identify a Project
Coordinator.

2.1.3 Participatory Process

During project preparation, frequent discussions and meetings were held with Department of
State for Trade, Industry and Employment (DOSTIE) and Department of State for Finance and
Economic Affairs (DOSFEA) on key issues affecting the design of the components. A one day
seminar with Trade Gateway stakeholder was held in June 2000. It successfully brought together
125 participants from both public and private sector. The Gambia Divestiture Act of 2001 was
approved by Parliament and the President after an intensive consultation with its key
stakeholders after which the GDA was established indicating GoG's strong commitment to the
Divestiture Program. It however seemed that the discussions did not address the social impact
issues of the program because resistance emerged during implementation of the DP.
The Project launch workshop took place in October 2002 with high level representation from the
Government9, civil society, development partners and the private sector to discuss the project
and its role in supporting the overall economic program of the country. The Bank's Regional
Director was also in attendance. A two day workshop was held to familiarize the stakeholders
on Bank Funded Project Management. The workshop covered Bank procedures in procurement,
disbursement and financial management. The project aide memoires indicated that Bank and
other development partners10 maintained a constant dialogue to ensure that assistance provided to
the trade, investment and private sector development were supportive and complimentary.

9
  Six Ministers attended the workshop: Ministers of Finance, Works, Construction and Infrastructure, Foreign Affairs, Trade, Industry and
Employment, Communication and Information Technology, Tourism and Culture.

10
     In particular, EU which is providing assistance in the groundnut sector,




                                                                           9
Despite a reasonable level of consultation with the stakeholders of the projects components, an
important aspect of the DP was not properly presented and thus led to resistance during
implementation. In this regard, the level of participation in project preparation is rated
moderately satisfactory.
2.1.4 Quality at Entry

The project's overall concept was sound and conformed to the Vision 2020, I-PRSP and the CAS
of 1997. The project did not undergo quality at entry assessment but was cleared for Board
approval. There was adequate level of analytical work undertaken including participatory
discussions with key stakeholders although social analyses on the impact of DP's stakeholders
were not performed. In this regard the resistance in implementing the DP by some of the
stakeholders did not have adequate mitigation measures. In this regard, quality at entry is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

2.2        Implementation

2.2.1      Overview

The project took place over a period of more than 7 years, from effectiveness in September 2002
to closing in December 2009. The project disbursed 100 percent of the allocated project cost of
SDR 12.4 million. This translated to US$18.3 million equivalent, 14 percent higher than the
estimated US$16.0 million equivalent at appraisal due to the fluctuations of the SDR exchange
rate over the years. Ministry of Trade, Industry and Employment (former DOSTIE) was the line
ministry for the implementing agency ­ GIPFZA. Implementation arrangements were at two
levels; Project Coordination Committee (PCC) and two implementing agencies GIPFZA and
GDA. A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) was to be created under DOSTIE. The PCU was not
created and the PCC was not meeting as required. As a result, the two implementing agencies
executed their own activities independently of each other. This fragmentation of responsibilities
was not effective as it created delays in decision making resulting into a rather slow
implementation performance. After the midterm review, GIPFZA was made the PCU and its
CEO as the Project Coordinator. This revised coordination arrangement proved useful to the
Project but less effective to GIPFZA as the staff of GIPFZA got fully involved in project
management activities and somehow paid less attention to their other responsibilities and
mandate (e.g. promoting private investment in the country). Project leadership was characterized
by frequent changes and lack of leadership on both sides, (CEOs and Bank Task Team Leaders
(TTL)), causing delays in decision making during the several transition periods and in some
instances even reversal of decisions11.

Since 2002, the project activities were concentrated on the physical progress of the FZ
construction and related infrastructure. Therefore, most of the disbursement was under the civil
works component with a satisfactory rating. By Mid-Term Review (MTR) in 2005,
implementation progress stagnated as the Government's commitment towards divestiture was
unclear and none of the 15 SOEs were divested as scheduled. It was suggested by the Bank to

11
  A decision to recruit a national private developer for the Free Zone was reversed by an incoming TTL disregarding the advanced stage of the
recruitment and some consultancies were discontinued resulting into the project paying for termination of contract costs.




                                                                      10
close the component but GoG insisted on maintaining it mainly for political reasons. At this
point, the PDO and the implementation progress (IP) ratings were downgraded to moderately
satisfactory. This rating was further confirmed by the Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA)
which judged the overall project performance as moderately satisfactory. The QSA identified
weaknesses in financial management, lack of proper Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system
and lack of decision making on the part of the Bank on the divestiture component. It further
stated that the Bank was overly optimistic on the ratings of satisfactory on the project
performance prior to 2006. At this point, it was recommended that GoG be notified that if APL
1 is unsatisfactory, the project will not be able to proceed to APL 2. However, the project
continued to encounter difficulties and was rated moderately unsatisfactory between June 2006
and December 2007 due to disagreement on the way forward, by both, the Bank and GoG.

Implementation progress improved after the Bank re-engaged GoG with revamped leadership
that intensified dialogue involving the World Bank Liaison Office in Banjul. As a result, the
restructuring package was quickly finalized and approved by the Board on March 19, 2008. The
improved performance that emerged up to the end of the project was due to intensified
supervision by the Dakar-based Bank team which included frequent supervision, as well as
reversed missions12. The project did not benefit from the existence of the Project Steering
Oversight Committee which was neither proactive nor dynamic thus deprived the project from
the much needed policy guidance during difficult periods at implementation. Furthermore, the
M&E system was weak and improved when the project was restructured and GIPFZA had its
own strategic plan which provided indicators coupled with the inputs from an M&E specialist, a
revised M&E framework was developed. This was later complemented by an intensive workshop
during a supervision mission in 2008 lead by a Senior M&E specialist. In addition, the Project
was formally re-categorized from APL to a Specific Investment Lending (SIL) since the APL
instrument was no longer practical (project could not meet all of the performance indicators to
trigger APL 2) and did not correspond to the lending priorities of the 2008 CAS.

2.2.2        Midterm Review (MTR)

The MTR of May 2005 was well prepared and an issues paper was available to guide
discussions. The review found the PDO still valid but expressed concern on substantial delays in
implementation of key tasks including getting possession of FZ site, recruitment of private
developer for the business park, difficulties in getting water and power supply for the site and
lack of progress in important components like the DP. By MTR, the project had met three out of
six PDO KPIs, with disbursements amounting to thirty percent of the Credit. The Bank then
downgraded the project ratings to moderately satisfactory, recommended in-depth restructuring
and set up an action plan which would improve implementation but concerns about the
inadequate alignment of the project with the capacity of the beneficiaries remained. Following a
three-year long and difficult dialogue between the Bank and GoG, the recommended
restructuring at MTR with some modification took place in March 2008.

2.2.3        Restructuring as response to effective implementation

     to the World Bank Regional Office in Senegal.




                                                     11
The Bank modified the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) three times to extend the Project
closing date to finalize the restructuring package for the project. The fourth change of the DCA
was substantial as it amended (a) Article 1 to include GGC; (b) Article II to change project
closing date to December 2009; (c) Article III to properly define execution of the project and
Article IV on the financial covenants; (d) Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Credit);
(e) Schedule 2 (description of the Project) and (f) Schedule 5 (Performance Indicators). The main
constraint was the unsatisfactory performance of Component 3 Support to the GDA. There was
lack of action on the component due to lacked of commitment and political will form GoG to
support implementation of recommendations made from the numerous consultancy reports
undertaken under the project. It was therefore, necessary to close the component. Under the
original project design, it was envisaged that both the GDA and the GIPFZA would implement
the Project. With the closing of the GDA component, GIPFZA became the PCU for the Project.

The PDO rating therefore was further downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory in June 2006 and
remained the same until after the restructuring in March 19, 2008. In June 2008, the project
performance had improved with a 75 percent disbursement rate and both PDO and IP were
upgraded to moderately satisfactory. However, by December 2008, the Project dropped back to
its moderately unsatisfactory rating due to concerns about the timely payment of rents by the
enterprises in the Business Park until the end of the project when it was upgraded to marginal
satisfactory with a disbursement rate of 91 percent and progress on the operation of the Business
Park and on PDO KPIs. This disbursement rate reached 100% after the closing date when all
eligible expenditures were processed and paid during the grace period.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3. 1 M&E design.

M&E was scheduled to be done by the PCC under DOSTIE which was later transferred to
GIPFZA after it became the PCU for the project. Between 2002 and 2006, complete project
progress reports were not issued due to the unclear institutional responsibilities. The PCC did
not have a dedicated Project Coordinator under DOSTIE to handle project matters. In addition,
some of the PDO indicators, such as capacity building, were not reported while some indicators
were deemed too broad and thus could have been difficult to measure the level of achievement.
As for the revised Result Framework, two PDO indicators were removed since they were related
to FZ concept which was replaced with that of a Business Park and due to difficulties of
measuring project's attribution to the export earnings of the country. These were: (i) export
earnings from the FZ and (ii) average clearance time for FZ related cargoes are reduced to 1 day.
The Bank and GoG had planned to conduct at least two full supervision missions per year. In
this regard, the design of M&E and its implementation arrangement is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

2.3.2   M&E implementation

During project implementation, it became obvious that the M&E framework was weak and not
fully developed and therefore difficult to track overall implementation progress and measure
outcomes and impacts for all the components. Despite the weaknesses, there was adequate



                                               12
information and data on some of the components which GIPFZA was directly involved. Data
collected by GIPFZA was based on its own activities with heavy reliance on the information
provided through Special Investment Certificate (SIC)13. Data from employment creation was
verified by GIPFZA through on-site visits to the firms and by data from the social security
agency of The Gambia. The Result Framework in the Implementation Status Report (ISR) was
frequently updated after every mission and in some occasions M&E was rated unsatisfactory but
no solution was provided to improve the situation. Some PDO indicators, such as capacity
building, investment promotion activities, and environmental impact were not reported on.
Progress reports on the project became available only after GIPFZA became the PCU and some
were sent to the Bank and comments/feedback was sporadically provided. During the
restructuring of the project in 2008, the Result Framework were revised through a one week
participatory process to adjust achieved targets upwards, provide focus and ensure measureable
indicators while identifying the responsible staff within GIPFZA. To further facilitate M&E, a
day's training was provided to GIPFZA staff on "Managing for Results". In this regard, M&E
implementation is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

2.3.3      M&E utilization

The Project team continuously reported on project performance indicators in the ISRs,
commenting on the quality of the data as good. By MTR only four out of fourteen KPIs were
met representing 28 percent. The Bank used these results to down grade the PDO rating to
moderately satisfactory. The revisions of the indicators at project restructuring reflected the
reductions in the scope of the project components (as two were dropped and one was added),
along with an extension of the target dates for achievement (project closing date). Most of the
changes involved output indicators and the project team updated them in the ISRs. The project
provided a space for learning by doing and innovation ­ which not only strengthened the overall
M&E framework, but also increased GIPFZA's commitment to, and ownership of, the process.
GIPFZA was encouraged to utilize the M&E reports as a management tool by sharing the
information with its senior management. These reports, although not regularly produced, were
distributed to some of its stakeholders including the Bank and its Board of Directors. Following
the restructuring, M&E was utilized more satisfactorily to make critical decisions during the
remaining period of project implementation. In this regard the overall rating for M&E is
moderately satisfactory.

2.4        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1      Environmental and Social Safeguards.

The Project complied with the Bank's safeguards policies set forth in OP 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment). The project was categorized as "A" meaning full environmental impact
assessments would be required for all activities to be located at the FZ/Business Park. Under the
guidance of the Environmental Specialists of the Bank, an ESMP was prepared during project

13
   The SIC provided information on (i) amounts of intended investment into the country, (ii) quantities and type of imported capital goods and
jobs creation. GIPFZA conducted on-site visits to verify information. FDI flows data correspond to that of UNCTAD data reports e.g. World
Investment Report 2008 and IMF Article IV Consultation Tables.




                                                                       13
preparation and was reviewed and adopted at a national workshop in August 2001. An MoU on
the implementation of its recommendations was signed in January 2002 between NEA and
GIPFZA to ensure that there was maximum cooperation with regard to FZ activities. The
management of the MoU eventually became smooth and NEA was free to inspect regularly and
provide comments on the activities of the FZ and other projects registered by GIPFZA.
Moreover, GoG had taken steps to implement the action plan including (i) an addendum to the
tender documents of the industrial park covering pollution control, health, safety, and source of
raw materials, and (ii) agreement on the fencing of the Abuko buffer zone/nature reserve.

The fencing of the Abuko nature reserve was the Project's biggest intervention in the ESMP, and
it was carried out in collaboration with its primary beneficiary (the Department of Parks and
Wildlife Management). The construction of high quality fence in a timely manner resulted in a
positive impact on the surrounding communities. By fencing the park, more land was freed for
the use by the neighboring households, bringing about more security in the community and its
visitors, while restricting human encroachment into the nature reserve.

As prescribed in the MoU, the Gateway Project provided technical training to NEA and GIPFZA
staff for proper handling of environmental and social safeguards measures. The training was
satisfactory as GIPFZA felt adequately prepared to identify environmental issues and refer them
to NEA. However, the Project team conducted spot checks to ensure that environmental issues
were being appropriately addressed as they held consultations with NEA. An environmental
specialist was included in the Task Team during project preparation but not during project
supervision except for the last supervision mission of December 200914. Nonetheless, as good
practice, and considering the amount of infrastructure built and rehabilitated under the Project, it
would have been prudent if an environmental specialist participated throughout supervision to
facilitate proactive attention to environmental issues and verify compliance.

Overall, the Project had a positive social impact through the attraction of investment and
employment creation, including improved access to new roads and electricity for nearby
communities15. Where potential social issues were identified, GIPFZA tried to engage in
dialogue with members of the affected community and the responsible agencies to discuss and
agree on an appropriate resolution16. In this regard, environmental and social safeguards
compliance is rated satisfactory.

2.4.2       Financial Management

The Project generally complied with the financial covenants stated in the loan agreement but
with some recurrent delays in submission of the Audit Reports (2004 and 2008). However, the

14
   The mission's findings were encouraging except for the health, safety and security standards at the GGC and industrial park which needed
some follow up by NEA and GIPFZA.

15
     Abuko, Sukuta and Yundum

16
   This was the case of Kuloro Free Zone where almost 260 ha were allocated to GIPFZA and the community refused to release 60 ha to GIPFZA.
The Kuloro Free Zone was not supported by the project. There might be a possibility of triggering the safeguard on resettlement on
this land acquisition.




                                                                      14
final overall financial management performance was rated moderately satisfactory after some
improvements were noted towards the end of the project. The Project, with critical support from
the Bank improved its financial compliance which included collection of Business Park rental
fees to GIPFZA and liquidation of all debts on behalf of FZ tenants17. Although the 2008 Audit
Report was submitted with substantial delays, the auditors issued an unqualified certification on
the financial statements, including the statement of expenditures and special account payments.
According to the auditors, the financial statements gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the project, and its surplus and cash flow statement for the year ended 31st December 2008.
Generally, the financial management system had moderate capacity shortcomings18 but these did
not materially affect the system's capacity to provide timely and reliable information for the
management and monitoring of the Project. The Project was able to meet its two important
performance indicators i.e. it maintained monthly withdrawal disbursement and the financial
audits were all unqualified. Therefore, the financial management system was, in general, deemed
adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the Bank loan proceeds were being used for the
intended purposes. Taking account of the financial performance of the project over the 7 years
and 3 months, the project financial management is rated moderately satisfactory.

2.4.3         Procurement Management

Overall performance of the procurement function under the Project was satisfactory despite the
challenges it encountered. Once it was agreed that GIPFZA would be responsible for all
procurement matters of the project, its performance improved. Information was always available
including (i) updated procurement plans; (ii) the procurement progress monitoring reports; and
(iii) procurement implementation plans. Initially, the Project encountered a number of
challenges including: (a) lack of familiarity with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines by
beneficiaries; (b) difficulties and delays in the preparation of the standard bidding documents due
largely to lack of capacity to develop detailed engineering designs and the bill of quantities; (c)
lack of understanding of standards for evaluating and evaluation became a tedious process; (d)
there were considerable number of failed bids (therefore requiring re-bids that magnified delays
in implementation); and (e) in many instances, few number of bidders participated in the
procurement process even if packages were advertised nationwide. Despite all these initial
challenges, the Project did not compromise the integrity of the procurement process. All Project
procurement processes and activities were planned and completed before the Project closing date
of December 31, 2009. One exception was made for the financial audit for the year 2009, which
can only be started following the closing of the Project and the completion of all its payments.
The procurement training provided by the Project and the quality and close supervision of the
Task Team significantly helped identify potential mis-procurement and corrective measures were
provided on time. In this regard, taking account of the procurement performance of the project
over the 7 years and 3 months period, the project procurement management is rated moderately
satisfactory.

Based on the low performance of the APL I and lack of signs of successfully achieving APL II
triggers, the project was changed from an APL to a SIL. The Bank is following up on the
Gateway Project with a Growth and Competitiveness Project (GCP) SIL that builds on some of
the positive outcomes gained and responds to increasing demand for diversification of export
oriented economic activities and employment creation. Resources from the Gateway Project
were used for the preparation of the GCP, which is expected to be approved by the World Bank
Board in late 2010.

A key lesson learnt from the Gateway Project was the absence a dedicated PCU. Therefore, the
designers of the GCP were compelled to create a PCU from project preparation to be reporting
directly to the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development (MEPID). In this
regard, some project management capacity built within GIPFZA will be transferred to the
GCP/PCU. GoG has decided to dissolve GIPFZA and create another more comprehensive
agency which will be responsible for investment and export promotion, FZs development and
SMEs, in line with the Gambia Investment and Export Promotion Act passed in Parliament in
April 2010. The assets of GIPFZA will be passed to the new Gambia Investment and Export
Promotion Agency (GIEPA) but the staff will have the option to competitively apply for the new
positions in GIEPA.

Since 2004, GoG had been trying to engage a private developer for the Business Park at Yundum
Airport. Upon completion of the pilot structures and infrastructure in 2007, GIPFZA intensified
its efforts including road shows to targeted countries and firms. Negotiations are currently
ongoing and could be concluded by end of June 2010. Meanwhile GIPFZA is managing the
Business Park including its upkeep and earning revenues from the tenants located in the park.

As for the support provided to GGC, the understanding was to find a private partner to manage
the company so that the required additional investment could be made to ensure that the gains
received this year are sustainable and permanent. The GoG assured the Bank that the policy has
not changed even though the agreed divestiture roadmap will take longer than envisaged.
Continued support is planned under the GCP.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

One of the pillars of the Government's overall economic strategy at the time of project
preparation was to support private sector development and employment creation. These goals
were compatible with the Bank's CAS of 1998 as described in the two prong strategy: (i) more
rapid, broad-based, export oriented sustained growth; and (ii) social sustainability.

The objectives supported by this project are still relevant with the Government's economic
policies and the Bank's 2008 Joint-CAS (JAS). As stated in the JAS, the Gateway Project
supported Pillar Two: Enhancing Growth and Competitiveness and Productive capacity of the
Poor; in particular, promoted a Competitive Investment Climate/Growth and Competitiveness of
the Gambia. While some of the instruments or policy styles may have shifted with the change in



                                              16
government operating environment (e.g. DP, APL) including tough global economic
environment, the GoG continued to pursue trade creation and facilitation, FZs creation and
investment promotion as some of its major sources of income, and growth of employment.

The goals of the Gateway Project in terms of institutional and private sector development were
clear but ambitious in the context of the Gambian economy and political environment. The
design of the components was appropriate at the time as the project was intended to support
establishment of a FZ at the airport; support the establishment of GIPFZA; support the DP
through GDA; build institutional capacity of key stakeholders, both public and private
institutions; and project management with environmental activities. When it became clear that
GoG was no longer supportive of the DP, the component was closed and GDA was dissolved.
The diagnosis contained in the PAD was adequate as it identified the key issues that needed to be
addressed through policy reforms, institutional changes, and support to the private sector. For
these reasons, the overall relevance of this project is rated as high.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

As designed during project preparation, the linkages of the Project's outputs to outcomes
occurred first, through institutional strengthening of the participating agencies and second,
through their project-specific activities in assisting the investors establish in the country and
enter their respective export markets. Project funds were disbursed at an average rate of 12
percent per annum, which enabled the completion of the infrastructure and civil works under the
project within 4 years. In addition, the Project was able to have a positive impact from
improvements in the institutional building and strengthening (GIPFZA, GGC), as well as from
other non-project related factors that may also have influenced export earnings, while the private
sector development impact is more likely to occur in the medium- to long-term. However, the
magnitude of the impact in both cases could be tempered by the current global economic
downturn and financial crisis which have notably curtailed the volume of investment flows into
the country.

PDO Outcome Indicators

The project achieved most of its PDO despite delays in restructuring. By December 2008, after
project restructuring, the ISR stated that the revised PDO KPIs would be achieved and by project
closing date on December 31, 2009 most of the revised PDO KPIs have been achieved and/or
surpassed. This conclusion is justified through the revised and strengthened M&E arrangement
carried out by GIPFZA. By the end of the project, three intermediate outcome indicators were
fully achieved while the fourth was partially achieved due to the delays in recruiting a private
master developer for the Business Park. However, since the completed 8.8 acres out of 160 acres
was a pilot, three firms are currently located and operating in the park and created 200 jobs
resulting into a 75 percent achievement of the indicator. The original PDO KPIs under the APL
were revised upwards during the restructuring (see Table 2).

Two PDO indicators were dropped at restructuring due to change of concepts from that of a Free
Zone to one of a Business Park: These were (i) achievement of annual ton and value targets for
the FZs and (ii) Average customs clearance time for FZ related cargoes is reduced to 1 day. The

two performance indicators for the closed component ­Support to GDA were also dropped.
These were: (i) the divestiture of telecom and transport enterprises. The telecom enterprise
GAMTEL was privatized without the assistance of the project in 2007; and (ii) none were

divested from the transport sector, instead, GPA was obliged to repossess a divested Shipyard
from the private sector due to lack of satisfactory performance. With a new component on
support to Groundnut sector was added, its performance indicators were partially achieved.
These were (i) divestiture strategy is approved by cabinet which was achieved; and (ii) the
preparation of a performance-based management contract for GGC which was not achieved due
to delays in completion of technical and financial audits for GGC. Quantitative performance
indicators were not selected as performance in the sector is highly dependent on good rains.

The PDO was "... to lay a foundation for expanded private investment, export-oriented
production and employment...." And therefore, project outcome indicators under the APL and
before restructuring was defined in terms of increase in private investment measured as
percentage of GDP; expanding export-oriented production measured by increases in earnings of
export revenues and generating employment measured as number of new direct jobs created due
to increased investment and production in the various economic sectors in the country. In sum,
the logic was to use the increased private investment as a catalyst to generate export-oriented
production from manufacturing, agriculture and tourism sectors which would in turn create
sustainable employment. The causal linkages between outputs and outcomes were well
established in the original Project's log frame and the revised result framework which was
confirmed through M&E reporting arrangements.
                                           19
Expanded Private Investment : GIPFZA, with the support from the Gateway Project, has been
able to attract private investment from all over the world. This was done through outward and
inward missions, promotional tours and service facilitation to investors in the country. At least
60 percent of the investors were of foreign origin while 40 percent were Gambians. Most of the
private investment projects took place between 2004 and 2007 reaching over US$50 million in
2005. The Total proposed investment was US$360 million but only US$212 million was actually
invested in the country. The original end of project target for private investment under the APL
was already surpassed in 2004 ($39 million). At restructuring in 2007, the amount of 20    private
investment in the country was US$120 million with an FDI average of 16 percent of GDP .

As intended in the GoG PSD Strategy, export oriented production sectors have been attracted to
the country and thus promoting the goal of diversification of the economy. A total of 97 projects
were registered through GIPFZA and 58 firms are operational in the Gambia of which only three
are located in the Business Park/FZ. Out of the 97 registered firms, the majority are in the
manufacturing sector with 35 percent of total projects, followed by the agriculture sector at 18
percent and the tourism sector at 15 percent. The APL PDO indicator was estimating at least
US$36 million of export earnings by the end of the Project. However, this indicator was dropped
during restructuring. The overall export earnings for The Gambia were21recorded at US$81
million for 2005, US$84 million for 2006 and US$76 million for 2008 respectively. This
indicator would have been difficult to measure due to attribution issues. However, 17 percent of
revenue earnings are normally from the agricultural sector, 35 percent from tourism and 18
percent from re-export trade.

           Employment creation is concerned, 4,605 new jobs have been created between 2002
As far as 22
and 2009 . Projects under operation and those in preparation reached their peak in 2005, with
more than 1,500 jobs created and US$59 million of investment. The agriculture sector, which
has always been an important sector in The Gambia, received 13.5 percent of total investment
and created almost 800 new jobs representing 18 percent of total jobs created. Tourism received
21.6 percent and generated 22 percent of total new jobs at 993, while the Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) sector which received a lion share of the investment at 34.5
percent only generated 7 percent of total new jobs at 340. This indicator was modified to include
all jobs created due to new private investments in the country assisted through GIPFZA.
Although the Industrial Park was completed in 2006, most private investors chose to be given
their own land for multipurpose use.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

The intermediate outcome indicators as shown in Table 2 above suggest a positive relationship
between the project outputs and achievement of the development objectives. A few of the
indicators were not measurable as defined in the PAD and were removed to be consistent with
the revised Result Framework.           The affected intermediate outcome indicators were:
establishment of a privately financed teleport, quality management audit of the Customs &
Excise Department23, divestiture of Track I and II enterprises and number of trained enterprises,
both public and private under the project. The Gateway Project made a reasonable contribution
to the sustainability of institutional environment which would enable continued attraction and
retention of private investment in the country. The support provided to GIPFZA was significant.
This achievement is however threatened by the closure of GIPFZA in June 2010 even though a
new institution will be created to replace it. The key contributions from project outputs to the
achievement of development objectives are summarized below:




22
     Potential of new job creation is 13,062 if the intended investments of US$360.38 million materialize.

23
     The Customs reform work was implemented under Economic Management and Capacity Building Project (EMCB project)




                                                                         22
 (i)    Key infrastructure near the airport was completed and the Business Park has been
        operational since 2008. Three tenants occupy the existing warehouses and pay rent
        which is deemed sufficient to cover the operational costs of GIPFZA. The existence of
        the first FZ encouraged other private investors to seek their own land to develop the same
        concept. The second FZ at Kuloro specializes in agricultural products.
(ii)    Technical assistance provided was able to expedite GIPFZA's establishment and was
        operational throughout the duration of the project. With the support provided under the
        project, GIPFZA was able to promote and attract investment into the country and was
        able to provide licenses to foreign and national investors and facilitated their registration
        within a short period. In this case, most investments were able to materialize within a
        reasonable period.
(iii)   Support to GGC was timely, in particular, the rehabilitation of the plant and equipment.
        This resulted in substantial improvements in its operational and financial situation. GGC
        has been able to increase the volume of groundnut crop it has handled from 6,000 Metric
        Tons (MT) in 2007 to 20,000 MT in 2008 and 35,000 MT in 2009 groundnut seasons.
(iv)    There were substantial improvements in project coordination and management,
        particularly in procurement resulting in sustainable institutional strengthening.
 (v)    The monitoring and implementation of the ESMP was satisfactory and had a positive
        impact on the communities around the Abuko Nature Reserve.

Based on the modest effectiveness of project outputs and the positive contribution to outcomes
including the expected medium-term impact from greater private sector investments, export-
oriented production and employment creation, the achievement of development objectives is
rated as moderately satisfactory. This rating does recognize instances of lost opportunities
primarily in the area of private sector participation in the DP, poor implementation performance
during prior to restructuring and absence of a private master developer for the Business Park.

3.3     Efficiency

Overall, the economic returns were at 16.8 percent at the end of the project with a Net Present
Value (NPV) of US$ 25.2 million which is more than what was estimated at appraisal due to
favorable FDI inflows. These benefits would have been more if the Business Park were fully
occupied and generating more export products. The benefits in the analysis were those accrued
form foreign exchange earnings and FDI flows. The benefits from institutional capacity building
were not included in the calculations. The job generation benefit was estimated at 3,000 direct
jobs by 2017 but this target was already surpassed by 25 percent at year seven.

The quality of output contributes to project efficiency. The participating agencies were in
general satisfied with the work performed by the consultants and with the quality of the
equipment purchased. GIPFZA as the PCU thoroughly reviewed all bids for consultant services
and for equipment purchases as revealed by the Bank's procurement evaluations. However,
some of the studies, such as those dealing with divestiture, yielded information that was never
put into effective use. The non performance of the DP and its closure after the 2008
restructuring and the lack of a private developer for the Business Park represent an opportunity
lost in the form of time and resources for the project. Based on these experiences of the project,
efficiency is considered to be only moderately satisfactory.

3.4           Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The development objectives of the Gateway Project remained relevant to GoG's priorities and
continue to be consistent with the JAS. The Project showed reasonable achievements of its
development objectives as demonstrated by the revised KPIs which were mostly fully met. It
enabled GIPFZA to attract US$212 million of private investment which surpassed its target by
18 percent and also surpassed its second PDO KPI of enabling the creation of new firms in the
country by 42 percent. It further surpassed its third PDO KPI by 15 percent. The Project also
satisfactorily achieved its fourth PDO KPI by making it easier for new investments to be
approved for SICs within a period of 4 weeks instead of 6 weeks. GIPFZA and the Public
Utilities Regulatory Agency (PURA) were established and are fully functional, while NEA was
further strengthened by support from the Gateway Project. GDA was closed after the DP was
discontinued by GoG. However, two project components: Support to Divestiture and Capacity
Building for GIPFZA and GDA, were closed due to lack of progress in implementation and the
new component Preparatory work for the support of Divestiture of the Groundnut sector,
partially achieved its performance targets. At the same time, the support provided to GGC was
able to increase its production capacity and thus revamped the groundnut sector by purchasing
several years' record high volume of groundnuts from the farmers who benefited from improved
services and prices. In addition, there have been an expression of interest from private investors
in GGC and the Business Park is under negotiations with a potential private developer. These
developments are encouraging as they would solve governance issues i.e. management of the
park and incentives for new firms to sustain outcomes of the project. The project was able to
disburse as much as 11424 percent of the credit proceeds and achieve a higher NPV than foreseen
at appraisal. Finally, the Gateway Project showed that, in general, the use of resources was
efficiently utilized. In this regard, the overall outcome of the Project is rated moderately
satisfactory.

3.5           Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)           Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty impacts and social development was one of the outcomes from the Gateway Project.
The 4605 new jobs created from the 97 new projects from private investments, resulted into a
positive impact to many households in the Greater Banjul Area. The benefits of job creation
cannot be overemphasized especially when more than half of the population of the country is
young. Reduction of income poverty is very important, in particular, for the women who care
for the whole family. As demonstrated under section 3.2 above, most of the investments were in
ICT, manufacturing and tourism where higher education and technical skills are prerequisites for
employment. Moreover, diversification of the economy is happening as most of the investment
was devoted to non-traditional sectors e.g. ICT and tourism. The fencing of Abuko Nature
Reserve Park was seen to have positive impact to the neighboring community as it brought

24
     Due to fluctuation of the dollar against SDR.




                                                     24
increased security and safety from the animals in the Park. Support to GGC created additional
employment opportunities at the Denton Bridge Depot, resulting in a greater demand for
transport and double shifts for which most of the workers are female.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

GIPFZA. The Gateway Project was successful in establishing GIPFZA. By Project closing,
GIPFZA was fully operational and functioned as an investment promoter, a facilitator for new
investments, and an industrial park manager and was later made the PCU of the Gambia
Gateway Project. The agency was well equipped with IT infrastructure and had a complement of
15 staff who received relevant training to develop their capacity to effectively carry out their
functions as experts in investment promotion and project management. Although its
performance declined towards the end of the project, GIPFZA exceeded the revised key
performance indicators set under the Project. Based on data provided by GIPFZA, US$212
million of private investment through 97 new projects were generated creating 4,605 new jobs
between 2002 and 2009. After the Gateway Project, the GoG provided budgetary support to
GIPFZA which will soon be transformed into a new agency called Gambia Investment and
Export Promotion Agency (GIEPA). The new agency will build on GIPFZA's assets and
institutional capacity.

GDA received technical assistance from the Project for privatization and completion of
transactions. However, due to lack of leadership, staff and technical capacity, it could not
implement its mandate. After the Project was restructured in 2008, the GDA component was
dropped and GDA was subsequently dissolved.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

GPPA: Due to the excellent capacity built in procurement, GIPFZA had been a point of
reference for many activities including collaboration with the Gambia Public Procurement
Agency (GPPA) and Auditor General's Office. The terms of reference prepared by the project
for GGC's financial auditing has been adopted by the Auditor General's Office as a template for
all general public auditing consultancies. The Procurement Specialist for the project worked
closely with GPPA to deliver a workshop on procurement reforms for the Gambia, which was
financed by the project and received support from the World Bank procurement team.

GGC: For the project to assist GGC in rehabilitating the oil storage tanks the Bank requested that
the assets be registered under GGC's name and this led GGC to fully understand the importance
of registering all its assets. As a consequence, GGC has now registered its assets and the
practice of assets registration is spreading as a good practice.

N/A.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome




                                               25
Rating: High

The Gateway Project provided financing for physical infrastructure of the Business Park at the
airport (US$6.50 million). However, how the Business Park will be managed and sustained is a
risk. By Project closing date, GoG had yet to conclude the negotiations with a private master
developer selected to take over the management of the park. Since GIPFZA will soon cease to
exist as of June 30, 2010, the transitioning mechanism on the management of the park to GIEPA
need to be clearer25. In this regard, the future of the park, which accounted for almost 40 percent
of credit proceeds, is not lucid, thus making the risk of maintaining the development outcome
achieved on establishing the park for industrial development riskier. The Project EIRR shows a
lower rate than at appraisal if it's further reduced it will make the investment uneconomical to
the country. In this regard, the risk to development outcome is rated high.

5.           Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1           Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The Bank's performance at identification, preparation and appraisal of the project was
acceptable. The Project was consistent with the Government's development priorities and the
Bank's CAS. In addition, the Bank also covered an in-depth analysis of the economy, trade
logistics and the EPZ concept, institutional, including public enterprise sector and the DP. The
Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all major relevant aspects, such as
technical, economic, environmental, institutional and fiduciary aspects. As mentioned in section
2.1, there was adequate level of dialogue and participation with the stakeholders including other
development partners. However, as stated in section 2.3.1, project preparation did not pay too
much attention on implementation arrangements and M&E framework to measure the
performance of all activities e.g., there was no indicator for capacity building. Major lessons
learned from earlier projects in the Gambia, were considered and incorporated into the project
design. As for the risk, some were underestimated, in particular, GoG's attitude towards the DP.
In this regard, the quality at entry is rated as moderately satisfactory.

(b)          Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the 7 years of project implementation was mixed but improved
substantially towards the end 2007. There were periods when the project was inadequately
supervised coupled with a period without a dedicated TTL and a long spell of lack of field visits.
There was a high turnover of task managers (four in total) during the first five years of project
implementation which disrupted continuity of dialogue with the Borrower and interrupted quality

     The Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development is in charge of the transition arrangements with a dedicated official identified.




                                                                         26
of supervision. Aide-memoires were prepared after missions and the performance of the project
was updated in the ISRs. However, both the PDO and IP performance were initially
unrealistically rated in the ISRs as they were rated satisfactory irrespective of the many issues
stated in the aide memoires and their lack of follow up to get immediate solutions. The
restructuring of the project was delayed and due to lack of agreement on way forward. To show
proactivity the Bank team prepared a Quality at Entry Review Paper for discussions with a panel
which included management but it did not resolve the issues at hand due to several factors
including a difficult political environment and governance issues.

From late 2007, the TTL was based in the Dakar Country office and provided the project with a
continuous and solid team leadership, established and improved dialogue both at the project level
and with the key Ministries. With the proximity of the TTL, project supervision was intensified
with frequent and reversed missions. Once the project was restructured, the entire task team re-
engaged with the project and gave it the needed impetus to achieve its full development
objective. The review of procurement of goods and works was done in accordance with the
provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Likewise, the review on financial management became regular and effectively monitored
through the provision of Financial Management Reports (FMRs). Despite the concerted efforts
by the end of the project, tough governance issues and poor performance throughout the first five
years must be considered against this very positive drive later in the project. Therefore, overall
Bank performance during supervision is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the fact that Bank support, even with its shortcomings, was crucial in the project
achieving an overall moderately satisfactory outcome, overall Bank Performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

GoG was initially committed and showed ownership of the Gateway Project. During
implementation, there were too many changes of head of ministries and three CEOs for GIPFZA
which affected the rate of decision making and implementation performance. Several times, the
Bank was required to take a leadership role in making the case for the Project and ensuring that
the authorities resolved critical implementation barriers including collection of rent from the
Business park tenants. The Government changed its interest in the DP and institutional support
to GDA; therefore, restructuring of the project became unavoidable. However, reaching a
consensus on the way forward proved difficult. In addition, the Project Oversight Committee did
not perform its role of providing guidance to the Project during implementation resulting into a
poor performance towards reaching the project objectives.



                                               27
At the later stages of the Project, there was a renewed interest in the Project, and the line ministry
became highly supportive. With the new interest in the project, most of the KPIs were achieved
leading to substantial achievements towards the KPIs as demonstrated in the Result Framework.
However, the renewed interest across a broad base of Government actors did not give adequate
support to GIPFZA to ensure that the critical action for sustainability of the project i.e.
completion of negotiations with a private master developer would take place. In this regard, the
Government's overall commitment and ownership was not consistent during the life of the
project and thus the Government's performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The implementing agency, GIPFZA, was responsible for the Project with three participating
agencies. The CEO for GIPFZA was also the Project Coordinator; therefore when the CEO was
removed it affected project leadership and management. This was evident when the CEO was
deployed to a higher office, two years before closing of the project which impacted on the image
of the agency. Some of the key GIPFZA staff was highly qualified and the skills they acquired
could be utilized in GIEPA or other sectors of the economy. The quality of management practice
was uneven across the Project's different functions. Most project documentation was well
organized and maintained in their archives, in particular, procurement documents. The
procurement capacity was exemplary as it led to a lot of good practices in the country. Financial
management was characterized by an uneven performance, which included late submission of
the audit reports and some ineligible expenditure. There were some improvements by the end of
the Project providing timely reporting of financial information and FMRs. Leading to a high
level of disbursement. This evaluation thus confirms the rate of moderately satisfactory for
Implementing Agency Performance.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Government's renewed commitment and ownership coupled with the high quality of staff
during a good part of the project's life were important factors in the overall performance of the
project. The overall Borrower performance is thus rated as moderately satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

Consistent strong Government commitment towards DP is critical to its success. The fact
that the GoG changed its commitment towards the DP became a problem. The component was
later dropped from the Project without any meaningful impact. It is therefore critical to examine
the support for the program in a country prior to incorporating such activities in a project. This
leads to the next lesson.

The design of the divestiture component should be based on robust stakeholder analysis.
Despite the indications of strong commitment by GoG during project preparation robust analysis



                                                 28
should have been undertaken on the social impact f its stakeholders. Resistance during
implementation emerged from other stakeholders including management of the enterprises to be
divested.

A Project should have only one Coordinating Unit. The Gateway Project had two PCUs
(GIPFZA and GDA) which did not work and reverted to one PCU (GIPFZA). While a PCU can
often be inserted into an institution, project coordination should not distract the agency from its
other functions. The head of the PCU can therefore be in an agency but should not be the head of
the agency.

Field based Task Teams (including TTLs) are an effective way for the Bank to provide
continuous support to the Borrower. There were five task team leaders over the life of the
Project. This high rotation resulted in a slowdown in the project implementation pace. It was
when the task TTL was field-based and available over a few years, that the project consistently
accelerated deliverance of PDO KPI results.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Physical Investment for a new Free Zone at the airport (US$ 6.35 million) -
Component rating: Satisfactory

As described on page 37 of the PAD, Component 1 had five subcomponents as follows:

(i) Enabling works at the airport; (ii) Fencing and access roads; (iii) Common utilities (energy,
water, telephone); (iv) Common user's warehouse; and (v) Consulting services for supervision of
works. The status at the Project closing date is as follows:

(i)     Enabling works at the airport. The enabling works was required to prepare the FZ site
        for civil works including removal of trees as well as leveling the soil at the site. This
        work was fully completed with satisfactory quality in May 2004 and allowed the civil
        works to take place.

(ii)    Fencing and access roads. The fencing was required to delimit the FZ area and allow
        customs to control the transfer of goods between the F Z, the port, the airport, and the
        local economy. The access roads were necessary to allow linkage of the GIPFZA
        headquarters with other buildings, such as warehouses. In addition, the roads ensure that
        the FZ is linked with the airport and the port to allow transportation of goods and
        products. This work was completed with satisfactory quality in May 2006. It allowed
        the link between the airport, which is a few meters away from the industrial park, and
        connects to the national road network allowing access to the port located 15 kilometers
        away.

(iii)   Common utilities. This included power, telephone, water, and sewage. The Project
        provided financing for the installation of these utilities inside the FZ and the connection
        of these utilities to the outside. The setting up of the common utilities was fully
        completed with satisfactory quality in November 2006. The industrial park has been
        connected to the water and electricity networks in late 2006. Moreover, a backup system
        to ensure that there is no power or water interruption/outage in the industrial park had
        been installed. For electricity, the capacity installed is 2 x 632 KVA provided by two
        diesel fueled power generators that are operational. Moreover, a 370 cubic meter water
        tank was installed as a back up to ensure an adequate water supply. GAMTEL connected
        the industrial park to the fiber optic telephone network at no cost to the project.
        Additionally, GAMTEL set up a customer service center some 500 meters outside the
        industrial park to provide services to the park tenants. Therefore, the project achieved its
        objective of providing industrial park firms best quality utility services in one location, by
        leveraging additional financing from one of the telecommunication operation, thus
        improving the quality of the common utilities beyond what was originally envisaged.

 (i)    Common users' warehouse. The Project financed a common user warehouse at the
        airport site. This was completed in November 2006. The warehouse is occupied by the



                                                 31
       first operator that obtained his license to operate in the park and did not want to build his
       own warehouses. The leasing rates utilized for its tenants are commercial. By building
       the warehouses, the Government sent a clear signal to private developers about its
       commitment to develop FZ, giving them an example to follow. As a result, several other
       FZs have been created e.g. Kuloro.

(v)    Consulting services for supervision of works. Consultants were recruited to ensure
       adherence to international standards in the development of the industrial park. The
       consultants completed their work in November 2006 after confirmation of satisfactory
       quality and completion of the civil works by the supervisory team; the keys to the park
       were handed over to GIPFZA in November 2006.

In this regard, the Industrial Park has been established as per the DCA and PAD. GIPFZA have
been given land lease of 160 hectares. The project financed the development of 8.8 hectares as a
pilot and it is managing the park until a suitable private master developer takes over the
management of the park.

Component 2: Establishment of an Investment Promotion/Free Zone Agency (US$5.10
million) - Satisfactory

As stated in the PAD, this component included five sub components: (B.1) GIPFZA operating
support; (B.2) Technical assistance; (B.3) consulting services to complete and implement market
surveys and marketing plan; (B.4) Consulting services to promote investment; and (B.5) various
studies related to facilitating trade.

(B.1) GIPFZA operating support (US$1.40 million)

The PAD establishes that "In the years immediately following its creation, GIPFZA will most
likely not have enough revenues from licensing fees and land leasing to cover its marketing and
operational expenditures. In addition, GIPFZA will act as an implementing agency for the
Project, which will probably result in a negative cash flow in the initial years. To enable
GIPFZA to establish itself during this period, the Project will finance its operating costs during
the first five years of operation. These operating costs will include: (i) salaries and travel
allowances of GIPFZA staff incurred in carrying out the Project, but excluding the Borrower's
civil servants; (ii) office supplies; (iii) utility costs that include costs for power,
telecommunications, and water; (iv) fuel, vehicle maintenance; (vi) insurance; (vii) audits; (viii)
investment promotional expenses.

The Project has finance GIPFZA's operating cost for a cumulative amount of US$2.1 million, as
per data available on the World Bank client connection of December 2009 which represents an
average cost of U$$270,375 per year. This has enabled the establishment and operation of
GIPFZA. Today, GIPFZA is fully operational, providing some functions of investment
promotion and facilitation, FZ management, and is the PIU of the Gambia Gateway Project. In
short, the Agency is established and recognised as the national investment promotion Agency. It
is fully operational, well equipped in IT infrastructure and the staff has received the relevant




                                                32
training to develop the requisite capacity to effectively carry out their functions as an investment
promotion agency.

While the operating cost has been relatively acceptable at over US$300,000 per year, the idea of
establishing a self sustaining investment promotion agency by the Project's closing date proved a
little too ambitious. GIPFZA has generated the equivalent of US$352,270 in revenues and
reimbursement of expenditures made on behalf of Green Industries located at the Industrial Park.
As such, by the end of the Project, GIPFZA's financial sustainability depends on having a
private developer for the Industrial Park to manage and develop the park. The status of the
selection of the private master developer was completed and the negotiations are still ongoing.
Based on data provided by GIPFZA, as of June 2009, the Project has helped generate US$212
million of investment through 97 new investments. Additionally, these investments have
combined to create an estimated 4,605 new jobs.

(B.2) Technical assistance (US$1.80 million)

The PAD established that a "highly qualified consulting firm will provide GIPFZA with both
short term and long term technical assistance. Short term assistance will mainly consist of
helping GIPFZA build its business plan, which will identify strategic directions for GIPFZA over
a seven-year period. This business plan will be accompanied by a financial analysis, which will
estimate annual revenues and expenditures, and justify the choices and recommendations.

Overall, the technical assistance provided to GIPFZA under the project has been satisfactorily
completed. A consulting firm was recruited through an international competitive process and
provided both short term and long term technical assistance to GIPFZA. A strategic plan
covering a 2007-2009 period, instead of 7 years plan mentioned in the PAD. The Strategic Plan
2007-2009 was developed but was over ambitious and difficult to implement as it required a lot
of resource level. Therefore, it was proposed to prepare the next strategic plan 2010-2015 to
coincide with the implementing period of the World Bank proposed Growth and
Competitiveness Project. The strategic plan would need to include clear and measurable
performance indicators and have its actions and resources fully aligned with a monitoring and
evaluation framework.

(B.3) Market surveys and marketing plan (US$0.3 million)

As stated on page 38 of the PAD, the "Project will finance market surveys that assess the needs
of international investors, identify interested operators and developers, and propose tailored
products to attract investment in The Gambia. Using the recommendations of the market
surveys, GIPFZA will design and implement an international marketing plan to promote The
Gambia as a favorable place for investment through the FZs and incentive packages..."

GIPFZA has developed a business plan which includes a marketing plan and has a focus on
sectors which seem to be competitive, including agro-business, fishing, tourism and light
manufacturing. Although GIPFZA has developed its marketing plan within the context of the
strategic plan and also carried out some promotional activities to attract investors, it is critical




                                                33
that GIPFZA uses the investor tracking system to systematically assess the impact of its
promotional activities, and as a tool for monitoring and evaluation of its services.

With financing from the Gateway Project, GIPFZA recruited a consultant to prepare its 2008
Annual Report. The consultant delivered the year end 2008 report and this was distributed to all
stakeholders; including investors. It was well received, particularly given the fact that it was the
first such issue and gave more insight on GIPFZA's activities and achievements. A 2009 Annual
report was under preparation to help stakeholders understand the work that GIPFZA has carried
out and the impact generated. Moreover, with support from the Project a new website has been
completed and activated. The staff completed the requisite training to ensure proper and timely
content management.

(B.4) Consulting services to promote investment (US$0.7 million)

The PAD establishes that "The Project will finance consultants to help prepare promotional
materials and fairs in The Gambia and abroad." To that end, and as advised by the Bank the
Project financed the development of additional materials, which are considered modern and
based on good practice, comparable to the promotional material produced by countries such as
Botswana and Mauritius. To improve the quality of the promotional material, GIPFZA recruited
the services of a professional marketing / promotional materials design consultant, with a view to
produce a diverse (i.e. both sector specific, and general), and high quality stock of best practice
caliber promotional materials. Additionally, GIPFZA hired a specialized assistance to develop an
Investment Guide. This work completed on June 29, 2009 and allowed GIPZA to have the
promotional material, promotional video, multimedia presentation, PowerPoint presentation,
information brochures and kit (folder) on six sectors, and an investment guide to effectively
carry out its investment promotion work.

GIPFZA prepared the production of a good quality annual report, which has been used to
showcase the role and responsibilities of GIPFZA as well as its achievements. This work was
completed and is still being used by GIPFZA as an additional, tool for its promotion.

(B.5) Financing of studies related to trade facilitation and investment (US$0.9 million)

For this sub component, page 39 of the PAD lays out that the Project will finance studies related
to GIPFZA's mission.

GPFZA carried out several studies related to its mission. These include the following: (i) an
investor perception survey and (ii) an impact assessment of the effectiveness and relevancy of
the investment incentives. These studies have been useful in helping GIPFZA determine the
areas in which investors needed more support so as to focus its action. As a result, GIPFZA has
made a decision to focus its activities on investment facilitation, as opposed to investment
promotion, as mentioned above.

The Project has also helped finance some studies that could help understand the measures to be
adopted to facilitate trade, as well as some of the studies necessary for the preparation of the
Growth and Competitiveness Project. These studies included: (i) a value chain analysis for the



                                                34
horticulture products; (ii) the design of a business environment reform program; (iii) the design
of the restructuring of the Gambia Hotel School into a National Tourism Training Institute, (iv)
the restructuring of GIPFZA and establishment of a one stop shop and (v) the design of a
matching grant scheme. The Gateway Project also financed an Electricity and Water Tariff study
funded. The findings of this study were shared with the relevant stakeholders. Moreover, the
Public Utility Regulatory Agency (PURA) proactively used this as a tool to engage all
stakeholders in a discussion regarding the need to review the electricity tariff. The analysis
contained in this study served as the basis to eventually lead in the reduction of the cost of
electricity in the Gambia effective November 2009 for the both domestic and industrial
consumers; with the former given 15% reduction.

Component 3: Preparatory work for Divestiture in the Groundnut sector
(US$ 2.40 million) - Component rating Satisfactory

The activities that were supported under the Gateway Project were as follows:

   (i)       Rehabilitation of GGC's assets including: (i) the purchase of two engines for one of
             the three tug boats; (ii) the improvement of the depot's crop handling equipment; and
             (iii) rehabilitation of the shelling and crushing plants;
   (ii)      The funding of GGC's technical and financial audits to prepare GGC's divestiture;
             and
   (iii)     The provision of support to ASPA to help establish the institution.

(C1)       Rehabilitation of GGC's Productive Assets

The partial rehabilitation of GGC's assets started relatively slowly before gaining momentum
after the November 2008 supervision mission. Procurement process was delayed due to
alteration of procurement documents that were previously agreed between the World Bank and
GIPFZA prior to Bank's consent. The alterations meant increased level of project resources
would have been required to complete the tasks. Based on the 2008/9 groundnut season data
provided by GGC, GGC bought, transported and processed 22,500 tons of unshelled groundnuts.
This represented by far the highest volume handled by the Corporation in the last five years. As a
reference, it is worth noting that the previous year only 3,400 tons were bought, transported, and
processed. Based on 2009/10 GGC data, equally high volumes of groundnut, 35,000 tons of
unshelled nuts were purchased and processed by GGC, showing an important upward trend in
the output of GGC thanks to the purchase of the rehabilitation of key assets

The detailed of the rehabilitation work is shown below:

Purchase of two engines for the rehabilitation of one tugboat. The World Bank agreed in
November 2008 to fast-track the provision of two marine engines for one of GGC's three
tugboats. The rehabilitation of the tugboat was completed resulting into a faster turnaround of the
GGC river transportation fleet and an increased ability to handle the 35,000 metric tons of
unshelled groundnut.




                                                35
Rehabilitation of Depots' Weighbridge Scales. The procurement of the weighbridge scales for
GGC's ten depots was completed and they were installed and operational. Their impact on the
work of GGC is highly positive as it has improved accuracy and farmers are satisfied by its
performance as they received electronic printed receipts for their sales and now know that the
equipment in place are reliable in determining the weight of their groundnut production.

Rehabilitation of the shelling and crushing plants involves the following activities:

        (i)    Rehabilitation of the grading equipment. The rehabilitation of the grading
               equipment and provision of spare parts, GGC was completed, allowing an
               increased functional capacity of grading plant for handpicked groundnut up to
               30,000 metric tons of unshelled groundnut.

        (ii)   Rehabilitation of the Shelling Plant Equipment: This task was completed and it
               now enables GGC to increase its shelling capacity from 100 Metric ton/day to >
               250Mt/day to efficiently handle the expected 35,000Mt of unshelled groundnuts.
               Since these shellers represent the primary industrial activity of GGC, the
               assistance was quite critical and timely as it increased GGC's ability to increase
               its shelling capacity.

       (iii)   The purchase of a new color sorting machine This equipment which is used to
               sort out the groundnut based on the level of aflatoxin content was critical to
               improving the quality of the groundnut to meet the requirements for export. The
               Sortex machines were fully refurbished. The supplier was able to test run the
               machines and completed training of staff on the operation of the machines in
               December 2009 when groundnuts was available from the new crop harvested of
               November 2009. The refurbished Sortex machine has enabled GGC to place in
               the international market all the HPS produced from the 35,000 metric tons of
               groundnuts since the groundnut will meet the quality standards. This is a
               significant achievement since prior to the acquisition of the color sorting
               equipment, GGC's production was exported as "animal feed."

       (iv)    The rehabilitation of the oil mill crushing plant The commissioning of the plant
               was done during the third week in December 2009 on a `dry-run basis'. GGC and
               the supplier understand that `certification of works' can only be issued when the
               machines have been run on full load. As a result from January 2010 the oil mill
               crushing plant was operational with a throughput capacity of 150 metric tons per
               day, and GGC was able to meet contracted crude groundnut oil shipment
               schedules and improve the quality of its services.

Rehabilitation of GGC's oil storage capacity. GGC did not have sufficient oil storage
capacity. Following a commitment made by the Government, GGC is planning to use two tanks
located at the Banjul port. The 1,000 Mt tank and the two incomplete tanks were repossessed by
Government through GAMCO liquidation and transferred to GGC. The transfer and ownership
certificates were obtained and the rehabilitation works started on the 19th September 2009. The
work was completed and GGC now has sufficient storage capacity. However, certification will



                                               36
only be issued by GGC subsequent to the tanks being fully laden to test their capacities and
welding strength.

Supply of Generators and Forklift: The provision of the generators and forklift will enable
GGC's major depots to operate on a twenty-four hours basis during the trading season and also
increase the handling of finished products (HPS). As a result, GGC depots and crushing plant
operate around the clock, which contributes to improving the handling and processing capacity.

Supply of general spare parts, equipment, maintenance and rehabilitation of GGC plants
and machinery This involved the procurement of five lots of spares parts, equipment, as well as
the maintenance and rehabilitation of a barge unloading facility. These were provided and
installed on time. The impact of this rehabilitation of the GGC plants and machinery is that it
enables GGC to ship crude groundnut oil at competitive freight rates thanks to the increase
volume shipped, thus improving the competitiveness of its groundnut oil. Moreover, GGC will
be able to adhere to a time frame that is in line with export schedule contracts with international
buyers for HPS and crude groundnut oil. The rehabilitation of jetty and barge unloading facility
was also completed. The rehabilitation of the unloading facility will result is GGC being able to
dock barges conveniently and safely for the discharge of groundnuts from the depots. As of
January 2010, GGC was able to discharge two barges simultaneously, a task that was not
possible before. This represents a doubling of the discharging capacity. Moreover, the
turnaround time of barges and evacuation of groundnuts from the 10 depots has significantly
increased, leading to an improved efficiency of GGC's work.

(C2)          Gambia Groundnut Corporation financial and technical audits

The audits were undertaken in support of the preparation of GGC's agreed upon divestiture plan.
They were meant to provide an understanding of GGC's financial and operational situation,
productive assets and technical efficiency. It was important to note that under the restructuring of
the Gambia Gateway Project, the actual implementation of the divestiture is not meant to be
financed. The Project is only meant to prepare the technical recommendations for the divestiture.

Financial audit

The audit was expected to cover the standard scope of a financial audit26. It in particular covered
the exact situation regarding the actual ownership of all GGS's assets. This included the current
legal ownership of some of GGC's assets, such as those inherited from Agro-oil (that GGC has
been managing for a few years) and more recently from GAMCO after its liquidation. The audit
investigated any contingent liability, old or new, such as the potential losses incurred through the
non-repayment by groundnut traders of the loans received from GGC for the 2007-08 and 2008-
09 seasons, as well as the current claim from GAMINVEST owners of a rental fee for the use of
GAMCO's crushing plant.

Technical audit and valuation of GGC with the aim to prepare a divestiture of GGC


26
     Although it is reflected in the TORs, it is not sufficiently made clear in the technical approach outlined by the firm in its submission.




                                                                            37
The objective of this consultancy three folds: (i) undertake a diagnostic and a complete technical
audit of GGC in the context of the groundnut sector in The Gambia, the region and worldwide; (ii)
assess the value of the company by various appropriate methods; and (iii) assess the different
divestiture options which could be used to bring about a private sector participation in GGC.

As of December 4, 2009, both the inception and interim reports have been submitted to
stakeholders. A Consultative workshop took place on December 8th in Banjul. This workshop
allowed the presentation of the findings of consultancy and obtaining additional stakeholder
input regarding the diagnosis while building consensus on the most suitable strategy to be
adopted to ensure that GGC can have the required investment to sustain the improved
performance. The final report was completed. It demonstrated that GGC is in a very challenging
situation. "It has sustained losses for the past few years and has negative shareholder equity.
Moving to profitability would require an intervention in one of three forms: (i) a significant
amount of fresh investment, (ii) a subsidy, and (iii) a change in the regime for pricing of
groundnuts, or a combination of the above. The status quo is therefore not sustainable, and
without one of these interventions, there is a risk of insolvency. Therefore it implies that
divestiture would be appropriate as such a transaction, will improve the economic conditions of
groundnut growers in The Gambia, where over 60% of the Gambian population is involved in
groundnut growing or processing and related activities. This would significantly contribute to
improving the revenues of farmers and alleviating poverty in the country.

(C3)    Technical support to ASPA (Agribusiness Service Plan Association)

ASPA has been incorporated and registered (September 8, 2008) under the Company Act.
Moreover, a new Framework of Agreement has been signed with the Government on December
1, 2008. As such, a new legal and institutional framework has been set up through these two key
steps and needed to be strengthened to contribute to managing the groundnut sector effectively
and through an association of private producers. ASPA has been set up as an autonomous inter-
professional body and should aim at financial independence and self-sustainability. This required
that the cost of its activities, and in particular that of its technical secretariat, be in line with the
resources that it is likely to be able to mobilize.

Support to ASPA Secretariat

ASPA recruited a technical secretary to provide a minimum internal analytical capacity
necessary for informing the decision-making of its stakeholders, monitoring developments in the
sector and providing international market price data. GGC has offered to accommodate the
technical secretariat in one of the empty buildings on its grounds at Denton Bridge.

To build the capacity of ASPA, the Gateway Project financed the acquisition of the necessary
investments/assets to make the Secretariat fully operational. This includes the supply of essential
office equipment: computers, printers, scanners, facsimile machine, network material for an
internet connection, etc. Some limited additional equipment was also purchased for the
Secretariat to be fully operational. These include the following: (i) a limited number of
complementary office equipment; and (ii) office furniture. Additionally, during the December
2009 supervision mission and in light of the project's existing savings, the World Bank conveyed



                                                   38
its no objection for the quick acquisition of a pickup truck to help ASPA be in contact with its
members and provide them services so as to secure revenues from membership fees.

Additionally, the Gateway Project funded (i) the subscription of ASPA to two of the world
leading commodity data publishers (Oil world and the Public ledger) to ensure that ASPA has all
the data ­ including price of groundnut and oil on the world market - related to the groundnut
industry worldwide and can use this data to make informed decision and determine the price of
groundnut based on a clear and objective formula.

The Gateway Project also financed the consultancy for the development of a 4 years strategic
plan for ASPA. This strategic plan is the instrument which would help ASPA determine the type
of services that it can rendered, the revenues that it can receive and the minimum cost that it
would need to cover to operate in a sustainable manner. ASPA's revised annual (operating)
budget amounts to about GMD 450,000 or US$18,000. Although ASPA might be able to finance
US$18,000 from ASPA's membership fees and other levies, it has not yet started its membership
drive. It is urgent that it does so immediately, before the start of the 2009-10 crop seasons. In the
meantime, ASPA will be unable to finance its small technical secretariat, at least until the
beginning of 2010. While the Gateway Project has helped set up the institution, it now needs to
work on ensuring its sustainability, including by controlling cost and generating revenues.

Component 4: Capacity Building (US$ 1.20 million). This component no longer exists
under the restructured Project. This section is only added for completeness since it was
formally closed.

Component 4: Capacity Building has been closed and the remaining training activities carried
out through component 2 since GIPFZA is the only beneficiary which needs minimal training.

Overall, the Project helped finance a significant amount of training for GIPZA and contributed to
sharpening the capabilities of the GIPFZA staff to accomplish specialized tasks in a competitive
environment, as well as understand and manage a World Bank financed project. Training/Study
Tours/Seminars have been attended by the GIPFZA staff. These include the following training
activities: Strategic Investment Promotion, Attraction of Foreign Direct Investment, Investment
Facilitation and Aftercare, Planning, Development & Management of Industrial parks, Free
Zones Regulation, Strategic Investment Promotion and Competitiveness, Mentoring Program for
Executive Directors, Corporate Governance, Challenges for the future, Creating an Enabling
Environment for SE Development, Trade Promotion and Export Development, Trade
Negotiation Skills, Health and Safety, Corporate Health and Safety Solutions, World Bank
Advanced Goods and Equipment Procurement training, Assuring the Quality of Bank Operations
in Africa, National and International Public Procurement, Procurement of Goods and Equipment
Management, Procurement of Consultants' Services, Procurement Project Management Financial
Management & Disbursement on World Bank financed projects, Practical Book Keeping Course,
Management Development Program, Human Resources Management, Financial Planning &
Control. It is worth noting that the above list is not exhaustive.

Each of the GIPFZA staff had benefited from short term training activities to improve their
ability to carry out their functions in an effective and efficient manner. The sub component was



                                                 39
performing satisfactorily. The cost estimate for this activity was US$ 205,000. Additionally,
selected public officials were taken on study visits to expose these key stakeholders to successful
experience of economic reforms.

Component 5: Project and Environmental management (US$ 0.90 million)

E.1     Project management (US$ 0.2 million)
Project Management component was rated moderately unsatisfactory at the end of the project.
While the Project had addressed the two violations of the Development Credit Agreement by
submitting, albeit late, the 2008 financial audit report and reimbursing the ineligible expenditures
under the Project, there was a need to address additional aspects to improve project management
including the need for GIPFZA to be pro active in making things happen. For example, delays in
getting the Budget for 2009 approved by its Board and getting a no objection to recruit a
financial management specialist to help strengthen its financial management function hampered
the timely implementation and ensuring the timely follow up on planned activities, while also
causing the applications for disbursement to be of uneven quality.

E.2     Environmental and social management ($0.7 million)

As stated in the PAD, "the proposed Project is rated Environmental Category A." In conformity
with Bank guidelines, an Environmental Assessment (EA) has been carried out by the consulting
company ECOLAS, financed by the PHRD Grant from Japan. The EA has identified
environmental and social issues related to the industrial park site and recommended measures to
be integrated into the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). These will be
implemented during the construction and operations phases of the airport site. Since many of the
economic activities in the industrial park have yet to be identified, the periodic environmental
and social assessments will also include activity-specific EMSPs, as they are identified. This
sub-component thus involves two activities: (a) Periodic environmental and social assessments,
and (b) Environmental mitigation measures.

  (i)   Periodic environmental and social assessments
         In order to ensure the environmental and social sustainability of the Project, an
         independent consulting firm will carry out annual audits. Since no firms had been
         operating in the industrial park until mid 2008, there has been no environmental audit.
         Currently, three units have started operating into the industrial park a consulting firm is
         being hired to carry out the environmental audit. As mentioned above these three
         industrial units operating in the industrial park are assembling garment and shoes, while
         the third one is in the production of diapers and toilet paper.

 (ii)   Environmental mitigation measures
         The Project was expected to fund environmental mitigation measures in the ESMP,
         which would include (i) mitigation measures related to the development of the airport
         Free Zone site, and eventually the development of River Free Zones; and (ii) industry
         and site-specific mitigation measures related to the installations and operation within the
         industrial park. The periodic environmental and social assessments originally envisaged




                                                40
        have not been carried out so far given that the industrial park has its first tenant only
        since March 2008 and started to operate a few months later.

On safeguard management, the Project financed the development of an action plan in
collaboration with the relevant World Bank Department. Moreover, the authorities have taken
steps to implement the action plan including (i) an addendum to the tender documents of the
industrial park on EMP covering pollution control, health, safety, and source of raw materials is
in place, (ii) agreement and fencing of the Abuko buffer zone/nature reserve under the Credit.

The Project carried out a major undertaking to protect the environment and wildlife by financing
the fencing of the Abuko buffer zone/nature reserve. This is the Project's biggest intervention in
the ESMP, and it was carried out in collaboration with its primary beneficiary (the Department of
Parks and Wildlife Management). The construction of the fence given the quality of the fencing
and its impact was a success story. It is well constructed and was completed within a relatively
short timeframe. Moreover, not only it freed more land to the neighboring households, it brought
more security in the community while it make it more difficult for human to encroach on this
important nature reserve, and lead to a the establishment of a well protected are which is safe to
visit.

Additionally, and as prescribed in the MOU, the Gateway Project provided technical training to 1
NEA and 1 GIPFZA staff (the Director of the industrial park) for the proper handling of
environmental and social safeguard measures. GIPFZA reiterated to the Bank mission that the
training was of the GIPFZA staff was to its satisfaction and that GIPFZA felt adequately
prepared to indentify environmental issues and refer them to NEA. A second NEA staff was
supposed to receive the training but this did not take place since his request for training was not
submitted to GIPFZA.

The project also financed the installation of a wastewater treatment plant at the industrial park.
There is no water at the plant that could raise some potential environmental concerns.

Recommendations to improve health, safety and security at the industrial park/GGC

The GGC oil mill for which is being rehabilitated with project's financing and the peanuts oil
storage tanks currently being constructed at the Seaport of Banjul present some health and safety
risks, which needed mitigated. Similarly, there are two unshielded compressors in the two
production halls. Poor access control and health and absence of safety control measures in GGC
means there are permanent risks of falls from height, trip/falls, burns and other physical traumas.
Overall, there is an inadequate health and safety awareness at the two sites. As such, the World
Bank recommended that operators in the industrial park and GGC adopt a documented
systematic approach to managing health and safety by assessing the hazards and effects of their
operations and developing appropriate measures to keep the risks to human health and safety as
low as reasonably practicable.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Background

The Free Zones (FZs) derive their competitive position from two main factors: (i) the quality of
the infrastructure and services delivered in one location; and (ii) the sectoral focus of the
development. The Zones was expected offer facilities at competitive prices but, more so, to offer
the best quality of personal service to potential investors in the region and worldwide. However,
the concept of free zone was changed to that of an industrial park.

GIPFZA was able to attract private investment into the country but it was located elsewhere than
the park. This was due to the fact that the investors could get new free land and develop it on
their own. The industrial park is almost charges are high.

Tourism is an important industry in The Gambia. Revenues from tourism contribute about 12
percent of GDP. Further development of the tourism industry has shown support to the
development of the airport activities and critical air-links, and therefore supports the growth of
other activities that are related to the hospitality industry.
The industry has also strengthened the domestic food and agribusiness industries, which
themselves can form the base of export manufacturing industries in the country. Additional
assistance will be provided under the proposed Growth and Competitiveness Project so that the
food and agribusiness industry generate additional revenues and jobs by fostering additional
linkages with the local economy thanks to the assistance to be provided by the matching grant
which will foster technical learning at the firm level. The Teleport services were not established.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
Three main benefits and two types of costs have been identified:
Benefits:
   (i) Foreign exchange earnings/value added of exports. Since there was shift from free
          zone concept to industrial park and investment projects elsewhere in the country,
          there was a flow of private investment in the country. In total the investment was
          US$210 million in the period of seven years. This included direct foreign investment
          in the country.
.
   (ii)   Employment generation. It was estimated that about 1,000 direct jobs will be
          created from 20 firms within 5 years. This assumption was surpassed as 4,605 direct
          jobs were created in the country due to the private investment and their projects. In 15
          years, this number of jobs will double to over 9,000 direct jobs inside and outside the
          FZs. A secondary effect expected in employment generation that was the creation of
          indirect jobs from activities in the periphery of the FZs and operations elsewhere in
          the country. Therefore, indirect jobs are estimated at three times the total jobs created
          in the FZs and elsewhere; such that; 13,806 additional jobs.




                                                42
                                    Actual jobs generation:
                         7 years                         15 Years
Direct jobs               4,605                           9,000
Indirect jobs            13,806                          27,000
Total                    18,406                          36,000

   (iii)   Technology transfer. FZs and industrial parks usually involve labor-intensive
           production and promote technology in the host country. This is one of the most
           important externality that comes with the presence of the FZs and industrial parks. In
           the long run, the "learning by doing" mechanism will come into play through the
           "catalytic effect" that will prompt gains in managerial practices and notions of quality
           control among local middle managers employed by the FZs firms. Once the industrial
           park has a private master developer; it is expected to increase productivity and
           efficiency in industrial park firms and other domestic firms, which would otherwise
           have not improved without the influence of the FZs. This benefit is difficult to
           measure and thus is not included in the present cost-benefit analysis.

Costs:
   (i) Infrastructure costs: Public expenditures required to set up the Zones are a clear
          economic cost. Therefore, the off-site infrastructure investment costs will be included
          as the major costs for the FZs project.

   (ii) Administrative costs: The establishment, maintenance and administration of the Zones
          sites are all economic costs, and in principle should be evaluated at shadow prices. In
          the absence of data, the financial costs will be used.

Main Assumptions:
Simple assumptions were necessary to carry out the economic analysis, and efforts were made
not to overestimate social profitability of the FZs. The assumptions used in the analysis include:

   (i) The GoG was committed to the Project and the continued improvement of the
           macroeconomic environment, including the implementation of its divestiture plan.
   (ii) Gross revenues in the tourism sector increased by 5 percent from 2002 to 2005 and 15
           percent thereafter.
   (iii)The export value added is estimated to be between 10-15 percent of total value of export
           sales from manufacturing include groundnut sector activities.
   (iv) The opportunity cost of capital is set at 12 percent, a rate frequently used in the
    region.

Results of the cost benefit analysis

The financial cost of the project is US$ 20.9 million including GoG's contribution to the project.
The estimated economic cost of $18.8 million is discounted by 10 percent of the financial costs.
The results showed that the overall project can be strongly justified in NPV and EIRR. The cash


                                               43
flow was revised for the whole project and not per component. Since the Free Zone was changed
to an industrial park the benefits have been reduced by a factor of three forth to reflect the social
opportunities cost of these resources. Based on the assumptions, the project benefits result in an
EIRR of 16.8% in the base case with NPV of US$ 25. 2 million. These benefits would have been
more if the free zone was fully occupied and generating more export products.

1. BACKGROUND, PROJECT RATIONALE AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

(i) Background
The Gambia Gateway Project was intended to enable The Gambia establish itself as a globally
competitive export and processing center. The project was thus a key component of the
Government's strategy for achieving broad based, export-oriented and sustainable growth. The
Project was to be implemented in phases through an Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
instrument. This lending instrument was settled on for the following reasons:
    · The need to progressively build capacity in the Gambia for trade promotion;
   ·   The phased sequence of the investment part of the Project and
   ·   The long-term commitment of the Government to implementing the Gateway Project.
The APL was to be implemented in two phases:
Phase 1(APL1): this was to lay the physical and operational foundations for establishing the
Gambia as a credible player in the world trade arena. This was to be accomplished by: Creating
a favourable business environment; Promoting private investments and launching an operational
free zone adjacent to the airport. Simultaneously, APL1 was to develop a long-term marketing
and operational strategy to reinforce free zone activities within the country's economy and
exploit its comparative advantages. Phase 2(APL2) was expected to consolidate the free zone
functions and financing and secure managerial and financial autonomy for the Gambia
Investment Promotion and Free Zones Agency (GIPFZA). This phase was to deepen production
linkages of the Free Zone with the local economy; pursue competitiveness of the Gambia in the
global market as well as extend and sustain the Project's income and employment benefits. Phase
2 was to focus on the populations living along the Gambia River by improving river navigation
to facilitate transportation of horticultural and agricultural products into other potential free
zones to be developed later under the Free Zone Act. Financing for phase 2 was projected to be
generated from income accruing from activities and facilities developed in phase 1. The
Gateway Project was approved by the World Bank Board of Director on 28th February 2002 and
became effective on 18th September 2002.

(ii) Project Rationale
The Gambia Gateway Project was a key component of the Government's drive to fight poverty
through employment creation and to reshape the economy based on an outward looking and
export oriented strategy. In this regard, the Project was intended to address some of the key
constraints highlighted in the Government's Private Sector Development Strategy: (i) weak
institutional framework for trade and investment promotion,(ii)lack of institutional capacity to
support private sector development and(iii) Poor public services particularly utilities. The
Gambia Gateway Project was expected to lay the foundation for future consolidation and
expansion. These were underpinned by certain developmental imperatives:
      1. The need to have a long-term vision and to constantly update strategy, and establish
          credibility and competitiveness in international markets.
      2. The critical importance of the participation of the private sector in the establishment of
          the free zones;


                                                51
    3. The complementary and facilitating role of the public sector;

    4. The development of the local private sector as well as the strengthening of local capacity
        to meet international trade standards.


2. PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND PERFORMANCE BY COMPONENT

Component 1: Physical investment for a new FZ at the airport: This component was to
establish the physical infrastructure necessary for an operational FZ at the airport. It included
(i) physical infrastructure to enable the FZ at the airport, including common users' facilities and
utilities; and (ii) consulting services for supervising works.

ACHIEVEMENT: The free zone has been physically established, occupying 8.8 hectares of the
160 hectare that was assigned to GIPFZA. It is important to note that the Physical Investment is
now both a free zone and industrial park since the dual functionality seems better suited to the
Gambian environment. The industrial park, a US$ 6.3 million investment, is operational and well
located near the Banjul International Airport in an area where enabling works had to be realized
to allow civil works to take place. The Park offers attractive amenities and infrastructure
including back-up energy, waste water treatment plant, networks for telecom, electrical supply,
sewerage, storm and portable water. There is currently a local company in the business park that
is involved in three different activities: production of garments, diapers and shoes. The search for
a private developer that would manage and further develop the park is on-going and is expected
to be positively completed soon.

Component 2: Establishment of a GIPFZA: This component was to establish the GIPFZA as a
self-sustaining entity that manages the FZs and promotes trade and investment. It included (i)
operational support to GIPFZA; (ii) technical assistance; (iii) consulting services to complete
and implement marketing plans and market surveys; (iv) consulting services for investment
promotion; and (v) studies (River-FZs Interface, a Trade & Transport facilitation survey, a
Quality Management Systems (QMS) Audit for the Customs & Excise Department).
ACHIEVEMENT: The Gateway Project has been successful in establishing GIPFZA. GIPFZA
is fully operational, recognized as the national investment promotion agency providing core
functions of investment promotion and facilitation, industrial park management, and was the
PCU of the Gambia Gateway Project. The agency is well equipped in IT infrastructure and the
staff have received the relevant training to develop the requisite capacity to effectively carry out
their functions as an investment promotion agency. The Agency also benefitted from both short
term and long term assistance. GIPFZA has met and or exceeded the original performance
targets for this component as reflected in Table 3. From 2002 to 2009, the Agency had generated
an estimated US$211million in investments and 4605 jobs through licenses issued to 97 projects
in all sectors of the economy. At the end of the Gateway Project, 58 of these projects were fully
operational and 10 of them were in mobilization stage. In fact, the positive results registered by
GIPFZA and experience gain during the implementation of the Gateway project led to the
decision to establish a new investment promotion agency to replace GIPFZA but with its
mandate expanded to included export and enterprise development in addition to the core
functions of investment promotion and facilitation. The new agency is called the Gambia
Investment and Export Promotion Agency (GIEPA) and is expected to start on 1st July 2010.


                                                52
Component 3: Support to the Divestiture Program renamed: This component was to support
the Government agenda for privatization. It included (i) technical assistance to support the
Government DP; (ii) divestiture safeguarding and monitoring; and (iii) divestiture consensus
building through national and international campaigns.
ACHIEVEMENT: This component was formally closed during the Gateway project
restructuring and replaced with a new component, Preparatory work for the Divestiture of the
groundnut sector that aimed to prepare work for the Divestiture of the Groundnut sector. The
following activities were undertaken under the Gateway Project:
    (i)     The rehabilitation of GGC's assets including the following: (i) the purchase of two
            engines for one of the three tug boats; (ii) the improvement of the depot's crop
            handling equipment; and (iii) the rehabilitation of the shelling and crushing plants;
    (ii)    The funding of GGC's technical and financial audits to prepare GGC's divestiture
            and
    (iii) The provision of support to ASPA to help establish the institution.

The developments and assistance channelled to GGC have substantially improved the capacity of
the groundnut Corporation, the major marketing agency for effective intervention in the
purchase, transport, processing and marketing of groundnuts and products abroad. With the
corresponding support given to ASPA, the sector has been significantly capacitated to hold its
position and improve its performance over time in a global market that will increasingly become
more competitive. The intervention has also resulted in helping provide the stakeholders with a
comprehensive diagnosis of GGC, and assess the different options that could be used to bring
about private sector participation in GGC.

Component 4: Capacity Building for GIPFZA and GDA: This component included training
activities for both the public and the private sectors directly involved in investment and FZ-
related businesses. Training included quality management and control processes, the ISO
certification concept, and information about US and European markets' access regulations for
products originating from ACP countries. This component also included training for GDA as
well as capacity building for the multi-sector regulatory agency.

ACHIEVEMENT: Overall, the Project helped finance a significant amount of training for
GIPFZA and contributed to sharpening the capabilities of the GIPFZA staff to accomplish
specialized tasks in a competitive environment, as well as understand and manage a World Bank
financed project. Training/Study Tours/Seminars have been attended by the GIPFZA staff. Also
the project helped train other institutions and individuals towards the common goal of attracting
private investment for economic development.

Component 5: Project and Environment Management: This component included funds for (i)
overall project management; and (ii) environmental studies and mitigation measures.

ACHIEVEMENT: The biggest achievement under the environment component is the fencing of
the Abuko Nature Reserve. Fencing the park has safe guarded a park that was under threat from
human encroachment. The National Environment Agency (NEA) also benefitted from technical
training which resulted in more awareness on the importance of adhering to the environmental
and social management plan of the project.

3. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
The project became effective in September 2002 and closed in December 2009. Despite the
challenges faced during implementation, most of the revised Key Performance Indicators had
been achieved and or surpassed by the end of the project. Of the four intermediate outcome
indicators, three were fully achieve whilst one was partially achieved. This performance is
mainly attributable to the dedication of the GIPFZA staff with the support of the Government of
The Gambia and the Bank. A number of factors had significant impact on project
implementation and outcomes and the key ones can be summarized as follows:

(i) Project Coordination and Implementation Arrangements
It was originally envisaged that the Project Coordinating Unit will be at the Department of State
for Trade, Industry & Employment (DOSITE) now Ministry of Trade, Industry & Employment
(MOTIE). However due to challenges in project coordination in the beginning, GIPFZA was
eventually tasked to become the PCU and its CEO was the Project Coordinator. This change in
coordination arrangements had mixed results for GIPFZA as an Agency and for the project.
With this change, GIPFZA became more focused on project coordination and management and
this yielded positive result for the project. However because of the full involvement of the
GIPFZA staff on project management activities, focus on the agency core mandate of investment
promotion and facilitation was lost and this affected the performance of GIPFZA as an
investment promotion agency.

(ii)Project Midterm Review
At the time of the MTR in May 2005, three of the six Key Performance Indicators were
achieved. However key difficulties for the overall project mainly centered on the progress of
work at the Free Zones at the Airport and the Divestiture Program. Capacity development was
one of the key objectives of the project. Whilst both GIPFZA and GDA were the two
implementing agencies for the project, capacity development was more concentrated and
effective with GIPFZA than the GDA. The MTR , though highlighted fundamental areas that
need restructuring and changes, it was not conclusive in terms of coming up with a firm action
plan to move the project forward and engagements dragged on for almost three years. This,
together, with the changes of TTLs during this critical period affected project implementation
particularly the search for a developer for Free Zone/Business Park.

(iii)Project Restructuring
The final restructuring of the project was in March 2008 and this provided a clearer vision and
plan of action from then to the end of the project in December 2009. The Government agreed
with the Bank to close the divestiture component and reallocated the funds for support to the
Groundnut sector.

(iv) Financial Management and Procurement Management
The project complied with all the financial requirements of the loan agreement although there
were some delays in submission of two audit reports. The project was able to achieve two critical
performance indicators: monthly withdrawal disbursements and financial audits were all
unqualified. Overall the project funds were used for the intended purposes. Procurement
management was carried out effectively despite challenges at the start of the project when there
was no procurement specialist in place in the PCU. Overtime, capacity in procurement



                                               54
management was developed and all information required in this area was usually provided and
on time. Despite the pressure in the last two years of the project when support to the groundnut
sector was added as well as preparatory studies for the Gambia Growth and Competitiveness
Project (GGCP) towards the end the project, all procurement activities were planned and
completed before project closure.


(v) M&E Challenges
M&E was a key challenge during project implementation particularly prior to the final
restructuring in early 2008. Whilst GIPFZA had information and data on components that it was
directly involved in, it was difficult to report on all the components as some were either too
broad or difficult to measure. Two of the original PDO Indicators that related to Free Zone
concept were dropped during restructuring as it was decided to change from the FZ to the
Business Park concept for the site at the Airport. The development of the GIPFZA Strategy Plan
(2007 -2009) provided a framework for M&E but this was more focused on performance
monitoring and measurement of indicators directly related to GIPFZA as an Agency, rather than
the Gateway Project. However the M&E performance improved after the revision of the Results
Framework during restructuring and a day's training in Managing for Results" for GIPFZA
staff. Project reports were regularly sent to The Bank by GIPFZA but comments on such reports
were rarely received by GIPFZA. The Bank regularly sent the final aide moirés on supervision
missions but this practice became rather ad hoc particularly during the last year of the project.

(vii) Environment and social safeguards
An MOU was signed between GIPFZA and the National Environment Agency (NEA) in January
2002 to ensure maximum cooperation between the two agencies. This was necessary to ensure
that the project adhered to all the necessary safeguards required for the activities located at the
Business Park at the airport. The provisions in the MOU were largely adhered to. The fencing of
the Abuko nature reserve was a major intervention and this benefitted the surrounding
communities as it provided more security for them and prevented encroachment into the park.
The project also provided training in environmental and social safeguard measures for staff from
both the GIPFZA and the NEA. Through the creation of employment, the project had a positive
social impact on the lives of the people of the Gambia. For all projects that are deemed likely to
have an environmental impact, GIPFZA always consults and works with the NEA and project
promoters to ensure that they adhere to the guidelines and requirements of the NEA. Where
social issues are identified, the communities and relevant stakeholders are always consulted and
engaged although such cases could take a long time to resolve.

(viii) World Bank Support
Overall support from the Bank's Project team during implementation contributed significantly to
the achievements of the project. This was particularly more apparent after restructuring when the
TTL was based in Dakar Senegal. This led to more frequent supervision missions to The Gambia
and more proactive and effective engagement and dialogue between the Bank team, the PCU and
other stakeholders, particularly regarding the intervention in the groundnut sector. However
despite the positive support, the Bank also contributed to some of the challenges and constraints
encountered during project implementation and some of these impacted significantly on the
performance of the project particularly as it relates to the Business Park. During the seven years



                                                55
of the project, a total of five TTLs were assigned to the project and of these four changes were
made in the first five years of the project. There were times when the project did not have a
dedicated TTL and this meant that time dedicated to the project was less than optimal. The
frequent changes also resulted in changes in focus and strategy as each TTL came with his or her
own management style and priorities. This significantly affected project implementation and the
outcomes particularly for the Business Park and Investment Promotion.

5. LESSONS LEARNT

(i) Project Coordination Units should be on its own. The experience with GIPFZA as the
Gateway Project Coordination unit highlights the need for PCUs to be stand-alone. The
experience shows that both the project and GIPFZA as an agency could have performed better if
the two were separated. However it is also critical to ensure that the standalone PCU is well
equipped and the staff have the requisite skills for effective delivery.

(ii) Project Counterpart Funds should be minimal if not zero: The experience of the Gateway
project is proof of the need for counterpart funding on the side of the government to be minimal
if not at zero per cent. The counterpart funding obligation of the government for the project was
an astounding 30% for all local contracts. It had proven difficult for the government to meet this
requirement particularly after the restructuring. This high rate is more like co financing than
counterpart funding for a country like the Gambia. This is not unique to just the Gateway project
but other projects as well. It is hoped that future projects will be at a maximum of 5% if not zero.

(iii) Changes in Task Team Leaders should be limited: The frequent change of TTLs , five
over a period of seven years for the Gateway Project is abnormal . This affected the
implementation process as well as outcomes particularly the developer search for the Business
Park. Significant delays in implementation were encountered in some instances due to changes in
TTLs and the fact that some came with different strategies and management styles. Having a
TTL close by in Senegal had a positive impact on the project and this is something that should be
considered where possible for future projects.

(iv) Business Park Concept more suited to the business environment in The Gambia and
sub region: Experience has shown that the concept of a free zone for the sub region and the
Gambia has not been successful so far. This has led to the change of concept from FZ to
Business Park for the site at the airport.
