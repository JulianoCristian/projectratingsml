Gateway Project for Gambia's\n            revised development objectives include: (i) support the\n            Gambia Divestiture Agency and reallocate the funds of this\n            underperforming component to a new component; (ii) capacity\n            building, to further focus the project's scope; (iii)\n            preparatory work for the divestiture of the groundnut\n            sector, to meet an urgent Government request to help improve\n            the performance of the groundnut sector; (iv) restructure\n            the results framework so that it is more focused, simpler,\n            and easier to use as a monitoring and evaluation tool; and\n            (v) funds are reallocated across categories. The original\n            overall project development objective was to lay the\n            foundation for expanded private investment, export-oriented\n            production and employment, through the establishment of the\n            free zone and an improved institutional environment. This\n            objective will be achieved by: establishing a self\n            sustaining Gambia Investment Promotion and Free Zone Agency\n            (GIPZ4) ; marketing and facilitating local and foreign\n            investments in well-targeted economic sectors; developing a\n            10 ha pilot free zone at the airport; helping the Government\n            implement its divestiture program; and mitigating any social\n            and environmental impacts that could result from project implementation."}, "docdt": "2008-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
