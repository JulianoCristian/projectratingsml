"Ratings for the Gateway Project for\n            Gambia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high, the\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the fact that the Government of\n            The Gambia (GoG) changed its commitment towards the DP\n            became a problem. The component was later dropped from the\n            Project without any meaningful impact. It is therefore\n            critical to examine the support for the program in a country\n            prior to incorporating such activities in a project. This\n            leads to the next lesson. Despite the indications of strong\n            commitment by GoG during project preparation robust analysis\n            should have been undertaken on the social impact f its\n            stakeholders. Resistance during implementation emerged from\n            other stakeholders including management of the enterprises\n            to be divested. The Gateway Project had two Project\n            Coordinating Units (PCUs) (Gambia Investment Promotion and\n            Free Zones Agency (GIPFZA) and Gambia Divestiture Agency\n            (GDA)) which did not work and reverted to one PCU (GIPFZA).\n            While a PCU can often be inserted into an institution,\n            project coordination should not distract the agency from its\n            other functions. The head of the PCU can therefore be in an\n            agency but should not be the head of the agency. Field based\n            task teams (including Task Team Leaders (TTLs)) are an\n            effective way for the Bank to provide continuous support to\n            the Borrower. There were five task team leaders over the\n            life of the project. This high rotation resulted in a\n            slowdown in the project implementation pace. It was when the\n            task TTL was field-based and available over a few years,\n            that the project consistently accelerated deliverance of\n            Project Development Objective (PDO) Key Performance\n            Indicators (KPI) results."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
