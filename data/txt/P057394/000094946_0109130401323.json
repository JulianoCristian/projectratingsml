During construction, water\n            spraying surfaces should prevent dusting; preventive\n            measures will be specified to reduce accidental spills,\n            and/or negative impacts on groundwater quality, reducing as\n            well adversity on soil quality, in addition to runoff water\n            contamination; and, a buffer zone of at least 200 meters,\n            should border industrial vs. residential areas, while\n            vegetation propagation should reduce noise, and air\n            pollution. During operation, emission standards, and\n            regulation enforcement should be developed, including\n            monitoring criteria; similarly, effluent discharge\n            standards, and quality control should be developed, to\n            include monitoring of groundwater quality. Further\n            mitigation measures address preventive actions for flora,\n            and fauna protection, cultural heritage protection, and\n            precautions to safeguard marine, and coastal resources. The\n            social management plan focuses on resettlement issues,\n            stipulating no relocation, nor significant effects are\n            envisaged, rather gradual long-term changes will assess the\n            required mitigation, adding that improved housing\n            conditions, and employment opportunities, will positively\n            impact the population's livelihoods."}, "docdt": "2000-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
