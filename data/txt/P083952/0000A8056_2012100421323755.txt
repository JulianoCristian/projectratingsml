                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Nicaragua's broad based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving transportation
                         bottlenecks that currently hinder economic growth and private sector investment. The specific objectives are to support economic growth by: (i) expanding and
                         complementing the previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of secondary and rural roads ; (ii) helping ensure the sustainability of the road
                         improvements, through strengthening of maintenance practices, and (iii) institution building and technical development in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure
                         (MTI) and the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).

                         The parent project for SDR 41 million (US$ 69 million equivalent) was approved on June 8th, 2006. The additional financing for an amount of SDR 30.4 million (US$ 39.3 million) was
                         approved by the Board on June 1st, 2010. The project finances rural road improvement works on priority roads in the productive regions of the country (total target 320km for the
                         whole project), periodic maintenance works on the national trunk road network (total target 80km), routine maintenance works (total target 2700km), and institutional support and
                         capacity building initiatives in the ministry of transport and infrastructure; and in the national road maintenance agency FOMAV. The project has been advancing significantly with the

                         original credit fully implemented. Under the original credit, 197km of rural road improvements were completed. Under the additional financing 113km out of 160km of rural road
                         improvements have been completed. Only a few road works are pending among which is the 18km stretch between Nueva Gunea and Naciones Unidas. Given the closing date of
                         this contract, the project has been extended until June 30th, 2014. The total number of 80km targeted for periodic maintenance on the trunk road network under FOMAV were also
                         successfully executed. Given the infrastructural work, and the work undertaken to strengthen the ministry of transport and the maintenance agency FOMAV to date, the project is
                         progressing satisfactorily towards achieving its objectives.
