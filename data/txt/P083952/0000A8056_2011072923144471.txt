                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Nicaragua's broad based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving
                         transportation bottlenecks that currently hinder economic growth and private sector investment. The specific objectives are to support economic growth by: (i)
                         expanding and complementing the previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of secondary and rural roads ; (ii) helping ensure the
                         sustainability of the road improvements, through strengthening of maintenance practices, and (iii) institution building and technical development in the Ministry
                         of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) and the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).

                         The project has been advancing significantly with 100% of disbursements progress under the original credit and 24% under the Additional Financing (AF), indicating an overall
                         disbursement rate of 68.5%, and is on track toward achieving its development objectives. In terms of physical progress under the original project, Components 1 and 3 have been

                         completed 100%, and only 17 km of the targeted 214 km of adoquines stabilization roads remain to be completed under Component 2 in order to reach the project closing (adoquines
                         stabilization target for Component 2 has been decreased from original 320 km to 214 km due to increased construction costs). The progress of the physical works under the
                         Additional Financing has also been satisfactory: 9 of 11 rural road sections are already under execution for adoquines stabilization with a satisfactory progress (Component 2); 47 km
                         of the Panamericana Norte highway is in the process of bidding by FOMAV for periodic maintenance to reach the original target of 80km, and a target of 2400 km is being routinely
                         maintained (Component 3). The implementation of studies, technical assistance and training for institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) and
                         FOMAV and procurement of goods under Component 4 have been initiated and are progressing at a satisfactory pace. In summary, both MTI and FOMAV have made significant
                         progress in the implementation of different components under the original project and AF, and the project is on course to meeting its development objectives before the revised
                         closing date of 31st December 2012. The preparation process of the new Rural Roads Infrastructure Improvement Project has begun following the decision made at the Project
                         Concept Note Review Meeting in May 2011. The interventions and activities under the components proposed in the new project have been discussed and agreed with the MTI and
                         FOMAV during the last mission, including the list of the 88km of rural road sections in the productive areas selected based on economic and social criteria analysis.
