                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Nicaragua's broad based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving transportation
                         bottlenecks that currently hinder economic growth and private sector investment. The specific objectives are to support economic growth by: (i) expanding and
                         complementing the previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of secondary and rural roads ; (ii) helping ensure the sustainability of the road
                         improvements, through strengthening of maintenance practices, and (iii) institution building and technical development in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure
                         (MTI) and the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).

                         The project is significantly advanced in its implementation, with a highly satisfactory performance. The parent project for SDR 41 million (US$ 69 million equivalent) was approved on
                         June 8th, 2006. The additional financing for an amount of SDR 30.4 million (US$ 39.3 million) was approved on June 1st, 2010. The project finances rural road improvement works on
                         priority roads in the productive regions of the country (total target 320km for the whole project), periodic maintenance works on the national trunk road network (total target 80km),
                         routine maintenance works through the use of micro-enterprises (total target 2700km), and institutional support and capacity building initiatives in the Ministry of Transport and

                         Infrastructure (MTI), and in the national road maintenance agency FOMAV. The original credit is fully implemented. Under the original credit, 197km of rural road improvements were
                         completed. Under the additional financing 153km of rural road improvements have been completed to date giving a grand total of 350km (greater than the original 320km target). A
                         few road works are pending among which are about 3km on the stretch between Nueva Guinea and Naciones Unidas, and works on the El Jicarral- Santa Rosa del Penon (6km).
                         The latter was approved to use up the remaining financing under the rural roads improvement component. The total number of 80km targeted for periodic maintenance on the trunk
                         road network under FOMAV were also successfully executed. Project estimates indicate about 785,000 direct beneficiaries in the sections financed under the project, with improved
                         access for local populations to markets and services, and with improved transit conditions and improved reliability on the road network being maintained throughout the country. The
                         community modules approach with a predominance on the use of local labor, materials and technology has also been highly successful with the generation of short-term employment
                         opportunities, enhancement of technical and entrepreneurial skills and engendering of a sense of community and ownership of the roads. It is expected that all project activities will be
                         completed before the project closing date of June 30th, 2014.
