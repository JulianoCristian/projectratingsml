                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to support the Government of Nicaragua's broad based economic growth and poverty reduction plan by relieving transportation
                         bottlenecks that currently hinder economic growth and private sector investment. The specific objectives are to support economic growth by: (i) expanding and
                         complementing the previous focus on trunk roads by improving a connecting network of secondary and rural roads ; (ii) helping ensure the sustainability of the road
                         improvements, through strengthening of maintenance practices, and (iii) institution building and technical development in the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure
                         (MTI) and the Road Maintenance Fund (FOMAV).
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The parent project for SDR 41 million (US$ 69 million equivalent) was approved on June 8th, 2006. The additional financing for an amount of SDR 30.4 million (US$ 39.3 million) was
                         approved by the Board on June 1st, 2010. The project finances rural road improvement works on priority roads in the productive regions of the country (total target 320km), periodic
                         maintenance works on the national trunk road network (total target 80km), routine maintenance works (total target 2700km), and institutional support and capacity building initiatives
                         in the ministry of transport and infrastructure; and in the national road maintenance agency FOMAV. The project has been advancing significantly with 100% of disbursements

                         progress under the original credit and 41% under the Additional Financing (AF), indicating an overall disbursement rate of 81%. The project has been on a fast track toward achieving
                         its development objectives before the closing date of December 31st, 2012. However, delays in contracting procedures under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for an 18km
                         stretch on the Nueva Guinea-Naciones Unidas section may necessitate project closing date extension.
