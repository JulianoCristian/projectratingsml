1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background

1.      At appraisal, Armenia had increased its public expenditure on education, and
Armenia’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, prepared in 2008, indicated the aim of
the government to raise education spending to 4.5 percent of the gross domestic product by
2021. Despite its strong commitment to education, it was expected that the government may
be forced to reduce education spending in response to the global economic crisis, which
resulted in Armenia’s real gross domestic product falling by 14.1 percent in 2009 and its
poverty rate increasing to 34.1 percent (from 27.6 percent in 2008).

2.      At the time of appraisal, Armenia had high average enrollment rates at all levels of
education, except at the preschool level where the enrollment rate was at an all-time low of
22 percent. The enrollment rate and the quality of preschool education sharply declined after
the funding and management responsibilities for early childhood education were transferred
from the central government to local governments under the Decentralization Law of 1996.
At the higher education level, although the government had not increased spending on higher
education, enrollments had been rapidly growing due to the high reliance on private spending
that mitigated the lack of government funding, which raised an equity concern as there was
limited access to higher education among the poor. However, tertiary education was regarded
as key to helping the country build a competitive knowledge economy, and in 2005, Armenia
joined the Bologna Process, committing substantial resources in an effort to build a strong
tertiary education sector in line with international standards. At project appraisal, the
government had just approved the Strategic Program for Reforms in Preschool Education of
the Republic of Armenia (2008–2015). The Program was supported by the first phase of the
Adaptable Program Loan (APL 1) and it sought to increase preschool enrollment to 90 percent
by 2015.1 The government also approved the Strategic Program for High School Reform in
2008 which aimed to improve the quality of education at the high school level by more
efficiently allocating resources and facilities.

Rationale for World Bank Assistance

3.      In 2003, the government set out an Education Sector Reform Program, with the
objective of improving the quality and relevance of the Armenian school system to meet the
challenges of the knowledge society.2 A Sustainable Development Program (SDP) covering
2009–2012 was prepared by the government in 2008. The SDP aligned with the Education
Sector Reform Program, and specified improvement in the access and quality of education—
from preschool to higher education—as key priories that would lead to accelerated poverty
reduction and economic growth. Aligned with the SDP, the Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) for Armenia (FY2009–2012) highlighted the Bank’s support to Armenia’s education
sector as a key priority, and placed particular emphasis on improving the quality and

1
  As referenced in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the government initially targeted to achieve
preschool enrollment of 90 percent by 2015, but primarily because of the economic crisis in 2009, the target
was postponed to 2017.

accessibility of preschool education, improving the quality of high school education, and
strengthening higher education through integration with the European Higher Education Area
in line with the Bologna Process.

4.      With Bank support, the first phase of the APL (APL 1) in support of the Education
Sector Reform Program enhanced the efficiency of sector management, upgraded the quality
and relevance of education, and improved the evaluation of sector performance. Many of the
activities supported under the APL 1 were either carried over from or formed the basis of
activities for the second phased of the APL (APL 2). A summary of the activities under the
APL 1 that carried over into the APL 2 are presented in annex 10. The second phase of the
APL, the subject of this Implementation and Completion Results Report (ICR), continued to
focus on the reforms of the general education system that were the primary focus of APL 1,
and also addressed key issues in both preschool and higher education areas that are closely
related to general education reforms, thus aligning with the SDP and CPS objectives and
responding to the government’s demand for support of an expanded sector agenda. Following
the implementation of the Education Financing and Management Reform project (P008281,
closed on October 31, 2002) and APL 1 (P074503, closed on November 30, 2009) as well as
the completion of the Public Expenditure Review of the Education Sector (2008) and the
technical assistance (TA) provided in the areas of quality assurance (QA) and Higher
Education Financing (2008), the Bank team was well positioned to continue to support the
expanded reform agenda under APL 2.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.     The project was the second phase of the APL of a 10-year program divided into three
phases (4, 3, and 3 years). The overall objective of the program was to improve the quality
and relevance of the Armenian school system to meet the challenges of the knowledge society.
While APL 1 and APL 2 had project specific outcome indicators, the overall program,
according to a government document included in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of
APL 13, only had possible outcome indicators for each of the phases of the program.

6.      According to the Credit Agreement of APL 1, the objective of APL 1 was to support
the first phase of the Borrower’s Program through: (a) improving and strengthening the
efficiency of the education sector to meet the challenges of a knowledge economy; (b)
upgrading the quality and relevance of the school education system; and (c) improving the
evaluation of the education system’s performance.4 The single outcome indicator for this
project was the same as the one listed by the government as a possible program outcome under
phase one. Given the strong performance of the first phase of the APL, it was decided that

  Development Credit Agreement No. 3849-AM. The PDO specified in the APL 1 PAD differed from the
project objective indicated in the APL 1 Credit Agreement. According to the PAD, the project’s development
objective was the same as the Program’s overall development objective, which was to “improve the quality
and relevance of the Armenian school system to meet the challenges of the knowledge society."

                                                    2
the second and third phases would be merged into a single project (referred to as the second
phase of the APL, or APL 2), the subject of this ICR. Annex 11 presents more details.

7.     The PDOs of APL 2 were to (i) enhance school learning in general education and
improve the school readiness of children entering primary education; and (ii) support the
integration of the tertiary education system into the European Higher Education Area.

8.    Progress toward achieving the PDOs of APL 2 was to be measured using the following
outcome indicators5:

               Improved Early Development Index (EDI) scores of students in kindergarten
                (KG) and schools receiving the grants with regard to students in the control
                group.

               Improved examination and test scores in project-targeted schools (TIMSS 2011
                and Unified Entrance Examination).

               Standings of Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard improving from Orange and
                Yellow to Green.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      There were no changes to the PDO during implementation. However, during the
restructuring that was signed by the Regional Director on September 10, 2014 (and
countersigned by the government on October 28, 2014) the project’s PDO indicator –

    The Project Description section of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (page 5, paragraph 19) states:

                   To measure the impact of the proposed operation, a series of outcome
                   indicators have been identified: (i) increased preschool enrollments; (ii)
                   improved school readiness among entering first graders in participating
                   communities; (iii) improvement of learning outcomes of 8th graders as
                   measured by TIMSS 2011 and of the 12th graders by the Armenian unified
                   examination, using the 2007 and 2009 results as the baseline, respectively;
                   (iv) in higher education, enhanced program and institution accreditation
                   and quality assurance as measured by the reports produced by the new
                   Armenian National Quality assurance Agency (ANQA) and eventually its
                   acquiring the status of candidate member to the European Network of
                   Quality Assurance Agencies; and (v) standings of Armenia in the Bologna
                   Scorecard (both in the overall score and partial scores related to the quality
                   assurance, recognition and program structure). These indicators will also
                   be complemented with other indicators which are component-specific (See
                   Annex 3).

When comparing the indicators listed in the Results Framework (Annex 3 of the PAD, p. 26-28), indicators
(ii), (iii), and (v) were included as project outcome indicators. Indicators (i) and (iv) referenced in the
aforementioned paragraph were not included in the Results Framework, however they were mostly achieved
by project closing.

                                                         3
“Improved examination and test scores in project-targeted schools (TIMSS 2011 and Unified
Entrance Examinations)” – was replaced by two indicators:

       Share of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam.

       Gross graduation rate in upper secondary education.

10.     There were two reasons for this adjustment. First, because preparatory activities for
the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2011 were launched in
January 2009 and the field tests were carried out in April 2010, only six months after the
project became effective on October 2, 2009, the project could not have had an important
impact on student learning that could have been reflected by the assessment. Second, the
Unified Entrance Examinations (UEEs) were not designed to be comparable from year to
year, and were therefore not appropriate indicators to use to measure and track project
outcomes.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The project’s main beneficiaries included students, parents, and communities;
schools, teachers, librarians, and school administrative staff; higher education institutions
(HEIs); professional development providers; key sector institutions, including the National

1.6 Revised Components

21.    Under the restructuring that was signed by the Regional Director on August 7, 2012
(and countersigned by the government on February 5, 2013) the following subcomponents
were revised:

       (a) The coverage of subcomponent 1.1 was expanded as a result of the high demand
           and commitment of communities to expand preschool education.

       (b) Subcomponent 2.1 was expanded to include state universities not originally
           covered by the project, and to increase the individual grant sizes given that
           additional resources were required to build an Internal Quality Assurance (IQA)
           System in large institutions.

       (c) Subcomponent 2.3 was revised to drop the design of the student loan scheme (the
           government considered that the introduction of a student loan scheme should be
           implemented under better socioeconomic conditions) and to expand the scope of
           ‘developing innovative financing mechanism through the Competitive
           Innovation Fund (CIF) in support of quality improvements and innovations in
           tertiary education institutions.’ While the original project design envisaged only
           the development of the CIF with implementation to take place at a later stage,
           following the design of the CIF, the government requested the Bank’s support to
           pilot the CIF under this project.

22.     Consistent with the above changes, the project’s monitoring arrangements and Results
Framework were adjusted, and US$1.5 million originally allocated to subcomponent 2.3 were
reallocated across other activities as detailed in annex 13.

1.7 Other significant changes

23.    In addition to the changes described above, the following significant changes took
place.

24.     Under the second restructuring that took place in 2014, the project closing date
was extended by 12 months to November 30, 2015 to allow for sufficient time to (a) pilot
the CIF and carry out grant audits at completion, and (b) direct existing preschool micro-
project savings toward the expansion of preschool education micro-projects and high school
refurbishment.

25.    A number of project activities originally to be financed by the project were
financed by non-project sources, as decided by the Prime Minister’s Office. These
                                             6
activities, primarily trainings, workshops and consultancy assignments, were implemented
using national and local resources. The shifting of activities to be covered under other national
and local sources freed up funding for project-initiated and supported activities that were not
covered by other sources.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

26.      Adequacy of government commitment. The project addressed the government’s
priorities and counted upon its continued commitment and ownership at the central, marz, and
community levels. Armenia’s SDP covering 2009–2012 set the improvement of the education
sector as one of the key development priorities. The Strategic Program for Reforms in
Preschool Education of the Republic of Armenia (2008–2015) was further committed to
strengthening the quality of primary and secondary education through improving the school
readiness of children entering primary education. Project design was also aligned with the
State Program for Establishment of the High School System, approved in 2008, that aimed to
create a more diversified upper secondary education. Armenia’s participation in the Bologna
Process reflected the country’s commitment to reform its tertiary education in alignment with
international standards.

27.     Soundness of the knowledge base and implementation experience. Project design
benefitted from the 2008 World Bank Public Expenditure Review for the Education Sector
with particular focus on preschool and high school education, and other analytical studies and
reports. 7 Lessons from the APL 1 and from international experience informed project
preparation and design, including lessons from the piloting of the preschool micro-projects
and high school reform, the student loan scheme, and CIFs.

28.      Coherency within the APL framework. As discussed in section 1.1, the APL 2 was
part of the Bank’s longer-term support to the government’s Education Sector Reform Program
2003–2013. The project was responsive to the reform needs in the sector and closely aligned
with government and CPS priorities. The project built upon the achievements of the first
phase of the APL and its objectives were consistent with the program’s objectives as were
outcome indicators.

29.     Adequacy of the preparation process. Project preparation was highly participatory
and benefitted from extensive consultations with key stakeholders (including other donors
and the private sector) and direct beneficiaries. The Bank team comprised seasoned technical
staff with expertise in key areas such as general education, early childhood development, and
higher education. A Quality Enhancement Review was conducted and the advice of the
Quality Enhancement Review Panel was integrated into project design, including the
formulation of the PDO.

                                                    7
30.      Project design, including the project’s organization, objectives and components, were
realistic and in line with the objectives and goals of the program. The risk assessment
assumptions made at appraisal reflected a good understanding of the education sector and
appropriate mitigating measures were incorporated to address the risks identified at the
preparation stage.

31.     The quality of linkages between the PDO, PDO-level indicators, intermediate
outcome indicators, and certain activities varied across indicators. The linkages related to the
“Improving the school readiness of children entering primary education” and “Supporting the
integration of the tertiary education system into the European higher education area” portions
of the PDO were relevant and strong. However, while the corresponding indicator to measure
school readiness was an appropriate one, the use of the Unified Entrance Examinations and
TIMSS 2011 were not appropriate indicators, as discussion in Section 2.3 of this document.

32.    A second shortcoming with regard to project preparation was the use of a
disbursement condition affecting the entire credit that required all component and
subcomponent heads to be in place at the Center for Education Projects (CEP). Absence of
these key staff members may have been a signal that the project was not fully ready for
implementation upon signing.8

2.2 Implementation

33.     Project implementation initially got off to a slow start. The Credit was signed on
June 5, 2009, and became effective on October 2, 2009. The disbursement condition
mentioned in section 2.1 was met when the higher education component head was hired in
January 2010. For almost two years, up to September 2011 (at which point 7 percent of the
Credit had been disbursed), implementation was generally slow, being affected in part by the
Bank’s failure to provide timely technical assistance and No Objections. Following the
September 2011 implementation support mission, project activities ramped up and significant
implementation progress was made.

34.     The Midterm Review (MTR) in December 2012 took stock of the project’s status
and highlighted key achievements and challenges. Project implementation progress was
discussed with a broad range of stakeholders, and the Bank team evaluated the progress of
project activities. The MTR assessed that the progress toward the achievement of the PDO
was Moderately Satisfactory considering that the EDI of students in preschools and KG
receiving grants relative to students in a control group, and Armenia’s standing on key
indicators in the Bologna Scorecard improved, while the performance of Armenian students
in TIMSS 2011 as compared to 2007 and 2003 decreased. Intermediate indicators were mostly
on track indicating that achievement of the PDOs was likely. The MTR assessed overall
implementation progress as Satisfactory considering that most of the core project activities
were on track toward achieving the intended results. The MTR also identified project areas
requiring fine-tuning through a restructuring, which was countersigned by the government on
February 5, 2013. At the time of the MTR, the project had disbursed 49 percent of the Credit.


8
 The project could not disburse until component and subcomponent heads were hired in the Center for
Education Projects (CEP), which served as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

                                                    8
35.     The first project restructuring that was signed by the Regional Director on
August 7, 2012 (and countersigned by the government on February 5, 2013) clarified a
number of indicators in the Results Framework and adjusted project activities to
respond to changes in government priorities. As part of this restructuring, some project
indicators were revised to accommodate the changes to Subcomponent 2.3 as discussed in
section 1.6, to adjust the intermediate target values to reflect the implementation process, and
to reword intermediate indicators to support appropriate measurement at project completion.
Importantly, the restructuring allowed for the Credit to be used to address key government
priorities that were in the beginning stages of development, such as the implementation of the
preschool micro-projects and the pilot CIF, while at the same time providing the government
with the opportunity to use other national and local resources to institutionalize activities for
which the project had already built momentum.

36.     The timeline and composition of project activities were adjusted during
implementation. In response to the Prime Minister’s Office instructions, certain project
activities were no longer supported under the project but were instead supported using other
national resources, thus freeing up project funds to be used for other key activities.

37.     A second project restructuring that was signed by the Regional Director on
September 10, 2014 (and countersigned by the government on October 28, 2014)
replaced one PDO indicator and extended the project closing date. The project was
designed to be implemented over five years but benefited from a 12-month extension of its
closing date as discussed in section 1.7, allowing for sufficient time to successfully complete
activities, including piloting of the CIF, increasing the number of preschools benefitting from
micro-projects from 140 as originally envisaged to 280, and expanding the number of high
schools benefitting from refurbishment from 105 as originally planned to 195.

38.     At project closing, most project outcomes and outputs had been achieved, with a
few moderate shortcomings. The project was never at risk and at project closing, more than
95 percent of project funds had been disbursed. However, although TEMIS was developed
and functionally available to use at project closing, official requirements had not been
introduced to ensure that TEMIS would, in fact, be used (for example, there was no mandate
for universities to enter data into the system or to create reports using the entered data; there
were no deadline requirements for entering the data into TEMIS or for using the data).
Therefore, although TEMIS was successfully developed under the project, at the time of this
review it was not being used in a comprehensive or heterogeneous manner across universities
or by MoES for the purpose of producing reports or planning. Discussions are underway to
identify the best approach to ensure the use of TEMIS particularly in light of existing data
management responsibilities at the universities. Additionally, the target of 7 public and 7
private universities evaluated against the newly developed QA standards, criteria, procedures,
and guidelines was partially achieved as 10 public but only 5 private universities were in fact
evaluated. It should be noted, however, that the five private universities that were evaluated
under the project are considered to be the main private universities in the country.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
39.     M&E design. The PAD laid out the basic arrangements for data collection and results
reporting. The indicators, including the PDO-level indicators in the M&E framework, were

                                               9
largely relevant and adequate to measure the results chain, and implementation arrangements
for M&E were identified in the PAD. At the same time, a number of issues were observed.
Baselines and targets for most of the indicators were not set as of project effectiveness, and a
provision for their identification was not included; by project closing, two baselines were still
not set. Project documents prepared during implementation highlighted the need to prioritize
the revision and consolidation of the M&E and the Results Framework, which was indeed
done during both of the restructurings. As a results, two PDO indicators (“share of test-takers
passing the 9th grade graduation exam” and “gross graduation rate in upper secondary
education”) were introduced as part of the second project restructuring. Although the “share
of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam” and the “gross graduation rate in upper
secondary education” were already relatively high prior to the implementation of project
interventions, and were also likely influenced by factors outside of the scope of the project,
the ICR team agrees that they were the best available measures that allowed to capture the
improved relevance and delivery of education.

40.     M&E implementation. Appropriate data was generally collected in a timely manner.
Project indicators were regularly monitored during implementation, and reported on in the
Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRs). The two restructurings mostly addressed
the limitations of the M&E design, further defining indicators, baselines, and targets, and as
discussed in section 2.2, making the Results Framework more appropriate for monitoring
project outputs and outcomes. Adjustments were also introduced to better capture the PDO
progress based on the Bologna Scorecard by identifying and monitoring the nine indicators
that were consistent across the scorecards that were published in different years (annex 14).
At the same time, the following issues remained. Indicators related to teacher training were
not dropped as part of the first restructuring, although the associated activities were dropped.
Also, the PDO indicator “Improved EDI scores of students in KG and schools receiving the
grants with regard to students in the control group” was monitored using a series of studies
that measured the development outcomes of children before and after their one-year
participation in preschool and of a control group of children, but the development outcome of
the control group was measured only once, at the time when the treatment group finished one
year of preschool. This methodology presents limitations as it does not allow for the
measurement of the differentiated gains between participants and non-participants between
two time points. Finally, it is not clear why the PDO indicator “Improved examination and
tests scores in project-targeted schools (TIMSS 2011 and Unified Entrance Examination)”
that was ultimately dropped as part of the second restructuring was not addressed in the first
restructuring.

41.     M&E utilization. Timely data were collected and used to monitor and improve
project performance and results on the ground. The M&E system strengthening went beyond
the project itself. NaCET, which is responsible for the Educational Management Information
System (EMIS), has substantially strengthened its capacity to collect, analyze, and report
sector performance indicators. Its website acts as a useful data portal, and its annual statistical
report provides the most up-to-date information on sector achievement and challenges. M&E
arrangements are expected to be sustained at the CEP, which continues to carry out M&E
activities of the Armenia Education Improvement Project (EIP) (P130182) that was approved
by the Board on March 13, 2014.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
                                                10
42.    The project was classified as category C for its low impact on the environment. No
safeguard policies were triggered.

43.     Fiduciary Management. The financial management arrangements in place at the
CEP including budgeting and planning, accounting, financial reporting, flow of funds,
external audits, organization and staffing arrangements were overall satisfactory and
acceptable to the Bank during the entire life of the project. The CEP maintained an adequate
internal control system, while the few minor deficiencies in the internal control system
observed during project implementation were effectively and successfully addressed by the
CEP. The project’s fiduciary management was consistently rated satisfactory during the life
of the project. The Interim Financial Reports of the project were submitted on time, reviewed,
and found to be acceptable to the Bank. The auditor issued unmodified (clean) opinions on
all financial statements, which were received on time, and no major issues were raised by the
auditor in the management letters. Similarly, all CIF grants’ financial statements received
unmodified (clean) opinions.

44.     Procurement. The procurement process was generally considered moderately
satisfactory for the majority of project implementation. Delays in the Bank’s no objection
before September 2011 slowed the procurement process. Additionally, issues such as the lack
of competition in procurement (which resulted in rebidding in some cases) affected
procurement and contract implementation. At times, the MoES had difficulty filling key staff
positions, and staff members had to take on responsibilities in addition to their primary job
duties. With the support from the Bank team particularly following September 2011, the CEP
addressed and resolved procurement issues in an efficient and effective manner.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.      The transition arrangements for the operation of key project activities are adequate
and comprehensive. A large number of activities have been incorporated into a follow-up
operation, the Education Improvement Project (P130182) approved in March 2014,
particularly those requiring long-term support to produce the expected outcomes, such as in
the areas of preschool and upper secondary education, curriculum revisions, integration of
information and communication technology (ICT), and the mainstreaming the CIF.
Importantly, the government has mainstreamed key activities and initiatives that were started
under the project: it took over the financial responsibilities for preschools (or communities in
the case of KGs) following the project’s initial one-year support to preschool micro-projects;
absorbed the oversight for training and capacity building of teachers; and supported the
development and implementation of a student loan scheme that is benefitting students who
would otherwise not be able to afford higher education. The government is also financing all
of the work associated with the QA systems (at the ANQA and at universities) that were
developed under the project. Thus, the government has effectively used project resources to
initiate reforms, while putting in place the necessary institutional, capacity, and financial
arrangements to sustainably implement these reforms beyond project closing.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation


                                              11
46.     The relevance of project’s objectives, design and implementation is rated as High.
The project’s priorities were consistent with the government’s priorities and with the Bank’s
CPS when it was prepared, and continue to be highly relevant and consistent with the
country’s development priorities as specified in the Armenia Development Strategy (ADS)
for 2014–2025 and the Bank’s 2013 CPS for the Republic of Armenia FY2014–2017. In the
ADS, Armenia recognizes the importance of quality human resources for ensuring long-term
economic development.9 Similarly, the Employment Strategy 2013–2018 of the Republic of
Armenia aims to improve education and training to address the constraints to job creation and
the bottlenecks for relevant skill formation. The latest five-year sector development strategy,
the Education Development 2016–2025 State Programme of the Republic of Armenia, also
continues to support education objectives at all levels of education, confirming the high
relevance of project objectives and interventions. The project’s design was aligned with key
policy priorities in the country and the overarching objectives of the government program that
was supported by the APL. Throughout its implementation, the project supported the
necessary capacity building of key stakeholders, ensuring that its activities were completed
successfully during the project and were sustainable beyond project closing. Project supported
activities were adequately adjusted in response to the country’s changing circumstances and
priorities, and remained relevant throughout the project. The Bank’s implementation
assistance was responsive to project needs and priorities as well. Thus, overall, project
activities were relevant at the design stage and continued to be relevant during
implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.   The achievement of the PDO is rated as Substantial. Achievements of the aspects of
the PDO are addressed below and detailed in annex 15.

48.     Enhancing school learning in general education. The achievement of this objective
is rated substantial as measured by the availability and use of educational inputs in schools
and the impact of teacher training in the classrooms, leading to tangible improvements in
student passing and graduation rates. At project closing, the associated PDO indicator “share
of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam” increased from 96.7 percent to 99.8
percent, a small but important change considering the increasing difficulty of reaching the last
five percent of students. The original end-of-project target was 99 percent. Similarly, the
“gross graduation rate in upper secondary education” reached its target of 90 percent at project
closing, from 85.95 percent at baseline.10



9
 The relevant ADS goals to which the project aligns include improving the quality of the general secondary
education; improving the quality and accessibility of preschool education; assuring the quality of general
education and the implementation of the mission of upper secondary schools, including through refurbishment
and support for educational materials; and improving the quality and streamlining professional education to
ensure its alignment with the demands of the labor market and the country’s strategic educational and
scientific development goals, including the provisions of Bologna and Turin Agreements.
10
   The PDO indicator “share of test takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam” is a measure of quality that
informs this objective. The PDO indicator “gross graduation rate in upper secondary education” is also a
measure of quality and systemic efficiency, and the interventions under Subcomponents 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4
improved the quality, relevance, and delivery of education to upper secondary school students, more of whom
have graduated from upper secondary education that has been improved by the project.
                                                     12
49.     Improved quality of teaching in general secondary school classrooms was achieved
through support for the training of all teachers in professional development and innovative
teaching methods. As a result of the training, the teaching style and behavior of teachers in
the classroom changed. For example, by project closing, the majority of trained teachers were
applying innovative teaching methodology in the classroom; and the percentage of teachers
solely using the presentation/recitation mode of teaching decreased from 43 percent in 2011
to 32 percent in 2012.11 By 2015, 74 percent of teachers were intensively using computer and
other digital materials, as compared to 25 percent in 2008. Twenty-five percent of principals
were also trained by the Union of School Centers on designing and implementing school
development plans. This training has been distributed to all schools and made publically
available on the NaCET website. However, information was not collected to assess how
principals have applied what they learned in their trainings, particularly with regard to school
development plans. Importantly, project activities in support of this objective helped to
develop Article 26 of the Law on General Education of Armenia regarding the provisions of
teacher attestation in the country, as well as the Decree on Awarding Ranks to School
Teachers and its subsequent revision.

50.     With project support, resource centers (which include laboratory and library materials,
as well as appropriate furniture and equipment) were established in all high schools, and all
high school students visited them. Schools also benefitted from furniture, computer labs, and
printers. Internet connectivity and computer resources supported through the project have
made possible the introduction of an educational network, connecting all public schools and
22 vocational education institutions via the Intranet. An updated version of the School
Management Information System (SMIS) has been installed in all public and some private
schools, and NaCET has trained approximately 1,388 school representatives, mostly
principals, on the use of SMIS software.

51.     Improving the school readiness of children entering primary education.
Achievement of this objective is rated as high. Specifically, the project provided grants to
support one preschool in each of the 280 communities, including in poor and disadvantaged
communities. Although during the project preparation it was envisaged that 140 communities
and 8,750 children would benefit, the project exceeded its objective, and 280 communities
and approximately 35,451 children benefitted as it was possible to complete some micro-
projects with less financing, therefore freeing up resources to significantly expand the
coverage of this intervention to other communities. As of project closing, all of the preschools
continued to be fully operational. The Ministry of Education, United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF), and Step-by-Step Foundation provided the necessary training to preschool
teachers and marz administrative staff.

52.     In meetings with parents and marz authorities, they reported that the school readiness
of their children after participating in the preschool micro-projects was high. Albeit the
measurement limitations discussed in section 2.3, consistent with this anecdotal evidence are
the findings of a survey of the students, which indicate that, on average, the EDI score was

11
  By 2013, the government mainstreamed the NIE’s responsibility for teacher training to maximize the
efficiency of public funding, particularly because the NIE was already mandated with teacher training
activities and it had full capacity supported by public funding to carry out those activities. As a result, the NIE
became solely responsible for teacher training and benefitted from the teacher training materials developed
under the project.
                                                        13
19 percent higher in the treatment than in the control group. Importantly, the project activities
in support of this objective have been sustained through the Strategic Program for Reforms in
Preschool Education of the Republic of Armenia (2008–2015), which includes per-student
financing arrangements that ensure the sustainability of preschools beyond the project.

53.    Supporting the integration of the tertiary education system into the European
Higher Education area. The achievement of this objective is rated as modest strictly on the
basis of the corresponding outcome indicator having only partially achieved its target
(Armenia’s standing in the Bologna Scorecard according the published stocktaking reports of
the Bologna Process). Despite important developments in the area of higher education in the
country, 5 out of 9 indicators were green at project closing, compared to the target of 75
percent of indicators being green (i.e. at least 7 out of 9 indicators).

54.      At the same time, the ICR team notes that the project’s contributions to Armenia’s
tertiary education system with not much more than US$8 million were remarkable, including
the accreditation of 15 HEIs, the establishment of Internal Quality Assurance Units in all 26
HEIs, the hosting of the Bologna Ministerial Conference in Yerevan for the first time outside
of continental Europe, and the introduction of TEMIS in 183 higher and vocational education
institutions. Other project achievements include support for higher education financing,
revision of teacher education curricula, and not only the design but also the piloting of the
CIF. Specifically, the project provided technical assistance for the development of a higher
education financing strategy in 2011 and, in combination with the government’s support for
student loan activities, by project closing 14 commercial banks had been selected to provide
loans to students on various terms. Furthermore, as a result of the partnership between Oulu
University and Armenian State Pedagogical University all pre-service teacher education
curricula in Armenia have become comparable to a typical Bologna program. Importantly,
the CIF projects allowed university students to gain key exposure to subjects and topics that
were directly relevant to the labor market, and the teaching employed within the context of
the CIF projects utilized the latest technologies and innovations, thus improving the quality
and relevance of student learning. The 10 grantee universities successfully implemented their
projects.

55.     Furthermore, one of the original five triggers from the originally-envisaged APL 2 to
APL 3, “New policy and implementation plan for cost-efficient reform of student social and
support services agreed with the Bank and approved by the government,” that was not met at
appraisal was met as part of the Higher Education Financing Strategy approved by the
Government on June 30, 2011. The subsequent Criteria for Assessment of the Students’
Financial Capacity and Student Financial Support Program and associated regulations were
approved by the Government in 2012. As a result, beginning in the 2013-2014 school year,
students from socially vulnerable and poor families have benefited from financial support
from the Government in pursuing higher education. Depending on the needs of students’ from
vulnerable or poor families (as determined by the Ministry of Labour and Social Services),
students receive 50 percent to 100 percent financial support from the Government in pursuing
higher education. Twenty percent of students in higher education institutions benefit from
such support and approximately 4,000 students have benefitted from the program since its
inception. The Law on Higher Education of 2004 is still in force and mandates that higher
education institutions provide scholarships (of up to 30 percent of tuition fees) to up to ten

                                               14
percent of the student body that has financial limitations in pursuing higher education
opportunities.

56.     On the TEMIS, the ICR team notes the following shortcomings: The initial national
report on higher education statistics generated through TEMIS was originally envisaged to be
available at the end of the academic year 2015–2016; however, only some institutions have
started data entry, and in many cases, the data entered is incomplete. It is not yet mandatory
for universities to use TEMIS and the government is currently reviewing options to mandate
its use. Thus, the intermediate indicator of 5 public and 2 private universities
producing/updating a strategic plan and self-assessment reports using information collected
through TEMIS was not met by project closing. The information provided by TEMIS at
project closing was also not adequate for the MoES’ annual report on higher education for
planning and budgeting purposes. Discussions are underway to identify the best approach to
ensure the use of TEMIS particularly in light of existing data management responsibilities at
the universities.

57.      Overall, the project’s contributions to Armenia’s tertiary education system
exceeded expectations but due to the fact that the related outcome indicator was not met, the
ICR team feels bound to rate this portion of the PDO as modest.

3.3 Efficiency

58.     Efficiency is rated as Modest.

59.     The economic and financial analysis provided in the PAD included limited data and
did not attempt to quantify the Economic Rate of Return, the Net Present Value, or conduct
an expected or projected benefit/cost analysis for project components or subcomponents.
Instead, the economic and financial analysis section in the PAD presented a general discussion
on the expected (a) cost-effectiveness of investing in preschool education, (b) cost-
effectiveness of investing in the ICT network and its integration in the teaching and learning
process, and (c) cost-efficiency and quality improvement of high school reforms.

60.    The project was expected to benefit 140 communities and 8,750 children in total over
5 years. In fact, 280 communities and 11,694 children benefitted from the first year of
preschool that the project supported. The government and communities absorbed the costs of
the preschools after the first year of project support. At project closing, all preschools and
KGs that were supported by the project in their first year were still operating. Overall, a total
of 35,451 children benefitted from the existence of a preschool or KG in their community
over the life of the project. The expansion of coverage to more beneficiaries was due to the
more efficient use of resources.

61.     The ICR team conducted a benefit/cost analysis for the investment in preschool
education. 12 In general, preschool education is associated with better cognitive and non-
cognitive skills that create better outcomes in the labor market and adult life indicators (such
as better health, lower criminality, better-informed voters, and so on). The model used in this

  The benefit/cost analysis was not conducted for other subcomponents as they were primarily capacity
building in nature and a quantifiable analysis would have required making many arbitrary assumptions,
undermining the accuracy of conclusions.
                                                    15
analysis assumes that the expansion and quality enhancement of pre-primary education would
lead to more years of schooling (including higher education graduates). Children would also
be more likely to finish high school and progress to higher education, which in turn would
lead to higher productivity and income, and less unemployment. The benefit of this
subcomponent comes from the higher expected income generated by a more qualified and
educated workforce.

62.     In quantifying these benefits, it is found that one year of preschool correlates with a
half-year increase in schooling. 13 Using the 2013 (latest available) Integrated Living
Conditions Survey data, the returns to one more year of schooling were found to be 2.8 percent
for males and 3.6 percent for females. It is calculated that a half-year increase in schooling—
the potential benefit of one year of preschool—results in a benefit/cost ratio of 5.04 for males
and 6.83 for females. In general, this is an underestimate of the benefit given that these
calculations reflect only private returns. Social returns to education can be more important in
some cases. A more detailed analysis is presented in annex 3.

63.     The benefit/cost ration estimates are close to the benefit/cost ratios of preschool
interventions in other countries. For example, the benefit/cost ratio of similar early childhood
development interventions in the Mexico Compensatory Education Project (P101369) was
found to be 6.47. In the Indonesia Early Childhood Education and Development Project
(P089479), the benefit/cost ratio was found to be 4.3 (these projects did not conduct
benefit/cost analysis by gender). The benefit/cost ratios for the APL 2 are also consistent with
those of the High/Scope Perry Preschool Study (Executive Office of the President of the
United States 2014)14 which has a benefit/cost ratio of 6.2.15

64.    The actual costs of various project activities are in general aligned with those
estimated at appraisal, with the exception of activities related to the preschool micro-projects,
where the costs per micro-project were lower than anticipated, allowing for significantly more
communities and more children to benefit from the micro-projects as discussed in section 3.2.
Additionally, project implementation was very efficient particularly given that the project was
implemented with administrative costs that were almost half of the original projections.

65.      Although not quantifiable at this stage, overall sector efficiency gain is likely a result
of the two activities supported by the project: high school reform and tertiary education
improvement. For high school reform, efficiency gains are likely to come from the economies
of scale that have resulted from strategically grouping high school students and teachers,
leading to more efficient use of resources and facilities, such as laboratories and libraries. At
the tertiary level, structural changes particularly with regard to QA will lead to better
institution management and accountability to public and private resources, and eventually

   “The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study provided preschool to low-income African-Americans at high risk
of failing in school in Ypsilanti, Michigan during the 1960s. Perry is one of the most well-known preschool
interventions in part because it was evaluated using a randomized trial yielding highly credible results, and
also because data on its participants have been routinely collected longer than most other evaluations on any
subject—until participants were 39 to 41 years old (Schweinhart, Barnes, and Weikart 1993.”

more relevant and higher quality programs that can produce more qualified human resources
in Armenia. The piloted CIF serves as an important instrument to stimulate innovation and
quality enhancement in HEIs. It also contributes to the goal of diversifying the funding
mechanism for better sector outcomes and improved efficiency.

66.    At this stage, as the efficiency of a number of key project investments cannot be
evaluated quantitatively, the efficiency for outcome achievement is rated as modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.     The project’s overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Project objectives
were and continue to be highly relevant for the country context and are in line with the
government’s development and education priorities, as well as with those laid out in the CPS.
Project resources were used effectively and efficiently to initiate reforms and to introduce the
necessary institutional, capacity, and financial arrangements to permanently and sustainably
implement the reforms beyond project closing. At the same time, despite substantial
achievements with regard to the project’s objectives, there were minor shortcomings in
implementing planned activities and some targets were not achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.     In Armenia, individuals who have a better education or are in the labor force are less
likely to be poor or extremely poor. The project’s investment in improved access to and in the
quality of education at all levels supported reforms that decreased the likelihood that project
beneficiaries will experience poverty. Increased access to preschool for children in poor areas
supported by the project has also likely benefitted the families who now have access to free
childcare and the time to pursue employment or education opportunities. The preschool
subcomponent also contributed to community development and set the stage for community
development initiatives on a larger scale, such as those that are currently supported under the
Social Investment and Local Development Project (P148836). Specifically, all communities
with preschools/KG participating in the preschool micro-projects contributed 25 percent (cash
or in-kind) of what the APL 2 provided to the micro-projects, helping communities strengthen
their capacity in planning, implementing, and monitoring activities for further improvement
of the preschools and of the communities to ensure sustainability.

69.     Although the project did not directly target gender, it nevertheless directly benefited
women: access to preschool has allowed mothers to pursue work or other personal or
professional development activities, and teachers, most of whom are women, benefitted from
teacher training opportunities under the project. Rates of return to education from the
additional year of schooling were found to be higher for women than for men (3.6 percent for
women versus 2.8 percent for men), therefore girls who attended preschool under the project
are likely to receive a higher increase in earnings as compared to boys. A review of the gender
aspects in select textbooks financed by the project also found that the representation of gender
roles could be modernized, and provided recommendations for improving gender
inclusiveness in the textbooks.


                                              17
70.     The project’s positive impact on institutional capacity and institutional development,
particularly on the long-term development of Armenia’s capacity and institutions, has been
substantial. The project supported the development of funding schemes, such as per capita
financing, to ensure the sustainability of financing for preschools beyond the support of the
project. The CIF funds flow mechanism has also introduced a culture of innovation and
healthy competition in higher education, setting the stage for possible further diversification
of financing mechanisms for higher education. It has strengthened the role of universities as
drivers for change, initiating and implementing innovative solutions in areas in which they
can use their expertise to affect change. The institutional capacity of ANQA, NaCET, the
MoES, and universities has been strengthened through well-tailored training, and
international TA and collaboration. Finally, the capacity of the CEP has been significantly
enhanced over the course of the project through Bank and external training, as well as from
on-the-job experience.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
71.      As discussed throughout section 3, the project resulted in the strengthening of key
institutions, including of preschools, general, secondary, and tertiary education institutions,
as well as of communities, marz and central education authorities, and key sector institutions
including the NIE, NaCET, and ANQA.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

72.      Stakeholder workshop and consultation sessions were carried out in September 2015
to learn the experiences and perceptions of project beneficiaries and to discuss lessons
learned. The sessions highlighted that parents of preschool children value the preschools for
the knowledge and skills that are taught, as well as for freeing up their time to pursue other
livelihood opportunities. High school representatives (teachers, principals, students, and
parents) noted that the computer and technology devices provided to schools have helped
teaching and learning, however they also expressed that additional support is needed for the
maintenance and training on the use of these technologies. Marz education authorities praised
the project’s support to preschools, and highlighted a high demand for more preschool
classrooms to accommodate all children in the community. This sentiment is supported by
official statistics as over the course of the project, the number of children who attended pre-
school institutions increased from approximately 53,900 in 2009 to approximately 72,700 in
2014 (latest available data), indicating an increase of approximately 35% in the number of
children attending preschool institutions.16 University representatives praised the innovation
centers created under the pilot CIF, noting the successful implementation of high quality
initiatives, and noted the need for support for certain standard procedures, such as
procurement. Teacher training providers expressed the need to apply a more tailored approach

follow-up evaluations of teachers. A detailed discussion of the sessions is provided in annex
6.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

73.    The follow-up EIP is supporting the expansion of the original objectives and activities
of APL 2, and the government and local communities have also absorbed the financial and
implementation responsibilities for project activities. However, certain risks remain,
including the following:

           The macroeconomic risk in the region may affect the development outcome.
            Growth rate has slowed to 2.1 percent in 2015, remittances have decelerated in
            the second half of 2014, and the demand for imported consumer goods has
            declined. Thus, there may be a risk that funding for sustaining education
            initiatives that were started under the project will not continue within the context
            of a tighter fiscal envelope.

           The sustainability of preschools is dependent on financing. Thus, for the
            preschools that do not receive per-student financing from the government, there
            is a risk that the communities will not be able to sustain them if there is an
            economic or financial crisis in the country or in a particular region.

           There is a risk that universities may not provide updates to the TEMIS database
            on a regular basis. At this point, there are no mandates or incentives to use
            TEMIS.

           With regard to the pilot CIF, although applicant universities have to specify the
            provision for financing to sustain the CIF projects upon graduation from project
            support, there is a risk that these universities may not be able to sufficiently invest
            and maintain the operation of the innovation projects after several years.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The overall objectives of the project were informed by extensive consultations with
key stakeholders and aligned with the country priorities and the objectives and challenges in
the sector. Project design drew on lessons learned from in-country experience, particularly
regarding the piloting of the preschool micro-projects and of the high school reform under
APL 1, as well as from international experience in the areas of preschool education, student
loan schemes, and CIFs. The Bank team had an adequate skill mix that represented a wide
range of sector and technical expertise, including specialized expertise in education

                                               19
economics, early childhood education, higher education, and ICT. The project filled an
important financing gap in the education sector.

75.     Despite these positive features, there were some shortcomings which influenced
quality at entry, particularly those related to M&E design that were discussed in section 2.3
as well as the inclusion of a disbursement condition (that was in effect the effectiveness
condition) as discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.2. On the basis of the information discussed
above, Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.     The Bank team comprised staff and consultants, both local and international, with the
appropriate skills mix with regard to operations, the education sector, procurement, fiduciary
management, and M&E. However, the borrower noted that during approximately the first two
years following effectiveness, the Bank team was slow in responding to PIU correspondence,
including to requests for No Objections, with delays of sometimes nearly two months.

77.     The decisions to restructure twice showed responsive supervision. The restructurings
allowed for the introduction of important improvements to project design, adjusting the scope
of project components to address the government’s priories in a timely manner and foreseeing
the need for additional time to properly implement key project activities. On the basis of the
information discussed above, Quality of Supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.    Based on the Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and the quality of
supervision, and the overall outcome rating, the rating for overall Bank performance is
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

79.     From the early stages of project preparation, the Government, particularly the MoES,
demonstrated a high level of commitment to working with the Bank to address the issues of
quality, access and equity in the education sector, and to ensure a coordinated approach among
the various partners and activities. This was evidenced by the fact that the minister and the
deputy ministers of the MoES guided the project effectively at all stages of the project cycle,
and closely collaborated with the Bank. The minister personally participated in the launch of
many project activities, ensuring the full engagement of stakeholders and of project visibility.
Counterpart funding was consistent and timely, even during fiscal pressures. Furthermore, as
discussed in section 1.7, the Prime Minister’s Office instructed that some project activities
were to be funded by domestic resources to ensure the most effective use of the Credit, and
the MoES proactively responded to the changes. Most of those project activities were shifted
                                               20
to being supported through other government funding, and have been successfully
implemented outside of the scope of the APL 2. The government has effectively used project
resources to initiate reforms and to build institutional capacity, and is sustaining key reforms
beyond the project as discussed in section 2.5. The Ministry of Finance was a collaborative
partner, consistently and promptly supporting the implementation of project activities. On the
basis of information discussed above, the government’s performance is rated Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

80.     The MoES ensured the overall leadership for the reform process, and its CEP served
as an effective PIU. The CEP was committed to carrying out project activities toward the
achievement of the development objectives. The transition of CEP directors was seamless and
the CEP teams continued to be fully engaged during transitions. The CEP implemented
project activities and resolved implementation and procurement issues in a timely manner.
The CEP was committed to its fiduciary responsibility, and handled several complaint cases
effectively. All records were well kept and consistent with procurement policies and
guidelines, and disbursement data was up-to-date. CEP specialists took part in training
opportunities, including from the Bank and other organizations.

81.    Despite challenges in finding appropriate staff in the country’s labor market, the CEP
ensured that it had the necessary technical expertise and efficient administrative capacity to
successfully perform its functions. It hired and trained the necessary staff as needed, and it
completed its activities effectively and efficiently. The implementing agency performance is
rated Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

82.    On the basis of government and implementing agency performance, borrower
performance is rated as Satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

83.    The project provided a number of lessons, with the key lessons summarized below
and detailed in annex 16.

           The Bank’s long-term engagement in the education sector provides a robust
            platform for well-performing projects, allowing for the broadening of the
            engagement in the sector.

           Bank-supported project activities can catalyze key sector reforms through close
            engagement and effective dialogue in general, as well as during project
            preparation.



                                              21
          Within the context of supporting a long-term substantive sector reform,
           responsiveness to short-term sector challenges is key for sustaining project
           relevance.

          Broad and complex projects can be successfully implemented in the context of
           timely and quality implementation support from the Bank and a client with high
           capacity.

          The M&E and the Results Framework should incorporate only those indicators
           that can accurately measure the results achieved through the project.

          Relevant, comprehensive and technically well-designed studies should be
           planned as part of project preparation to monitor and accurately measure project
           outcomes.

          Successful implementation of the Competitive Innovations Fund (CIF) can be
           ensured through clearly defined roles and responsibilities of the CIF recipients
           and their timely and relevant capacity building.

          Teacher professional development can significantly benefit from learning best
           practices in collaborative and hands-on settings, such as through international
           partnerships.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost-effectiveness of Investing in Preschool Education

1.      A competitive grant scheme was established through which a number of preschool micro-
projects received grants to establish new or upgrade existing preschools. Such micro-projects were
implemented in every school year between 2010 and 2015.18 While 208 micro-projects took place
in existing primary schools, 72 micro-projects took place in independently-housed KGs. In the
first year of the micro-projects, the Bank funded the micro-projects and all benefitting
communities contributed at least 25 percent of what the Bank contributed, either financially or
through in-kind contributions. Following the first year, the government supported the 208 micro-
projects in existing primary schools through per capita financing. The communities supported the
72 micro-projects implemented in the KGs. Throughout the course of the project, communities
made the necessary contributions during the first and subsequent years of the project.

2.     The ICR conducted a benefit/cost analysis of the project using the number of children
reached and the increase in educational attainment (0.5 years for children attending 1 year of
preschool).19 Rates of return were calculated using the 2013 (latest available) Integrated Living
Conditions Survey data20 and were found to be 2.8 percent for males and 3.6 percent for females.

3.      The following assumptions were made as part of the benefit/cost analysis:

             In accordance with the law, children start primary school at the age of 6.

             The participation of children in the preschool micro-projects was their first exposure
              to preschool and children did not attend preschool before that year.

             Once the preschool micro-projects are established, they continue to operate the
              following years.

             The preschool institutions based in schools (202 out of 280) are funded by the state
              budget (following the first year of operation when support was provided by the project
              and local communities that contributed an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount
              of the Bank loan) based on per capita financing.

             Since all stand-alone kindergartens have been operating past the first year of Bank
              support, it is assumed for the purposes of this analysis, that communities provide the
              same per capita contribution as the government following the initial year of Bank’s
              support.




18
    Preschool micro-projects were implemented in the following school years: 2010–2011, 2011–2012, 2012–2013,
2013–2014, and 2014–2015.

             The number of male and female children participating in the preschool micro-projects
              is approximately equal.

             11,694 children benefitted from the first year of each of the preschool micro-projects.

             35,451 children benefitted from all years of the preschool micro-projects.

             Since the retirement age is 63 and students graduate at the age of 17, children do not
              begin to realize the benefits of increased wages until age 18, and they work for 45
              years.

             One additional year of preschool correlates with a half-year increase in schooling.21

             A 3 percent discount rate was used.

             Exchange rate of AMD 474 for US$1.

             Annualized wages for men are US$4,778 and for women, are US$3,150.22

4.       For one year of preschool directly before enrollment in primary school, the benefit/cost
ratio is 5.04 for males and 6.83 for females. For all children benefitting from the preschool micro-
projects over the course of the project, the wage gains are approximately US$35 million, with a
cost of approximately US$6 million, for a net benefit of approximately US$29 million. This is an
underestimate of the benefit, given that the returns are only private returns as social returns have
not been factored in. Thus, the benefit/cost estimates suggest that the project’s preschool micro-
project subcomponent did better than break even.

Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.     The ICR team visited to the project sites, and met with local authorities, parents, teachers,
principals and students, and other direct and indirect beneficiaries. The key discussions from these
meetings are summarized below.

University Representatives

2.     The new innovation centers that have been created and the activities implemented under
the CIF are important accomplishments that have led to the improvement in education quality,
relevance, and social equity by adjusting education programs with labor market requirements,
contributing to the modernization of education programs, and creating public-private partnerships.
The ‘culture of quality’ has been introduced to universities throughout the country, and universities
have improved their capacity in strengthening both internal and EQA systems. At times, however,
procurement and other requirements with regard to the purchase of specific unique equipment were
complex, and time limits for project implementation and the associated paperwork posed
challenges.

Marz Education Authorities

3.       The preschool institutions were established in all marzes throughout the country. They have
become an attractive ‘children’s world’ that is quite different from the primary school and other
institutions in the marz. The institutions provide a desired environment for free and dynamic
personal development of children that promotes the growth of children’s abilities and preparedness
for school. Creation of toilets with adjusted basins to suit the needs of young children is another
important detail the project has secured. It is noteworthy that the training provided to the teachers
in modern early education techniques is an important accomplishment of the project. In marzes
such as Armavir and Aragatsotn the preschools have admitted children from families of national
minorities. In other marzes such as Ararat, based on need, preschools have admitted children of
neighboring communities as well, where there are no similar preschool institutions. The
preschools have contributed to job creation, increase in birth rate, and parents’ employment,
including engagement in agriculture. In some communities, for example Lori and Tavush, based
on demand, there is a need to create more rooms for additional children. Additionally, there was a
request to involve the capital city of Yerevan in the project as there is a high demand for preschool
institutions there.

Parents of Preschool Children

4.      The preschool institutions have provided an opportunity for many parents to work because
their child was enrolled in the preschool. One of the parents, for example, started to work in a
candy shop while another parent went to work in a factory. The only contribution that parents
provide to the preschool is their children’s food during the school day. Everyone unanimously
agreed that, because of the preschools, children learn and obtain knowledge and skills that are
difficult or impossible for parents to teach.




                                                 37
Teacher Training Providers

5.      In providing in-service teacher trainings, differences in competence levels of urban and
rural teachers were obvious. It was necessary for the training providers to use a tailored approach
to be able to engage teachers of different levels, especially in the use of ICT in teaching. The 12
hours allocated to the training on the use of ICT proved to be insufficient, given the different levels
of computer/Internet mastery of the trainees. The poor level of ICT use is mostly due to teachers’
limited access to a computer.

6.      There were differences in preference of the timing of the training—whether it should be
held during an academic semester or school break. While the training providers accommodated
the majority’s preference, several others complained that they were working overtime due to the
trainings. The training served as a venue to come together, to get to know what is going on in other
educational institutions, and to network with counterparts. Sometimes teachers preoccupied with
daily work were cut off from ‘reality’ and from what is going on in other educational institutions,
and the training became the place to catch up.

7.      The main shortcoming of the training was that it contained no subsequent evaluation.
Teachers completed through the training, which was not monitored or evaluated with regard to the
use of the training and further application of newly gained knowledge and skills in the classroom.
No feedback mechanism existed. Additionally, there is no link between a teaching performance
and career progression in education or teaching. Even while mastering certain contemporary
methodologies, teachers did not practice them because introducing and practicing something new
requires extra effort, which in this case, does not lead to career progression and does not provide
incentives for experimenting because all teachers are compensated at the same salary scale.
Hopefully soon, the teacher ranking system will be fully implemented and teachers will have more
incentives for improvement and better performance.

8.      It is desirable to conduct the training at a time when teachers are free from their teaching
obligations and can fully concentrate on the training.

High School Representatives (Teachers, Principals, Students, and Parents)

9.      With an increasing number of computers and technology devices in schools, there is an
increased responsibility for maintenance of these devices. More support from NaCET in providing
trainings and securing a reliable Internet connection is desirable. Textbooks in high schools are
overloaded with content and are written in an academic language; they are very theoretical. It was
recommended that instead of grading students very frequently, teachers guide the learning process
and provide qualitative insight into students’ understanding. The Bank’s support in providing up-
to-date technologies and furniture is highly appreciated by students and teachers.

Annex 7: Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

To ensure the implementation of the policies adopted by the Armenian government and
continuation and completeness of the reforms in the education sector, the Armenia Education
Quality and Relevance Project has taken into account the priorities of educational reforms and has
also ensured the continuation and expansion of the activities implemented by the World Bank’s
First Education Quality and Relevance Project (2003-2009).

The Project consisted of two components. Each included four subcomponents.

         Reform 



During the Project implementation, another procedure was introduced prior to the execution of the
planned activities – approval of procurement plan by the RA Prime Minister. Based on this, some
of the planned activities under the Project that were not approved by the Prime Minister were
suspended bringing changes in the total picture of the Project implementation.

During the implementation of the Project, the planned trainings for teachers (partly) and school
principals were suspended within the scope of Subcomponent 1.2. Teacher trainings were
continued and financed from the state budget; and the trainings for school principals were
implemented within the scope of the activities conducted by the school-centers. Within the
component of higher education, Subcomponent 2.3 initially intended introducing sustainable
financial system via developing higher education financing strategy, introducing student loan
system and establishing Competitiveness Innovation Fund (CIF). In 2011, the introduction of the
student loan scheme was suspended based on the government’s decision; and the intended funds
were reallocated to the establishment of the CIF.

Because of the changes mentioned above, project restructuring was initiated to reflect those
changes and reallocate funds for other activities. The restructuring of the project required almost

                                                            40
half a year causing delays in the overall implementation of the project. Thus another amendment
to the financing agreement was conducted to extend the deadline for the project completion for a
year till November 30, 2015 instead of initially planned November 30, 2014.

Performance of the project outcome indicators

The Projects had four outcome (Project development) indicators. Component 1 accounted for three
outcome indicators, which have been achieved by the time of performing the current study. In the
area of preschool education, the implemented micro-projects have contributed to the improvement
of the Early Development Indicator (EDI) scores of the students in the involved preschools.
The proportion of the test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam and the gross
graduation rate in upper secondary education recorded significant improvements. The latter
two indicators have grown by 3 and 11.5 percentage points respectively, exceeding the pre-set
targets. Teacher trainings and professional development, ICT continuous integration in the
learning process and high school reforms have had a significant input in these developments,
ultimately contributing to the improvement of the quality of education.

The Project outcome indicator for Component 2 has been measured with progress in the Bologna
Process. Armenia’s ranking in rating system of the Bologna Process, which summarizes the
standings of the countries involved in the process as of 2014, has improved and the share of the
green-value indicators has grown from 44% to 70% since 2012. Improvement in one indicator is
necessary to achieve the target value (75%). Taking into account that 15 universities in Armenia
are officially accredited as of end of the Project, the 7th indicator – stage of development of external
quality assurance system – will obviously improve its stance in the next report.

The activities planned by Component 1 have mainly been implemented; and four out of the five
intermediate outcome indicators have been achieved. Three out of the four subcomponents in
Component 2 - establishment and strengthening of the national quality assurance, strengthening
the capacity to implement a sustainable financing system and reforming pre-service teacher
education - have successfully been carried out and the pre-set intermediate outcome indicators
have been achieved. One of the subcomponents - developing tertiary education management
information system, is still in the implementation phase and the target indicators of the
subcomponent are still in process.

 * Preparatory works for the trainings designed for the school principals within the scope of the Project were fully completed; however, the launch
 of the trainings was suspended in 2013 by the instruction of the RA Prime Minister. The materials developed within the Project’s framework
 have subsequently been reflected in the mandatory training courses of the school principals and candidates implemented for attestation purpose.
 With the Project support, the Union of School-Centers has implemented activities aimed at professional development and training of the school
 principals in leadership and management. Throughout 2012-2014, 30% of school principals participated in the trainings organized by the Union
 of School Centers.

Project performance
Component 1
Subcomponent 1.1. ''Promoting School Readiness and Equal Opportunities at the Start of
General Education''. Micro-projects in preschool education have been successfully developed
and implemented. Over 36,000 children have been provided with preschool education over the
period of 2010-2015. 280 micro projects – double of the initially planned 140 have been carried
out. The micro-projects have been implemented mainly in the marzes; specifically, in communities
that lacked operating kindergartens or the existing conditions were insufficient to involve more
children. The preschool institutions included in the micro-projects have been renovated, the
teachers have passed trainings followed by mentoring support and consultations for teachers
provided by an internationally experienced teacher training organization, and educational materials
and facilities have been provided. According to the implemented study, the children involved in
the micro-projects have recorded higher EDI scores, as compared to those who did not attend
preschool. Thus, EDI scores of students in the participatory group were on average 19 percent
higher than those of students in the control group.It is noteworthy that Schools implementing
preschool micro projects received state financing for the children involved in preschool institutions
ensuring sustainability of the projects.

Overall, the execution of the Subcomponent has considerably contributed to the implementation
of the government’s “Strategic Program on Preschool Education Reforms and Pilot Projects 2008-
2015”, has significantly increased the level of children’s readiness for school and has ensured
equal opportunities at the start of general education, especially in the regions.




                                                                      43
Subcomponent 1.2. “Supporting Further Improvements in the Quality of Education through
Improved Teacher In-service Training and Professional Development”. Teachers' professional
development scheme has been developed and introduced. The ABU consulting company provided
CEP with long-term and comprehensive support by developing legal normative documents on the
attestation process, procedures for receiving professional ranks, developing teacher training
programs to be used during the pre-attestation trainings. Over 12,500 teachers have been trained
during 2011-2012. This has been followed by the trainings organized by the National Institute of
Education in 2013 with funds allocated from the state budget. By the time of developing the current
report, all teachers subject to mandatory attestation have passed the necessary trainings. Teachers
have started to increasingly employ innovative and efficient methods of teaching. The activities
under the Subcomponent 1.2 have contributed to the establishment of the Union of School Centers,
which organizes activities aimed at dissemination of innovation in general education, practice
exchange and improvement of the quality of teaching and learning.

Subcomponent 1.3. “Supporting Integration of Information and Communication Technologies
in General Education”. Around 460 schools with problematic accessibility, namely, remote
geographical location and lack of appropriate infrastructure, have been connected to the Armenian
Educational Network, thus completing the interconnection of all schools in Armenia. ICT trainings
have been conducted for teachers within the framework of pre-attestation trainings. Use of ICT by
teachers in the teaching process has increased. The schools have been provided with management
information system along with necessary computer equipment, including a computer, a UPS and
a multifunctional printer per school for administrative purposes. Representatives of all schools
namely 1,420 staff members took part in the trainings aimed at effective use of the delivered
hardware and software for the administrative purposes. Currently, an electronic repository of
educational resources is being developed for four subjects taught at high and primary schools.

It was initially planned to create an open education platform which would serve as a mechanism
promoting ICT use among teachers and creation of electronic materials by them. The
implementation of this activity was suspended by the decision of the Prime Minister’s Office.
Instead, the development of an existing education platform (www.armedu.am) was considered
expedient. Therefore, it was decided to establish an e-learning resource repository instead of the
open education platform. This repository was created by NACET with the financial assistance of
Vivacell MTS, a telecommunications business company in Armenia. Based on the findings of the
“Needs Assessment of Electronic Education Content and Materials” study conducted by NACET,
electronic education resources were developed for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology
subjects. The developed educational electronic materials for four subjects are available at the URL:
http://esource.armedu.am/.

Subcomponent 1.4. “Supporting the Implementation of High School Reform”. The project
continued the support of high schools establishment. Resource centers have been established in
the high schools, equipped with computers and furniture, mobile computer laboratories and active
boards which are intensively used in the teaching process. About 1,200 teachers and the librarians
of all high schools took part in trainings (trainings of the high school teachers started within the
framework of the First Loan Program). Software for school library administration was developed
and introduced in all high schools and trainings were organized for all high schools librarians. All



                                                44
high Schools' resource-centers have been provided with library book stocks in Armenian, Russian
and English languages, in total about 270 titles of books.

Component 2

Subcomponent 2.1. “Establishment and Strengthening of the National Quality Assurance
System”. National system for higher education quality assurance has been formed in Armenia,
which includes internal and external quality assurance. Based on the established system,
institutional accreditation process of the HEIs has successfully launched. Independent accrediting
body defining quality assurance standards In Armenia has been formed – the National Center for
Professional Education Quality Assurance Foundation (ANQA), which is an affiliated member of
the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher education (ENQA), and aspires to
become a full member in 2016. 26 HEIs have established internal quality control systems and 15
HEIs have received institutional accreditation in the framework of the Subcomponent. About 400
representatives of all HEIs in Armenia have been trained to improve their skills and knowledge in
regard to quality assurance issues.

Subcomponent 2.2. “Developing a Tertiary Education Management Information System
(TEMIS)”. Tertiary Education Management Information System has been developed and
introduced in Armenia. Currently, the system is installed in 183 educational institutions and in the
central hub. The system is not fully used yet by the educational institutions due to lack of skills
and certain technical issues. In addition, large educational institutions have their own operating
systems in place and do not fully realize the opportunities provided by the new system. A
regulatory framework of the system usage is being launched and a detailed content guide is being
developed to enhance the system users’ skills and universities’ motivation.

Subcomponent 2.3. “Strengthening the Capacity to Implement a Sustainable Financing
System”. New strategy for financing Armenia’s higher education sector has been developed and
adopted, followed by implementation of a number of resultant activities. The assistance scheme,
benefitting around 4,000 socially vulnerable families from public universities, has been funded
additionally from the state budget. A Competitive Innovation Fund for financing innovative
projects within universities was established and successfully launched providing grants to 10 HEIs.
Based on the success of the Subcomponent, CIF grants have been included in the WB Education
Improvement Project.

Subcomponent 2.4. “Reforming Pre-Service Teacher Education”. Large-scale educational
reforms have been implemented in the Armenian State Pedagogical University after Kh. Abovyan
in cooperation with a European HEI, which has involved all levels and key directions of the
university activities including curricula review, developing quality assurance system, reviewing
internship placement requirements in the schools, developing career center, and strengthening
management, transparency and internal quality assurance. The reforms have created base for a new
and modern culture at the ASPU matching international standards. Additionally, the infrastructure
of state pedagogical universities of Armenia has been renewed; in particular, comprehensive
resource centres and modern laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Geography have
been established in five state pedagogical universities of Armenia. The cooperation between the



                                                45
University of Oulu and the ASPU has not been limited by the scope of the Project and is continued
via mutual visits and student exchange programs.

Summary and conclusions

The micro-projects implemented throughout the general education system have significantly
contributed to raising the level of school readiness for children in Armenia and ensuring equal
education opportunities, especially in the regions. A mandatory attestation system for teachers has
been introduced aimed at ensuring the continuity of regular trainings for teachers. The use of ICT
in the educational process has increased and has reached to a new level. The connection to internet
of over 460 schools with problematic accessibility, apart from educational use, has had an
important social impact for the stakeholder communities since previously internet accessibility in
those communities was very low. As a result of the expanded educational and technical
infrastructures, enhanced teacher capacities and other developments of the high school system, the
latter has transformed from formation to development phase. This will enable full realization of
the main mission of the high school system, which is to prepare students to independent life and
receive further professional education.

As a result of the implemented activities by the Project in higher education, internal and external
quality assurance system has been established and independent accrediting body defining quality
assurance standards has been formed - ANQA. The compulsory institutional accreditation process
helps HEIs to better understand their problems, address the gaps, formalize processes and improve
management systems. A modern educational system for preparing teachers has been launched at
the Armenian State Pedagogical University. The Competitiveness Innovation Fund has been
established and successfully launched. The grants provided by the CIF have contributed to
improvements in higher education quality, relevance and accessibility.

The synergy between the implemented activities is an additional leverage for the Project’s
effectiveness. Particularly, reforming pre-service teacher education (Subcomponent 2.4) is
expected to improve the quality of general education.

Challenges

Overall, the main risks for the materialization and sustainability of the Project’s implemented
activities and achieved results are external. While the activities planned by the Project and set goals
have mainly been achieved, the systemic problems existing in general and higher education sectors
of Armenia may limit the widespread impact of the Project. Addressing these challenges will
contribute to efficiency of the Project’s activities and ensure continuity.

In the area of general education, there is a need to improve and update educational infrastructures,
facilities, technology and other educational resources of the schools. The current model of trainings
needs to be improved to fully address the requirements for knowledge, skills and capacity building
of the teachers. In preschool education, there still are accessibility gaps, especially in regions.

In the area of higher education, the established quality assurance system is a new educational
culture. All stakeholders need to demonstrate consistent efforts for the system to succeed and

                                                  46
become a comprehensive element of the higher education system. Similarly, the reforms
implemented at the ASPU have been crucial for the university; however, their sustainability
necessitates ensuring consistent implementation of the introduced processes and systems, and
disseminating the newly established culture into the rest of the pedagogical HEIs in Armenia.

Overall, the rapid and continuous developments in educational needs, priorities and technologies
make it imperative to upgrade the quality of educational resources and educational environment
aimed at improvement of the quality of education. For this purpose, a joint agenda and continuous
harmonization of the state policy and programs of the World Bank and other stakeholder
international organizations are necessary to lead to greater synergy and improved results. A part
of the existing challenges in the area of education in Armenia has been taken into account with
regard to developing the WB Improving Education Project.

Overall, the implementation of the World Bank’s Second Education Quality and Relevance Project
has recorded tangible results and has had a positive impact in the education sector of Armenia. The
implemented programs have created good base for implementing the next phase of initiatives under
the WB Improving Education project aimed at further development of general and higher
education in Armenia.

Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and implementation
of the project, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future

During the preparation of the project, MOES together with the other relevant agencies in the
education sector, provided significant input to this process assisting both in the preparation and
implementation of certain components of the project and the achievement of the overall goals and
objectives of APL2. The performance of both MOES and PIU was positively acknowledged by
the Government and stakeholders of the education sector.

The preparation and implementation of the project also faced certain challenges. In particular,
preparatory works were conducted by PIU and MOES without additional financing during the
implementation of the APL1, which caused double workload of the staff.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co financiers, or of other partners during
the preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of their
relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned

The performance of the Bank was very effective during the preparation and implementation of the
operations. At the beginning of the implementation of the project, feedback from the Bank was
received with some delay, which also caused delays in the overall implementation of the project.
After the change of the TTL, the Bank was very operative in providing feedback for
requests/queries by PIU. There was a change of the TTL at the final stage of the implementation,
but that change was very smooth and did not affect the overall implementation of the Project.

The role of the project should not be interpreted as that of a provision of ultimate solutions – they
are just vehicles to enhance the situation. For the designated areas to succeed there is a strong need

political willingness and full consensus and partnership with the civil society.

Annex 11: Education Sector Reform Program Triggers

The APL supported Armenia’s Education Sector Reform Program. Its development objective was
to improve the quality and relevance of the Armenian school system to meet the challenges of the
knowledge society. As included in annex 15 of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of the first
phase of the APL, the government provided the Bank with a “List of possible indicators and
triggers (conditions) for a ten-year APL” that could be used to monitor each of the phases of the
program. That document suggests that at the completion of APL 3 the following two outcome
indicators would have been achieved: “schools are organizations in which pedagogical, financial,
and administrative aspects are focused on increasing student learning;” and “student learning
outcomes have improved.” This is the only document identified by the ICR team suggesting
possible outcome indicators for the entire APL program, and there are no specific targets or further
information on how they would be measured.

The APL 1 had as its objective to support the first phase of the Borrower’s Program through: (a)
improving and strengthening the efficiency of the education sector to meet the challenges of a
knowledge economy; (b) upgrading the quality and relevance of the school education system; and
(c) improving the evaluation of the education system’s performance. 23 Its outcome and
intermediate outcomes were the same as those included in the “List of possible indicators and
triggers (conditions) for a ten-year APL” mentioned above; the single original outcome indicator
was that “70 percent of teachers are engaged in activities likely to develop the necessary
knowledge and competencies in their students.”

The APL 2, approved approximately five years after APL 1, had as its development objective: to
(i) enhance school learning in general education and improve the school readiness of children
entering primary education; and (ii) support the integration of the tertiary education system into
the European Higher Education Area. Similarly, the APL 2 original outcome indicators differed
from the single indicator included in annex 15 of the PAD for the first APL (“90 percent of teachers
are engaged in activities likely to develop the necessary knowledge and competencies in their
students”); the same is true for intermediate indicators. Additionally, the APL 2 included in both
its development objective and indicators targets related to strengthening the higher education
system, something that was not explicit in the original program design.

The triggers agreed for each phase of the APL remained unchanged and were all met during its
implementation, as reported below. For that reason, as well as the lack of clarity regarding the
program’s outcome indicators, the ICR team found them to be an important indication of the APL’s
contribution toward improving the quality and relevance of the Armenian school system to meet
the challenges of the knowledge society, its development objective.

  As previously mentioned, the PDO included in the PAD differed from the project objective specified in the APL
1 Development Credit Agreement.

Outcomes at Project Closing

Although during project preparation, it was envisaged that 140 communities and 8,750 children would benefit,
approximately 35,451 children have benefitted as it was possible to complete some micro-projects with less
financing, therefore freeing up resources to be used in other communities. As of project closing, all of the
preschools continued to be fully operational. The Ministry of Education, UNICEF, and Step-by-Step Foundation
provided the necessary training to preschool teachers and marz administrative staff. Discussions with parents and
marz authorities were positive, and stakeholders felt that the school readiness of their children after participating
in the preschool micro-projects was high.

Annex 16: Discussion on Lessons Learned

1.     The Bank’s long-term engagement in the education sector provides a robust platform
for well-performing projects, allowing for the broadening of the engagement in the sector,
including through the introduction of innovative programs and sound policy advice. The
Bank’s continued presence in the sector and long-term support through the APL series helped
deepen the understanding of education sector issues and to accumulate implementation support
experience. The Bank has been an active development partner in the sector with its support aligned
with the country’s and sector’s development objectives.

2.     Bank-supported project activities can catalyze key sector reforms through close
engagement and effective dialogue in general, as well as during project preparation. The
successful implementation of several innovative programs under the project have been
mainstreamed or scaled up by the government through domestic financing, such as for the
preschool programs and the ANQA operations.

3.      Within the context of supporting a long-term substantive sector reform,
responsiveness to short-term sector achievements and challenges is key for sustaining project
relevance. The two restructurings during the project cycle adjusted project activities and resource
allocations. The restructurings ensured that a balance of government- and Bank-financed activities
was maintained and that those programs that were prepared for piloting or scaling up, as was the
case with the CIF and preschool programs, could in fact do so.

4.      Broad and complex projects can be successfully implemented in the context of timely
and quality implementation support from the Bank and a client with high capacity. Although
the project got off to a slow start, proactive and effective implementation support from the Bank
helped ensure completion of project activities. Importantly, successful implementation was
possible due to a client that had extensive experience working with the Bank and that was dedicated
to achieving the project outcomes.

5.      The M&E and the Results Framework should incorporate only those indicators that
can accurately measure the results achieved through the project. The indicators should be
SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attributable, Realistic, and Time-bound). For example, if results
of TIMSS are to be used, it is important to determine when the data will be collected to ensure that
the assessment results can be attributed to the project. Additionally, if UEE results are to be used
to measure progress over time, it is important to confirm that the assessment is designed in a way
that will allow for such comparison.

6.      Relevant, comprehensive, and technically well-designed studies should be planned as
part of project preparation to monitor and accurately measure project outcomes. The project
incorporated an evaluation of the impact of the project’s preschool interventions on the Early
Development Index of children. The study was designed by a local firm under the supervision of
the PIU; however, the study was not as rigorous as it should have been. Project implementation
support should include support for ensuring the quality of study design, the quality of data
collected, and the analysis that is prepared on the basis of that data. Rigorous studies will not only
benefit the project M&E but will also contribute to the global knowledge in this area.


                                                 66
7.      Successful implementation of the CIF can be ensured through clearly defined roles
and responsibilities of the CIF recipients and their timely and relevant capacity building.
Specifically, the key lessons include the following: (a) strengthening the procurement and financial
management capabilities of the CIF recipient is crucial; (b) there is a need to establish clear
mechanisms for problem solving; (c) there is a need to develop templates and procedures to clearly
define responsibilities and M&E arrangements; (d) stable staffing of recipient projects is a key
factor for success and should be a criteria for project implementation; and (e) a sustainability plan
should be required as part of the CIF proposal.

8.      Teacher professional development can significantly benefit from learning best
practices in collaborative and hands-on settings, such as through international partnerships.
The close partnership between Oulu University and Armenian State Pedagogical University
ensured that all preservice teacher education curricula in Armenia are now comparable to a typical
Bologna program. The quality of this teacher training will be sustained through the strengthened
IQA System, enhanced professional development opportunities, as well as the newly developed
good governance and transparency policy, all of which were introduced as a result of the
international partnership.
