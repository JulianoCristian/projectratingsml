Second\n            Education Quality and Relevance Project, APL 2 (EQRP 2) and\n            the Education Improvement Project (EIP). The Request was\n            submitted by 9 NGOs, 2 students and 5 parents from Armenia.\n            The Panel notes that the issues raised by the Requesters are\n            serious, legitimate concerns of citizens about the content\n            and directions of reforms in education that is absolutely\n            critical to the future of Armenian children, and therefore\n            of Armenia. However, the Panel is unable to establish that\n            the concerns raised by the Requesters, although legitimate,\n            can be considered as instances of material harm that may\n            have resulted from a failure of the Bank to follow its\n            Operational Policies and Procedures with respect to the\n            design, appraisal or implementation of the Projects financed\n            by the Bank. In light of the foregoing the Panel does not\n            recommend an investigation into the matters alleged in the\n            Request. The Panel appreciates Management's statement\n            that it intends to verify and review the claims related to\n            gender issues and related insensitivities, and to include\n            them in its policy dialogue with the Borrower."}, "docdt": "2014-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
