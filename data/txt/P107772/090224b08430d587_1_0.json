for the Second Education Quality\n            and Relevance Project for Armenia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: The Bank\u2019s long-term\n            engagement in the education sector provides a robust\n            platform for well-performing projects, allowing for the\n            broadening of the engagement in the sector. Bank-supported\n            project activities can catalyze key sector reforms through\n            close engagement and effective dialogue in general, as well\n            as during project preparation. Within the context of\n            supporting a long-term substantive sector reform,\n            responsiveness to short-term sector challenges are key for\n            sustaining project relevance. Broad and complex projects can\n            be successfully implemented in the context of timely and\n            quality implementation support from the Bank and a client\n            with high capacity. The monitoring and evaluation M&E\n            and the results framework should incorporate only those\n            indicators that can accurately measure the results achieved\n            through the project. Relevant, comprehensive and technically\n            well-designed studies should be planned as part of project\n            preparation to monitor and accurately measure project\n            outcomes. Successful implementation of the competitive\n            innovations fund (CIF) can be ensured through clearly\n            defined roles and responsibilities of the CIF recipients and\n            their timely and relevant capacity building. Teacher\n            professional development can significantly benefit from\n            learning best practices in collaborative and hands-on\n            settings, such as through international partnerships."}, "docdt": "2016-05-04T03:45:01Z"}
