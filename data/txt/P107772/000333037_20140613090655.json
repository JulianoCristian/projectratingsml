The\n            EQRP2 was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive\n            Directors (the 'Board') on May 12, 2009 for SDR\n            17.0 million IDA credit (equivalent ofUS$25.0 million) to\n            the Republic of Armenia with a closing date of November 30,\n            2014. It consists of three components, namely: 1) enhancing\n            the quality of general education; 2) supporting tertiary\n            education reforms in the context of Bologna agenda; and 3)\n            project management, monitoring and evaluation. The Ministry\n            of Education and Science will be responsible for the\n            implementation of the project supported by a Center for\n            Education Project (CEP) acting as the project implementing\n            unit. At the time the panel received the request for\n            inspection, about 72 percent of the credit had been\n            disbursed. The requesters state that 'any new\n            loan' will have to 'take into account the problems\n            with the previous loan program' and address those\n            issues. The requesters attached several case studies to\n            illustrate impact on students and parents who are among the requesters."}, "docdt": "2014-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
