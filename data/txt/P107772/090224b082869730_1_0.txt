                         Overall progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. All four outcome indicators (post project restructuring) show
                         positive trends. These indicators include improved Early Development Index of students in preschools and kindergartens receiving grants; share of test-takers passing the 9th grade
                         graduation exam; gross graduation rate in upper secondary education; and standings of Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard. At present, most of the core project activities are on track
                         towards achieving the targets. These include, among others, promoting school readiness and equal opportunities at the start of General Education; enhancing the quality of
                         education through improved teacher in-service training and professional development; continuing support to the integration of ICT in the teaching and learning process; supporting the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project was restructured in September 2014 to (a) extend the closing date of the project by 12 months until November 30, 2015 and (b) replace one of the Project's three PDO
                         related outcome indicators - “Improved examination and test scores in schools (TIMSS 2011 and Unified Entrance Examinations)” - with new indicators, more relevant for measuring
                         the Project's outcomes. The following two indicators were incorporated as replacement: (a) Share of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam and (b) gross graduation rate
