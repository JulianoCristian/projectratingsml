We have audited the accompanying project financial statements of the Second Education Quality

(the "IDA") Credit Agreement 4565 AM, which comprise the statement of financial position as
of December 31, 2015, the statement of the Project sources and uses of funds, the statement of

Bank for the year ended December 31, 2015 in support of the Credit Agreement 4565 AM
withdrawals, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory

accounting policies described in the note 2 to the project financial statements, the World Bank

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the project financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the project financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the project
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the project financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the project financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position
of the Second Education Quality and Relevance Project as of December 31, 2015, and of the
funds received and expenses incurred for the year then ended, in accordance with the accounting
policies described in the note 2, the World Bank guidelines, and the relevant points of the Credit
Agreement 4565 AM.
In addition, in our opinion, the SOEs submitted together with the internal controls and
procedures involved in their preparation can be relied upon to support the applications for the
Credit Agreement 4565 AM withdrawals.
Emphasis ofMatters
We draw attention to note 3 to the project financial statements, which states that the closing date
of the Second Education Quality and Relevance Project was defined as November 30, 2015. Our
opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.
Basis ofAavnting
Without modifying our opinion, we draw attention to note 2 to the project financial statements,
which describes the basis of accounting. The project financial statements are prepared to assist
the management of the State Agency "Center for Education Projects" Project Implementation
Unit" of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Armenia to meet the
requirements of the financial reporting of the World Bank. As a result, the project financial
statements may not be suitable for another purpose.
