Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The PDP indicators include
 improved Early Development Index of students in preschools and kindergartens receiving grants; share of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation
 exam; gross graduation rate in upper secondary education; and standings of Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard. Up to date, the Project has achieved 3
 out of the 4 PDO targets. The PDO indicator of the standings in the Bologna Scorecard, Armenia has achieved 6 "green" ratings out of the common
 9 indicators since 2009. One more green rating of the indicators will be needed to reach the PDO target of 75%. Given that only 2 months remain,
 this target is unlikely to be met before project closing on November 30, 2015. Nevertheless, it is notable that from 3 to 6 indicators reaching "green" (out
 of 9 in total) within 6 years time is a major progress for institutional reforms in the higher education sub-sector. Armenia's progress is particularly
 outstanding compared with neighboring countries.

 The Overall Implementation Progress (IP) for the project is rated "Satisfactory". At present, all core project activities have been completed. These
 include: promoting school readiness and equal opportunities at the start of General Education; enhancing the quality of education through improved
 teacher in-service training and professional development; continuing support to the integration of ICT in the teaching and learning process; supporting
 the implementation of high-school reform; establishing and strengthening the National Quality Assurance System; developing the capacity of the
 Ministry of Education and Science to implement a sustainable financing system for higher education; and reforming pre-service teacher education. As
 of September 2015, 99 percent of the credit funds have been committed, and 86 percent of the credit funds have been disbursed.

         By Armenian law, the age for children to start school is 6 years. (Page 25 of the official translation of the Law of the Republic of Armenia on
         General Education - http://www.translation-centre.am/pdf/Translat/HH_orenk/Education/HO_160_N_General_Edu_en.pdf). Since children
         graduate in grade 12, they would have reached or are expected to reach the age of 17 on December 31 of 12th grade, which means that it
         is probably reasonable to assume that they will be 17 years old at graduation. The latest population census was in 2011, however the World
         Bank provides interpolated population statistics for 17 year olds, so according to World Bank Data
         (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=Education-Statistics:-core-indicators&preview=off), there were 38,226 17 year
         olds in 2014. To get the gross graduation rate: 34,419 or (27,400+7,019)/38,226=90%.

               Comments
               There have been 3 Bologna process stocktaking reports during the project implementation period (2009, 2012, and 2015). However, the
               scorecard indicators have been changed across these 3 reports. To capture Armenia’s progress consistently, the supervision task
               team proposed to keep the common 9 indicators to measure progress.




 Overall Comments
 The project has achieved 3 out of the 4 PDO targets. On the PDO indicator of the standings of Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard, the
 team would like to note that from 3 to 6 indicators reaching "green" (out of 9 in total) within 6 years time is a major progress for institutional
 reform. Armenia's progress is particularly outstanding compared with neighboring countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan. In 2015 Bologna
 process report, 8 out of the 13 indicators are green in Armenia, compared with only 5 in Georgia, and 4 in Azerbaijan.

 The recent mission discussed with the PIU on the methodology measuring the impact of the pre-school micro-project. The studies have spanned
 from year 2011 to 2015 as the micro-projects rolled out in the regions. The study measures the development outcomes of the children before and
 after their 1-year participation in preschool. The study also selected “control” groups of children. However the development outcome of the
 control group was only measured once, at the time of the treatment group finishing 1-year preschool. Strictly speaking, this design cannot clearly
 identify the net impact of pre-school invention, as it cannot compare the gains in early development outcomes between treatment and control
 groups. The mission emphasized the need to revise the methodology in the EIP project, where pre-school grant micro-projects are continuously
 supported.

               During the past 5 years, all teachers (about 40,000) have participated in the mandated professional development programs delivered by the
               NIE and other training providers (during the earlier years). Prior to 2013, 12,165 teachers' training was funded by the Project.

               professional development of teachers” , Baker Tilly Armenia, 2013), by 2012, only 32 percent of teachers are still solely using
               presentation/recitation mode of teaching, reduced from 43 percent in 2011 Since further teacher training has no longer been supported by
               the Project since 2013, no further survey data beyond 2012 is collected on teaching practice.

               There have been only few institutions started data entry, and in many cases, the data entered is incomplete. Discussion with CFEP and
               MoES highlighted the need for mandating the institutions for data entry through government regulations as well as instituting financial
               incentives and consequences. A Ministerial Order for institutional mandate of management information provision is currently under
               discussion. Additional support for capacity strengthening may also be needed in selected institutions. The mission discussed the potential
               of using EIP allocation on NACET capacity building to continue support this area.

 Overall Comments
 2 indicators related to the use of TEMIS have not reached Project targets. A Ministerial Order for institutional mandate of management information
 provision is currently under discussion. Additional support for capacity strengthening may also be needed in selected institutions. The mission
 discussed the potential of using EIP allocation on NACET capacity building to continue support this area.

 In addition, 2 indicators (number of principals trained and teaching method used in classroom) have not been tracked after the related training
 activities had been dropped through project restructuring.
