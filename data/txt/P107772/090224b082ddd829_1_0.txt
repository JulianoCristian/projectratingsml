Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. All four outcome indicators (post
 project restructuring) show positive trends. These indicators include improved Early Development Index of students in preschools and kindergartens
 receiving grants; share of test-takers passing the 9th grade graduation exam; gross graduation rate in upper secondary education; and standings of
 Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard.
 At present, most of the core project activities are on track towards achieving the targets. These include: promoting school readiness and equal
 opportunities at the start of General Education; enhancing the quality of education through improved teacher in-service training and professional
 development; continuing support to the integration of ICT in the teaching and learning process; supporting the implementation of high-school reform;
 establishing and strengthening the National Quality Assurance System; developing the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science to implement a
 sustainable financing system for higher education; and reforming pre-service teacher education. Given about 6 months remaining of the implementation
 period, several intermediate result indicators have already reached their final status/value given that a majority of project activities have been
 completed. Some other indicators are still awaiting progress update (e.g. TEMIS report; approved teacher training curricula).
 As of March 2015, 81 percent of the credit funds have been disbursed.
