Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The PDO indicators include (i)
 improved Early Development Index of students in preschools and kindergartens receiving grants; (ii) share of test-takers passing the 9th grade
 graduation exam; (iii) gross graduation rate in upper secondary education; and (iv) standings of Armenia in the Bologna Scorecard. Currently, the
 Project has achieved 3 out of the 4 PDO targets. The PDO indicator on the standings in the Bologna Scorecard, Armenia has achieved 6
 "green" ratings out of the common 9 indicators. One more green rating of the indicators will be needed to reach the PDO target of 75%. Overall, it
 is notable that from 3 to 6 indicators reaching "green" (out of 9 in total) within 6 years’ time is a major progress for institutional reforms in the higher
 education sub-sector. Armenia's progress is particularly outstanding compared with neighboring countries.
 The overall Implementation Progress (IP) rating is "Moderately Satisfactory" as data input and report preparation using TEMIS is not envisaged to
 complete before project closing. The related component -"supporting tertiary education reforms in the context of Bologna Agenda" - is also rated as
 "Moderately Satisfactory" accordingly. The component "enhancing the quality of general education" is rated "Satisfactory" in this ISR, as all the activities
 have been carried out and the key results targets supported by these activities have been reached.
