"Confronted by a large debt burden at the\n            end of the 1990s, Brazil teamed with the International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and other\n            financial specialists to craft a new approach to debt\n            management that has not only yielded billions of dollars in\n            savings in debt service payments, it also set a new\n            foundation for economic strength that helped insulate Brazil\n            from the severity of the global financial crisis. The\n            savings that resulted from the IBRD-supported reforms are\n            being used to broaden and increase the quality of public\n            services across Brazil. The Bank is financing the completion\n            of Brazil\u2019s integrated debt system through supplementary\n            finance added to the recently restructured and extended its\n            operations. The Bank also continues to work with individual\n            state governments to improve their debt management capacity."}, "docdt": "2010-04-28T03:30:00Z"}
