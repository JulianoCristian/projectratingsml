 Synopsis

   Confronted by a large debt burden at the end of the 1990s, Brazil teamed with the IBRD and other finan-
   cial specialists to craft a new approach to debt management that has not only yielded billions of dollars
   in savings in debt service payments, it also set a new foundation for economic strength that helped
   insulate Brazil from the severity of the global financial crisis. The savings that resulted from the IBRD-
   supported reforms are being used to broaden and increase the quality of public services across Brazil.
