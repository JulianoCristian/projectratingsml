In addition, national\n            Metrology, Standardization, Testing and Quality system was\n            outdated, which deprived the Macedonian enterprises of the\n            appropriate means to control the quality of imported goods\n            or to certify that the quality of their exported goods meets\n            required standards. The World Bank provided assistance with\n            policy reforms and capacity building through a combination\n            of complementary investment and policy lending. BERIS\n            assisted the government in implementing selected policy\n            areas supported by a parallel series of Development Policy\n            Loans. The project also accomplished notable improvements in\n            the business environment by considerably simplifying and\n            streamlining the regulatory environment for opening,\n            operating and closing a business. As a result, investor\n            protection was strengthened and the company law was revised\n            in line with the European Union (EU) requirements. Business\n            registration had been simplified and shortened to one day\n            through the creation of a one-stop shop at the Central\n            Registry. New calibration equipment for the Bureau of\n            Metrology broadened the calibration services to companies in\n            line with EU requirements and quality standards and\n            increased their export potential and competitiveness."}, "docdt": "2010-10-20T07:38:01Z"}
