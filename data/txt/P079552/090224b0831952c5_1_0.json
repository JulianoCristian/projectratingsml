Companies in\n            FYR Macedonia faced many challenges, such as an inefficient\n            and unresponsive bureaucracy, significant regulatory\n            burdens, and a weak judicial system resulting in increased\n            costs and time of doing business. This impeded the private\n            sector's ability to invest and grow. The World\n            Bank's Business Environment Reform and Institutional\n            Strengthening project focused on cutting the red tape and\n            bureaucracy hurdles for the enterprises. The protection of\n            investors was strengthened and the company law was revised\n            in line with the European Union requirements. As a result,\n            the country progressed in improving the business environment\n            and was assessed positively in the annual progress report of\n            the European Union."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T07:47:00Z"}
