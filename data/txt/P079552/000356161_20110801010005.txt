1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Business Environment Reform and Institutional Strengthening (BERIS) Project was
a Technical Assistance Loan in the original amount of Euro 8.8 million, equivalent to US$11.3
million. The Project was designed to complement a series of three annual programmatic
development loans to support the Governmentâ€™s medium-term policy and structural reforms to
improve the investment climate and the governance and efficiency of the public sector.

1.1. Context at Appraisal

2.      The Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia is a small transition economy
and landlocked country with a population of two million people. In the early days of
independence and transition, the country experienced hyperinflation, border conflicts, and civil
disturbances. In spite of the turmoil, successive governments embarked upon an ambitious
reform program aimed at transforming the country into a market economy. State-owned and
socially-owned enterprises were privatized, markets liberalized, and reforms in the financial
sector led to a stronger and more viable banking system. At the same time, the Government
achieved and maintained macroeconomic stability.

3.      Despite achievements in the reforms and macroeconomics stability, the economy
faced numerous challenges, which resulted from the regional instability and countryâ€™s own
deficiencies. These included a weak judicial sector, a failure to attract strategic investors for
privatization of state-owned enterprises, and a failure of owners and managers of newly
privatized firms to restructure or introduce innovations. The enterprise sector had difficulties in
competing in an increasingly global market. Enterprises had been losing market share in
domestic as well as traditional export markets, and were unable to penetrate new markets.
Imports continued to increase, resulting in a widening trade deficit. A poor growth record,
negative trade balance and low foreign direct investments (FDI) reflected the high political risks
associated with the country and more broadly the Balkans. It also reflected an unfavorable
business environment.

4.      Reports and surveys pointed to significant shortcomings in the business
environment. According to the 2004 Competitiveness Growth Index, FYR Macedonia ranked
84 among 104 countries. Lack of clarity and stability in the regulations and corruption
constituted major issues. In the Foreign Investor Advisory Service/ Investment Climate
Advisory Services (FIAS) 2003 Administrative Barriers Review and Administrative and
Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS), most respondents considered the lack of clarity in the existing
regulations (72 percent), instability of laws and regulations (60 percent), and corruption in the
public sector (87 percent) as the major obstacles impacting the development of a friendly
business environment. The generally poor quality of regulations translated into high compliance
costs for businesses, generating strong incentives for companies to remain in the grey economy.

5.    The competitiveness of the economy suffered from an outdated national Metrology,
Standardization, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) system, which was not internationally
recognized. Standards were not in line with the European norms; laboratory facilities were

obsolete and unable to meet the industryâ€™s demand for metrology and testing services.
Therefore, Macedonian enterprises could not control the quality of imported goods or certify that
the quality of their exported goods met European standards. Despite existing laws against
restriction of competition prepared with the support of the European Commission and the
establishment of an anti-monopoly authority, the capacity to effectively enforce a competition
regime compliant with EU was not in place.

6.      Access to credit information on businesses was also limited. The Central Bank
(NBRM) operated a credit registry, however, the system did not provide timely and complete
credit information on borrowers. Access to information collected by the Central Registry (such
as pledges, registered businesses, and annual account statements and financial reports) was also
inadequate. By-laws for the establishment of an integrated information system (â€•one-stop-shop
systemâ€–) and implementation of a streamlined business registration process had been approved
before this operation was appraised. Assistance was considered necessary for the Central
Registry to implement the new systems.

Through investment and adjustment operations, the Bank provided assistance for capacity
building and policy reforms. The BERIS Project was part of a package of closely linked
operations aimed at improving the business environment in the country, consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated August 14, 2003, which outlines a holistic approach to
sustainable economic growth based on robust private sector activity and enhanced investment.
The Project has complemented a parallel operation, the Programmatic Development Policy Loan
(PDPL) series of three DPLs, which was successfully completed in December 2008.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.     The overall objective of the BERIS is to strengthen the capacity of the Government
to improve selected areas of the business environment in an EU-oriented context.

8.     The key project outcome was the demonstrated capacity to coordinate and implement
regulatory reforms, and deliver selected public services in compliance with EU requirements.
Key results indicators mentioned in the PAD were:
   ï‚· number of government officials trained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA)
       concepts and techniques;
   ï‚· number of regulatory regimes streamlined with the RIA and complementary
       methodologies;
   ï‚· number of conformity assessment bodies accredited;
   ï‚· number of calibration completed by the Bureau of Metrology (BoM);
   ï‚· time required to register a business; and
   ï‚· number of ex-officio decisions made by the Commission for the Protection of
       Competition (CPC).

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
        and reasons/justification.

10.     At request by the Government in June 2010, some of the indicators were revised and
refined in order to better reflect and measure the results of the Project as restructured. The
original outcome (PDO) indicator (Demonstrated capacity to coordinate and implement
regulatory reforms, and deliver selected public services in compliance with EU requirements)
was vague in scope and not defined with specific measurable indicators. The restructuring was
adaptive and corrective, introducing new or revised results indicators while the final outcome of
the project remained the same.

11.    The following PDO-level result indicators were included in the modified Results
Framework (RF):
    A. Number of EU Directives dealing with business regulation and operation transposed in
        the national legislation.
    B. Ranking on the ease of doing business in the Doing Business Report.
    C. Overall assessment of the business environment areas supported by the Project in the
        annual EU Progress Report.

12.   Intermediate Outcome Indicators were revised and refined to add clarity to the
monitoring and result measurement of each component. The revised intermediate indicators
are:
    ï‚· Cumulative number of regulatory regimes in business law streamlined using Regulatory
      Impact Assessment.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of laws and by-laws streamlined using Regulatory Guillotine.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of trained technical staff at the MSTQ institutions.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of types of measurements in which the Bureau of Metrology is able
      to provide calibration services.
    ï‚· Annual number of calibrations done by the Bureau of Metrology in line with EU
      standards.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of accreditations granted in accordance with European cooperation
      for Accreditation (EA) standards.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of standards harmonized with EU (CEN and CENELEC).
    ï‚· Cumulative number of trained technical staff at the MSTQ institutions.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of national policies and strategies on competitiveness developed and
      adopted by the Government in line with EU.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of government officials trained in implementation and monitoring of
      national competitiveness policies.
    ï‚· Cumulative number of days required to register a business (in working days)
    ï‚· Cumulative number of business registrations.
    ï‚· Annual number of workshops organized by the Ministry of Economy (MoE) and Sector
      for Economic Reforms (SER) to discuss Governmentâ€™s progress in business environment
      reforms with relevant stakeholders, including progress made in BERIS-supported reforms.


   1.4     Main Beneficiaries


                                               3
13.   The majority of the beneficiaries of the BERIS were public institutions under the
umbrella of the MoE. Project beneficiaries were:
    ï‚· For the Business Regulation Component, the Sector for Economic Reforms at the General
      Secretariat, the Ministry of Economy and legal and economic experts of selected line
      ministries;
    ï‚· For the Metrology, Standards, Testing and Quality Component, the Bureau of Metrology,
      Institute for Accreditation of the Republic of Macedonia (IARM) and the Institute for
      Standardization of the Republic of Macedonia (ISRM);
    ï‚· For the Competition Policy Component, the Commission for the Protection of
      Competition, State-aid Unit and the Industrial Policy Unit of the Ministry of Economy
      (IPU);
    ï‚· For the Information Access Component, the Central Registry and the Supervision
      Department of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM).
    ï‚· The ultimate beneficiaries of the project were businesses and exporters.

14.     The beneficiary agencies were responsible for implementing the activities of their
respective subcomponents as well as for monitoring and evaluation of the results achieved under
the Project.

   1.5      Original Components (as approved).         The Project consists of the following
            components:

 (i)     Business Regulation. This component aimed at addressing the Government's weak
         capacity to establish and implement business friendly regulatory regimes by:
          ï‚· building a regulatory management system at line-ministry and central government
             levels;
          ï‚· developing the capacity to improve the quality of new and existing regulations,
             through the RIA and complementary methods such as the guillotine, starting with the
             pilot for business licensing and market inspections; and
          ï‚· establishing comprehensive and central database of regulations. The component had
             also supported small business surveys and two Administrative Barriers Review and
             Administrative and Regulatory Cost Surveys, which were used to assess outcomes of
             the component.

 (ii)    MSTQ system. To improve competitiveness, this component was designed to improve
         the national MSTQ infrastructure and services in a manner consistent with EU-
         regulations. This was to be achieved by:
          ï‚· modernizing the national metrology infrastructure;
          ï‚· strengthening the capacity of the MSTQ institutions to carry out their mandate in an
             EU-oriented environment;
          ï‚· increasing the business sector awareness of the challenges and opportunities of
             competing in the EU market; and
          ï‚· assisting the country in drafting a development strategy, including reviewing the
             institutional and legislative framework, to bring the country closer to EU
             requirements.


                                                4
    (iii) Competition Policy Regime. The overall objective of the component was to strengthen
          FYR Macedonia's capacity to implement an EU-compliant competition policy regime.
          This was to be done by:
           ï‚· strengthening the capacity of the Commission for Protection of Competition and the
              State-aid Unit (SaU) and its commissioners to implement a competition policy
              regime in line with the acquis communautaire;
           ï‚· strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Economy to design and implement
              industrial policy measures in line with EU requirements;
           ï‚· increasing public awareness of competition policy issues, including the functioning
              of state-aid among relevant stakeholders; and
           ï‚· providing training for relevant stakeholders (e.g., officials of selected line ministries,
              judges, lawyers, etc.) in competition policy, the new competition law and state-aid
              regime.

    (iv) Access to Information. This component aimed at addressing poor access to information
         by:
           ï‚· assisting the NBRM to implement a credit information registry that provides
             information on borrowers in line with relevant EU legislation on privacy and
             consumer data protection, and international best practices;
           ï‚· supporting the Central Registry in: (i) organizing and making relevant business-
             related information available to the public, through the establishment of a centralized
             database; and (ii) establishing a â€•one-stop-shop systemâ€– to streamline business
             registration;
           ï‚· reviewing the legal framework and governance rules for the Central Registry; and
           ï‚· supporting a publicity campaign to increase awareness of the â€•one-stop-shop
             systemâ€– and new business registration system.

    (v)     Project Coordination Support. This component was designed to ensure proper
            implementation and coordination of project activities, including support for financial
            management, procurement and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) requirements. In
            addition, the component would support organization of periodic business surveys,
            integrated public information campaigns for the MSTQ system and competition policy,
            and the dissemination of progress made by the Government in improving the business
            environment among the business community, policy makers and other relevant
            stakeholders.

      1.6      Revised Components


15.     At the request from the Borrower, the World Bank management approved a second level
restructuring to revise Component 3 (see Table 1) in October 2010. This change had been
preceded by a related partial cancellation of accrued project savings of Euro 2.4 million (27% of
the Loan amount) at the request of the Borrower 1 . The subsequent changes â€“ revision of

Component 3 (see Table 1), a new allocation of loan proceeds (see Table 2), revision of project
costs (see Table 3) and of the result framework see Section 1.2 - were formalized in the
restructuring of October 2010. These changes did not affect the PDOs, the implementation
arrangements, or the appraisal summary of the Project.

Component 3 and the partial cancellation, but also to introduce more measurable indicators,
improved or new units of measurement and sources of information for the measurement of the
original outcomes.

20.      The reasons underlining the changes in the restructurings were the following:




3
  Original â€•Total Project Costsâ€– as in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The financing plan for original costs
included a large Borrower financing of Euro 2.46 million that is no longer part of the project financing and not
reflected in the revised project costs. The Borrower co-financing amounts to Euro 127,691 that represents co-
financing of the project costs up to December 2009 when the Bank financing percentage was changed from 90
percent to 100 percent.

                                                        7
Partial cancellation of June 2010:
   ï‚· Original project costs in some cases had been overestimated.
   ï‚· Availability of other financing sources including international donors (EU4, USAID, the
       UK), to support capacity building activities originally envisaged under the Project (e.g. in
       the areas of market inspections, regulatory reform, regulatory impact assessment,
       competition policy). In the last two years preceding the restructuring, the Commission
       for Protection of Competition had received technical assistance from other donors
       (mainly the UK) to support activities and capacity building originally envisioned under
       the BERIS.
   ï‚· Despite the project extension, the timeframe proved to be insufficient to complete the
       procurement for parts of the metrology equipment, due to the fact that they were custom-
       made and the number of manufacturers and suppliers was very limited, thereby
       demanding more time for the procurement process than normally required. Consequently,
       under Component 2, the Bureau of Metrology (segment of the Component) reduced the
       size and value of the procurement package from originally planned 1.1 million EUR to
       800,000 EUR.

Revision of Component 3 in October 2010:
The revision of Component 3 (originally Competition Policy) was due to the fact that EU funded
some technical assistance activities with the CPC originally envisioned under Component 3, so
that the component was slightly revised and broadened as mentioned before. The core change
was in supporting the design and implementation of sector competitiveness policies, as distinct
from competition polices. Emphasis was placed on the Industrial Policy 2009-2020 (required by
the EU), which included five areas of policy intervention: (i) foreign direct investment; (ii)
applied research, development and innovation; (iii) small and medium enterprise (SME)
development; (iv) ecological products and sustainable development; and (v) support to business
clusters and networks. Also, at request by the Minister of Economy and Deputy Prime Minister
of Economic Affairs, the Project provided technical assistance to develop or revise sector
competitiveness strategies, namely: National Crafts Development Strategy, National Tourism
Strategy, Export Promotion Strategy and Strategy for development and management of the
Technological Industrial Development Zones (TIDZ). The amount financed under Component 3
was not substantially modified and other modifications were not considerable.

 In December 2005, FYR Macedonia was granted a status of the EU candidate country, which resulted in more
obligations as well as available resources from the EU through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance.
Consequently, the first EU Progress Report on the country was produced in 2006.

                                                       8
arrangements were based on a streamlined model of Project Coordination Unit (PCU), which
relied on designated ministry staff to carry out project management functions on top of their
regular civil servant duties. This resulted in multiple delays, particularly in procurement
activities. Positive changes took place in the last two years, particularly after the Project was
extended and restructured (March and September, 2010 respectively). The PCU capacity was
strengthened by hiring additional staff: project management and financial specialists. As a result
disbursement increased dramatically less than one year before closing. At the beginning of 2010,
disbursements accounted for less than 13 percent of the total loan proceeds and the contribution
of project activities to the achievement of the development objectives was limited. Final
disbursements exceeded 90 percent of the restructured amount and objectives and targets were
achieved to a considerable extent. Despite progress, due to portfolio consolidation requirements,
the Project had to be closed nonetheless.

22.     Leadership. The first three years of the Project were marked by several changes in the
Government and beneficiary agenciesâ€™ leadership, combined with changes in the World Bank
team. These changes translated in a less than consistent pace of implementation of the Project.
With the strengthening of the project management and procurement activities, the Project
accelerated its implementation. The attention and commitment from the Minister of Economy,
Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Economic Affairs coupled with the
continuity and consensus of MoEâ€™s and the World Bank teamâ€™s during and following the
restructuring process were important factors, which contributed to the successful completion of
the Project.

23.     EU accession. EU accession continues to be highly popular and remains the anchor of
reform in nearly every area of government and public services. The authorities are harmonizing
national legislation with the EU acquis communautaire, with specific achievements in the areas
of company law, movement of goods, enterprise and industrial policy and competition policy,
which have been supported by the Project. Overall, legislation is aligning FYR Macedonian
policy closer with the EU. However, further work is essential to enhance administrative capacity
for legislation implementation and enforcement.

2.1.       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     The objectives of the Project were clear and the components and identified activities
to achieve such objectives were in most cases supported by sound analysis. The BERIS
Project was designed to be implemented in four years, between FY2006 and FY2010 under the
overall responsibility of the Ministry of Economy. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
provided a solid basis to support the relevance of the objectives and concomitant individual
components. The issues surrounding business regulations are elaborated and the data provided
back-up to the analysis. In particular, the references to the FIAS 2003 ARCS and the 2004
Business Competitiveness Index are very illustrative of the issues. Similarly, there is convincing
background regarding the weakness of the MSTQ system and the need to improve it in order to
promote exports and integrate the country with the EU. Technical assistance and equipment are
both described as relevant albeit some needs were overestimated. The need for improved
competition regime is explained and exemplified in highly relevant sectors (i.e.
telecommunications). However, information about the role of the SAU and its potential links

                                                9
with Industrial Policies was weak. Credit Information and Business Registration are elaborated
with adequate background, based on Doing Business 2005. The international experience in this
field was also very relevant as background.

25.     Adequacy of the Project Design. The design of the Project benefited from the
international experience. This type of project has been implemented in several countries in the
region. It addressed clearly identified areas of constraints to development in the business
environment, complementing parallel DPLs and creating better conditions in the business
environment and economic criteria (as outlined in EU acquis) to facilitate the countryâ€™s
accession to the EU. The inclusion of technical assistance, such as training on RIA, regulatory
reforms, the expansion of the one-stop shop for company registration and calibration of
metrology equipment proved to be beneficial for the achievement of the PDOs (although
calibrations of metrology showed weaknesses as we will see later). Components were designed
according to stated objectives, particularly after restructuring, with the exception of Component
3 (Competition Policy restructured into Industrial and Enterprise Policy and Competitiveness
Support Component). This component was vague in part. Over-budgeting in some components
was subsumed in the design, albeit the financing from other donors and the complexity of
procurement in some cases were also important reasons leading to the partial cancellation and
reduction of the project size as explained before. The complexity of the project design with
multiple beneficiary agencies and the limitations of the streamlined PCU model were known but
underestimated in the design. The Quality Enhancement Review (QER) had provided useful
observations about the implementation risks. QER advice was taken into consideration but only
partially. The initial project design was complex and the results framework lacked clear and
measurable indicators, which needed to be revised when the project was restructured. Finally,
budgetary constraints due to the global financial crisis and new financing priorities
(infrastructure, energy) of the Government in 2009 were also reasons for the reduction in
counterpart financing as acknowledged by the Bank in the restructuring. The restructuring
process came rather late in the implementation phase of the Project, i.e., less than a year before
the revised closing date but it led to a significant improvement. The need to restructure the
Project was overlooked by the Government during a November 2008 mission, when the Bank
team identified it as an option. It was subsequently accepted in 2010 with very good results.

26.     Adequacy of Governmentâ€™s (and Implementing Agenciesâ€™) Commitment. The
Government showed commitment to establish an institutional framework for implementation of
regulatory reforms, with a permanent unit (the SER) at the Central Government level (General
Secretariat). That was an important sign of commitment for this loan as well as for the whole
reform process. However, procurement activities were very slow until late in the process
accounting for the slow disbursement until early 2010. This revealed low capacity at the PCU
combined with less than enthusiastic response from the Government and implementing agencies
judging by the long delays. There had also been a weak coordination among key official
agencies: PCU, CPC, ISRM, IARM and BoM. The last three agencies, for example, did not
reach an agreement to hold a joint public awareness campaign. The recent resolution of these
issues had a very positive impact on the final project results.

27.    Assessment of Risks. The PAD identified risks with emphasis on political commitment
to reforms, regional instability and the fact that the country was rated as having high

                                               10
procurement risks. At all government levels, there had been inadequate provision and resources
for auditing procurement transactions. It was stated in the PAD that the BERIS did not entail
any social risk or risk of adverse social impact, an assessment proved to be correct. At the
specific project levels, several risks were mentioned: inadequate staffing at line ministries and
SER, lack of adequate skills by the beneficiary agencies (BoM, ISRM, IARM and MSTQ),
potential high turnover of the PCU staff involved in procurement and financial matters, lack of
experience with World Bank projects by PCU staff. It was mentioned that the MoE had
developed policies and procedures to minimize project financial management risks. Initial
actions to address implementation risks, particularly those related to low capacity
implementation, were rather general and did not prove effective. Implementation issues,
particularly those ones related to procurement, were effectively addressed in a meaningful
manner at almost the end of the Project, early 2010. Lack of proper coordination among the
beneficiary agencies was not foreseen as a potential issue and was addressed late in the
implementation. Country and regional risks, as well as commitments to reforms, seem, at the
end, less problematic than originally envisaged. Key risks were generally assessed in the PAD.
Ex post, key project risks proved to be in financial management, procurement and project
coordination. They were addressed in early 2010.

2.2.        Implementation

28.     A streamlined PCU at the Ministry of Economy was responsible for the overall
project management and coordination with the beneficiary agencies. The PCU was
established within the Sector for European Integration at the Ministry of Economy. The staff
consisted of a Director (civil servant/head of sector) and three local consultants (one financial
management expert, one procurement specialist and one project manager). The Director of the
PCU was appointed by and reports to the Minister of Economy. The PCU was responsible for
financial management, procurement, ensuring a link between the beneficiary agencies and the
Bank, monitoring of project progress, evaluation of results, dissemination of progress made by
the Government in business reforms directly supported by the BERIS and assisting in the
organization of public awareness campaigns (for the MSTQ system, competition policy and
â€•one-stop-shop systemâ€–) and periodic business surveys such as the ARCSs. The PCU also
assisted beneficiary entities in all aspects related to the BERIS implementation. The PCU had
been staffed with civil servants who have additional and competing responsibilities. That factor
had been considered an important reason for delays until new specialized staff was appointed.
Reporting on indicators had been weak but improved late in the Project.

29.     The PCU lacked implementation capacity due to severe understaffing. One of the
consequences of the understaffing was delay in implementation and low level of disbursement.
The risk of large undisbursed amounts had been flagged in several opportunities (that risk
persisted all along albeit clearly reduced after restructuring). The PCU increased its operational
capacity by hiring new, experienced staff, namely a Program Manager and a Financial Manager,
which strengthened the fiduciary management, implementation and disbursement. These
changes, together with an enhanced sense of commitment, contributed to a sharp acceleration of
disbursements in the last year of the Project.




                                               11
2.3.     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     In general terms, the M&E arrangements design, implementation and utilization
were adequate. The PCU was responsible for coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the
project activities. In support of the PCU, the BERIS included a small component to build the
central M&E capacity. The PCU was responsible for collecting and analyzing data from project
implementing entities, and preparing biannual progress reports for the MoE, the SER, the SC,
other policy makers, and the Bank. Each beneficiary agency established an M&E system
enabling the assessment of outcomes and results under each specific project component. BERIS
had also financed a small component to build the M&E capacity at SER. At the conclusion of
this BERIS, the responsibility for monitoring and evaluation of the business environment is
expected to remain with the SER.

31.     The Results Framework, from todayâ€™s perspective, as included in the original PAD
was deficient, however, it was improved in the project restructuring in 2010. The PDO
Indicator in the original results framework was too general and not amenable to practical
measurements. The Intermediate Outcomes Indicators were more operational although in some
cases did not include clear units of measurement. Improvement in the RF took place as part of
the project restructuring. In the new RF, the indicators were easier to monitor, baseline values
were included in most cases and units of measurement were, by and large, clear. The new RF,
complemented by other collected information, allows assessing key project objectives. The
quality of the information as recently collected appears moderately satisfactory, including the
substantial information on the countryâ€™s progress in the business environment and in the
economic criteria in general, provided in EU Progress Reports between 2006 and 2010. The
PCU did not consistently submit biannual progress report based on performance indicators.

2.4.        Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     The Safeguard policy is not applicable according to the PAD and the Project
Restructuring Paper. In addition, it was stated that the â€•Ministry of Environment is planning to
perform a pilot RIA review of the Law on Waste Management.â€– (Aide Memoire, November
2008 Mission) 5 . Problems on Financial Management were acknowledged in several
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and Aide Memoires (AMs). However, the Project did not
experience any misprocurement actions or reputational issues. According to the last ISR,
financial statements were delayed for more than three months and analytical reports were lacking.
Problems on Financial Management did not manifest themselves fully for a while as the number
of transactions was limited. This has changed as the Project accelerated the pace of
implementation. Assistance, consisting of a Financial Management Consultant has been
provided since early 2010 for the very year of the Project.


5
  The mid-term aide memoire referred to the â€•environmentalâ€– conditions of the labs. However, it was subsequently
clarified, the mid-term review was referring to internal â€•temperature and humidity-related factorsâ€– prevailing in the
labs, not to environmental factors in the general sense.




                                                        12
33.     Financial management arrangements continued to be assessed as moderately
unsatisfactory throughout most of the implementation, due to lack of appropriate analytical
accounting records and lack of submission of quarterly financial reports (FMRs). In addition, the
project's financial management function was vacant for a period of one year. On the positive
side, the project audits had clean opinion throughout the project implementation. The World
Bank on site supervision missions did not identify any particular irregularities either during the
transactions review.

34.    Agreement on last financial and audit reports. It has been agreed with the
implementing entity that they will submit to the World Bank the financial report for the whole
unreported period by June 15 2011. The last audit of the project is due on June 30 2011.

2.5.    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.     The Project achieved most of its objectives and key elements for the Project
sustainability are, in most cases, in place. First, the consolidation of key institutions/processes
has been largely achieved (SER, RIA, regulatory guillotine). Second, the perceived commitment
to the integration with the EU and continued dialogue with the authorities, by the World Bank
provide a good reassurance for the sustainability of this Project. Third, there are, however, some
weaknesses in the MSTQ system and more could be done on consultations with stakeholders.
Conditions for sustainability are elaborated below:

    ï‚·   Establishment of a permanent institutional framework and processes at the Central
        Government. In this regard, the following has been observed: (i) SER was created; it is
        expected to perform its duties beyond the project life; (ii) RIA methodology, together
        with the guillotine, has been increasingly applied as informed below. RIA has been
        (institutionally) used for all new legislation considered by the Government with the
        exception of legislation under urgent procedures; and (iii) regular consultation/dialogue
        between the Government and stakeholders to discuss progress in business environment
        reforms is underway. In the project experience, progress was limited as only 8
        workshops were held, out of 20 targeted. However, according to public information, the
        SER team led by the Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs established a practice to
        visit businesses to discuss the issues that they are facing in the regulatory and operating
        environment, which could be addressed by the Government. This practice will have to
        become regular.
    ï‚·   Sustainability of the BERISâ€™s achievements will be enhanced by FYR Macedoniaâ€™s
        progress toward EU membership. As of December 2005, FYR Macedonia is an EU
        candidate country and is committed to membership in the EU.
    ï‚·   More remains to be done to bring the national MSTQ system closer to the EU. The
        EU is providing additional technical assistance through the Instrument for Pre-Accession
        Assistance (IPA) and the process seems progressing moderately satisfactory as assessed
        by the annual EU Progress Reports for the country.
    ï‚·   There has been a limited use of an M&E system as a way of informing the business
        community and civil society while providing accountability of the Government


                                                13
         institutions in the implementation of reforms. With some weaknesses, the M&E system
         does work but there is no evidence that it is widely publicized.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

36.     The objectives and design of BERIS were of high relevance in support of the goals of
the authorities as stated in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2004-2010, namely
faster growth by building on improved business environment and EU accession. In
achieving these goals, BERIS was complementary to the PDPL series implemented in the period
2006-2009. According to the ICR, the PDPLs achieved it developmental outcomes of improving
business environment with moderate risks. IEG review concurred. BERIS implementation
revealed several problems, which were solved, to a large extent, with the restructuring. Local
capacity, particularly on financial management and procurement, had been overestimated
resulting in delays until early 2010. Unrealistic costing for some components was included in
the design but amended in the restructuring. The complexity of some procurement demanded
more time and efforts than expected; this also led to some cancellations in the restructuring.
Beneficiary agencies did not coordinate properly and that possibility was not anticipated in the
PAD. Again, these shortcomings and challenges were largely addressed at a latter stage of the
Project life.

3.2.     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

37.     The overall objective of the BERIS is to strengthen the capacity of the Government
to improve selected areas of the business environment in an EU-oriented context. The
project achieved most of its objectives and targets, as presented by the status of the indicators:

38.      PDO Indicators:
      A. The ranking of â€•ease of doing businessâ€– improved markedly: from 96 in 2007 to 38 in
         2010. It was considered among the three top reformers in 2009 (Doing Business Report
         2010) and 11th globally by the level of cumulative change accomplished between 2005-
         2010 (Doing Business Report 2011).
      B. The â€•Overall assessment of the business environment areas supported by the Project in
         the annual EU Progress Reportâ€– is positive. According to the EU Progress Report 2010,
         the country continues to be well advanced in the economic criteria and in the areas
         supported by the Project it is making further progress. The report recommends starting
         accession negotiations as the Project established as a target.
      C. The Number of EU Directives dealing with business regulation and operation transposed
         in the national legislation increased partially from three to five directives6 out of seven
         targeted. This indicator was included in the original RF (before restructuring).


6
  Fourth Company Law Directive on annual accounts, Tenth Company Law Directive on cross-border mergers of
limited liability companies, Shareholders Rights Directive on the right of pre-emption of shareholders and electronic
registration of companies; First Company Law Directive on lower levies for data from the Central Registry; the
Law on European Company was introduced. (Source: EU Progress Report 2010).

                                                         14
39.   The above mentioned outcomes are supported by the following outputs/intermediate
outcomes linked to specific project activities:

    1. Cumulative number of regulatory regimes in business law streamlined using Regulatory
        Impact Assessment: three out of a target of five (As part of the RIA process, of the 360
        laws that have been adopted by the Government since the system was in place, 60 are
        laws ratifying international conventions and protocols and as such not subject to RIA,
        254 laws included the RIA process while 46 were adopted without such process).
    2. Cumulative number of laws and by-laws streamlined using Regulatory Guillotine: 564
        over a target of 550.
    3. Annual number of calibrations done by the Bureau of Metrology in line with EU
        standards: 493 over 100 targeted.
    4. Cumulative number of types of measurements in which the Bureau of Metrology is able
        to provide calibration services: 18 over 50 targeted. This is a key output measurement for
        the MSTQ component. According to the 2010 EU Progress Report for FYR Macedonia,
        amendments to the Law on metrology and the Rulebook on measuring instruments were
        adopted, ensuring further alignment with the EU. The first two reference standards of the
        Bureau of Metrology, for volume of flow and for measuring unit for mass, were
        recognized as national standards. The Bureau acquired full membership status with the
        European Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET). In July 2010, the
        Government adopted a strategic development plan for the Bureau of Metrology and for
        the metrological infrastructure for 2010-2012. The procurement of new equipment for
        laboratories for temperature, mass, pressure, time and frequency improved the
        institutional capacity of the Bureau. However, no laboratories have been accredited yet
        and they are not yet adequately equipped to enable effective operation of the Bureau.
        Moreover, the Bureauâ€™s staff has been reduced by three employees.
    5. Number of ex-officio decisions relative to total number of decisions made by the
        Commission for the Protection of Competition: 30 percent of the target.
    6. Cumulative number of business registrations: more than 100,000 which is slightly less
        than the target of 105,000.
    7. Cumulative number of days required to register a business declined from 40 days to 4
        hours, which is the revised target7.
    8. Cumulative number of trained technical staff at the MSTQ institutions: No information
        provided. However, report of some training has been reported an included a Tour to EU
        countries by MSTQ technicians.
    9. Cumulative number of accreditations granted in accordance with European cooperation
        for Accreditation (EA) standards increased from 3 to 55 (the target was 50).
    10. Cumulative number of EU (CEN and CENELEC) standards adopted: According to the
        2010 EU Progress Report for FYR Macedonia (Chapter 1, Free movement of goods, page
        31), cumulatively, by October 2010, the ISRM had adopted 15,308 standards, of which


7
 The Doing Business Report of 2010 measures the time as 3 days for 3 procedures, however the Central Registry
has demonstrated in writing (Reform Update to the Doing Business 2009) that they can technically register a
business in 4 hours.


                                                      15
          13,707 are European standards. The newly adopted standards relate mainly to the areas
          of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, machinery, medicinal products and services,
          construction products and oil derivatives. The ISRM has identified about 11,700
          potentially conflicting standards, of which 3,146 have already been withdrawn.
      11. Cumulative number of national policies and strategies on competitiveness developed and
          adopted by Government in line with EU. The target was two and it was achieved.
      12. Cumulative number of the government officials trained in implementation and
          monitoring of national competitiveness policies: increased from zero to 20 over a target
          of 50.
      13. Annual number of workshops organized by the MoE and SER to discuss the
          Governmentâ€™s progress in business environment reforms with relevant stakeholders,
          including progress made in BERIS-supported reforms increased from two to eight. The
          target was 20.

40.      Other outputs/indicators not captured by IOIs but available, include:

      14. One stop shop for business registration has been finalized. It is linked with the
          employment agency, social contribution funds (pension and health insurance) and
          providing information for market transactions8.
      15. The Disaster Recovery System has been finalized providing a back-up to the business
          data at the Central Registry.
      16. A television and print media public relations campaign has taken place and a web portal
          has been established to solicit comments and input from the private sector.
          Approximately 500 responses have been received to date through the web portal. This
          system is not active any longer.
      17. The building of a regulatory management system at line-ministry and central government
          levels was advanced with the consolidation of SER as permanent entity (for RIA and the
          â€•guillotineâ€–) and the establishment of regular RIA procedures at each relevant ministry.
      18. Establishing comprehensive and central database of regulations. There have been 1,583
          entries in the Single National Electronic Registry of Regulations (SNERR), out of which
          52 regulations were in the phase of being reviewed for adoption. A breakdown by
          Ministry was reported.
      19. Supporting small business surveys and two Administrative Barriers Review and
          Administrative and Regulatory Cost Surveys, which will be used to assess outcomes of
          the (business regulation) component. Initial surveys were conducted but not regularly.
      20. Increasing business sector awareness of the challenges and opportunities of competing in
          the EU market, including the functioning of state-aid among relevant stakeholders. No
          information of progress on this activity.



8
  For example, there will be a list in the Central Register with persons that have blocked accounts, opened
companies several times, put the companies into bankruptcy and opened new companies and have criminal or
misdemeanor sanctions. These persons will not be able to open new companies again.




                                                    16
      21. Strengthening the capacity of the CPC and the State-aid Unit and its commissioners to
          implement a competition policy regime in line with the acquis communautaire. Few,
          isolated training was provided to officials.
      22. Strengthening the capacity of MoE to design and implement industrial policy measures in
          line with EU requirements. This was developed with Project support and is considered
          important for EU accession under Chapter 20. The Project assisted in the development
          and adoption of the Industrial Policy Strategy 2009-2010 and the Green Book on
          Competitiveness and competitiveness strategies on several sectors (ICT, wood, metal
          processing, food, tourism and handicrafts).
      23. The Project assisted in development of the first National Innovation Scoreboard
          according to EU methodology, which benchmarks the performance of the innovation of
          the private sector and compares it with the performance in the EU member countries. In
          2010, thanks to the support from BERIS, FYR Macedonia was included in the EU
          Innovation Scoreboard for the first time.
      24. Reviewing the legal framework and governance rules for the Central Registry. No
          progress reported and/or documented in this regard.
      25. Supporting a public campaign to increase awareness of the â€•one-stop-shop systemâ€– and
          new business registration system. Some campaigns were in fact undertaken but they
          were not financed by the Project.
      26. Support organization of periodic business surveys, integrated public information
          campaigns for the MSTQ system and competition policy, and the dissemination of
          progress made by the Government in improving the business environment among the
          business community, policy makers and other relevant stakeholders. No progress
          reported.
      27. Accreditations granted by IARM in line with EU. By October 2010, IARM had
          accredited a total of 55 conformity assessment bodies and withdrawn nine accreditations.
          The adoption of the new Law on Accreditation is in line with the EU. The number of
          staff and experts working for the Institute for Accreditation (IARM) increased to 15 full-
          time employees, 16 lead assessors, 64 technical assessors and 44 experts. The procedure
          for signing multilateral agreements covering testing laboratories, inspection bodies and
          product certification bodies with European cooperation for Accreditation (EA) started.
          The IARM signed co-operation agreements with the accreditation body of Bosnia and
          Herzegovina.

      Summing up:
         ï‚· Three out of four PDO Indicators (outcomes) were achieved; one was partially achieved.
           The contribution of BERIS to these outcomes is necessarily partial and goes hand in hand
           with other Bank loans (especially PDPLs) and donorsâ€™ activities (particularly of the EU).
         ï‚· Six IOIs were achieved or exceed the target and six were partially achieved.
         ï‚· 12 Indicators were not included among the IOIs: five were achieved, three partially
           achieved, two did not report any progress and in two of them no information is available.

Results â€“ linkages:

41.       Key aspects of the PDOs to be captured by outcomes (or PDO Indicators) are:
      ï‚·   Strengthened capacity of selected areas of business environment.

                                                 17
      ï‚·    EU-oriented context.
      ï‚·    Both aspects are clearly interlinked.

42.        PDO Indicators (outcomes):
      ï‚·    PDO Indicator A measures the improvement in business environment, which is an
           outcome.
      ï‚·    PDO Indicator B measures the â€•EU oriented contextâ€–.
      ï‚·    PDO Indicators C and D do provide indications that the country has become closer to the
           EU. However, they seem more like IOIs rather than PDO Indicators (project outcomes),
           thereby complementing other IOIs that measure progress towards the â€•EU contextâ€–.

43.        Intermediate Outcomes Indicators (IOIs):
      ï‚·    IOIs # 1, 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21 and 22 are linked to the business environment
           (PDO Indicator A). There is strong evidence of such linkages around the world in that
           regard although it is recognize that these indicators are contributors to the business
           environment, which also depend on other factors. Precisely, this is where the links with
           other operations, particularly the PDPLs, becomes highly relevant.
      ï‚·    IOI # 7 is a result of other actions, i.e. IOIs # 1 and 2. It will also provide an indication of
           improvement in the business environment and could be used as outcome (PDO Indicator).
      ï‚·    IOIs # 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24 are associated with project activities, which
           bring the country closer to the EU (PDO Indicator B). The link is, in most cases, self-
           explanatory. Other factors, outside this Project, are also crucial in bringing the country
           closer to the EU.

3.3        Efficiency

44.     Considering the scope of the operation, much of the return will be in the form of
better performing institutions and increased compliance with EU requirements. Benefits
should be measured in the form of performance indicators. Some weak aspects in the design,
solved by the restructuring, may have resulted in some additional costs/time or reduced
efficiency. They were not substantial. The amount spent to prepare this operation exceeded
US$300,000. Approximately US$80,000/year were spent in supervision. The amount spent in
supervision seems reasonable and in line, or even lower, relative to similar projects in the region.
The amount spent in preparation is in line with similar projects in the region and may be
considered somewhat on the high side9. Considering these factors, the efficiency of the project
in achieving a return to the investment is rated substantial.

3.4        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
45.     The project achieved its development objective efficiently to a moderately
satisfactory extent. The project objectives have been very relevant in view of the country issues.

Objectives and targets were generally achieved. This Project made an important contribution to
such achievement. In fact, indicators show important progress towards the project objectives and
targets with some exceptions, for example, on metrology calibrations. The Project was designed
to tackle the sector issues described in the PAD and contributed to the PDOs (notwithstanding
some weakness in design and implementation of Component 3 â€“ Competition Policy). Some
weaknesses in implementation design were evident and prompted a late restructuring, as
described before. The restructuring proved to be very appropriate. However, time and resources
were spent meanwhile and the efficiency of the Project may have been affected to some extent.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
N/A

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

46.     In the context of overall economic reforms and integration with the EU, the BERIS
Project contributed to important institutional progress. The implementation of the RIA
system as a permanent, internalized system, the introduction of the so-called guillotine, the
improvement in the MSTQ infrastructure, the improvement in the credit registry system and
efficient functioning of the One-Stop-Shop system at the Central Registry are all tangible results
of this Project in the institutional area. Notwithstanding these facts, progress fell somewhat short
of expected in some cases, particularly in the metrology area (calibration systems). The process
of private sector consultation should be underscored, as it provides some reassurances, but needs
to be improved and sustained. It started in 2007: a broad range of stakeholders in the private
sector had been consulted. Eight workshops were conducted with private sector representatives
in different parts of FYR Macedonia, which was nevertheless short of the target. Also, a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with several private sector organizations thus
providing legitimacy to the process.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
47.     The risks of policy changes that may affect the development outcome seem moderate
since the economic dynamics and relations with the rest of Europe have amplified the benefits of
reforms. This Project has generated strong constituencies. For example, RIA is highly
appreciated as a business simplifier, the national MSTQ services (in a manner consistent with
EU-regulations) is likely to be more and more demanded by exporters, access to credit
information is becoming widespread and a steady part of doing businesses. Institutions such as

                                                19
the Bureau of Metrology, Institute for Accreditation of the Republic of Macedonia, the Institute
for Standardization of the Republic of Macedonia, and the Supervision Department of the
National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia are largely consolidated beyond the closing of this
operation. Nevertheless, management turnover must be kept at acceptable levels in relevant
agencies; it had been high until recently.

48.    Some risk remains that the Project will not fully materialize its benefits because
beneficiary agencies may not be provided with the needed political and economic support.
However, this risk is moderate or even low at this stage as agencies are better established and
demand for their services by businessmen and exporters are on the rise10.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
49.     The Project was prepared with solid sector knowledge and paying attention to the
international and regional experience. It was highly relevant in view of the country issues and
the CPS. Design was generally appropriate. However, there were important weaknesses. First,
one component (Component 3 â€“Competition) was not particularly clear or well focused and costs
proved to be overestimated in some cases. Second, Monitoring and Evaluation arrangements
were adequate but the results framework was weak. It was improved when the Project was
restructured. Third, some implementation problems were to some extent overlooked and solved
late in the Project (i.e. technical readiness for procurement, financial management and
coordination among agencies). Finally, implementation risks due to institutional deficiencies
were, therefore, underestimated at the preparatory/PAD stage.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
50.     Supervision missions focused on the development objectives, particularly business
environment. Thanks to the clarity of (several) supervision missions, including mid-term review,
a successful restructuring took place in 2010. Missions insisted on the need to improve financial
management and procurement, which had been the main implementation weaknesses. This was
reflected in several ISRs, AMs and, more fundamentally, on the measures taken to restructure the
project and accelerate disbursement. However, initial ISRs did not report on results. Results
reporting were generally poor until the Project was fairly advanced. As implementation advanced,
ISRs elaborated on progress and issues with candor. They could have emphasized more on the
results as reported in the indicators. Changes of staff at the beginning of the Project,
compounded with changes in the counterparts, may have impacted the Project negatively. There

   Exports to neighboring countries are increasing. These countries are now controlling their imports with EU
regulations in mind.

is some evidence of WB contribution to ensure adequate arrangements for regular operations of
supported activities after the loan closing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
51.    Since the final development outcome is Moderately Satisfactory, this rating gives more
weight to the rating on supervision.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
52.      In the final and decisive stage of the Project, the Ministry of Economy and Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) have done a very good job and demonstrated strong commitment and
initiative. Covenants were fulfilled (albeit one of them with some delay from the implementing
agencies). Reforms were advanced providing a proper framework for the project implementation.
There is evidence of some consultations with stakeholders. Their inputs to relevant policy
decisions had been requested. As mentioned before, the preparatory process was not fully up to
the demands required by this project; readiness for implementation had been deficient. This
explains, to a large extent, delays in implementation. Frequent changes of Directors at
beneficiary agencies (i.e. MSTQ), mostly related to changes in the political scene, had played a
negative role; they were ameliorated by the stability of technical staff. The Government showed
strong commitment and decision in resolving these issues in 2010. There had been long periods
of slow movements and lack of strong decisions before (recent changes at political level may
have helped to implement decisions at the end). Financial Management had been weak; financial
statements not yet produced, no irregular procurement was reported, coordination with other
donors operating in the sector â€“and affecting the Projectâ€”appears adequate, the final
arrangements to operate BERIS activities after the Project is closed seem also adequate,
particularly with the continuity of SER, the institutionalization of RIA, BoM, and the support
obtained from the EU to several relevant activities.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
53.     Most beneficiary agencies showed uneven commitment during most of the project
implementation. Again, improvements took place mostly after restructuring. Coordination had
not been very strong, mainly due to changing leadership in the institutions and understaffing at
the PCU. The challenge of coordination was particularly pronounced on matters related to
reporting, financial management and procurement. It took too long for beneficiary agencies to
resolve pending issues, to accommodate to each other when coordination was required. The
strong commitment at government level in the last year did impact on the agenciesâ€™ performance,
which improved markedly as the Project was closing. Their arrangements for transition to the
post-BERIS period seem adequate as their structures are basically established.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (MS)
54.    Since the final development outcome is Moderately Satisfactory, this rating gives more
weight to the rating on government performance.

6. Lessons Learned

55.       The following lessons were learned from implementing the Project:

      ï‚·   Even a late restructuring could significantly improve implementation. When
          implementation is unacceptably slow, the Team should raise the issue to the highest
          possible level as soon as possible, draw proper options and proceed. Make sure that
          extensions are appropriately timed to accommodate to the complexity of procurement
          activities underway so as to fully achieve objectives and targets.

      ï‚·   Having dedicated staff in implementing agencies is crucial for the success of the
          Project. Pay detailed attention to the readiness of implementing agencies to carry out
          their duties at preparatory stage, particularly their capacity and staffing needs for project
          management, financial management and procurement. Remedial measures should be
          implemented before the Project is launched otherwise decisions tend to be postponed
          severely impacting the pace of implementation. Continuity of relevant staff could be
          determinant in the pace of implementation, including WB staff involved in preparation
          and supervision.

      ï‚·   When there are several institutions involved in implementation, coordination issues
          should be anticipated before the Project is launched. In such a case, a higher-level
          mechanism should be in placed to resolve issues expeditiously.

      ï‚·   Project costing should be paid detailed attention at the preparatory stage particularly
          when â€•custom-madeâ€– procurements are part of the design.

                        Information about the implementation of the BERIS Project

Component 1: Improvement of business regulations

Within the framework of component 1, the Project supported important aspects related to the
improvement of the legal and institutional framework in the field of business environment. Namely the
BERIS Project was the first and only project that began systemic examination of the institutional and
legal mechanisms for establishing the so called Regulatory impact assessment, as well as the Regulatory
guillotine process which was used to implement the largest and most substantive so far, activities related
to the reduction of the administrative burden on the business sector in the Republic of Macedonia.
Specifically, the project financed a Study for the establishment of RIA and the Regulatory guillotine in
the Macedonian legal system. This was continued by the provision of technical assistance for
strengthening the capacities of the General secretariat â€“ sector of economic policy and regulatory reform
as the highest RIA body. An initial training workshop was held on RIA in the public administration;
templates were prepared for RIA assessments and there is a legal obligation to use RIA assessment
templates for every new proposed law or bylaw to be enacted by the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia and prepared by the responsible line ministries; the first legislation overview in the Republic
of Macedonia which includes the principle â€•silence is consentâ€– was prepared and provided overall legal
and institutional systemic establishment of RIA in the Republic of Macedonia, something that did not
exist before this project.

At the same time with this process, the Ministry of Economy, in the process of harmonizing the
legislation of the Republic of Macedonia with the legislation of the EU, determined that there is an urgent
need of technical assistance to implement the last phase of the harmonization, the so called â€•cross borderâ€–
phase. The project finances technical assistance to prepare and transpose the packet of EU directives and
regulations related to â€•cross borderâ€– aspects. In that context, the following activities were implemented:

Technical assistance was provided in the preparation of the Law on Changes and Additions to the Law on
Companies. This law was subsequently enacted (â€•Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia
no.42/10) together with accompanying correspondence tables that received positive opinions about being
100% harmonized, from the European Commission. These changes helped harmonize the legislation with
Directive 32007L0036 on the administration of the rights of shareholding companies listed on the stock
exchange as well as improve the legal framework for doing business in the Republic of Macedonia.

Technical assistance was provided in the preparation of the Law on Changes and Additions to the Law on
Companies. This law was subsequently enacted (â€•Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia
no.48/10) together with accompanying correspondence tables that received positive opinions about being
100% harmonized, from the European Commission. These changes helped harmonize the legislation with
Directive 32007L0056 on cross border merging of companies.

Technical assistance was provided for the preparation of the Law on European Company which was
enacted (â€•Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia no.115/10). This law incorporates the

     The text below is a translation from original in Macedonian, received at WB Skopje office on May 18, 2011.


                                                         33
provisions that allow the use of the options provided in the Council Regulation on the Statute for a
European company 32001R2157 and Directive 32001L0086 on participation of employees in a European
company.

Technical assistance was provided for the preparation of the Law on european economic interest Groups
which is expected to be enacted in June 2011 according to the plan of the Secretariat for European Affairs.
However the law has been prepared and has been completely harmonized between the different
institutions. It incorporates provisions that allow the use of the options provided in the Regulation on
European Economic Interest Groups.

Technical assistance was provided for the preparation of the Law on Changes and Additions to the Law
on the One Stop Shop System and Maintenance of the Company Registry and the Registry of other legal
Entities which was enacted (â€•Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia no. 17/2011) together with
legal expertise about the possibilities to further harmonize the procedural norms or rules of procedure for
registration of companies, implemented in accordance with this law, with the Directive 32003L0058
which, at the same time legally enables the realization of phase 2 of the One Stop Shop System Project,
i.e. the establishment of an electronic filing of all documents at the moment of the registration of
companies in the company registry. In addition, there is a possibility for electronic preparation of the
required documents and electronic signature instead of providing hardcopies notarized by a notary public
(which still exists as an option). Thus, this law has been fully harmonized with Directive 32003L0058.

Finally, the project supported the preparation of the first country innovation scoreboard. This is a report
that presents the results of the implementation of the first generation of indicators of the European
Innovation Scoreboard (EIS) in the Republic of Macedonia. The purpose of this document is to provide
methodology, methods and tools for future implementation of the Macedonian part of the European
Innovation Scoreboard. The European Innovation Scoreboard is published in the European Union every
year since 2001 in order to monitor and measure innovation performances of the EU member states. In
2008 the methodology of the EIS was revised and the number of dimensions being monitored increased to
7, and they were grouped in three main blocks: enablers, company activities Ð¸ outcomes. Each of these
dimensions includes a group of indicators that provide for a balanced assessment of the innovation
performances of that dimension. The indicator groups and dimensions are deigned in a way as to capture
the different innovation processes and models occurring in the different countries. EIS uses the latest data
from Eurostat, as well as other internationally acknowledged sources available during the analysis.
Whenever possible the data collection makes use of internationally recognized institutions in order to
enhance the comparability of data from different countries. A significant source of data is the Community
Innovation Survey, i.e. surveys implemented by the country every 2-3 years in order to determine the
situation with the innovative activities at the level of forms. In the Republic of Macedonia, some of the
indicators were calculated with an analysis of the results from the implemented field survey (more than
2000 companies were analyzed). This innovation scoreboard should be used to provide summative and
hard evidence that will raise public awareness, support policy debate and provide legislators with
fundamental inputs into innovation, research and development policy creation. This is a first version of
the EIS report for the Republic of Macedonia, with the main purpose of defining and introducing a system
for data identification and analysis in the future. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to draw
conclusions on the basis of the information presented further in this report. Based on these arguments it is
necessary, in due time, to develop a system for relevant data collection that will provide for more reliable
results. The set methodology is valid for further implementation and will be used for future surveys,
providing more reliable conclusions.

Component 2: Development of quality system



                                                    34
Within this component the Project successfully continued the efforts of the previous projects financed by
the EU which established the legal and institutional framework of the Quality System in the Republic of
Macedonia. In that context, this component implemented procurements for six laboratories of the
metrology bureau. This includes equipment for the following laboratories:

            -   Laboratory for mass measurements;
            -   Laboratory for temperature measurements;
            -   Laboratory for time and frequency measurements;
            -   Laboratory for pressure measurements;
            -   Accessories for the existing equipment;
            -   Spectrometer.

In addition, IT equipment was also procured for the needs of the metrology bureau. The project also
provided complete material and technical equipment for the training center at the accreditation institute of
the Republic of Macedonia (office and IT equipment).

The project funds used to realize the above mentioned procurements in fact helped the Republic of
Macedonia provide for the necessary level of institutional development of the quality system with a view
of fulfilling the requirements of the EU with respect to free movement of goods. Investing in new
equipment for both the Bureau and IARM is, in fact the biggest investment in these institutions in the past
4 years which means that the project directly enabled both institutions maintain their level of development
so that the Republic of Macedonia could continue to receive positive opinions from the EU that it fulfills
the criteria for membership in the EU from the point of view of free movement of goods. Without the
contribution of the project, the country would have clearly continued to receive constant negative
opinions.

The benefit of the project is also important, considering that after the completion of the project there will
be a new project financed by the EU for strengthening the capacities of the metrology bureau and IARM.
The prerequisite for realization of this new project was the achievement of the objectives of the competent
2 of the BERIS Project. In that context, the Republic of Macedonia was able to join the regional project
for the development of quality systems financed by the EU in 2011/2013.

Component 3: Industrial and enterprise policy and competition support.

The goals of this component are to strengthen the Commission for protection of competition and the
industrial policy department in the Ministry of Economy. The preparations of the most important strategic
documents of the Republic of Macedonia from the aspect of industrial development were realized within
the framework of this component, including the national industrial policy strategy and action plan for its
implementation, supported by the study for development of indicators for measuring of the success of the
national economy which will be enacted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia, the National
Study for Development of 11 Technological and Development Industrial Zones in the Republic of
Macedonia enacted by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. The National Strategy for
Development of Artisanship in the Republic of Macedonia and the National Strategy for Promotion of
Export were prepared and are in the final phase of adoption, and the Proposal National Strategy for
Development of Tourism was completely revised.

The project financed the procurement of IT equipment for the Commission for Protection of Competition
and financed several trainings in various topics in the area of protection of competition and state aid for
the CPC staff. As a result of the above activities, the country progress reports in European integrations, in
the chapter about the Industry Policy from the aspect of quality, efficiency, public administration work
plans and programs, give assessment of achieved progress.

                                                     35
The biggest benefit from the realization of the project activities in this component comes from the fact
that the European Union has provided EUR 2 million to support the implementation of the National
Industrial Policy Strategy, and the project provided financing of EUR 220,000 for three sub-projects
which enabled this EU assistance planned for 2012.

Component 4: Access to information

Most of the funds from the BERIS Project were realized within the framework of this component, which
is logical if we consider that the country is one of the world leaders in the area of access to business
information. Namely, the information technology development of the Central Registry of the Republic of
Macedonia was financed in the framework of this component, making the country a world leader in
business opening (currently fourth in the world and first in Europe). This was enabled with the so called
one stop shop project phase 2 which included: procurement of hardware for the Central Registry,
development of software for electronic filing of annual accounts, procurement of a system for saving of
the Central Registryâ€™s databases, preparation of a Strategy for Application of XBRL in the financial and
business information exchange and certainly the core of the OSS2 project which included:

    ï‚·   Electronic filing of documents for registration in the company registry (electronic registration of
        companies)
    ï‚·   Electronic monitoring of bankruptcy procedures
    ï‚·   Electronic filing of documents in the leasing registry
    ï‚·   Electronic filing of documents in the pledge registry
    ï‚·   Electronic registration of the first employments during registration of companies
    ï‚·   Electronic register of persons who are forbidden to manage and establish companies.

Institutional implementation of the Directive 2003/58/EC on electronic filing of documents in the
company registry and the Directive 1999/93/EC on electronic signature;
    1. Creating an online business infrastructure for domestic and foreign entities;
    2. Promotion of the interoperability between all institutions and bodies involved in the process of
         company registration and business operations;
    3. Raising of the level of transparency and efficiency in the bankruptcy and liquidation procedures;
    4. Protection of the business community from illegal activities through introduction of register of
         disqualified entities;
    5. Raising of the rate of return for the investors in the bankruptcy and liquidation procedures;
    6. Providing conditions for further progress in business loan provision through implementation of
         the e-pledge and e-leasing systems.

The functional solutions of the one stop shop project phase 2 are the following:
   1. Electronic filing of documents for registration, changes and removal of the companies and other
      legal entities registry;
   2. Direct submission of electronic attachments (statutes, establishment contracts, authorizations etc.)
      prepared in electronic form and digitally signed with valid digital signatures;
   3. Replacement of notary verifications with digital signatures;
   4. Bilingual communication and documentation of the registrations (Macedonian and English);

                                                    36
    9. Real time recording of blocked transaction accounts of legal entities;
   10. Automatic identification and â€•blacklistingâ€– of natural persons and legal entities that perform
       management functions in companies with blocked accounts or who have been banned from
       activity. Preventing the â€•blacklistedâ€– legal entities and natural persons of any function in new
       companies until they are â€•blacklistedâ€–;
   11. Keeping a complete electronic bankruptcy file by the bankruptcy trustees in a transparent manner
       available to the public via internet;
   12. Precise statistical insight in the bankruptcy procedures for the regulatory bodies, the state and the
       creditors.
   13. Electronic filing of registration, change and removal documents for the pledge registry and leasing
       registry;
   14. Direct service of electronic attachments (pledge contracts, leasing contracts, authorizations etc.)
       prepared in electronic form and digitally signed with valid digital signatures;
   15. Preparing and registration of pledge contracts by the notaries in electronic form;
   16. Recording of the start of enforcement of orders, electronically and directly by the enforcement
       agents;
   17. Filing of leasing contracts in electronic form directly by the leasing companies;
   18. Electronic payment of the registration tariffs;
   19. Electronic service of resolutions and certificates to the applicants.

The effects of the functioning of the solutions developed under phase 2 of OSS are the following:
   1. Complete online registration, administration and closing of business without the need for physical
        presence in Macedonia;
   2. Submitting and receiving of business information translated into English language;
   3. Reduction of the administrative barriers and costs in the process of registration of companies,
        pledges and leasing;
   4. Faster procedure for establishing pledges and leasing as instruments for receiving loans;
   5. Saving time and money with replacement of the notary certification with personal digital
        signatures and certificates;
   6. Protection of the business community through prevention of entities that have been banned or
        disqualified to enter the legal transactions;
   7. Faster fund recovery as a result of more transparent and faster bankruptcy and liquidation
        procedures;
   8. Timely and correct information for the registered legal entities;
   9. Avoiding duplication of the storage and processing of data, i.e. only the needed data are received
        from the CRM;
   10. Laying the foundation for implementation of a standard for exchange of business information
        between the institutions using the XBRL business standardized software language, which is
        covered in a special strategy which is being prepared;
   11. Easier management of the court procedures involving legal entities through introduction of
        electronic bankruptcy, liquidation management and register of disqualified entities; Timely and

        Doing Business Report due to the introduction of integrated electronic register for liquidation and
        bankruptcy procedures management which will make them much faster and more transparent;
   13. Enabling a functional online business in the Republic of Macedonia;
   14. Centralized and accurate data for the needs of macroeconomic planning.

This has enabled the Republic of Macedonia to achieve the level of institutional development for
implementation of the business legislation required for accessing the EU in the area of companies,
accounting and audit. It also lead to expectations that, in Doing Business 2012 assessment, the country

                                                    37
will be the first in the world that has enabled electronic opening of companies and most importantly low
cost, fast and accurate collection and distribution of business data to the business.

The project also financed the National Study for Improvement of the credit register of the National Bank
of the Republic of Macedonia which has already been implemented by the NBRM according to the
recommendations of the study and the credit register functions as updated and promoted according to the
EU requirements on institutional level of development by NBRM vis-Ã -vis the implementation of the
legal framework for financial services and banking activity in the country.

Component 5: Project coordination unit

The BERIS Project has first stated a practice of realization of World Bank project by civil servants which
led to significant strengthening of the knowledge, experience and preparedness of the Ministry of
Economy in the procedures and rules for planning, negotiating, contracting and World Bank projects
according to the Bank rules. In that context, a special success is that the Ministry of Economy, through
the Sector for European Integration, which acted as Coordination Project Unit, independently and with
support from local consultants, has succeeded in overcoming all the mistakes, problems and flaws in
process, material, technical and financial aspects and enabled proper and consistent project
implementation. Therefore, the information structure on the financial aspects of the Project shows
exceptionally positive information:

                                                                               Percent of

    final disbursement record (as of 30.04.2011) should be strongly considered as adequately adjusted
    in ICR ratings in terms of level of satisfactory of the Project. It should be highlighted that over
    95% of the restructured loan is disbursed. The ending of the grace period should be thus
    incorporated in the final ICR but also should further improve the Project performance where
    applicable.
ï‚·   The successful Project performance breakthrough resulting from poor 1.07 mil euro from 2006-
    2009 to almost 6.6 mil as of 30.04.2011 was a direct result of precise synchronization of
    Governmentâ€™s business environment goals, priorities and actual policies as planned in its Annual
    Working program and their adjustment to BERIS Projectâ€™s objectives in terms of enabling full
    and on time support to almost all business environment initiatives, projects and measures foreseen
    to support the business environment. Thus the number one lesson learned from the side of the
    borrower is most definitely the objective to completely sync the National Agenda of measures
    policies and actions to support specific area (business environment) with Projectâ€™s services
    (procurement of goods and Selection of Consultants). This should be also a starting point in every
    negotiation of a similar project in the future as something that will prevent the inconsistencies,
    delays or unattractiveness to use the Project for Governmentâ€™s objectives.
ï‚·   The greatest achievement arising from the technical implementation of the project is that all
    beneficiaries had complete freedom of evaluation and choice when it comes to selecting the most
    advanced consultants and procure most advanced equipment under the principles and within the
    framework of the World Bank Procurement of Goods and Selection of Consultants Guidelines.
    This resulted in a very favorable cooperation during the contract implementation period thus it is
    expected that all beneficiaries were completely satisfied of the contract performance. Apart from
    certain worries in delaying the payments per contracts through complex Payment operation
    system there were no reporting of non-cooperation, non-collaboration or in any aspect missing
    link of mutual understanding and professional approach towards successful contract
    implementation in any respect. Namely only one contract was not implemented and thus not
    disbursed in full, due to mutual agreement of both parties that further assistance in this respect
    (Regulatory impact assessment) is not needed due to advanced stage of National Regulatory
    reform implementation.
ï‚·   The project delivered primary metrology and IT Equipment that completely increase the capacity
    of Bureau of metrology and Central register for institutional implementation of their scope of
    work. This can be granted as direct impact of the project to Countryâ€™s most wanted goal for its
    EU integration process: Institutional capacity building for the implementation of the national
    legislation as aligned to EU acquis. Without these investments neither EU Progress Report in
    2009 and 2010 would have lacked to add positive conclusions of the capacity building in free
    movement of goods nor in business environment domain but basically the country would have no
    investments in new equipment in metrology and on company registry for the period 2006-2010 at
    all. As BERIS was certain follow up of EU projects that delivered sort of equipment before 2006,
    in particular SMAQVA I and II projects for Metrology, procurement of metrology equipment
    under BERIS was also a condition for granting technical assistance through EU IPA 2009 Free
    movement of goods Project that is in implementation at the moment. In particular the Project
    financed high quality training programs for certain employees in institutions that consist the
    System of Quality and Protection of Competition in Macedonia that could absolutely be achieved
    in the situation of a limited national budget.

ï‚·   The change in the Bankâ€™s BERIS Team in 2009 resulted in similar restructuring on the side of
    PIU, where Ministry of economy contracted local consultants for procurement and financial
    management while keeping their Project Director within current Head of EU department.
ï‚·   The failure of the project to provide significant results in 2005-2009 was direct results of weak
    staff subject to permanent changes, weak and insufficient awareness and considerable experience
    and knowledge of the public administration on how to perform project management in a role of
    Project Implementation unit, as well as constant changes of the Government as well (the project
    was negotiated and implemented during mandates of 4 ministers of economy. It was learned that
    more structured and organized PIU should be created internally in the Ministry in order to create
    a more visible unit in particular when there is a clear transformation from a PIU consisted of civil
    servants employed in Ministry of economy with scope of work not related to project management
    to PIU with professional procurement and financial management staff. Nevertheless thanks to the
    BERIS project the Ministry of economy is most definitely the most experienced and advanced in
    future management of potential projects related to its scope of work as similar one is already
    managed in Energy department.
ï‚·   The most of the remarks are in relation to financial management. It is to be noted that the market
    of local consultants capable and experience to perform financial management on World Bank
    project is very limited thus during the Project life there was continuous effort of MoE to assign
    high quality FM. Considering the audit report outcomes and taking into the consideration that
    project experienced 4 FM (two civil servants in the beginning and two local consultants) during
    its life while having predominantly two Procurement officials one of whom was later appointed
    as Project Director. The failure to establish a capacity built PIU should be considered as pre-
    condition for a project. This should be a condition that should prevent the beginning of the project
    until the PIU staff is elected and the quality of such is recognized.
ï‚·   Ministry of economy wants to emphasize the fact that during 5 years of project life, no issue of
    non-transparency, corruption or other malpractice was reported, or any complaints in this respect
    were received. In short the Project faced with only one issue of complaint on evaluation by
    second ranked consultant and this was treated in accordance to the Bank recommendation thus
    avoiding any further issues.
ï‚·   The Project BERIS most the only project on improving the business environment that 100%
    supported all ongoing Government actions and is the most quickest adaptable project to service
    the sudden/ specific needs. In this regard without the support of this project, many strategic
    documents would not have been created and their need was considered as of outmost importance
    (revising the Draft of Tourism Development strategy, Preparing the National Craft development
    strategy, National Study on Free economic Zones, National strategy for Extensible business
    reporting language implementation, Export Promotion Strategy, Innovation scoreboard, Preparing
    the Law on European company and amending current company law twice to include the
    approximation provisions to newest EU Directives related to business (shareholderâ€™s rights and
    cross-border mergers directives). Many of these strategic documents are now in process of
    follow-up implementation projects. Namely EU IPA Provided over 2 mill Euro to support the
    implementation of National Industrial policy strategy (BERIS financed the strategy with
    approximately 170.000 euro) , 1 mill euro to support the further assistance in strengthening the
    Bankruptcy policy (BERIS provided within the umbrella of 2 mil euro for One stop shop, a
    component for enabling e-system for bankruptcy tracking and recording, a so-called â€•E-

                                                40
    bankruptcyâ€–). Also the Export promotion strategy is expected to be implemented by support of
    USAID in 2011/2012. In this regard the Government thanks to XBRL Strategy that is in final
    process of adoption, satisfied with the quality and goals determine to provide additional 2 mill
    Euro to support one of the three projects planned to implement the XBRL in Macedonia. Thus it
    is visible that the investment in TA for different domains resulted in attracting additional
    multimillion project support follow up thanks to the high quality and importance of the Strategic
    documents prepared.
    Another successful story was that some of the projects that were initially considered with bigger
    budgets were actually implemented faster and with lower budget. Innovation scoreboard was
    prepared in 5 months with budget not exceeding 150,000 Euro while the initial estimation under
    previous EU Project drafting terms of reference was above 350,000 Euro in 2 yearsâ€™ time. The
    efficiency in the implementation and cost saving aspect was another positive impact.
    Further to the above, there were other positive values arising from the Project performance.
    Macedonian company law reached the level of a EU member state thanks to the Projectâ€™s support
    in finishing the last â€•cross-borderâ€– package of EU that is recognized in the last two annual reports
    on Countryâ€™s Progress in the chapter of Company law. This recognition was due to enabling
    quality and on time assistance through the Project. This was also measured and subsequently the
    country improves its ranking in Doing Business under Protecting Investors (#20 in the World
    among top 10# in Europe).
ï‚·   The Project implementation unit lacked the necessary financial management software, as this tool
    is widely used and would effectively contribute to a more sound financial management.
ï‚·   While the subjective factors reflecting the slow procurement and contracting record from 2005-
    2008, it is to be noted that this was changed during 2006-2010. Namely One of the poorest
    procurements that should be envisaged as a baseline was the first selection of International
    procurement Expert that lasted almost 9 months and it was a Individual Consultant selection
    needed to strengthen the capacity of the PIU. Nevertheless during 2009-2010 PIU was already in
    process of complex ICT procurements that resulted in fair time duration and contracting which
    proves that the capacity was significantly improved leading to multi-procurements at the same
    period (Disaster recovery system, One stop Shop II, 12 lots on ICB for metrology). However it is
    very important to note that certain procurements required also a certain time to be adequately
    prepared. Namely it took one year to prepare and launch complex procurement and selection in
    metrology as is considered as very specific area, as well as ICT Consultant services of a very
    specific domain. Proper preparation of tender documentation took time but resulted in efficient
    procurement process.
ï‚·   The PIU had the extremely well procurement team on the side of the bank delivering the opinions
    and guides on all procurement aspects that at this point is considered as essential both from the
    perspective of proper procurement management but also from the aspect of capacity building. In
    this respect, the well-established cooperation among procurement officials in PIU and Bank
    procurement team that basically was not changed during the Project life remains the essential
    precondition for having such well disbursement record at the end. Procurement supervisions and
    inspections were very much contributing to the overall transparent and proper managed
    procurement.
