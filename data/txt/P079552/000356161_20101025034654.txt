BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REFORM & INSTITUTION STRENGTHENING 
PROJECT 
RESTRUCTURING PAPER 
SUMMARY 
 
The proposed Level 2 restructuring is pursuant to requests from the Borrower in letters 
dated June 10, 2010 and June 29, 2010 requesting the following changes: (a) partial 
cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the total amount of 2.4 million EUR, which has 
already been acknowledged by the Bank effective June 10, 2010, (b) improvement and 
refinement of the Results Framework, namely the PDO indicators and intermediate result 
indicators, and, (c) revision of the name and broadening of the scope of Component 3 
(currently Competition Policy) of the Project to cover a broader set of activities related to 
the industrial policy strategy and competitiveness strategies.  The partial cancellation also 
necessitates a reallocation. 
 
The proposed changes do not affect the Development Objectives, the implementation 
arrangements, or the appraisal summary of the Project.  
 
PROJECT STATUS 
 
The Project has been making substantial progress toward achieving the development 
objectives. The Company Law was revised and investor protection strengthened 
according to European Union (EU) requirements. Business registration has been 
simplified and shortened to one day. Over 100 laws and by-laws have been developed 
and adopted using the Regulatory Impact Assessment and 56 laws and 481 by-laws were 
streamlined by the Regulatory Guillotine. The Strategy for Industrial Policy 2009-2010 in 
line with the EU 
acquis communautaire 
(Chapter 20) was adopted by the Government. 
The Disaster Recovery System (1.2 million EUR) was implemented providing back-up of 
all business registration data of the Central Registry. A link between the Central Registry, 
Employment Agency and Health Insurance Fund has been operational. The One-Stop-
Shop Phase 2 (1.9 million EUR) is under implementation and will establish electronic 
registration of businesses, the first employees as well as leasing, pledge and bankruptcy 
registries. The new equipment for the Bureau of Metrology (800,000 EUR) is under 
implementation.  
 
Successful implementation of the large procurement packages is important for the 
country’s EU accession agenda in coordination with the financial Instrument of Pre-
Accession of the European Commission. Additional procurement activities totaling 
230,000 EUR for consulting activities to support priority areas for economic growth and 
competitiveness have been in advanced stages of completion. The Project 
Page  7
7
Implementation Unit (PIU) of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) has increased its 
operational capacity by hiring new, experienced staff, namely a Program Manager and a 
Financial Manager which will additionally enhance the fiduciary management, 
implementation and disbursement. 
The Project was restructured in February 2010 and in June 2010, respectively, (a) through 
a
9-month extension, to
 
allow for sufficient time to implement the complex activities 
(One-Stop-Shop Phase 2, equipment for the Bureau of Metrology and the Disaster 
Recovery System), which are important for the country's path to the European Union, and 
(b) through a
 
partial cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the amount of 2.4 million 
Euro, which cannot be utilized until the new closing date of the Project due to 
involvement from other donors and new financing priorities of the Borrower and Bank in 
the country. 
 
Total disbursement to date is 1,844,000 EUR or 28% of the total current loan amount
1
,
which represents an increase of 11% on the current loan amounts since March 2010. 
Total commitments in signed contracts (The One Stop Shop Phase 2, Disaster Recovery 
System, equipment for the Bureau of Metrology, Innovation Scoreboard and Crafts 
Strategy) in 2010 is around 4,250,000 EUR. With their implementation by December 
2010, the disbursement will increase to 87%. In addition, approximately 300,000 EUR or 
4.6% of the total loan amount are allocated to ongoing and planned procurement 
activities (technical assistance for the implementation of the Industrial Policy Strategy, 
revision of the Tourism Development Strategy and IT equipment for the Ministry of 
Economy and the Institute for Accreditation), which are expected to be completed soon.  
 
PROPOSED CHANGES  
 
·
Results/indicators (Annex 1): 
 
The Project Development Objective: 
Strengthening of the capacity of the 
Government to improve selected areas of the business environment in an-EU 
oriented context 
remains the same.
 
We propose to introduce PDO level result indicators and refine the intermediary 
result indicators to better reflect and measure the results of the originally 
envisioned Project Development Objectives in a new EU-oriented context. The 
original outcome (PDO) indicator (
Demonstrated capacity to coordinate and 
implement regulatory reforms, and deliver selected public services in compliance 
with EU requirements) 
is vague in scope and not defined with specific measurable 
indicators.  We propose to add the following PDO level results indicators: (a) 
Number of EU Directives dealing with business regulation and operation 
transposed in the national legislation; (b) Ranking on the ease of doing business in 
1
Following the cancellation of 2.4 million EUR, effective June 10, 2010, the current total amount of the Loan is 6.4 
million EUR. Prior to the approval and acknowledgment of the partial cancellation, it was agreed with Operations 
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) that the partial cancellation would be the first phase of a two phase restructuring 
(the second phase is the revision of Component C and the results framework) and be formally documented in this 
restructuring paper.  
 
Page  8

the Doing Business Report; and (c) Overall assessment of the business 
environment areas supported by the Project in the annual EU Progress Report. 
 
A
revision of the intermediary result in Component 3 (currently 
Competition 
Policy Regime
)
is proposed in order to correspond to the proposed revision of the 
name and scope of Component 3 (into 
Industrial and Enterprise Policy and 
Competitiveness Support
).  
 
While most of the original intermediary result indicators have been only refined 
by reference to EU requirements or best practices, a few new intermediary 
indicators and corresponding targets are proposed in Component 2 (indicators 1 
and 2) and in Component 4 (indicator 2):   
 
Component 2: MSTQ System
Intermediate Result indicator One: 
Cumulative number of trained technical staff 
at the MSTQ institutions. 
Intermediate Result indicator Two
:
Cumulative number of types of measurements 
(field+ranges) in which the Bureau of Metrology is able to provide calibration 
services.  
 
Component 4:  Access to Information
Intermediate Result Indicator Two: 
Cumulative number of business registrations. 
 
The revised framework is attached as Annex 1 to this Restructuring Paper. A revised 
supplemental letter relating to the indicators will be obtained from the Borrower.  
 
·
Components 
We propose to amend Component C (
Competition Policy Regime
)
through:  
(a) reduction of subcomponent (i),  
(b) renaming of the Component C as 
Industrial and
 
Enterprise Policy and 
Competitiveness Support 
and to modify, accordingly, its scope to 
correspond to the new priorities of the Government in its path to the 
European Union.   
 
Specifically, the proposed changes are due to the following reasons:  (a) in the last 
two years the original beneficiary in subcomponent (i), the Commission for 
Protection of Competition, has been receiving technical assistance from other 
donors to support activities and capacity building originally envisioned to be 
supported by BERIS; (b) the newly adopted Industrial Policy Strategy 2009-2020, 
which was developed under the Project and is important for EU accession under 
Chapter 20 (Enterprise and Industrial Policy) of the 
acquis
 needs further support 
until an EU-financed project starts in late 2011 or early 2012.  The Industrial 
Policy includes five areas of intervention: (i) Foreign direct investment; (ii) 
Applied research, development and innovation; (iii) Small and medium enterprise 
(SME) development; (iv) Ecological products and sustainable development; and 
(v) Support to business clusters and networks.  
Page  9

The new Government priorities for support of the business environment and 
competitiveness also include revision of the Strategy for Development of 
Tourism, development of the Crafts Strategy and assistance with the development 
of the special economic zones and export promotion. In the last year, the Ministry 
of Economy and the Sector for Economic and Regulatory Reforms (Office of the 
Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs) requested technical assistance and 
just-in-time advice from the Bank through BERIS in these areas. 
 
The modification of the scope of Component 3 will not affect the purpose of the 
Project and, specifically, the Component to help build the institutional framework 
and capacity to systematically improve the quality of business regulations. The 
new focus of the Component will remain in an area where substantial 
acquis 
communautaire
 exist (Chapter 20 - Enterprise and Industrial Policy) in which 
BERIS will help increase FYR Macedonia’s compliance with the acquis and also 
bring it closer to EU best practices (e.g. foreign investment and export promotion, 
tourism development). 
 
While the Project provided equipment and technical assistance to the Commission 
for Protection of the Competition in the past to strengthen its capacity, the main 
proposed beneficiaries of Component 3 are the Ministry of Economy (Industrial 
Policy Unit, SME Development Department, Department for Tourism and 
Department for European Integration/BERIS Project Implementation Unit), and 
the Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform.  The Industrial Policy 
Unit at the Ministry of Economy has a successful track record with BERIS with 
the design of the Industrial Policy and also has a role of coordination with the 
State Aid Unit at the Commission for Protection of Competition to ensure that the 
industrial policy does not violate state-aid rules and does not adversely affect the 
market competition, and/or increase the regulatory burden considering the 
existing links between industrial policy and competition policy. 
 
The description of Component C, in the Legal Agreement (Schedule 2, 
Description of the Project), would be amended as follows:   
 
Part C:  Industrial Policy and Enterprise Competitiveness Support: 
The provision for institutional development and capacity building of the 
Borrower’s capacity to implement a European Union-compliant industrial policy, 
enterprise competitiveness support and competition regime through (i) 
strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Industrial Policy Unit to design 
and implement industrial policy measures in line with European Union 
requirements; (ii) strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of 
Economy and the Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform
2
to design 
and implement sector competitiveness policies in line with European Union 
requirements and best practices; (iii) increasing public awareness of industrial and 
competition policy issues; and (iv) providing training and seminars for relevant 
2
The Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform is the successor department to the Sector for 
Economic Reform

stakeholders in industrial, competitiveness and competition policies, through the 
provision of technical assistance, training, equipment, goods and study tours.

Financing 
 
Project Costs:  Upon the request from the Borrower dated June 10, 2010, a partial 
cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the amount of 2.4 million EUR (27% of 
the original Loan amount of 8.8 million EUR) was acknowledged by the Bank 
effective June 10, 2010. The partial cancellation was based on a thorough 
assessment and finding from the Borrower that the funds cannot be utilized by the 
closing date of the Project due to involvement from other donors, limited capacity 
of the Ministry of Economy/Project Implementation Unit and new financing 
priorities (infrastructure, energy) of the Government and Bank in the country (see 
below for more details).

Original “Total Project Costs” as in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The financing plan for original costs 
included a large Borrower financing of Euro 2.56 million that is no longer part of the project financing and not 
reflected in the revised project costs. The Borrower co-financing amounts to Euro 127,691 that represents co-financing 
of the project costs up to December 2009 when the Bank financing % was changed from 90% to 100%.

o
Cancellations 
In June 2010, the Borrower’s request for cancellation of funds in the 
amount of 2.4 million EUR of the Loan was based on a prior assessment 
of the Borrower and their discussions with the Bank about the needs and 
priorities for financing.  It was determined that the amount of 2.4 million 
could not be utilized until the new closing date of the Project, due to (a) 
gap between the originally projected and realistic financing needs under 
the Project due to which the equipment for the Bureau of Metrology was 
reduced from originally planned 1.9 million EUR to 800,000 EUR, and the 
project costs in Component 1 (Business Regulation) were decreased from 
1.5 million EUR to 650,000 EUR, (b) limited capacity of the Project 
Implementation Unit (streamlined into the Ministry of Economy as per the 
more recent Bank model/standard of streamlined PIUs) to handle multiple 
parallel procurement activities including some complex large IT ones at 
the same time, and (c) availability of other financing sources including 
international donors (USAID, the UK), to support some capacity building 
activities originally envisaged under the Project (e.g. in the areas of, 
market inspections, regulatory impact assessment, competition policy).
