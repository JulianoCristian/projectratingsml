                         proceeds in the amount of 2.4 million EUR, (iii) broadening of Component C (originally Competition Policy) and (iv) refinement of the results framework. The Ministry of Economy
                         increased the capacity of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) by hiring two additional people - Project Coordinator and Financial Manager. As a result of the project restructuring

                         and increased PIU capacity, the pace of implementation increased significantly so that the project has been making substantial progress toward achieving the development
                         objectives. The three largest procurement packages important for EU accession are well underway. The current disbursement rate is 64%, compared to 12% in March 2010. Progress
                         with procurement activities is as follows: The Disaster Recovery System (1.2 mn EUR) which provides back-up to the business data at the Central Registry has been fully
                         implemented, whereas the One Stop Shop Phase Two (1.9 mn EUR) and the Bureau of Metrology equipment (800,000 EUR) are in advanced stage of completion. The One-Stop-
                         Shop Phase Two is establishing electronic registration of companies and employees (through an interface with the Employment Agency, Health and Pension Insurance Funds) as
                         well as leasing, pledge and bankruptcy registries. The Company Law was revised and investor protection strengthened according to EU requirements. Over 100 laws and by-laws
                         have been developed and adopted using the Regulatory Impact Assessment. In the Doing Business Report 2011, FYR Macedonia ranks 38th on the overall ease of doing business
                         globally retaining the high position of last year (36th), with progress in starting a business (ranking 5th) and paying taxes (ranking 33rd). The progress of the country in business
                         environment reforms was assessed positively in the 2009 and 2010 Progress Reports of the EU, noting good progress in the areas addressed by the Project.
