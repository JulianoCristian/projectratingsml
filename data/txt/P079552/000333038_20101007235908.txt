                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
The proposed Level 2 restructuring is pursuant to requests from the Borrower in letters
dated June 10 and June 29, 2010 requesting the following changes: (a) partial
cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the total amount of 2.4 million EUR which has
already been acknowledged by the Bank effective June 10, 2010, (b) improvement and
refinement of the Results Framework, namely the PDO indicators and intermediate result
indicators, and, (c) revision of the name and broadening of the scope of Component 3
(currently Competition Policy) of the Project to cover a broader set of activities related to
the industrial policy strategy and competitiveness strategies. The partial cancellation also
necessitates a reallocation.

The proposed changes do not affect the Development Objectives, the implementation
arrangements, or the appraisal summary of the project.


PROJECT STATUS
The project has been making substantial progress toward achieving the development
objectives. The Company Law was revised and investor protection strengthened
according to European Union (EU) requirements. Business registration has been
simplified and shortened to one day. Over 100 laws and by-laws have been developed
and adopted using the Regulatory Impact Assessment and 56 laws and 481 by-laws were
streamlined by the Regulatory Guillotine. The Strategy for Industrial Policy 2009-2010 in
line with the EU acquis communautaire (Chapter 20) was adopted by the Government.
The Disaster Recovery System (1.2 million EUR) was implemented providing back-up of
all business registration data of the Central Registry. A link between the Central Registry,
Employment Agency and Health Insurance Fund has been operational. The One-Stop-
Shop Phase 2 (1.9 million EUR) is under implementation and will establish electronic
registration of businesses, the first employees as well as leasing, pledge and bankruptcy
registries. The new equipment for the Bureau of Metrology (800,000 EUR) is under
implementation.

Successful implementation of the large procurement packages is important for the
country's EU accession agenda in coordination with the financial Instrument of Pre-
Accession of the European Commission. Additional procurement activities totaling
230,000 EUR for consulting activities to support priority areas for economic growth and
competitiveness have been in advanced stages of completion. The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) of the Ministry of Economy (MOE) has increased its
operational capacity by hiring new, experienced staff, namely a Program Manager and a
                                              3
Financial Manager which will additionally enhance the fiduciary management,
implementation and disbursement.


The project was restructured in February 2010 and in June 2010, respectively, (a) through
a 9-month extension, to allow for sufficient time to implement the complex activities
(One-Stop-Shop Phase 2, equipment for the Bureau of Metrology and the Disaster
Recovery System) which are important for the country's path to the European Union, and
(b) through a partial cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the amount of 2.4 million
Euro which cannot be utilized until the new closing date of the Project due to
involvement from other donors and new financing priorities of the Borrower and Bank in
the country.

Total disbursement to date is 1,844,000 EUR or 28% of the total current loan amount1,
which represents an increase of 11% on the current loan amounts since March 2010.
Total commitments in signed contracts (The One Stop Shop Phase 2, Disaster Recovery
System, equipment for the Bureau of Metrology, Innovation Scoreboard and Crafts
Strategy) in 2010 is around 4,250,000 EUR. With their implementation by December
2010, the disbursement will increase to 87%. In addition, approximately 300,000 EUR or
4.6% of the total loan amount are allocated to ongoing and planned procurement
activities (technical assistance for the implementation of the Industrial Policy Strategy,
revision of the Tourism Development Strategy and IT equipment for the Ministry of
Economy and the Institute for Accreditation) which are expected to be completed soon.


PROPOSED CHANGES

     ·    Results/indicators (Annex 1):

          The Project Development Objective: Strengthening of the capacity of the
          Government to improve selected areas of the business environment in an-EU
          oriented context remains the same.

          We propose to introduce PDO level result indicators and refine the intermediary
          result indicators to better reflect and measure the results of the originally
          envisioned Project Development Objectives in a new EU-oriented context. The
          original outcome (PDO) indicator (Demonstrated capacity to coordinate and
          implement regulatory reforms, and deliver selected public services in compliance
          with EU requirements) is vague in scope and not defined with specific measurable
          indicators. We propose to add the following PDO level results indicators: (a)
          Number of EU Directives dealing with business regulation and operation
          transposed in the national legislation; (b) Ranking on the ease of doing business in
1
  Following the cancellation of 2.4 million EUR, effective June 10, 2010, the current total amount of the Loan is 6.4
million EUR. Prior to the approval and acknowledgment of the partial cancellation, it was agreed with Operations
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) that the partial cancellation would be the first phase of a two phase restructuring
(the second phase is the revision of Component C and the results framework) and be formally documented in this
restructuring paper.


                                                           4
       the Doing Business Report; and (c) Overall assessment of the business
       environment areas supported by the Project in the annual EU Progress Report.

       A revision of the intermediary result in Component 3 (currently Competition
       Policy Regime) is proposed in order to correspond to the proposed revision of the
       name and scope of Component 3 (into Industrial and Enterprise Policy and
       Competitiveness Support).

       While most of the original intermediary result indicators have been only refined
       by reference to EU requirements or best practices, a few new intermediary
       indicators and corresponding targets are proposed in Component 2 (indicators 1
       and 2) and in Component 4 (indicator 2):

       Component 2: MSTQ System

       Intermediate Result indicator One: Cumulative number of trained technical staff
       at the MSTQ institutions.
       Intermediate Result indicator Two: Cumulative number of types of measurements
       (field+ranges) in which the Bureau of Metrology is able to provide calibration
       services.

       Component 4: Access to Information

       Intermediate Result Indicator Two: Cumulative number of business registrations.

The revised framework is attached as Annex 1 to this Restructuring Paper. A revised
supplemental letter relating to the indicators will be obtained from the Borrower.

   ·   Components
         We propose to amend Component C (Competition Policy Regime) through:
         (a) reduction of subcomponent (i),
         (b) renaming of the Component C as Industrial and Enterprise Policy and
             Competitiveness Support and to modify, accordingly, its scope to
             correspond to the new priorities of the Government in its path to the
             European Union.

       Specifically, the proposed changes are due to the following reasons: (a) in the last
       two years the original beneficiary in subcomponent (i), the Commission for
       Protection of Competition, has been receiving technical assistance from other
       donors to support activities and capacity building originally envisioned to be
       supported by BERIS; (b) the newly adopted Industrial Policy Strategy 2009-2020
       which was developed under the project and is important for EU accession under
       Chapter 20 (Enterprise and Industrial Policy) of the acquis needs further support
       until an EU-financed project starts in late 2011 or early 2012. The Industrial
       Policy includes five areas of intervention: (i) Foreign direct investment; (ii)
       Applied research, development and innovation; (iii) Small and medium enterprise
       (SME) development; (iv) Ecological products and sustainable development; and
       (v) Support to business clusters and networks.
                                            5
        The new Government priorities for support of the business environment and
        competitiveness also include revision of the Strategy for Development of
        Tourism, development of the Crafts Strategy and assistance with the development
        of the special economic zones and export promotion. In the last year, the Ministry
        of Economy and the Sector for Economic and Regulatory Reforms (Office of the
        Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs) requested technical assistance and
        just-in-time advice from the Bank through BERIS in these areas.

        The modification of the scope of Component 3 will not affect the purpose of the
        project and, specifically, the Component to help build the institutional framework
        and capacity to systematically improve the quality of business regulations. The
        new focus of the Component will remain in an area where substantial acquis
        communautaire exist (Chapter 20 - Enterprise and Industrial Policy) in which
        BERIS will help increase FYR Macedonia's compliance with the acquis and also
        bring it closer to EU best practices (e.g. foreign investment and export promotion,
        tourism development).

        While the Project provided equipment and technical assistance to the Commission
        for Protection of the Competition in the past to strengthen its capacity, the main
        proposed beneficiaries of Component 3 are the Ministry of Economy (Industrial
        Policy Unit, SME Development Department, Department for Tourism and
        Department for European Integration/BERIS Project Implementation Unit), and
        the Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform. The Industrial Policy
        Unit at the Ministry of Economy has a successful track record with BERIS with
        the design of the Industrial Policy and also has a role of coordination with the
        State Aid Unit at the Commission for Protection of Competition to ensure that the
        industrial policy does not violate state-aid rules and does not adversely affect the
        market competition, and/or increase the regulatory burden considering the
        existing links between industrial policy and competition policy.

        The description of Component C, in the Legal Agreement (Schedule 2,
        Description of the Project), would be amended as follows:

        Part C: Industrial Policy and Enterprise Competitiveness Support:
        The provision for institutional development and capacity building of the
        Borrower's capacity to implement a European Union-compliant industrial policy,
        enterprise competitiveness support and competition regime through (i)
        strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Industrial Policy Unit to design
        and implement industrial policy measures in line with European Union
        requirements; (ii) strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
        Economy and the Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform2 to design
        and implement sector competitiveness policies in line with European Union
        requirements and best practices; (iii) increasing public awareness of industrial and
        competition policy issues; and (iv) providing training and seminars for relevant

 The Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory Reform is the successor department to the Sector for
Economic Reform
                                                   6
          stakeholders in industrial, competitiveness and competition policies, through the
          provision of technical assistance, training, equipment, goods and study tours.

      ·   Financing

          Project Costs: Upon the request from the Borrower dated June 10, 2010, a partial
          cancellation of proceeds of the Loan in the amount of 2.4 million EUR (27% of
          the original Loan amount of 8.8 million EUR) was acknowledged by the Bank
          effective June 10, 2010. The partial cancellation was based on a thorough
          assessment and finding from the Borrower that the funds cannot be utilized by the
          closing date of the project due to involvement from other donors, limited capacity
          of the Ministry of Economy/Project Implementation Unit and new financing
          priorities (infrastructure, energy) of the Government and Bank in the country (see
          below for more details).

              o    Consequently, the project costs per components/activities are amended as
                   follows:

   o Cancellations

       In June 2010, the Borrower's request for cancellation of funds in the
       amount of 2.4 million EUR of the Loan was based on a prior assessment
       of the Borrower and their discussions with the Bank about the needs and
       priorities for financing. It was determined that the amount of 2.4 million
       could not be utilized until the new closing date of the project, due to (a)
       gap between the originally projected and realistic financing needs under
       the project due to which the equipment for the bureau of metrology was
       reduced from originally planned 1.9 million EUR to 800,000 EUR, and the
       project costs in Component 1 (Business Regulation) were decreased from
       1.5 million EUR to 650,000 EUR, (b) limited capacity of the Project
       Implementation Unit (streamlined into the Ministry of Economy as per the
       more recent Bank model/standard of streamlined PIUs) to handle multiple
       parallel procurement activities including some complex large IT ones at
       the same time, and (c) availability of other financing sources including
       international donors (USAID, the UK), to support some capacity building
       activities originally envisaged under the Project (e.g. in the areas of,
       market inspections, regulatory impact assessment, competition policy).
