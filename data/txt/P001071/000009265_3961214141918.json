    Development Support Project for Guinea was satisfactory. The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            development has been partially achieved, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was deficient. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, adequate linkages,\n            exchanges, and contacts are very important to ensure that\n            studies and surveys lead to policy formulation. Second,\n            simply subcontracting studies to foreign consultants,\n            because of a lack of local capacity and in the interest of\n            having the studies done within a reasonable time, does not\n            build any capacity in government departments. Third, social\n            funds are more likely to achieve their objectives when they\n            have greater independence from the Government. Fourth,\n            community involvement and support in the design,\n            implementation, and management of sub-projects to be\n            financed by social funds are very important to ensure the\n            success of social funds. Fifth, in order for a social fund\n            to start operations and finance sub-projects quickly, a\n            number of conditions must be met, such as the various\n            instruments needed for operations must be available.\n            Finally, mixing credits and grants makes the management and\n            operation of social funds particularly difficult and risky."}, "docdt": "1996-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
