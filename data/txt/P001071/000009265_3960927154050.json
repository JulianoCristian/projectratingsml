         Project is designed to initiate a process that will enable\n            the government to develop a long term program for\n            alleviating poverty in Guinea as a complement to the growth\n            promoting objectives of the structural adjustment program.\n            Three components constitute the core of the program. First,\n            there is social policy planning. The project will support\n            the strengthening of the Human Resources and Social Policy\n            Division (DHRPS). The DHRPS will be responsible for carrying\n            out studies on important issues of social policy and\n            integrating the results of these studies, and the results of\n            the household survey, into the design of social policy and\n            of the adjustment program. The second component involves\n            monitoring living standards. The Direction Nationale de la\n            Statistique et de l'Information will be strengthened by\n            the creation of a new Survey and Price Indices Division\n            which will organize and implement a permanent household\n            survey to track the evolution of living standards through\n            the adjustment process. The third component is the creation\n            of a pilot program of sub-projects for socio-economic\n            development. This program will be managed by a new Pilot\n            Project Unit. The Unit will be responsible for appraising,\n            and monitoring poverty-alleviation sub-projects to be\n            financed under the program."}, "docdt": "1989-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
