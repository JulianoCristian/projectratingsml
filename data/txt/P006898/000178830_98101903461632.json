The generating plant will consist of two 15 MW sets,\n            with provisions for a plant expansion to a total of six 15\n            MW sets at a later date. A tailrace (760 meters in length\n            approximately) will carry the waters from the power plant to\n            the Reventazon river. The project includes an outdoor\n            step-up substation adjacent to the power plant, outdoor\n            step-down substations at Colima, Barranca, and La Garita,\n            with some 80 kilometers of 138 KV single circuit\n            transmission line. Additionally, diesel generating plants,\n            consisting of two 4 MW sets, will be installed at the Colima\n            station, another two 0.5 MW at Limon station, on the East Coast."}, "docdt": "1961-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
