Plant Flue Gas Desulfurization Project for China is to\n            reduce Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) emissions in the heat and power\n            sector and enhance the capacity of regulatory authorities to\n            monitor and enforce compliance with their SO2 emissions\n            reduction program. There are two components to the project.\n            The first component is the technical assistance component.\n            To strengthen the technical and institutional capacity\n            related to SO2 emission control and reduction in Shandong,\n            it includes: (i) capacity building and enhancement in\n            emission monitoring and regulation enforcement, including\n            upgrading of online monitoring equipment and information\n            systems; and (ii) technical and managerial training; and\n            (iii) development of related regulations, procedures, and\n            policies. Finally, the second component is the investment\n            component to finance the installation of Flue Gas\n            Desulfurization (FGD) facilities at four coals fired heat\n            and power plants. These plants include existing coal-fired\n            cogeneration units and cogeneration units that are under\n            construction or planned for construction. All plants have\n            selected to install limestone-gypsum wet FGD technology."}, "docdt": "2008-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
