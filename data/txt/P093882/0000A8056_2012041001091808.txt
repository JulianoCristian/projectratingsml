                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to reduce SO2 emission in the heat and power sector and enhance the capacity of regulatory authorities to monitor
                         and enforce compliance with their SO2 emission reduction program.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been slow to implement since its inception in 2008, with only one of the original 4 sub-projects going ahead. The remaining 3 have been dropped for World Bank
                         financing and the Shandong Finance Bureau has looked for suitable replacements. In March 2011 the PMO identified 4 potential new sub-projects which were pre-appraised by the
                         Bank team. In January 2012 the Shandong Finance Bureau cut this list to 3 projects only. These projects were part of the projects pre-appraised in 2011.
