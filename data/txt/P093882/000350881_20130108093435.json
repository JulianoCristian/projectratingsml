China Shandong Power Plant Flue Gas\n            Desulfurization Project was rated as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and both Bank and borrower performance were unsatisfactory.\n            The lessons learned during this project are - (1) A project\n            supporting mandatory targets should carefully time project\n            support with the targets' timeline. (2) Early\n            communication to the final borrowers of the Bank's\n            project cycle and timing of availability of funding is\n            needed, especially when working with corporations. (3)\n            Advance procurement of technical assistance, on a\n            retroactively financed basis, and greater attention to final\n            recipients of the technical assistance could mitigate risks\n            of poor loan-financed TA execution. (4) Strong project\n            management units are needed to support finance bureaus in\n            supervising multiple subprojects. (5) The Bank needs to be\n            more proactive and clearer on initiating project restructuring."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
