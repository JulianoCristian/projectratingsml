           UKRAINE – ROADS AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
                                P100580
                             LOAN 7677-UA

                                  Restructuring Paper



1.    The closing date for the Ukraine Roads and Safety Improvement Project, Loan
7677-UA, P100580 will be extended from 31-Dec-2012 until 31-Dec-2013.

2.      The project development objective continues to be to improve the condition and
quality of sections along M-03 highway, and increase road safety throughout Ukraine.
This objective is likely to be achieved if the project closing date is extended. Besides the
extension of the project closing date, there is no other change to the project.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary since some of the civil works contracts
cannot be completed before the original closing date. This is especially valid for the
additional contracts which were awarded after the first restructuring of the project.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project closing date. No further extensions
are expected.
