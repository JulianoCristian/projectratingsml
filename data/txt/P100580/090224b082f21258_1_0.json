Roads and Safety\n            Improvement Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            improving design of civil works: consultations during the\n            design phase and continuous engagement with local\n            communities during implementation improve compliance with\n            safeguard policies, as well as project design. The continued\n            engagement resulting from a sequenced approach (a number of\n            consecutive projects) to lending and complementary trust\n            funds can provide a platform to improve sector dialogue\n            where the World Bank is a new player in the sector. An\n            effective road safety strategy requires investments in\n            infrastructure as well as substantial measures to strengthen\n            institutions, including a complementary safety education\n            campaign and enforcement. Both approaches developed under\n            this project, although contributing to a reduction in\n            accidents, focused mainly on infrastructure improvements.\n            Issues with counterpart funding caused delays during project\n            implementation. In particular, the financial position of\n            local firms was compromised. Furthermore, the recent budget\n            constraints in Ukraine have adversely affected the ability\n            of the government to finance Value Added Tax, or VAT, land\n            acquisition, design work, and the operating expenses of\n            relevant entities associated with project implementation.\n            The World Bank should consider more systematically financing\n            100 percent of project costs to minimize the risks to\n            implementation caused by a delay of funds coming from the government."}, "docdt": "2015-05-28T04:40:05Z"}
