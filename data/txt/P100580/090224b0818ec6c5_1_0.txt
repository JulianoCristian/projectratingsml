                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is well on its way to achieving its main development objective of "improving the condition and quality of sections of the M-03 road". This objective is to be achieved
                         through physical road works - - and these works are progressing well. By mid-January 2013, about 78 percent of works have been executed and about 74 km of road sections fully
                         completed and open for traffic. Two of the four original large road rehabilitation contracts have been essentially completed and two are still ongoing. Concerning the second objective
                         of "increased traffic safety on roads", three contracts covering about 29 black spots have been signed. One of them has been completed and two are still under execution. Given the
                         low interest of contractors in participating in bidding for road safety works, the project was restructured in mid-2011, with a reallocation of about 50% of the funds of the Road Safety

                         contracts were subsequently awarded in early 2012 and are under execution. About 97.5 % of the loan resources are committed through signed contracts.
