                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is well on its way to achieving its main development objective of "improving the condition and quality of sections ofthe M-03 road". This objective is to be achieved
                         through physical road works - - and these works are progressing very well. By September 17, 2012, about 73 percent of works have been executed and about 68 km of road sections
                         fully completed and open for traffic. Two of the four original large road rehabilitation contracts have been completed and two are still ongoing. Concerning the second objective of
                         "increased traffic safety on roads", three contracts covering about 29 black spots have been signed and are under execution. Given the low interest of contractors in participating in
                         bidding for road safety works, the project was restructured in mid-2011, with a reallocation of about 50% of the funds of the Road Safety component to the Road Rehabilitation

                         component. The reallocation allowed to increase the length of M-03 road sections to be rehabilitated under the project. Three additional contracts were subsequently awarded in early
                         2012 and are under execution. About 97.5 % of the loan resources are committed through signed contracts.
