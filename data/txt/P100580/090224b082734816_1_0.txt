                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Few weeks prior to project closure on September 30, 2014, the likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objectives (PDO) is high. Conditions and quality of 120 km of the
                         M-03 have already been improved to 4 lanes-dual carriageway expressway standards. Moreover, the works on additional 38 km of the M-03, which had been delayed for months,
                         have resumed to an appropriate rhythm and, overall, 158 km of the M-03 are expected to be upgraded to 4 lanes-dual carriageway by Project closing date. Road safety has
                         substantially increased along this major road corridor as a result of the upgrading works. Moreover, road safety has been improved throughout Ukraine as a result of additional works
                         to eliminate critical road safety spots and improve one dangerous corridor. As a result, both PDO indicators' targets as defined under 2011 restructuring, are expected to be
                         exceeded: 158 km of M03 upgraded vs. a target of 140 km, and 4 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles annually vs a target of 8 or lower.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         By the end of 2013, all works and activities under the Project had been substantially concluded but one large 38 km road rehabilitation and upgrading works contract on the M-03.
                         The contractor had been subject to serious cash-flow constraints for months affecting the pace of execution of the works. As a result, a second extension of the closing date till
                         September 30, 2014, was granted in December 2013 to provide additional time for the government to finalize the remaining upgrading works of the M-03 highway.
