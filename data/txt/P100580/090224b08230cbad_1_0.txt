                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The likelihood to substantially achieve the Project Development Objective (PDO) is high. The M03 conditions have already been improved to 4 lanes-dual carriageway expressway
                         standards on close to 120 km. This is above Project initial physical target and represents 85% of the revised target upon Project restructuring in 2011. Moreover, improvement works
                         on an additional 38 km of the M03 has already been substantially advanced with structural works finalized allowing improvement of the riding conditions, missing only the road
                         surface layers as well as horizontal signaling and part of the road side equipments to finalize the road section. Similarly, the Project contributed to improved road safety in Ukraine as
                         it supported the elimination of 10 black spots identified by the international road assessment program (iRAP) as well as the improvement of a 25 km long road corridor with safety
                         issues. The total number of fatalities per 10,000 vehicles is now 5, substantially lower than initial target.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         While progress towards achieving the PDO is generally satisfactory, delays in the execution of one rehabilitation and upgrading contract of the M03 has not allowed to complete the
                         works by the planned closing date, December, 31, 2013. As a result, upon request from the Government, an extension of 9 months of the closing date to September 30, 2014, has
                         been granted, to allow for a completion of the works and achievement of the Project's objective.
