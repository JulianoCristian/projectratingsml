Implementation Status Overview
C    The project is well on its way to achieving its main development objective of "improving the condition and quality of sections of the M-03 road". This objective is to be achieved
through physical road works - - and these works are progressing very well. Concerning the second objective of "increased traffic safety on roads", there is only very limited interest of
contractors in executing the road safety works. The project was therefore restructured in mid-2011, with a reallocation of about 50% of the funds of the Road Safety component to the
Road Rehabilitation component. The reallocation allows to increase the length of M-03 road sections to be rehabilitated under the project.
