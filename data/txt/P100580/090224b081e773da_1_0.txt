                         Implementation Status Overview
                         While Project Progress towards achievement of DO is satisfactory, overall implementation remains moderately satisfactory given the disbursement rate and physical progress,
                         respectively of 75% and 85% at 6 months of the closing date. Slow progress in the executionof one work contract under component 1 is a matter of concern as it could end not being
                         concluded before Project closing date.
