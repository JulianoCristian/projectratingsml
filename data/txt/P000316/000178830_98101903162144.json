The project\n            would consist of the construction or expansion, and\n            equipment of three primary school teacher training colleges,\n            a secondary school teacher training college, fifteen general\n            secondary schools, four technical schools, and a\n            post-secondary agricultural college. The project would also\n            include technical assistance to provide experts to reinforce\n            the Ministry of Education's planning services and\n            specialist teachers in such subjects as engineering and farm\n            management. The project would be carried out by a Project\n            Unit within the Ministry of Education. The Chief of the Unit\n            and the Project Architect have already been appointed by the\n            Government and are acceptable to the Association.
