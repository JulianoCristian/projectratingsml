a.d private secors are still h-e,r'4   d A pendent onr hgh co-4- Pn4en,- s4k1ine

ref'orm of thle educa'-or. syster. -whichi at- pr-esentu is c oestly andnogedt

iii.    The proposed project would support planned reforms by providing urgent-
_Ly needuedu facilities lbaddbo meake the educatiorn systernl a m,or e e L'L'e c ' . -r
instrument of economic and social development policy and to reduce the per
graduate unit costs.
iv.     As modified. during appraisal, the proposed project consists of:
A. Construction or expansion and equipment of:
- four teacher training colleges,
-  fifteen general secondary schools,
- two technical schools and re-equipment of two others, and.
- a higher school of agriculture.
B.  - Related technical assistance for a total of 44 man-years)
including 20 man-years of fellowships, and
- establishment of a project unit to supervise project
implementation.
v.      E-r-ollment capacity of the proposed 24 project schools would be
7,140 including some 5,500 new places.   Qualified entrants for all the project
schools would be avrailable. The output would contribute substantially to
meeting the needs of industry, agriculture, and education for qualified
manpower and would gradually reduce dependence on foreign skilled labor., The
project would provide teachers trained to apply proposed curricula reforms in
which mathematics zmd science studies and workshop and agricultural training
activities are given prominence.
vi.     The project schools are appropriately located and selected sites are
satisfactory. Schedules of accommodations, equipment and furniture are
economical and appropriate. Estimated cost of construction is high but
realistic in view of current building costs in Cameroon. Contract awardls and
procurement would conform with IDA international competitive bidding
procedures.

1. INTRODUCTIO)N
1.01    In M'ay, 1968 a joint Bank/Uhesco/FAO education project reconnaissance
mission visited the Federcil Republic of Cameroon. In November, 1968 the
Government, assistecl by a Unesco project identification/preparation mission,
submitted a request for International I)evelopment Association financial
assistance for an education project estimated to cost $23.5 million.
1.02    The proposed project was appraised during February, 1969 by a mission
consisting of Messrs. C. L. Germanacos (education snecialist) and F. D. van
Loon (econaaist) of the Bunk, Mr. A. Voisin (FAO, agricultural education),, and
the consultcmts Messrs. J.. C_. JTmene  (technical ecii3t-oAn) andi L. Vera
(archi.tect).
1.03    As modified during appraisal the proposed project, at an estimated
totnl cost of UTS  il mnillion, rcrmnp"ise-s

sions to three others:;
(iv) six new second cycle general secondary schools,and extensions
to one other which is to have both an agricultiur-al technLicia
tra.ining wing and an amnex of the secondary teacher training
college;
(v)  one new vocational training school, extensions to one
technical lycee and re-equipment of two existing vocational
training schools;
(vi) extensions to the Federal Higher School of Agriculture (EFSA);
and.
B. Related services:
(vii) technical assistance of 44 man-years;
(viii) establishment of a project unit to supervise project
implementation.
1.04    The modifications, described later in the report, reduce capital and
recurrent costs of the project schools and increase qualified output without
detriment to the quality of education or the nature and scope of the original
request.
Social and Economic Background
1.05    The Federal:Republic of Cameroon. established in October 1961,
consists of territories formerly administered by France and the United



Kingdom. Niumerous ethnic groups are represented in the country, each with
se-veral lang-uages. Botsh rrench and Eglish are offLcia-L lnguages of the
Republic.
1.06    The population of Cameroon is estimated at 5.4 million, with a
density of ]1.o inh-bitanLs per m2 and a &vWVIL rate of 2.1%.  There are
fewer than 50 towns with over 5,000 inhabitants but urban population, 17.4%

still small, has grown very rapidly, mainly by import substitution and scTre

1.08    Development prospects for Cameroon seem good and the planned annual
increase of GDP by 5;.75% dluring the Second Economic and Social Dievelopmernt
Plan period (1966-1971) is likely to be surpassed, but public investments in
infrastructure, especialjly in transportation, will largely determine grolth
rates in the longer term as present facilities increasingly constrain
expansion in agricu:Lture and manufacturing.
2. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The Administration and Structure of Education
2.01    The Federal M4inister of Education, Youth and Culture is responsible
for secondary and higher education, public and private (Annex 1); each of the
two federated States retains control of primary education and primary teacher
training. The Federal lUiinistry of Education Planning Division prepares the
development program but is handicapped. by lack of specialized staff and of
coordination with t]he directorates of the Ministry and State Secretariats of
Education.
2.02    The education systems of the two States (Annex 2) at primary and
secondary levels differ in structure, content of education, and school
administration and organization practices.  The East Cameroon system has
six primary grades (Pl-P6), four grades of first cycle secondary education
(Sl-S4), and three of second cycle (S5-S7). Examinations determine promotion
at the end of each grade. French is the medium of instruction throughout.
Reform of the structure, content, and student flow has been proposed but
little acti.on has followed because of shortages of appropriate facilities and
oLalified teachers.
2.03    Wes.t Cameroon. winth Rnoglish as the medium of instrucetion, has a
seven year primary course (P1-P7) which leads to a five-year secondary



course (Sl-,S5); this course is terminal in itself but also prepares
cMdjndidates for the um-niersity nprenratorv grades (S6-S7).
The Education and Training Effort
2.04    Annexes 3-U1 give the basic da.ta concerning enrollments, distribution
and flow of students, o-uLtn1l_-ts and teachers. The salient facts are as follows:

2.uo    Since i95r enrollments in prinmLry education have increased threeo"d,
in secondary six tilmTes. Expansion has outpaced provision of facilities and
qualified teacher supply, and has not been matched by organizational, adsini-
trative and curricu].a reforms made necessary by the new political and economic
context and the move toward mass education.
2.07    In the Secon,d Plan, 1966-1971, emphasis has been directed to
quality improvement, the hiighest prior:ity being given to improved and expanded
training of qualified primary school teachers.  In West Cameroon, the output
of qualified teachers will increase significantly as from 1971.  In East
Cameroon, progress has been slower and facilities should be augmented.
2.08    Repeater, drop-out and examination failure rates in general and
technical secondary education are generally high and output low. The univer-
sity Las been unable to obtain the required intake, and the economy has not
had an adequate supply of well-educatedi or wvell-trained middle and high-level
workers. Expansion of secondary education should be combined with some
restructurinig, revision of selection, promotion and guidance practices and
further curricula refarms.  Further, Cameroon needs to expand its general
secondary teacher training program, particularly since the main source of
foreign supply - FA; - proposes to concentrate on providing teachers for
vocational education, teacher training, and higher education.
2.09    In Fast Cameroon. the output of the agricultural secondary level
schools (Amnex 9) is adequate for the public sector only. The training :is not
entirely reLevant to the needs of the economy, and teachers need re-training.
The Agriculbural Eduication Division of the Secretariat of Rural Development is
to be re-organized a-nd will undertake curriculinn studieis with bilateral
technical assistance. Soviet Government aid has been obtained for the e:pan-
sion and imorovement of two agricultlre sehools.  Tn West Came-roon. the present
output of agricultural technicians from the College of Arts, Science and
TPchnologY is insufficipnt.
2.10    The proposed project w^Tould support plans to make good the deficiencies
ouitlined above (see paras. 4.06-4.13 and 5.03-5.09).

is satisfactory-.

remained stable at about 10; of the total federal recurrent budget, but East
and West Cameroon recurrent education budgets increased in relation to the

respectively in 1967-68. T      recurrent expenditmt  r&t,  cre stis-

3.04    Of total federal education recurrent expenditures, 63% is channelled
through the Ministry of E:ducation, 329 through the Munistry of Finance
(salaxy contributions and housing for foreign aid teachers), and 5% through
other ministries.  In adcdLition to the State Government expenditures on
primary education, rural communities spent about CFAF 250 million on repair,
maintenance and staXf salaries.
3.05    Excluding foreign aid, recurrent expenditures on education by alL
ministries in 1967-68 were allocated as follows:
primary education   43.7%;    secondary education   35.6%
higher education    11.2%;    other charges          9.5%
These figures show the h'igh cost of secondary and higher education in the
present system; in higher education 31Lo of recurrent erpenditures is f or'
scholarships.
3.06    Subventions to private education, mainly for teachers' salaries.,
totalled more than CFAF 1 billion, and represented 37% of primary education
recurrent expenditure and 11% of seconldary and technical education recurrent
expenditure.



3.07    All public education is free.    Scholarships of CFAF 45,000 per year
are awarded to 26% of public secondary school students    and 11   ' of nrivate
secondary school pupils.   All students in higher education receive scholar-

students are treated as government employees and receive a substantial C:FAF

reviewed in. view of the financial burd.en that the plannea a:-pansion of ENS and
EFSi5 would impose.
3.08     aital BAdgets for education have fluctuated widely` i     relation
to the tota.l capital budget and now account for 4%. Over the last five years,
public capital expenditures on education totalled about CFAF 6.2 billion.
Foreign sources provided 85-90% of thi.s. Rural comrunities contributed about
CFAF 80 million per year. *The high proportion of foreign aid in the capital
expenditures is typical of African countries receiving French assistance.
3.09    Foreian Aid:   The greater part of foreign aid to education, whic:h
accounted for $12.6 million or 33% of total expenditure in 1967-68, is in the
form of grants. Aid to the recurrent budget is larger than capital aid and
more crucial; without the 750 French assistance educators, the secondary school's
and the University could not operate. Annual cost of a FAC teacher is about
$13,750 including a Cameroon contribution in salary and housing of about
$5,600. This contribution exceeds the salary of a qualified national teacher.
Total Federal outlay for technical assistance teachers is 32% of the Federal
education recurrent expenditures.
Projected Expenditures, 1975-1976
3.10    Projected recurrent expenditure levels have been estimated on the
basis of the projected enrollments, teacher targets, and distribution between
the public and private sector outlined in paragraphs 4.07-h.13 (see also
Annexes 4, 11, 17-20).   On these assumptions, the estimated recurrent public
exnenditures on edu.cation in 1975-76 Lre as follows (Annexes 12 and 13)

More particulars about the labor force in East and West Cameroon are given
In Annexes 14 and 15.
4.02    Projected economic growth will require a rapid expansion and improve-
ment of the education system. GDP is expected to grow at en average annual
rate of 6.1% from CFAF 226.4 billion in 1968-69 to CFAF 342.8 billion in
1975-76. Assuming that the modern sector as at present accounts for 80% of
GDP, has the same rate of growth, and. labor productivity increases by 3%
mnnually, then the labor force in the modern sector would grow from 160,000
to 197,000 in the same period. Of this number, 31% or 61,000 persons would
need educational qualifications of first cycle secondary standard or higher.
To attain this objective, an additional 10,200 persons with these qualifica-
tions should enter the labor force and about 9,800 more would be required for
normal replacement, due to death and retirement.
14.03   In addition, the government intends to implement a policy of gradual
replacement of ex=atriate personnel now in the labor force.  Full Cameroon-
ization duLring the period under review is not possible and the percentage
participation of expatriates for 197'5 has conseauentlv been reduced only
moderately. In absolute nwubers, expatriate staff in 1975 may be 10%

figure; it includes replacement needs but does not take into account a possible
up-grading of the modern sector labor force, the full needs of the education
sector, or the need for qualified personnel in the traditional sector.   Adding
the requirements of the full expansion of the education system not accounted
for in the table above, a further 1600 qualified teachers, the total minimum
number of additional workers required by 1975 with secondary or higher educa-
tion qualifications would be about 22,300.
Education Development Needs
4.06    To meet these training needs at reasonable cost, it is necessary to
adopt the planned strategy of the Second Plan, 1966-1971; that is, the
iLtegration of controlled expansion with measures to improve the efficiency
and productivity of the education sysltem. Application of the necessary
curricula reforms calls for an adequate and appropriately trained teaching
force and for functionally designed and well-equipped school buildings.
Combined with adminListrative measures to accelerate the flow of students
through the. system, such programs wou:Ld increase output in relation to intake,
thus reducing unit costs per graduate.
4.07    Primary education enrollment targets for 1975 would be 915,000, or
78% of the relevant, age-group.  Secondary education should be expanded as
follows to about 100,000 stuclents, or 10% of the relevant age-group:
General Sec:ondary:        83,800 of which 75,000 in first cycle,
8,800 in second cvele
Technical and Vocational: 12,000
Primarv Teacher Training: 3;000
Agricultural:              1,000
Higher education enrollments would be 3,000.

Superieure in the period 1968-1975. To meet this need, the ENS at Yaounde
shouLd be expanded to 500 students bDy I:973 and the ENS alnex in west Ca-,etU.r-oon
to 80. This would increase the proportion of qualified Cameroonian teachers
from 8.>% in 16oo8 to 70% in 1975, and reduce the number of expatriat e teachers
from 730 to 400.
4h10    The proposecd expansion of general secondary education entails
provision oif 25,000 additional places in the pu-blic education sector, 21,000
in the first; cycle EndL 4.,000 in the second.
4.1l    In East Cameroon total enrollment in technical and vocational schools
would not ilcrease by 1975, but raising the entry point into the existing
schools will free places for an increased intake so that output would be
nearly doubled. Furthermore, a re-organization of courses would make the
output more acceptable to industry. Two vocational schools have been selected
to pilot the reforms, and the Technica:L Lycee at Douala is to be expanded.
and up-graded to concentrate on training of technicians. FAC is making a.
grant of $660,000 for equipment for technical schools.
4.12    To meet projected needs in West Cameroon, additional vocational school
facilities would be required to increase the present enrollment of 147 to
about 500 in 1975.   The estimated annual dem.and for some 50 agricultural
extension aLnd cooperatives' workers necessitates the expansion of the
agricultural technicianst wing at CAST.
h.13    In view of the acute shortage of professional agriculturalists,
estimated at 120 by 1970, it is planned to expand the enrollnent of the
regional institutiorL, the Ecole Federale Superieure d'Agriculture, to provide
an output of 20 Cameroonians annually and 20 nationals of other sponsoring

5.  THE PRCJECT
General
5.01    The proposed project, to be implemented during 1969-1973, provides
for the construction, furnishing and equipping of 24 schools, related
technical assistance and establishment of a project unit to supervise
implementation (see para. 1.03). The estimated total cost is $14 million.
5.02    Construction needs and enrollments of the project schools, listed
with details in Annex 21, are as follows:

The Project Schools (see also Appendix A for further technical details)
5.03    The project schools would have a total enrolLment of 7140 of which

as the project includes replacement of some existing but obsolescent
accommoudation. To ensure that tne project schools function effectively and
conform to the national and regional education needs and policy, the Government
has given assurances that the enrollment structure and distribution of couises
in the project schools would be in line with the schedule in Annex 22. The
schedules of accommodation (Annex 23) and equipment nave been cdrawn up oIi this
basis and for the use of revised curricula.
5.04    The contribution of the project toward meeting education developmnent
needs related to economic development needs is considerable. Project items
Nos. 1-3 (Annex 21) prov:Lde the additional facilities requirod for rrimary
teacher training (para. 4.08), items Nos. 4 and 18 the facilities for secondary
teacher training (para. 4.09), and items Nos. 18 and 20-24 the facilities
for industrial and agricultural training (paras. 4.11-4.13).   Project items
Nos. 5-19, the general secondary schools, would meet only a small proportion
of the additional first cycle places required in the project constructionl
period, 1971-1973, but a substantial proportion of the second cycle places
needed (see paras. 4.10 and 5.07-5.08).
5.05    Intake for all project schools is assured (Annex 11 and para. 2.05),
because the Government has undertaken to award sufficient scholarships to
maintain enrollments at planned levels at the primary teacher training
colleges, the Ecole Normale Superieure and the Ecole Federale Superieure
d'Agriculture (project Items 1-4 and 24).
5.06    The project schools would thus provide a significant proportion of the
qualified output required from industrial, agricultural and teacher training
institutions (Annex 22):

5.07    The curricula proposed for the project schools are satisfactory.. The
major nnnovation has been made in the project first cyrcle ge.neral secanncIary
schools (project items Nos. 5-12) with the introduction of courses in agri-
culturve and workshop practice.  Tlh.ese courses would be +-, .m val but would

graduates of existing two.-cycle schools. The project second cycle general
secondary sc:hool  (i.tems N0os. i3-i9) woUid emphiasize mathematics and science
studies and eliminate classical streams.
5.08    During negotiations the Govermnent also gave assurances that by 1973
it would implement its proposals to reform exist,ing practices of selectLng,
promoting and channeling students through the system.
5.09    Qaalified teachers for the proposed project schools (Annex 2h) would
be available provided that the number of bilateral agency teachers is not;
reduced prematurely. The secondary teacher training program is planned t;o
supply the needs of the general secondary schools in the period 1972-1980 and
to reduce reliance on expatriate teachers. This would enable bilateral
technical assistance to be directed towards teacher training and technical
institutions until such timiie as Cameroonians are trained.  During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that:
(i)  in regqests for technical assistance teachers and training
fellowships or in contracting of staff, the Government would
give priority to teacher trainers and teachers of technical
and agricultural subjects;
(ii)  teacher-student ratios in. the project schools wTouldbe el,proxi-
mate to those showm in Annex 24, and qualified staff would
be appointed.
5.10    Furniture lists and costs are satisfactory.   Equinment lists in some
instances need further elaboration and would be submitted for approval by
mnA before -prnmirement! reasonAhth sirms for  nipm.ent have been incn-11dAd
in the project costs.   Both lists include provision for shortages and
repla-anp,mnt needs in existing project schools.
-11     The demographnc and transportation factors referred to earlIer
(para.. 1.06) necessitate provision of dormitory facilities.  Originally 4500
dormitory places were requeste.d hbut-. t!ir1 waS reduced duiring apprani.l to 266l0;
with the proviso that school facilities would be made available to all students
for str.ndv and qocial purposes in the afternoons and evenings.
5 .12   Th.e locatic-ns of the proposed general secondary schools support the
Government policy to establish a public school in every Department/Region.

Technical Assistance
5.l4    The project includes the cost of experts for 8 man-years, to be
at tJacithedU 'tio th re-or-ganized  Diy oUf YOL±duCcati-L Cld.LUa J ±,D. U±thenS
(para 2.01). The team would help prepare comprehensive education plans and
progrzaas, provide relat-ed on-thle-job tr`aining for Cameroonian personnel, and
assist1 with curricu:Lua development and project implementation.  The group
would comprise an educationaL planner, an economist and a school Duild-ng-S
specialist, each for two years, and a technical and an agricultural education
speciaiist, each for one year.  During negotiations the Government gave
assurances that add-itional counterpart staff would be appointed to the Plan-
ning Department.
5.15    The experts would, in particular, advise on measures to reduce
education unit costs and on appropriate phasing of administrative and curri-
cula reforms. The school buildings' specialist would participate in school
facilities' surveys and studies to lower building costs.   The team would
assist the Project uinit (para. 6.03) in the preparation of architects' briefs,
equipment and furniture lists, tender documents, and project schools' programs
of study with a view to their wider application.
5.16    In addition, specialist teachers would be provided for a total of 16
man-years to complement technical assistance expected from bilateral and
multilateral sources. Twenty man-years of fellowships are included so thlat
senior staff of project schools can be given oppor-tunitics for further studies
and/or training abroad.  The team of experts and the specialist teachers would
be recruited and appointed by the Government with the approval of the As.o-
ciation on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
Cost of the Project
5.17    The estimated total cost of the proposed project is CFAF 3.,458 mfllion
or US $l1 million eauivalent; the estimated foreig   exchange component is
CFAF 2,295 million or US $9.3 million, representing just over 66% of the
total cost. The costs by type of educational facility are analyzed in

The costs include import taxes on goods for civil works but exclude import

5.19    Building cost per square meter averages $131, or $12 per square foot.
This is high by Iatin America or East Africa standards, but reasonable in
the Cameroon context (Appendix B) and in comparison with other French-speaking
West Africa countries. Reductions in total costs have been effected by
application of more economic standards for construction and by taking into
account the possibilities in East Cameroon of partial pre-fabrication and
standardization of construction components.

dures are satisfactcry.
6.02    Professional Serv:ices: In East Cameroon, neither the Secretariat, of
Public: Work.s nor any of the existing local architectural firms is organized
or staffed to carry out the design and technical control of a project of the
proposed magnitude. The Government would retain for this purDose a forei.gn
architectural firm acceptable to IDA, and on terms and conditions acceptELble
to TmlA. Tn accordarre with Government, regulations. the ronsulting architect(s)
would form an association with one or more of the local firms. The constLlting
firm(s;) wnuld provide the architectunral, e-ngineering, supervisory and teehnithl
control servrices for construction of aLl project items in East Cameroon and be
responsible for certificati'on of co-ntractorst bills. Tfn ;W.est rGm.ervon  t.he

educator -andc an engineer/architect, both acceptable to DA, and a qualified
accountant. The edutcator and the engineer/architect have been appointed and
one of the two is tc) be appointed project manager.  The unit would be pro-vid3.l
with adequatie supporting staff and work facilities.
6.04    Disbursements: A credit of US $10.5 million, equivalent to 75% of the
total cost of the projecti,is proposed which would meet 100% (US $9.3 million)
of the estimated foreign exchange costs and 25% ($1.2 million) of the local
costs. The financing of part of the local costs is justified on the groimds
that public savings will be insufficient to cover all the local costs of
public investment programs during the next few years, and because of the highl
priority of this project. The proposed credit would be disbursed on the basis
of:
(a) 100% of the costs of the technical assistance, instructional
equipment End furniture categories, including the costs of the
equipment and furniture needed for the project unit, estimated at
US $2.8 million; and
(b) a percentage (69%) of the estimated cost of the remaining items,
that is, civil works, site works and professional fees.
In conformity with :DA practice, the disbursement percentage under (b) above
would be adjusted so that disbursement would be spread throughout the period
of project executioni.

The Project - Further Technical Details
1.        The Primary Teacher Training Colleges (Project Items Nos. 1-3):
The project includes the construction and equipment of three primary teacher
training colleges with an annual output by 1974 of 60 instituteurs (Grade I
teachers) and 400 instituteurs-adjoints (Grade II teachers).
2.        The Grade I college - the Ecole Normale d'Instituteur a Vocation
Rurale (ENIR) - was opened in 1967 in temporary premises as a UNDP/Unesco
sponsored project. The cbjective of IMIR is to train teachers over a three
years' course to become competent in the classroom and in the school garden
and also in community development services (animateurs).    A dynamic curri-
culum has been developed for this purpose by the competent Unesco and
Cameroonian staff. ENIR has other functions also: it participates in
developing a more rurally-centered primary school curriculum and carrying
out experimental studies with this; it has initiated improvement of the
curricula cf the lower level primary teacher-training centers; it engages
in the up-grading of primary school adiministrators and unqualified teachers.
It is expected to operate anaudio-visual aids' production center and an
expanded correspondence course program.
3.        The location is acceptable for the purposes of teacher and
animateur preparation and experimentation with primary school curriculum
reform, but not for the proposed research, correspondence course and
production activities    9'he mision DconsiderPei that these latter functions
should be planned in the wider context of similar and proposed activities

8.        Thne college is tio be expanded tio a capacit ty of 500 students in
1973-197h, 440 of whom would be training for first cycle secondary school
beaching (Section A) and 60 for second cycle tieacning (oection B). Enroll-
ment growth. would be:

9.        The proposed expansion accords with plans to improve secondary
education arnd to reduce the number of expatriate teachers. The output by
type of tea.ching discipline must be related to the need. For some years,
the intake of Section A courses of two years' duration should be distributed
into three groups (20 per group) for prospective teachers of French and
two groups for each, of English, Social Studies, Maths-Physics, and General
Science.
10.       The curricula i.n all courses are satisfactory except that of
teachers of English. which should give more emphasis to English-learning
and less to a second foreign language.. In the last two years of a four-year
course, trainees in Section B, who are not graduates of other faculties of
the Univer'sity, would attend subject-matter courses in the appropriate
faculties of the Urniversity and only the professional courses at the ENS;
university graduates of other faculties transferring to the ENS would
follow a one-year course.

some further training abroad no difficulty is envisaged in recruiting staff;
technical assistance for this purpose is included in the project.   Preseint
FAC, Canada and U.K. technical assistance is expected to continue and could
be increased should the necessity arise in view of the planned decreased
demand for technical assistance for general secondary schools.
12.       The project includes construction and equipment of the additional
teaching spaces required, and a hostel for 120 students.
13.       General Secondary Schools:   The proposed eight first cycle schools
(Project Items Nos. 5-12) with a capacity of 2,560 will meet a small propor-
tion of the total additional needs of East Cameroon at this level. They
have been located to help implement Government zoning policy and will intro-
duce curriculum reforms. No West Cameroon first cycle schools are included
because the construction program for that State is not yet prepared. The
schools would have a common two-year course (Grades S1 and S2), but in
Grades S3 and Sh about half the students would take a course which differs
from the conventional type by including a substantial agricultural and work-
shop practice component. One second cycle school (Project Item No. 15)
would have 160 students in Grades S3 and Sh of a first cycle school.
1h.       The original request for West Cameroon was for the expansion from
289 to 800 of the Cameroon College of Arts, Science and Techmology (CAST)
at Bambili in the North, at present the only second cycle secondary school
in the State.  Such expansion could not be justified in tcrras of adequacy
of intake. It proved to be more advantageous for future development to
construct a. new second cycle school at Kumba, the biggest town in West
Cameroon and situated in the South Center.
15.      EBoth CAST and Kumba would limit enrollment to 180 (90 intake) but
in addition Bambili would expand its agricultural technicians' wing from the
present 43 to 100 and the Annex of the ENS from 18 to 80. Thus CAST would
have a total enrollment of 360. In determining the additional construction
needs, account has been taken of the adjoining agricultural research and train-
ing facilities which are now used also by CAST agricultural students, a hosteL
under construction with US AID funds, optimum use of existing accommodation,
and minor modifications to existing buildings to be carried out by the
Government at no cost to the project.
16.       The Technical Education and Vocational Training Schools: The EDouala
Techrical LTycee (Project Item 1No. 20) would phase out its first cyrle
secondary level courses-to provide an expanded second-cycle program leading
to the baccalaureati mathematiques et t+echnqdr que d to the baccalure2t c!e

ment.
17.     The vocational schools at Edea and Ebolowia (Project Items Nos. 21 and
22) have been chosen as pilot centers for a new industrial progran.   Recrait-
ment would be from first cycle general secondary Grade S2 level for a three-
year course, partly in the school and partly in industry, in preparation for
the Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle. In both schools the existing
buildings, suitably rehabilitated at no cost to the project, are adequate to
the new purpose. IDA aid is required for the replacement of obsolete
furniture and equipment and for additional equipment where the present
provision is inadequate (sheet metal work, electrical fitting, and refrigera-
tion at Edea) or new courses are to be introduced (electrical fitting and
auto-Diesel mechanics at Ebolowa).
18.     For West Cameroon there had been a proposal for the construction of
two vocational schools at Kumba and one at Victoria. The proposal was not in-
cluded in the request because of the uneconomic size of the units. The Govern-
ment has re-submitted the proposal in the form of an acceptable single school
for 240 students with courses in building trades, auto-mechanics and commercia).
subjects (Project Item No. 23).
19..    The curricula of the three vocational schools could be improved b;y
increasing the student work load from the present 30 to 34 periods weekly and
thus bring it more in line with the work load of the technical lycee which
ranges from 35-38 periods.   This increase would permit development of higher
skills and give a better utilization factor for the equipment installed.    The
Government has been advised on this Doint.
20..    Estimated output of the three vrocational schools by tvpe of trade
would be:
General Yiechanics and Sheet Metal Work        30
Electrical Fittiing                            60

Senegal and Haute Volta.
22.     EFSA would be restructured and expanded and provide new courses in
agricultural, engineering and teacher training. Students would be accepted for
a two-year degree course following two years in the Faculty of Science where
they would have pursued an agriculturally-biased science course and a
vacation course in practical agriculture organized by EFSA. A common first
year of theoretical and practical studies would be followed by a second yrear
in which there would! be a degree of specialization and greater emphasis on
practical work. The: long vacations would be devoted to field work outside
the school.
23.     Projected enrollments are 80 for the first degree course, 20 field
officers and new graduates for a one-year specialization and research course
in animal husbandry, agricultural engineering or plant protection, and 20
places for training of practising and prospective teachers of agriculture and/
or, as the necessity arises, up-grading of field officers of various levels.
About a half of the total 120 places would be taken up by Cameroonians. the
remainder bZy sponsoring countries. Ou-tput of graduates is expected to
increase from 10 to hO in 1975, including 20 Camreronians.

force could handle additional construction work.
3.      Construction:  Imported building materials, high wages and benefits
for expatriate labor anci managers of the building industry, and Transpc1rTatioLi
difficulties are responsible for high construction costs in Cameroon. The
costs increase considerably in relatlon to those obtaining in the port of
Douala, rising by 40% in the upper north of the country. It may be possible
to reduce costs by closer attention to materials' specifications and to the
possibilities of utilizing partial prefabrication, standardization of building
coq)onents and appLication of modular coordination tecbniques, as done
recently in a large FED primary school project.
4.      Professional services: The Public Works Departments of the States
have regional offices that control public construction. In West Cameroon, the
Departmentj is well organized and professionally qualified to carry out
architectural projects, but this is not the case in East Cameroon. The
counitry has only two firms of local architects and three of foreign archi-
tects competent tc) design construction projects, but all have adequate ex-
perience in Cameroon.
5.      Tendering and contract award procedures: Both East and West Cameroon
governraeint procedures for tendering are satisfactory. Architects, eng:Lneers
and contractors follow an acceptable system of professional practice anld
procedures for conitracts.

1/ Figures of the Second Development P:lan, ]L966-1l971 which have alreadwy been exceeded; the Plan asswued enforcement of reforms to excludle oveer-age
pupiLs gradually and. to improve flows through the system.
2/ If o1ver-age andc under-age pupils are exc:Luded (about 120,000) this would drop the percentage of enrollments to about 70%.
7/ Mission projections on ass,-ptions (a) that in E.C- refor-m-s to improve flows are enforced in Thirdi Plan period. and (b) that W.C. enrcillnDrts
are stabilized as a percentage of the age-group 6 through 12. If (a) iEI achieved then the enrollments in E. C. would be 9qO% of the 6 throaugh 11

b) It is diffic:uLt to measure the output of the several schools sinc:e in many cases the enrollment figures stop short of a recognized
standa:rd of attainment either because the fuill cycle has not been reached (as in recently estabLished schoo:Ls) or whore enp]LoyTnen.t
Notes-  a) n be secured wiLthout conLetion of te cyc:le (as in :many pivatie bommereial sc ols). The figures shown correspond to the enroll-
rments :in the final year of each cycle.
c) It is not possible to show examination successes corresponding to the given output since many of the examinations nay be taken by
students external to the schools.
