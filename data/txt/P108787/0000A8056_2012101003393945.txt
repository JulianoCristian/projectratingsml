                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In order to continue providing important support to the GoL in implementing its Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP), the MDTF has been successfully
                         restructured in March 2012 to extend its closing date until March 31, 2013. Two donors, namely, SDC and SIDA have exited the MDTF. The total RE-TF fund has increased to USD
                         4.7 mil. Major works to be completed during the extension period include the design of the Treasury Information Management System (TIMS), technical assistance for VAT

                         implementation and go-live implementation of VAT return processing and payment module of the Lao Tax IT System (LaoTIS). In addition, the MDTF would continue supporting on-
                         going critical reform efforts in Treasury Single Account implementation, consolidation of spending unit technical revenue accounts into National Treasury, support of GFIS operation,
                         accounting reform, and external audit capacity strengthening.

                         As of September 2012, works on TIMS design and TA for VAT implementation are progressing well and expected to be completed by March 2013 while implementation of Lao TIS
                         VAT module for tax return and payment processing faces some delay. Substantial work to support external audit capacity strenthening has yet to start due to delay in recruiting
                         external consultants. Thanks to completion of staffing of the newly established PCU with Financial Management and Procurement specialists in April, 2012, project management has
                         since improved considerably and disbursement accelerated.
