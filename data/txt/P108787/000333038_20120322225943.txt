                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A.      SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper (RP) introduces changes to the Lao PDR Public Finance Management Strength-
ening (PFMSP) Program Appraisal Document (PAD) and its accompanying legal documents: the Recipient Exe-
cuted Trust Fund (RETF) Grant Agreement No. TF091192. The proposed changes are to: (a) align the amount of
the grant agreement with the resources available in the MDTF; (b) extend the closing date of the RETF from
March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013; this additional implementation timeline is necessary to allow: (i) AusAID
and EC to disburse their respective remaining commitment into the MDTF (ii) to complete the critical activities of
the program to fully achieve the project development objective (PDO) and (iii) to provide continued support to the
PFMSP 2011-2015; (c) update the allocation to the disbursement categories and the detailed financing plan by
sub-components to reflect the extended timeline and the revised amount of the grant agreement and (d) include
the updated results matrix and program indicators.

B.      PROGRAM STATUS

2.      Background: The Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) was adopted by the
Government of Lao, PDR in November 2005, by the approval of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Minister for
Finance. With the inclusion of revenue administration reforms within this program, as part of the new Budget
Law promulgation this year, the PEMSP has been renamed in the Public Finance Management Strengthening
Program (PFMSP). The PFMSP remains a multi-year medium-to-long term rolling program which aims to im-
prove policy consistency, efficiency in public finance management, increased transparency and accountability in
public financial management, by strengthening institutional arrangements and capacity, and making progress to-
wards appropriate international financial management standards.

3.       The Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was
established to provide implementation support to the overall Lao PDR’s PFMSP. The MDTF includes pledged
contribution of about USD 7.3 million from 4 donors: EC, SDC, SIDA and AusAID. The costs estimates for the
program for both the Bank Executed Trust Fund (BETF) and Recipient Executed Trust Fund (RETF) were based
on activities to be executed over a four year period. Although the BETF started disbursement shortly after its in-
ception on (June 6, 2008), the RETF disbursement started much later on or around January 9, 2009 (effectiveness
date). The implementation timeline for the RETF has thus been drastically reduced from 48 months to 33 months
(from effectiveness to initial closing date of October 31, 2011).

4.        Implementation progress. Progress towards achievements of PDO is rated Satisfactory and overall im-
plementation progress is rated as being Moderately Satisfactory. The MDTF continues to provide important
support to the GoL in implementing its PFMSP, especially in the areas of treasury modernization, budget execu-
tion, accounting and financial reporting; and revenue policy and administration. Following the mid-term review
(MTR) of PFMSP, the PFMSP has been expanded to include the external oversight and audit component and the
MDTF has started providing support to this new component in the current fiscal year. GoL has committed all of
the funding under the existing GA including the outstanding disbursements from the AusAID and EC. Major
activities to be completed during the proposed extension period include the design of the Treasury Information
Management System (TIMS), technical assistance for VAT implementation and the roll out of the Lao Tax IT
System (LaoTIS). The MDTF is expected to continue to support on-going critical reform efforts in Treasury
Single Account implementation, consolidation of spending unit technical revenue accounts into National Treas-
ury, support GFIS operation, accounting reform, and external audit capacity strengthening. The GoL has re-
quested MDTF co-financiers for a two-year extension (from the original closing date of October 31, 2011) to
complete the implementation of critical activities planned under the 2010-2015 PFMSP program and make full
use of the remaining committed contribution from AusAID and the EC. A first restructuring completed last

                                                                                                                4
October granted a partial four months’ extension to allow continued support to the program while waiting for the
EC to process the extension of its bilateral agreement with Lao PDR and for additional contribution to be dis-
bursed into the parent account. A second restructuring took place in February 2012, granting one month’s exten-
sion to allow for full completion of donor Administrative Agreements’ amendment. The SDC and SIDA have
fully disbursed their $200K and SEK 7,400K respectively; and are exiting the MDTF; while the other two do-
nors (AusAID and EC ) have agreed to continue their support to the program for the proposed extension period.

5.       Implementation arrangements and fiduciary issues. Over the past year, the management of the project
has faced major transition challenges. Up to the closing of the previous PFM project (the FMCBP); the fiduciary
aspects of the RETF were handled by a dedicated unit under the External Finance Department: the Public Finance
Management and Strengthening Unit (PFMSU). The MOF management decided to establish a new Project Coor-
dination Unit (PCU) under the directorship of the Director General Cabinet Office to oversee all Bank-funded and
administered projects. The MOF has appointed the Manager for the PCU and staffed the PCU with government
officials for the positions of the deputy manager and assistant. The recruitment of fiduciary staff (procurement and
financial management specialists) are underway. As an interim measure, the PCU is currently staffed with two (2)
accountants, working temporarily until the financial management specialist is on board.

6.      Despite some delays, Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs) have been submitted regularly. The
quality of the IFR has improved over time. Audit reports have been submitted and the audit opinions were unqual-
ified.

       The Financial Management rating for the MDTF has been upgraded to marginally satisfactory to reflect
improvements made in clearance of advances and improved quality of the IFRs and realization of the action plan.

C.      PROPOSED CHANGES

7.       Closing Date. This restructuring proposes a 12 months extension from March 31, 2012 to March 31,
2013. This timeline is necessary for the remaining activities for the RETF program. This will be the third exten-
sion and a cumulative extension of 17 months. As of January 9, 2012, USD2.2 million has been disbursed and an
additional USD 1.6 million has been committed but the implementation of the related activities will go beyond the
current closing date of March 31, 2012. Major contracts to be completed beyond the current closing date are the
TIMS Design Consultant contract, VAT adviser assignment, LaoTIS roll out contract. In addition, the MDTF will
need to continue to support on-going critical reform efforts in Treasury Single Account implementation, consoli-
dation of spending unit technical revenue accounts into National Treasury, support and maintenance of GFIS op-
eration, accounting reform, and external audit capacity strengthening. Therefore, there is a clear need for exten-
sion to allow for the remaining donor commitments to be fully disbursed and utilized to provide continuous sup-
port to the Government's reform program.

8.      Components. As agreed at the MTR of the MDTF, an additional component (G - External Oversight and
Audit) has been included in the PFMSP which constitute an important element of the PFM system. The MDTF
will assist the State Audit Organization (SAO) to implement its action plan for capacity development and ICT
strategy. The assistance to the SAO is the continuation of the Bank’s support to this external audit function previ-
ously funded by the Bank-finance project called Financial Management Capacity Building Project (IDA 3676-LA
and IDA-H 3160, TF 57139).

9.      Financing plan. The total pledged contribution for the parent MDTF for PFMSP is approximately USD
7.3 million, out of which USD 3.07 million was originally allocated to the recipient executed trust fund. The
Grant Agreement amount will be increased from USD 3.07 million to USD 4.7 million to reflect the resources
available for RETF under this MDTF.

BETF and RETF.

The PFMSP will secure a coordinated approach in addressing deficiencies within GoL financial management and
accountability system with the following outputs:

      o   Improved consistency between Government development priorities and activities;
      o   Improved efficiency in public financial management;
      o   Improved transparency and accountability in public finance management;
      o   Strengthened institutional financial management systems and capacity;
      o   Appropriate international financial management standards applied; and
      o   Prioritized and sequenced Government’s initiatives in strengthening public financial management.

The overall project development objective of the PFMSP remains unchanged: to support the Government of Lao
PDR to enhance the public sector effectiveness to the socio-economic development of its population. MDTF
would contribute to progress in four out of eight outcome areas of the PFSMP (improved macro-fiscal discipline
and management, improved financial management and control, improved revenue management and control, im-
proved sectoral and local allocation and management) which are critical to achieving the goal of the PFM re-
form. While a results framework was not included in the initial PAD, efforts were undertaken by the Ministry of
Finance to prepare a detailed framework for monitoring results during the initial stages of project implementation
based on the results of the PEFA assessment. The final results framework was endorsed following the MTR; and
is included as Annex 2 to this RP. A comprehensive monitoring framework for these indicators with baselines
and target measurements can be found in the project file.

Public Financial Management Strengthening Program. The ultimate goal of the PFMSP are: improved policy consistency, efficiency, transparency and account-
ability in public expenditure and revenue management by strengthening institutional systems and capacity and making progress towards appropriate international
financial management standards and effective use of foreign financing. MDTF will contribute to progress in four outcome areas of the PFSMP (improved macro-
fiscal discipline and management; improved financial management and control; improved revenue management and control and improved sectoral and local
allocation and management) which are critical to achieving the goal of the PFM reform.
