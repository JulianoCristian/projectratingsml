Implementation Status Overview
The MDTF continues to provide important support to the GoL in implementing its Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP), especially in the areas of treasury
modernization, budget execution, accounting and financial reporting; and revenue policy and administration. Following the mid-term review (MTR) of PFMSP, the PFMSP has been
>   expanded to include the external oversight and audit component and the MDTF has started providing support to this new component in the current fiscal year. GoL has committed
o   all of the funding under the existing GA (and some of the to-be-disbursed commitments of EC and AusAID) but implementation of signed contracts will go beyond the current closing
0   date of the TF (February, 29, 2012). Major works to be completed during the extension period include the design of the Treasury Information Management System (TIMS), technical
:   assistance for VAT implementation and the roll out of the Lao Tax IT System (LaoTIS). The MDTF is expected to continue to support on-going critical reform efforts in Treasury
o   Single Account implementation, consolidation of spending unit technical revenue accounts into National Treasury, support GFIS operation, accounting reform, and external audit
0   capacity strengthening. The GoL has requested MDTF co-financiers for a two-year extension (from the original closing date of October 31, 2011) to complete signed contracts and to
r    use the additional funding from donors to support 2010-2015 implementation plan of the PFMSP. SDC has indicated that it will exist the MDTF while the other three donors (EC,
.0   AusAID, Sida) have agreed to the extension. Given the amount of final funding to be made available to the RE-TF, it was agreed that the extension will be for 17 months from the
-   original closing date (i.e. until March 31, 2013).
