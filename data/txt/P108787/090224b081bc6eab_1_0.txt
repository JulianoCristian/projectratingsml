                         Implementation Status Overview
                         While the overall high level objective of the PFMSP MDTF is to support the GoL to enhance the public sector effectiveness to socio-economic development of its population, the
                         immediate objective of the MDTF is to improve the effectiveness of the public finance management in Lao PDR through support to the Government's Public Financial Management
                         Strengthening Program. The ultimate goal of the PFMSP are: improved policy consistency, efficiency, transparency and accountability in public expenditure and revenue

                         management by strengthening institutional systems and capacity and making progress towards appropriate international financial management standards and effective use of foreign
                         financing. MDTF is expected to contribute to progress in four outcome areas of the PFSMP ( (i) improved Macro-Fiscal Discipline and Management, (ii) improved financial
                         management and control, (iii) Improved revenue management and control, and (iv) improved sectoral and local allocation and management) which are critical to achieving the goal of
                         the PFM reform.

                         The PFMSP MDTF has just been extended for four months until end-August 2013 with funding reallocated from the BETF and allocation from interest income and exchange rate
                         gains to provide continuous support to the PFMSP and support to the recently introduced school block grant scheme as well as the consultation process for preparation of the local
                         administration law and civil service law.

                         The PFMSP MDTF is now entering the fifth year of implementation. So far the activities supported by the MDTF financing have contributed to improved budget credibility and
                         transparency, better control of government cash balances, improved tax payer registration and effective administration of VAT, improved public financial legal drafting process
                         through wider consultations. Progress for most of immediate result indicators seem to indicate that Lao PDR PFM system is improving, albeit the progress may not be sufficient
                         enough to raise scores for all the associated PEFA indicators.

                         Key achievements include: completion of centralization of the treasury, tax and customs functions; adoption and implementation of the Treasury Single Account Framework;
                         expended budget coverage through consolidating technical revenue and major off-budget funds into the budget and disbursed through the National Treasury and its provincial offices;
                         improved timing and content of budget circular; completion of implementation of the External Debt Management System (DMFAS) with all data inputted into the system, completion of
                         the business process mapping and proposed changes for implementation of a full function treasury system; successful VAT introduction, putting in place a technical foundation for the
                         strengthening of taxpayer service, compliance management and audit, and completion of the new VAT law draft. Some planned works such as development of budget allocation
                         norms and revenue sharing formula, issuance of budget ceilings could not be achieved due to the lack of understanding and capacity to design an inter-governmental transfer
                         system, weaknesses in coordination between central government agencies and provinces, and lack of clarity in the roles between central government, provinces, and districts.
                         Nevertheless, the GoL's decision to implement the school block grant from FY2010-2011 to transfer funding directly the primary schools on the basic of a per pupil formula is an
                         encouraging development and a step in a right direction to help reduce inequality in education service provision.
