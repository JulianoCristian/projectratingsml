           People's Democratic Republic were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was high, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Grantee performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: it is important to recognize that\n            PFM reforms are complex and outcomes are difficult to\n            measure. Accurate assessment of the recipient's\n            institutional environment and capacity is crucial when\n            designing a capacity-building technical assistance (TA)\n            project and its implementing unit. Past Bank experience\n            shows that when the government is highly committed to a\n            project, a high degree of project flexibility leads to good\n            results. But in the case of the PFMSP-multi-donor trust fund\n            (MDTF), project flexibility worked against successful\n            implementation since it allowed authorities to shift their\n            attention to new priorities and responsibilities, and pay\n            much less attention to the Bank's project and its\n            results. The guiding principles for project implementation\n            must be clear to all involved - the project's steering\n            committee, managing agency, project management units, and\n            implementing units in order to ensure that procedures are\n            followed and results are carefully tracked. Intensive\n            supervision and adequate funding are crucial prerequisites\n            for TA project success. For a public finance management TA\n            project, the correct mix of knowledge, skills, adequate\n            training, and clear and easy-to-follow procedures are crucial."}, "docdt": "2014-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
