assist the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MOH) in improving\n            health care services through the establishment of a primary\n            health care system. The project would provide for training\n            of staff as well as construction, furnishing and equipping\n            of health facilities in four regions of Peru. The facilities\n            would serve about 3.5 million people, most of whom live in\n            absolute poverty and suffer from high rates of mortality and\n            morbidity. The delivery system would also support efforts in\n            the fields of population planning and nutrition improvement.\n            The Bank loan would provide funds for maintenance\n            facilities, project administration, project monitoring,\n            health education and improving management in the MOH.\n            Finally, the loan would include funds for the preparation of\n            a further primary health care project."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
