In 1998, the World Bank approved a 38\n            million dollars loan to support legal registration of\n            960,000 urban properties in Peru. More than 1.3 million\n            homeowners have registered their properties since then, and\n            demand keeps growing. The comision de formalizacion de la\n            propiedad informal, which manages the project, uses popular\n            theater and comes to local festivals in poor barrios to\n            encourage people to register their properties, and thereby\n            benefit from an associated micro-credit program."}, "docdt": "2004-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
