Institutional reform is\n            not a one-step intervention; instead, it is an evolutionary\n            process in the sense that, as soon as a reform is completed,\n            new constraints and new obstacles emerge, and efforts have\n            to be taken to resolve these issues. The idea to create a\n            new institution with a sole mandate to issue titles, rather\n            than using an existing institution, may yield positive\n            results; 2) a long-term vision, where continuous\n            Government-Bank dialogue may render very positive results in\n            the medium and long terms, giving way to a comprehensive\n            approach to property rights, to match modern organizations\n            and markets. In particular, property rights formalization\n            must be complemented by policies that promote access to\n            credit, housing, infrastructure, and community empowerment,\n            among others. Moreover, institutional reforms are required\n            to eliminate high transaction costs in property markets as a\n            precondition for an effective demand for formalization.\n            Other lessons focus on effective consensus-building, and, on\n            special monitoring and evaluation mechanisms."}, "docdt": "2004-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
