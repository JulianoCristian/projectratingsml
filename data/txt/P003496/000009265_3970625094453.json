implementing investment projects\n            and administering technical assistance. The project will\n            consist of technical assistance and training subprojects\n            which will be selected by agreement between the Government\n            and the IDA. Most of the subprojects will support project\n            preparation. A few subprojects will be aimed primarily at\n            strengthening the core agencies and other institutions\n            involved with Bank operations.
