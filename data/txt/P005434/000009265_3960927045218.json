To achieve its objectives the project will provide Credit\n            Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) with: (a) a line of credit to\n            support its lending for low- and moderate-cost housing; and\n            (b) technical assistance funds for studies to improve its\n            knowledge and understanding of the housing supply system, to\n            develop new savings and credit products, and to adapt its\n            management information and internal audit systems to its new\n            depository and lending activities. In addition, the project\n            will finance institution building activities designed to\n            upgrade the Government's capability to facilitate land\n            and housing development."}, "docdt": "1989-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
