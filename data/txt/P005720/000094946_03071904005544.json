Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory because a firmer line should have been taken\n            on administrative restructuring. Borrower performance is\n            rated unsatisfactory because of substantial delays during\n            implementation. OED rates the outcome of the Agricultural\n            Sector Investment Project as moderately satisfactory and\n            sustainability is likely. Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, reflecting the solid analytic underpinnings of\n            the project and the generally adequate nature of\n            supervision. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory,\n            primarily because of the high commitment to the project. OED\n            rates the outcome of the Northwest Mountainous Area\n            Development Project as satisfactory and sustainability is\n            rated likely because the participatory approach has built\n            community ownership. The National Rural Finance\n            Project's outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory\n            because it failed to improve on the deficient approach and\n            mixed performance of the projects that preceded it.\n            Sustainability is rated unlikely based primarily on the weak\n            loan recovery rate. Bank performance is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory because of the design deficiencies (reflected\n            in hurried preparation). Borrower performance is also rated\n            highly unsatisfactory, reflecting on the government's\n            failure to allow the National Agriculture Bank to function\n            as a solvent commercial enterprise. Four important lessons\n            were confirmed by this project experience: First, a\n            piecemeal approach to reform-trying to effect small changes\n            under the cover of a number of investment operations-offers\n            little leverage and is therefore unlikely to work. Second,\n            attempts to strengthen monitoring are futile if the\n            performance indicators monitored are not linked to achieving\n            significant outcomes. Third, decentralization is an\n            important objective, but may be counterproductive if\n            resources are spread too thinly. This is a particularly\n            important issue for agricultural services, the structure of\n            which needs to be rationalized. Fourth, where there have\n            been several interventions which are cumulative in effect it\n            is reasonable for evaluators to have higher expectations of\n            development effectiveness and to be correspondingly more\n            demanding in their search for evidence of effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
