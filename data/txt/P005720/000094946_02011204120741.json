On\n            reviewing the history of financial intermediation loans in\n            the Bank, lessons show that many have been partially, or\n            totally cancelled, because demand did not materialize;\n            actually, it is flexibility that becomes critical in the\n            design of such projects, that is, excessive restrictions on\n            clients to which the financial institution could lend,\n            should preferably be avoided. In this project, allocation of\n            loan funds to specific subproject categories, created an\n            unnecessary administrative burden, thus requiring loan\n            reallocations during the life of the project. Instead, a\n            positive list of subprojects by categories, could have been\n            defined, specifying that no single subproject category could\n            receive more than, say a certain percentage of the total\n            loan proceeds. Moreover, given the project objective to\n            support both rural development, and the institutional\n            development of a specific bank, a coherent strategy should\n            have been in place, and the Bank should have deepened policy\n            discussions on ways to support the farmers' financial\n            difficulties, by urging the Government to provide direct\n            assistance to such farmers."}, "docdt": "2001-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
