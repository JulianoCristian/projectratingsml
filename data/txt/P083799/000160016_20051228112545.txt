Description         The EPPFMC contributes to implementation o f the first, second and
                    fourth pillars o f Mali's Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework
                    (PRSF), namely: accelerated and re-distributivegrowth in a context
                    o f macroeconomic stability and openness, driven by the private
                    sector;    institutional development     (including  public    finance
                    management), governance and participation; and basic infrastructure
                    and productive economic activities. Specifically, the EPPFMC aims
                    to: (i)promote growth and poverty reduction through (a)
                     strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal management and (b)
                    implementing key actions underpinning Mali's long-term growth
                    and competitiveness; and, (ii)     improve efficiency, accountability
                    and    transparency     in public    finance   management      through
                     strengthening (a) public expenditure management at central and
                     decentralized levels and (b) the public procurement system.

                    Macroeconomic management would be strengthened through
                    prudent expenditure management; and greater linkage between the
                     macroeconomic framework, the budget and the implementation o f
                     the PRSF. This will be done by strengthening the medium term
                    budget framework and medium term sector expenditure framework
                    processes; continued implementation o f cotton producer price
                    mechanism to reduce risk o f budgetary transfers; commenced
                     implementation o f cotton sector reforms while ensuring close
                    monitoring o f cotton sector financial position; and strengthened
                     institutional framework in the Ministry o f Finance (MEF) for
                    monitoring/coordination o f the PRSF and the growth agenda. The
                    growth support agenda would be strengthened through continued
                     implementation o f financial       sector  development    actions to
                     strengthen the health o f the sector and enhance access to finance
                    particularly longer term funds; implementation o f key transport
                     sector actions to improve quality and lower cost o f transportation
                     services; and implementation o f trade facilitation measures to
                    reduce processinghansactionscosts o f trade.

            Public expenditure management         (PEM), drawing from the
            Government's Consolidated Action Plan for the Modernization and
            Improvement o f Publicfinance management, would be strengthened
            through continuing the automation o f information flows between
            key MEF de-concentrated departments (notably, treasury, budget
            and financial control)      to increase information quality and
            transparency, improving the quality o f published material on the
            financial and expenditure situation o f the Government to increase
            transparency;    and continued improvements in PEM processes,
            particularly internal and external budget control mechanisms.
            Public procurement would be strengthened through adoption o f a
            coherent    action plan and     commencing its      implementation,
            comprising updating o f the legislative/regulatory       framework,
            strengthening the linkages between public procurement and public
            finance management processes, and strengthening the private
            sector's access to public procurement opportunities.

Benefits    The proposed operation would support the Government in the
            pursuit of its policy objectives laid out in the PRSF within an
            appropriate macroeconomic       framework,    by providing sound
            financing for execution o f the Government's 2005 budget. It would
            also provide the incentives to implement key economic, social and
            institutional reform to strengthen overall performance o f the
            economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Implementation o f
            the EPPFMC program contributes to strengthen public finance
            management, thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness o f
            public sector spending. This includes strengthening governance and
            performance o f the procurement system.          In agriculture, the
            operation would contribute to stabilizing the performance o f the
            cotton sector and farmer incomes; and to laying the foundations for
            private sector led expansion o f the Office du Niger (ON) irrigation
            zone. The operation would also contribute to enhancing the export
            prospects o f handicraft products (typically produced by small
            informal sector firms) through removal o f the export assessment tax,
            thereby improving the incomes o f the poor. It would also improve
            the investment climate by lowering the administrative and financial
            cost o f starting a business, and strengthening property rights over
            land.

            Over the medium term, the operation would contribute to reducing
            transportation costs by ensuring regular road maintenance and
            lowering the cost burden (in money and time) on the private sector
            o f customs administration, and to increase agnculture growth and
            food security due to expansion o f the ON area. It would lower the
            costs o f financial services (and therefore enhance access to credit)
            through cleaning up non-performing loans from bank balance
            sheets.   It would also improve access to longer term resources
            vitally needed to stimulate private sector led growth, through the
            strengthening the prospects o f institutions with long term assets
            whether     financial (pension   funds, housing bank, insurance
            companies) or physical (leasing companies).


                                    vii

Risks              The operation faces the external, institutional, and political risks.
                   External risks stem mainly from the well-known vulnerability o f the
                   Malian economy to vagaries o f weather and commodity price
                   fluctuations (cotton, oil) as well as regional crises (e.g., Cote
                   d'Ivoire, cricket infestation). Mitigating these risks over the horizon
                   o f the proposed project remains difficult. However, the project
                   would be broadly consistent with policies and initiatives to reduce
                   the Malian economy's structural vulnerabilities over the medium
                   term by the inclusion o f key measures for financial sector
                   development,    transport    diversification and trade       facilitation
                   measures (including customs reform).        Additionally, the country
                   dialogue would allow for some budget flexibility to address crisis-
                   related expenses within the context o f a prudently managed budget
                   supporting priority growth and poverty reduction programs.
                   Increasing progress toward predictable and timely donor support
                   and coordination promotedunder the project will also be key.

                   Institutional risk comprises the threat o f weak capacity and
                   governance to program implementation and outcomes. This risk o f
                   slower-than-desired     program implementation stemming             from
                   capacity constraints will be reduced through continued technical
                   support by the World Bank and other donors to strengthen capacity,
                   particularly   in coordination      o f   the  financial   sector    and
                   growtldmacroeconomic programs.          Project design also includes
                   strengthening growth-critical areas such as prudent fiscal policy,
                   financial sector development and transport and trade facilitation.
                   Furthermore, by building on the good record of policy reform in
                   public finance management, the Credit itself will contribute to the
                   institutional strengthening o f various agencies involved in public
                   finance management including at sub-national levels.

                   Political risk remains that the Government's current commitment to
                   the continued reforms, including privatization and liberalization
                   program (banking, cotton, telecommunication sectors) could wane.
                   Potential re-opening o f discussion on agreed measures could cause a
                   loss o f momentum inreform implementation. This risk i s constantly
                   monitoredby the country team inorder to detect problemareas early
                   on and adjust the Bank response as needed. Finally, and perhaps
                   most importantly, given the low international cotton prices, there is
                   a critical political risk that insufficient recovery of world cotton
                   prices would dictate a sharp downward adjustment inlocal producer
                   prices, an adjustment that could prove politically extremely
                   difficult. While this risk i s not possible to control, the operation
                   draws from estimates o f the potential poverty and financial impact
                   o f various cotton prices in order to inform the policy choices and
                   trade offs between the need for local prices to reflect world market
                   conditions and the desirability o f cushioning the temporary impact
                   on the poor.

                                       TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI


                                           1.       INTRODUCTION

1.1     The Economic Policy and Public Finance Management Policy (EPPFMC) to Mali, to be
presented to the Executive Board on January 19, 2006, i s a single tranche operation o f US$25
million supporting improved management and implementation o f the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Framework (PRSF). The PRSF, formally adopted by the Government o f Mali in May
2002, identifies the framework for the Government's policies during 2002-2006.                          The second
annual progress report (APR) covering implementation during 2003-2004 was adopted by the
Government in August 2005 and transmitted to the Bank and FundinNovember 2005. The APR
and Joint Staff Advisory Note will be distributed to the Executive Board for information in early
January 2006.

1.2     Preparation of the credit has proceeded during a difficult economic period in Mali.
Government revenues are lower due to adverse terms o f trade movements during 2004-05
(increasing oil price, declining cotton price), just as government expenditure requirements have
risen to manage food shortage concerns resulting from the low rainfall and locust invasion in2004.
Inflation i s up sharply in 2005 (5 percent this year versus -3.1 percent last year) due to the food
shortages, and transport costs remain high due to the continuing reliance on more distant ports in
the wake o f the political crisis in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire. The current economic situation
underscores the precarious economic environment in which the country's macroeconomic and
budgetary management occurs.

1.3      The EPPFMC, which builds on and expands the program under the Fourth Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC IV) approved by the Board inMarch 2005, comprises three components:
(i)strengthening macroeconomic framework and budget policy; (ii)pursuing key growth-
supporting measures for financial sector development, irrigation development, transport and trade
facilitation, and business climate enhancement; and (iii)             strengthening public finance management
systems. The credit i s an integral part o f the 2003 CAS base case comprising annual policy-based
lending complemented by specific sector operations. A new CAS will be prepared in FY07 to
outline Bank support for the second PRSF (covering the period 2007-201l),                   which the authorities
are preparing on a schedule aligned with the 2007 budgetpreparation cycle.'



                                        2.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

2.1      Mali benefits from a stable and inclusive political environment, having successhlly
concluded four successive Presidential elections since 1990 and two sub-national elections since
1997. It has been a steady reformer over the past twenty years, albeit a plodding one at times. In

' A draft is expected to be available by July 2006 for integration into the 2007 Budget and a final version by October
2006.

response to market-oriented economic reforms and broad-based political reforms over the last 20
years that spurred private sector activity and enhanced civil society participation, Mali's real GDP
growth has averaged above 5 percent a year since 1994 when the currency was devalued. Gross
national income per capita (atlas method) increased from US$240 in 1994 to US$370 in2004, a 4.0
percent average annual increase, translating into reductions in poverty (paragraph 2.16) and
inequality (paragraph 2.17).

2.2    Despite the achievements over the past decade and half, Mali faces significant economic
and social challenges. Over 60 percent o f Mali's population lived below the poverty line in 2001,
and Mali's social indicators remain among the lowest in the world-it                  is ranked 172 out o f 175
countries inthe HumanDevelopment Index compiled by the UnitedNations Development Program
(UNDP). This partly reflects the fact that Mali is avast landlockedcountrywith arelatively narrow
natural resource and human capital base. It i s the largest country in West Africa (1.22 million
square kilometers) covering twice the size o f Texas. With a population o f about 12 million,
population density i s very low (10 persons per square kilomete?) resulting in high cost o f public
service delivery, difficulty in accessing some segments o f the rural population as well as nomadic
communities, andhightransportation costs for agricultural inputs and other goods.

2.3     Mali's economy remains fragile in view o f the economy's vulnerability to climatic
conditions and commodity price fluctuations (primarily o f cotton, oil, gold). The economy i s
dependent on agriculture and gold production, and exports are highly concentrated with gold and
cotton together comprising over 90 percent o f export earnings. As a land-locked country, Mali
faces challenges due to weak development o f infrastructure and transportation services, and to
economic and political conditions in neighboring countries. The business environment-notably
road transportation but also investment inflow prospects-continues to suffer from the protracted
stalemate in the resolution o f the crisis in C8te d'Ivoire. As with other low income countries,
administrative capacity i s also weak. A significant social, structural and macroeconomic agenda
remains for Mali to consolidate the gains o f the past to sustain broad-based growth, hrther
entrench market-oriented forces inthe country, and advance the poverty reduction program.

Growth and Prices

2.4     Mali's economic performance i s highly subject to several exogenous shocks, and 2004 was
a particularly challenging year in that respect. In 2004 Mali faced several adverse exogenous
shocks: natural disasters in the form o f drought and locust invasion; commodity price shocks;
currency appreciation against the dollar; and persistent regional instability. Inadequate rainfall and
locust infestation during the 2004-05 crop year3resulted indeclines in cereal and cotton production
by at least 16 percent4 and 3 percent respectively, contributing to a decline inreal GDP growth to
2.3 percent in 2004, following 7.2 percent growth in 2003. While the terms o f trade overall
improved marginally during 2004 at 1.4 percent, adverse shifts in key international prices were
particularly burdensome to Mali's macroeconomic management-notably,                         a 30 percent fall in


 The next largest West African country by land area, Nigeria, covers 0.9 million square km. With a population of 129
millionpeople, its populationdensity i s 142persons per km2.
 The crop year runs fromM a y to April.
 Depending on which government methodology used, the drop incereals production is as high as 40 percent.

                                                         2

international cotton prices during 2004 contributed to severely worsening the cotton sector's
financial position, thereby having implications for the state budget to cover the resulting sector
deficit; while a 31 percent rise in oil prices induced the Government to lower petroleum taxes to
ease the price impact at the pump, led to declining fiscal revenues. Weakening o f the U S dollar
relative to the euro in2004 to which the local currency i s pegged, aggravated the adverse impact o f
the cotton price decline since the latter i s denominated in U S dollars. Lastly, persistent instability
inneighboring Cote d'Ivoire kept transport prices high as more distant ports continued to be used,
and contributed to Mali's lackluster investment prospects.

2.5      In2005 Mali continues to bear the macroeconomic repercussions o f last year's exogenous
shocks inaddition to continued terms o f trade declines during 2005. The cotton sector deficit from
last year has constrained the smooth management o f the cotton season this year and, due to low
food stocks stemming from the 2004 drought, the Government has had to devote resources to food
security objectives through increased food imports and food distribution to affected population^.^
The timely distribution or sale o f food stocks by the Government and donor agencies, appear to
have limited the human costs o f the drought and locusts. Reflecting the marketed food imbalance
in 2005, however which raised cereal prices by over 50 percent in the 12 months through
September 2005, consumerprices increasedby 23 percent resulting inan estimated average annual
inflation for 2005 o f 5 percent compared with the -3 percent inflation outcome in 2004 and -1.3
percent in 2003. The rise in gold prices (5 percent on average in 2005 relative to 2004) was
insufficient to counter the absence o f a recovery in cotton prices (the average price over first three
quarters o f 2005 i s 12 percent lower than the 2004 average) and the continued oil price increase (by
39 percent on average inthe first three quarters o f 2005; see Annex 12 for discussion o f economic
impact o f the oil price shock in Mali). The result i s continued deterioration o f the terms o f trade
during 2005, by a projected 13 percent year-on-year, worse than the initial projections by about 3
percentage points.

2.6       At the same time, the return to more favorable climatic conditions and higher gold
production in2005 have yielded better economic outcomes on some indicators albeit less favorable
than the initial projections. Economic growth i s expected to return to the average post-1994 levels,
with real economic growth in2005 projectedto be 5.4 percent due to strong rebound in agriculture
production (both cereals and cotton) in response to the good rainfall levels. The projected growth
for 2005 i s lower than the initial projection o f 5.8 percent, however, due to slightly lower projected
gold output. Table 2.1 summarizes the main impact o f the exogenous shocks on growth and prices.


Fiscal Developments

2.7       While the exogenous shocks in 2004 translated into some revenue shortfalls (such as
petroleum tax), fiscal revenues overall were higher than the April program targets due largely to
higher-than-expected value added tax receipts. Government revenue indicators improved in 2004
relative to 2003, reflecting improvements in revenue management and collections: total
 government revenueincreased interms o f GDP, to 17.4 percent in2004 from 16.4 percent in2003;
 and tax revenue increasedto 15.1percent in2004 from 13.6 percent in2003. Nonetheless, lower non-
tax revenues and lower external grants than programmed, meant lower overall resources (revenues
 including grants) than targeted, inducing the authorities to reduce non-poverty budget expenditures

 'TheWorld    FoodProgram estimated that up to 20 percent of Mali's population (about 2.2 millionpeople) in the north
 of the country, was at riskof famine.

accordingly. Delays in executing externally financed capital spending in addition to lower-than-
anticipated government transfers6, contributed to spending below budget. In terms o f GDP, the
Government's prudent budget management translated into slightly better budget execution than
April program targets, in addition to a lower overall fiscal deficit than programmed-the                        fiscal
deficit on a commitment basis excluding grants was 6.6 percent, and the fiscal deficit on a cash
basis including grants was 2.3 percent, both lower than the respective program target by 1
percentage point o f GDP (see Table 2.2).

2.8      In2005 thepersistentoilprice shock andfood insecurity situationcontributedinlargepart
to continued revenue shortfalls relative to program targets. The authorities lowered the tax on
petroleum product imports to avoid sharp increases inpetrol prices at the pump duringthe first half
o f the year. To compensate for rising food prices, they introduced temporary exemptions on import
duties for food imports, and decided to postpone implementation o f some planned tax measures
(e.g., the elimination of VAT exemptions for the agricultural bank and agricultural inputs).
Shortfalls innon-tax revenues-notably               difficulties incollecting dividendpayments, property taxes
and capital gains taxes-also               contributed to the revenue shortfall.          Measures introduced to
strengthen tax and customs collections (improved onsite accounting checks, large taxpayer unit
computerization, recovery of WAEMSJ duty losses compensation, and strengthening o f import
verification to combat customs fraud) are expected to enable the authorities to make up shock-
related revenue shortfalls.

2.9      As a result of the revenue shortfalls, 2005 budget revenues in terms o f GDP fell short of
program targets by about 1 percentage point o f GDP. A further shortfall in external grants by 1
percentage point of GDP i s projected.                 Nonetheless, total revenues o f 17.6 percent o f GDP
represented a slight increase over 2004. Despite the revenue setbacks, execution of the 2005
budget has been good so far. Expenditure targets were broadly in line with program targets,
particularly capital expenditures, with slight shortfalls experienced in current expenditures. Total
expenditure and net lending in 2005 i s projected to be 26.3 percent o f GDP (versus the target 27
percent), with current expenditures at 13.8 percent o f GDP (versus the target 14.3). Expenditure of




  These comprise:      a provision that didn't materialize, for potential transfers to the electricity/water utility to
compensate for the government's lowering o f utility fees;         and an unused provision to cover staff downsizing of
privatized companies.

HIPC resources is projected to fully reflect the planned amount. The overall fiscal deficit (cash
basis including grants) i s projected to be 4.2 percent o f GDPversus the 3.5 percent target.

ExternalDevelopments

2.10    The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) worsened slightly in 2004 to 9.5
percent o f GDP due largely to lower gold exports. Gold exports declined (by 2.4 percentage points
relative to the 2003 share) combining with a decline in other exports (by 0.5 percentage points) to

outweighed the increase in cotton exports (1.4 percentage points). A lower decline in imports (by
1.O percentage points) relative to the exports decline (by 1.3 percentage points total) and unchanged
service account balance, thus translated into a worsening o f the current account balance by 0.8
percentage points. Including official transfers, the current account deficit was estimated to be 7.7
percent in 2004, up from 6.1 percent in 2003. Lower financial inflows (mostly by the private
sector) led to an estimated deterioration in the overall external balance to minus US$186.9 million
(or -3.4 percent o f GDP in 2004), following a surplus in 2003 o f US$221.4 million (4.5 percent of
GDP). Gross international reserves are estimated to have decreased by about US$82.2 million in
2004, equivalent to about 1.5 percent o f GDP. Despite the decline, reserves represented 6.4 months
of imports in2004, down from 7.1 months in2003.

2.11     In 2005, the current account deficit (excluding official transfers) is projected to widen
further to 11percent of GDP, due largely to adverse terms o f trade7 whose impact i s projected to
increase the burden of imports (including oil imports) and lower cotton exports which, together,
outweighed the increase in gold exports. A strong projected increase in official inflows contributes
to slightly improving the overall external deficit to US$80 million (or 1.6 percent o f GDP) in2005.
Mali's contribution to the gross international reserves o f the Central Bank o f West African States
(BCEAO) i s projectedto increase in2005 (by US$67.5 million) but still remain equivalent to about
6 months o f imports.


Monetary Developments

2.12     As a member o f the Franc Zone, Mali's monetary policy i s implemented satisfactorily by
the regional central bank, consistent with the peg to the Euro. Mali's monetary indicators reflect
prudent monetary management on the part o f the Government. The bulk o f money supply growth
in Mali is due to increases in credit to the economy rather than in government credit. In 2004
money supply growth i s estimated to have declined by 2.4 percent, reflecting a 6.5 percent decline
in net foreign assets and 4.1 percent increase in net domestic assets which, in turn, reflected an
increase in net credit to the Government and to the economy as a whole. In 2005, money supply
growth i s expected to be higher at 6.5 percent, in view o f the higher economic growth. Both net
foreign assets and net domestic assets are projected to increase, by 4.6 percent and 1.9 percent
respectively.

                          MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                                  OUTLOOK

2.13     Giventhe likely recurrence o f climatic and commodity price shocks, Mali's economy faces
a real challenge o f reducing annual volatility in GDP growth and o f increasing real GDP growth
above the 5 percent average experienced since the 1994 devaluation. Under the revised medium-
term macroeconomic framework for 2006-08 recently agreed with the IMF and the Bank, average
annual growth i s projected at about 5.5 percent, inflation at about 1percent on average and current
account deficits (excluding official transfers) at about 8.4 percent o f GDP. During 2006-08,
continued prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management comprising enhanced revenue
mobilization and efficient resource allocation and expenditure management will be crucial to
maintaining macroeconomic stability. As gold production i s anticipated to level o f f after 2008,
increased GDP growth would need to come from other sources, notably diversified agriculture,
 'Theterms   of trade i s projected to deteriorate in 2005 by 13.4 percent year-on-year, due to combined effect of rising
oil prices and falling cottonprices.

ago-industry and services driven by private sector efforts. Critical to strengthening private sector
led growth would be implementation o f structural reforms, notably: cotton sector reforms to
restore the viability o f the sector and minimize the fiscal risk it poses; financial sector reforms;
and infrastructure reforms particularly intransport, energy and water sectors.

2.14     Public finances and financing requirements.                       As noted above (paragraph 2.9)
implementation o f the 2005 budget has been satisfactory to date. The budget reflects the priorities
o f the PRSF overall and priorities o fthe key sectors as detailed inthe sector MTEFs. As a result o f
the revenue shortfalls discussed above, and after adding donor financing, a residual financing gap
of CFAF 9.7 billion (US$18.0 million equivalent and 0.35 percent o f GDP) remains.                           The
authorities are expected to close the gap through domestic financing without affecting overall
development objectives. The 2006 budget is consistent with PRSF priorities, and even enhances
allocations to health and education programs relative to the 2005 budget. Reflecting a projected
GDP growth o f 5.4 percent, and inflation o f -1.5 percent as food availability returns to normal
levels, revenues are projected to increase relative to 2005 to underpin the expanded public
expenditure program. With the shift to budget support by the donors for key sector programs
(health, education, decentralization), inpart representing additional external financing to Mali and
including the proposed EPPFMC financing, the 2006 program i s fully financed.

2.15      Debt Sustainability. At enhanced HIPC completion point (March 2003) Mali's net present
value (NPV) o f debt-to-export ratio was reduced below the 150percent threshold and projected to
remain below the threshold throughout the 20 year projection horizon. A joint IMF-World Bank
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) (attached at Annex 9) shows that external debt sustainability i s
broadly achieved under baseline projections in relation to the policy dependent debt burden
thresholds.8 Thus under the IDA 14 criteria Mali i s a "green light" country, receiving its entire
allocation inthe form o f credits rather than grants. Adverse external and internal shocks, however,
could result in breaching the thresholds over the medium term, despite implementation o f sound
macroeconomic policies and prudent debt management. Accordingly, Mali i s assessedas having a
moderate risk o f debt distress. Further multilateral debt relief under the G8 initiative (MDRI) is
estimated to reduce Mali's nominal debt and debt service by half in the medium term, but would
approach the indicator level inthe baseline over the long term. Thus while the risk o f debt distress
in the MDRI scenario is low over the medium term, it returns toward the moderate risk level
assessed in the baseline. Table 2.3 summarizes the debt indicators prior to and post MDRIat the
end o f2006.

Poverty Dynamics and the MDGs

2.16     Poverty has clearly fallen in Mali irrespective o f the methodology used. Two surveys were
to estimate the measures o f poverty in Table 2.4: the Enqukte Budget Consommation (EBC) for
198811989 and the Engukte Malienne sur 1'Evaluation de la Pauvretk (EMEP) for 2001.

         Poverty levels and trend:        Table 2.4 suggests that according to the food energy intake
         method applied by DNS19,the share o f the population inpoverty inMali in 2001 was 68.3
         percent, a decrease o f about four percentage points versus the level observed in 1989. With
         the cost o f basic needs method" the share o f the population in poverty in 2001 i s lower, at
         56.5 percent, and the decline versus 1989 i s somewhat larger, at around 7 percentage points.
         The share o f the population declaring having difficulties to meet food needs correlates with
         the poverty level.

         Geowaphic location: As expected, poverty i s much higher in rural than in urban areas.
         There are also large differences between regions, and one surprise in this respect-the
         Sikasso area appears to be very poor. This i s surprising given that the region benefits from
         better climatic conditions than other areas which permit, among many other crops, the
         cultivation of cotton. One hypothesis for this outcome i s that the region may be attractive
         for migrants, thereby resulting in population inflows that reduce standards o f living per
         capita. Also, at least in2001, cotton prices were low and cotton farmers produced less than
         inprevious and subsequent years, which may have resulted inhigher poverty inthat year.
         Still, the situation o f Sikasso warrants further investigation, especially considering that
         according to the subjective poverty indicator presented in Table 2.4, households seem to be
         better able to meet food needs there than in other regions (but again, research has shown
         that child malnutrition rates in the Sikasso region are relatively high, which adds to the
         puzzle).

 Under this methodology, households not meeting minimum daily nutritional requirement o f 2450 kilo-calories a day
are considered poor.
loThis method which estimates the price of a bundle o f goods that meets pre-determined basic needs, is itselfbased on
a caloric requirement.

2.17    The reduction in poverty has been larger since the 1994 devaluation than during the 1990s
as a whole. Table 2.5 provides estimates o f poverty and inequality using per capita consumption
data from the 1994 EnquEte Malienne de Conjoncture Economique et Sociale (EMCES) and the
2001 EMEP. These estimates are based on the cost o f basic needs method. In addition, measures
of asset-based poverty are provided on the basis o f the 1996 and 2001 Demographic and Health
Surveys."     The first row in Table 2.5 suggests a decrease in poverty o f close to 15 percentage
points between 1994 and 2001, which i s due in part to an apparent decrease in inequality. The
second row shows the expected decline in poverty since 1994, solely on the basis o f growth
observed inthe National Accounts and assuming no change ininequality. Inthis case, the share o f
the population in poverty decreases by more than 11 percentage points. Finally, the asset-based
measures o f poverty inthe last row also suggests a decline ininequality and a reduction o f poverty
o f about 12 percentage points, which is again large. Data on household assets tend to confirm a
general improvement instandards o f living.

2.18     Despite rapid progress since the devaluation, it will still be difficult to achieve the MDG
target o f reducing poverty by half in 2015 versus the 1990 baseline. As noted in the November
2004 report Rapport de suivi de la mise en oeuvre des Objectlfs du Millknaire pour le
Dkveloppement (OMD) prepared with support from UNDP, the rate o fprogress inreducing poverty
since the early 1990s i s insufficient to reduce poverty by half in 2015, and it i s unclear whether
Mali will be able in future years to reap similar benefits as those obtained since the 1994
devaluation. In rural areas, faster poverty reduction will require improving productivity,
diversifying rural activities, breaking the isolation o f certain production areas, and developing
commercial trade. In urban areas, the focus should be on promoting earnings and creating
employment, among others through good governance and higher productivity inthe private sector.
Poverty reduction also requires the reinforcement o f social networks supporting the most
vulnerable and attacking social exclusion. The magnitude o f the challenge represented by poverty
can be illustrated with the following statistics: in 2001, according to the DNSI method for
estimating poverty, the cost of eradicating poverty (i.e. the value o f a transfer ensuring that all
households have a level of consumption at least equal the poverty line) has been estimated as CFAF
462.5 billion in 2001 (US$873 million), or 32 percent o f the total consumption o f the private
households. Further information on progress toward the MDGs i s inAnnex 8.




"There, themethodologyentailspoolingtogether datafromthetwo DHSinordertouseacommonweightingsystem
to construct an asset index. Because asset ownership i s much higher inurban than inrural areas, we construct separate
indices for each, and use an asset-base poverty line that provides levels o f poverty in urban and rural areas similar to
those observed using per capita consumption in the 2001 EMEP. National poverty measures are obtained by pooling
together the urban and rural DHS data and rescaling the latter by the ratio o f the urban and rural asset poverty lines.

                              3.     THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

3.1     The Malian Government development and poverty reduction program for 2002-06 has been
presentedin its full PRSF, which was endorsed by the Bank and the FundBoards and is supported
by the donor community. Mali's economic development and poverty reduction strategy rests on
four pillars: (i)accelerating shared, private-sector led growth (the pre-requisite pillar); (ii)
strengthening institutions, governance and participation; (iii)developing human resources and
access to basic services; and (iv) strengthening basic infrastructure and productive economic
activities. The proposed operation directly supports the first, second and fourth pillars o f the PRSF
and, by helping promote growth and strengthen expenditure execution, it supports poverty
reduction and social objectives. The proposed operation's selectivity and limited scope builds on
the lessons o f Bank involvement in stressing advantages o f flexible, graduated operations with
simpler, robust design closely aligned with Mali's priorities.


                                 PRSFIMPLEMENTATIONIN2003-2005

3.2     Mali is nearing the end o f implementing its May 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)
covering the period 2002-2006. The PRSF represents the Government's unified framework o f its
medium term policies and strategies and is the main document for alignment and harmonization
with the donors. A progress report was prepared summarizing achievements in the first year o f
implementation (2002-03) and outlining policy objectives for 2004-06. The report was subject to
regional consultations prior to its validation by a workshop comprising, representatives of the
Government, civil society, the private sector, and the donor community. The second progress
report, covering PRS implementation during 2003-2004, was recently completed and adopted by
the Council o f Ministers.

3.3     To date Mali has made satisfactoryprogress towards these PRSF objectives.

    e   First pillar: macroeconomic stability for accelerated shared growth. Mali has been
        maintaining a stable macro environment with the consumer price index declining by 1.3 and
        3 percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively, reflecting a decline in food prices following an
        exceptional cereal production in those years. The overall fiscal deficit, on a payment order
        basis and excluding grants, was reduced to 5.1 percent o f GDP in 2003 compared with 7.3
        percent in 2002, and was largely covered by foreign financing. The projected deficit for
        2004 is 8.8 percent o f GDP. Mali's economic situation improved significantly in 2003 in
        spite o f the crisis in CBte d'Ivoire: real GDP growth was 7.4 percent in2003 compared with
        4.3 percent in 2002. However, reflecting unfavorable external conditions (highprice o f oil,
        locust infestation), Mali's performance deteriorated in2004, with a projected growth rate o f
        only 2.3 percent.

    e    The second strategic pillar: institutional capacity building. The Malian authorities have
        undertakenmajor administrative and institutional reforms inthis area. These reforms aim to
        ensure a good management o f public affairs, social peace and stability without which no
        sustainable development action i s possible. They include: (i)improvement o f the
        performance o f public administration;          (ii)continuation of the decentralization,`
        deconcentration process; and (iii)    improvement o f the management of public expenditures,
        rehabilitationofjustice, fight against corruption and financial delinquency.

0 The thirdpillar: sustainable human development and access to basic social services.

     >   With regard to the health and population component, objectives for 2002-03 have
        been satisfactorily attained, notably with respect to the extension o f health coverage
         andthe organization o fthe referral system. However, further efforts need to be made
         on vaccination, prenatal, and childbirth indicators. Moreover, despite the availability
         o f HIPC resources, the share o f health in the current expenditure o f the central
         government budget i s increasing too slowly. To improve the efficiency and coverage
         inthe health sector, the MinistryofHealthis focusing on: (i)        increased vaccination
         rates throughout the country; (ii)   improving the quality o f services, with the creation
         o f a national Agency for Evaluating Hospital Services in 2002; and (iii)        working
         more closely with the private sector to harness this potential, since the poor do make
         extensive use o f private services. Regarding the population subcomponent, the
         Government adopted in April 2003 the updated National Population Policy (NPP),
         the overall objective o f which i s to contribute to the improvement o f the standard
         and quality o fpeople's lives.

     >   Concerning the       education     and literacy    component, the preparation and
         implementation o f the ten-year Education Development Program (PRODEC) has
         been speeded up with the effective start-up of the Investment Program o f the
         Education Sectorjointly financedbythe Central Government and donors. Moreover,
         the development o f a MTEF for the Education Sector will increase the capacity o f
         PRODEC to meet the PRSF and MDG targets. In particular, the objective o f 64.0
         percent o f gross schooling rate (GSR) in the first cycle in 2002 has been achieved
         and slightly exceeded (64.3 percent). It is likewise for the GSR o f girls: 53.7 percent
         achieved as against 52.0 percent targeted. Inaddition, significant efforts have been
         made in improving budget allocations to the education sector, which have permitted
         the accelerated implementation o f PRODEC through the building o f classroom and
         recruitment o f contractual teachers, notably with resources from the enhanced HIPC
         Initiative. However, there is the persistence o f the low quality o f the Malian
         educational system despite the improvement o f the pupil-teacher ratio, and
         inadequate numbers o f classrooms and teachers inthe Teacher Training Institute. As
         a result, the objective o frecruiting and training 2,500 teachers was not reached.

     k With respect to drinking water and sanitation component, important institutional
         reforms and actions were conducted in2002 and 2003, allowing better identification
         o f the difficulties inherent to this sector including, among others, delay in the
         transfer o f responsibilities skills, and the number o f entities intervening inthe sector
         with different strategies.


0 Thefourth pillar: development of basic infrastructure and support toproductive sectors.
  This pillar aims at improving the economic environment and profitability o f factors o f
  production with the view o f attracting investment, creating jobs, increasing revenues,
  accumulating wealth, and reducingpoverty.

     >   With respect to transportation infrastructure, institutional reforms have been
         undertaken in order to improve connections within the country and with the outside


                                               11

              world and facilitate the movement o f people and goods. Regarding airport
              infrastructures, the Government i s committed to concessioning the operations o f the
              Bamako Airport. Operations o f the Mali-Dakar railway has been successfully
              concessioned. Performance o f the railway has already improved and will continue to
              do so as improvements are made to the tracks, rail stock, and quality and safety o f
              rail services.

          P Concerning telecommunications, Mali's 1 per 100 persons ratio of telephone
              penetration i s particularly low compared to other countries in the region. Moreover,
              telecommunications services are unequally distributed over the national territory,
              and basic communication tariffs are high reflecting the monopolistic structure o f
              supply. To address these issues, the authorities preparing the national telecom
              company for privatizationto be completed inthe course of 2006.

          k Inthe energy sector,progress hasbeenmadeinincreasing thenationalrateofaccess
              to electricity from 9.3 percent in 2001 to 14 percent in2004. Inaddition, the Malian
              Agency for the Development o f Rural Electrification and Domestic Energy
              (AMADER)was created.

           P To.support productive sectors, the authorities emphasize the development o f the
              rural sector with the adoption of the Government Program for the Development of
              50,000 Irrigated Hectares between 2003 and 2007. Restructuring o f the cotton
               sector, however, i s taking a longer time than anticipated. The authorities have
              delayed the CMDT privatization and are inthe process o f reflecting on the pace and
              scope o f cotton sector restructuring in light o f prevailing world market conditions.
               Considerable efforts are also underway in the fields o f equipment and credit to
              producers, the development o f other agricultural products, the promotion and
               extension o f the results o f agricultural research in order to achieve food security and
               self-sufficiency.


              4.      BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY



4.1    The Bank's CAS (July 2003) emphasizes support for the PRSF and improved public
resource management for reducing poverty. The Bank's CAS is designed to support the
implementation o f the PRSF in complement to interventions o f other donors. The CAS selectively
focuses on the following three keythemes:

   0   Promoting growth by combining policy support through adjustment (and subsequently,
       development policy) operations, with an approach o f increasing agricultural productivity
       and diversification through rural sector operations and non-rural growth driven by the
       private sector. This corresponds to the 1" and 4thPRSF pillars.


   0   Developing human resources by working with donors to strengthen programmatic
       approaches inthe health and education sectors. This corresponds with the 2"d PRSF pillar.



                                                    12

       Improving public finance management and governance by focusing on public sector
        financial accountability mechanisms covering public expenditure, procurement, and
        financial management systems. This corresponds to the 1'' PRSF pillar.

4.2     Mali is currently in the CAS base-casescenario andthe key instrumentsof the CAS in
support of these themes were the following: (i)         support via Structural Adjustment Credits
(SACs); (ii)   community driven development operations supporting productive sectors and fight
against HlV/AIDS; and (iii)  traditional investment operations targeting specific needs in transport
and private sector development to enhance the competitiveness o fMali's economy. The Mali SACs
I11 and lV, therefore, represented a central instrument o f the on-going CAS to support the
macroeconomic stability and public sector management. SAC lV provided broad budget support
for strengthening fiscal discipline and public expenditure management, and laying foundation for
stronger financial sector. Another Bank lendingoperation focused on the more sector-specific rural
development agenda (e.g., innovation, irrigation, improvement o f agricultural supply chain etc.).

4.3     DuringCAS implementation, the SACs became annual singletranche operations, insteado f
multi-tranche operations-thus,    the SAC IV (originally programmed in the CAS as a $55 million
operation covering a two year policy horizon) was turned into the one tranche SAC IV o f $25
million that was approved by the Board in March 2005, and the one tranche EPPFMC o f $25
million. The EPPFMC i s part o f the base case lending scenario o f annual modest budget support
operations. Its thematic coverage i s also relatively modest, focusing on policy and institutional
issues in macro, public finance and selected sector areas instead o f also incorporating broad sector
programs. It complements with self-standing sector investment operations covering, respectively,
health, education, rural infrastructure, agricultural competitiveness, support to growth, and
transport corridors. Transition to a medium term framework will be addressed in the upcoming
CAS exercise and possible programmatic PRSCs in the future, and inclusion in EPPFMC o f a
trigger for the next operation linkedto the privatization o f the cotton ginning company (CMDT) by
2008.

4.4     Based on the past record, the borrower's commitment to and ownership o f reforms i s
deemed adequate, but slow progress on cotton sector reforms with high risk implications for
macroeconomic stability has kept the country from accessing larger volumes o f policy-based
lending assured over a multi-year period.       With the satisfactory implementation o f the new
producer price setting mechanism resulting inreduction in budgetary risk o f the sector under SAC
IV and EPPFMC, as well as adoption of a cotton sector reform program and action plan, the
possibility o f a multi-year series o f policy-based operations i s potentially within sight. Mali's
ownership o f its reforms i s reflected in the track record under the third and fourth SACs, the
ongoing IMF-supported PRGF program, and implementation of the PRSF. Under SAC III,           Mali in
the past four years made solid improvements inpublic expenditure management (as this component
was rated highly satisfactory by the ICR) and also satisfactorily managed the cotton crisis o f 2001.
Nonetheless, the structural agenda is unfinished:     while implementation o f the cotton producer
price mechanism has reduced the risk from fluctuating international cotton prices, there is a need to
deepen the reform agenda in that sector. There i s also a need to implement policy reforms that
support the structural reform agenda incotton and other growth-inducing sectors.

                      COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

4.5      The Bank closely coordinated the work o f the SAC N and the EPPFMC with the IMFteam
and other bilateral partners, especially in the area o f macroeconomic and fiscal management and
financial sector reform. This i s in line with intensifylng efforts to establish a unified framework for
budget support in2006. Following an IMF-supported PRGF which expired in2003, the authorities
reached an agreement on a new PRGF which was approved by the Fund Board in June 2004,
comprising revenue mobilization, prioritizing expenditures, and supporting sustainable growth
through faster human capital accumulation and private sector development, including via
privatizations in the key sectors o f cotton and telecommunications. The first PRGF review was
concluded in March 2005, and the second and third reviews o f the program was concluded in
December 2005. The Bank and the Fund coordinate closely on the macroeconomic and structural
policy dialogue: for example, under the agreement with the Bank and the IMF, priority poverty-
reducing budgetary expenditures will be protected as long as the program remains on track and
sufficient external assistance i s secured. Other areas o f collaboration with the Fund are detailed in
Annex 5.    As regards cotton reforms, the Bank has shared views and collaborated closely with
development partners including AFD, France, EU, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, U SAID.

4.6      Regarding FSD, while bank is the only player in the banking, insurance and pension
sectors; however, many partners are involved in the microfinance area. With the Bank playing a
key role, several donors participated in the elaboration o f the action plan for microfinance 2005-
2008 which was adopted inApril 2005 by the Council o f Ministers. They also agreed to fund some
o f these activities. USAID i s implementing a financial sector project. The World Bank i s placing
the emphasis on regulatory issues. On Irrigation, the Bank works very closely with O N donors'
coordination unit. This coordination unit is comprised of all O N donors: AFD, The World Bank,
the Netherlands, the European Union, USAID, KFW. The Contrat Plan (CP) or performance
contract for 2005-2007 intends that all donors will position their activities around objectives of the
CP and those of the development guidelines o f ON area.                A guiding Charter for donors'
interventions inON area i s under preparation. On PSD, consultations were heldwith other donors,
primarily U SAID, the Millenium Challenge Corporation and the European Union during
preparation o f the proposed operation. France, Sweden and Switzerland support private sector
associations (notably the two umbrella organization o f artisans), and the Africa Capacity Building
Foundation provides support to the Chamber o f Commerce.

Regarding Transport and trade facilitation:

4.7      The Bank i s closely coordinating with the other donors involved in road maintenance and
road transit in Mali and in the region. Preparation o f the regional road transport and transit
facilitation program was launched during a regional workshop organized in Accra in November
2003. All West African countries, the two regional economic institutions, representatives from the
private sector and from six donors attended the workshop. Joint missions to prepare the program
were carried out with the African Development Bank (ADB) in April 2004, July 2004 and May
2005. These missions concluded, in consultation with the regional institutions, that the most
efficient contribution from the Bank to the program would be to complement the project approved
bythe ADB inNovember 2003 to improve road transit conditions on the Ghana-Burkina Faso-Mali
corridor. The World Bank i s preparing simultaneously with the African Development Bank similar
operations on the Abidjan-Lagos and Cotonou-Niamey corridors.


                                                    14

4.8     The Bank i s also closely coordinating with the European Union (EU) which is preparing its
own contribution to the regional program. Inthis respect, EUi s providing support to the Economic
Community o f West Afncan States through the set-up o f a dedicated unit to help prepare and
implement the program. EU will focus on support to the implementation o f structural reforms,
capacity building and will limit the investment portion o f its contribution to the construction of
joint border posts. EU i s also involved in the countries through its country,projects. In Mali, EU
provides support for the construction o f weighing stations and road toll stations to control
overloading of trucks and generateresources for road maintenance.

4.9     The EPPFMC complements other Bank operations in agriculture, financial sector, private
sector, infrastructure and transportation with a focus on policies critical to the successful outcomes
in the respective sectors. For cotton, the other Bank operations in the rural sector (PASAOP,
PACR and PCDA) are flexible enough to be positioned to support broader cotton sector reforms
once adopted by the Government. PASAOP i s more focused on producers' capacity building and
support to soil rehabilitation, improvement o f farm-level productivity; PCDA focuses on enhancing
value added of agricultural sub-sectors and PACR on collective support to communities. The
financial sector development project (PDSF) accompanies the Government reform program inthe
banking, insurance, microfinance and social security sectors. It supports all the actions that are part
of the EPPFMC. (Privatization o f BIM, split o f CAS/SFD, audit o f non performing portfolio o f
commercial banks, studies on the domiciliation o f insurance policies and on leasing companies,
 study on Government debt to INPS and actuarial studies o f INPS and CRM). The sources o f
 growth project and the agricultural competitiveness development project have also some financial
 sector elements;    for example, the former supports the delivery o f services (including partial
 guarantees) to facilitate SME financing.

 4.10   Regarding the private sector, this operation complements activities under the Growth
 Support Project (FY05). For irrigation, this operation complements the rural infrastructure
 investment project (PNIR) which is itself complemented by the other rural operations mentioned
 above in terms o f producers' capacity building, sub-sector valorisation and financial and technical
 support to communities.

 4.11   As regards transport and trade facilitation, the operation complements the on-going
 Transport Corridor Improvement Project under which resources allocations to, and financing of,
 road maintenance i s monitored. The operation also complements the Regional Road Transport and
 Transit Program under preparation with the regional economic institutions and the countries o f
 West Africa, and scheduled'for Board presentation in December 2006. The objective o f the
 program i s to increase competition among more efficient transport corridors in West Africa to
 boost internal and external regional trade, a recognized vector o f economic growth and
 subsequently poverty reduction. In a first   phase, the program will concentrate on the Ghana-
 Burkina Faso-Mali corridor. It will provide the resources which will finance the investments
 necessary to implement the structural reforms. The program will include the following key
 elements:

    0   regional level: Streamlining and harmonization of road transport and transit regulation and
        procedures (implementation of Inter-State Road Transit guarantee system (ISRT),
        harmonization o f axle load and technical vehicle control regulation, removal o f bilateral

        agreements on road freight allocation, capacity building (support to regional facilitation
        committee and regional institutions);

   e    corridor level: Facilitation o f transit (construction o fjoint border posts and improvement o f
        transit procedures) and improvement o f information systems (monitoring o f corridor
        performance, electronic cargo tracking systems, electronic securitization o f ISRT transit
        documents); and,

   e    country level: Improvement o f road infrastructure (long term performance based
        management contracts, truck stations and rest areas) and associated telecommunication
        system, improvement o f port security, benefits for corridor neighboring population (road
        safety, environment, HIV /AIDS), capacity building (support to national facilitation
        committees and administrations, consultationwith stakeholders).


                                           LESSONSLEARNED

4.12    The EPPFMC benefits from lessons learned in implementingrecent policy-based lending.
Thematic coverage o f those operations (SACS I11and N)form a subset o f those pursued under the
EPPFMC. As such, lessons from those operations are particularly pertinent. The SAC 111(which
was approved in December 2001) supported two areas o f reforms that were critical for poverty
reduction in Mali: (i)  restructuring o f the cotton sector to enhance efficiency and support growth;
and (ii)reform o fpublic expenditure management to improve efficiency and transparency o fbudget
management for poverty reduction. According to the ICR (which was endorsed by the OED) the
Credit broadly achieved its objectives with respect to macroeconomic performance, and to a
significant extent in public expenditure management. The cotton sector reform, however, was less
successful, especially with regard to adhering to the timetable for privatization o f the cotton
company and limitingthe fiscal risks to the budget.

4.13    The EPPFMC incorporates the following lessons identified inthe ICR (FY04) for the SAC
III:

    e   Development policy operations focusing on a limited structural reform agenda are more
        likely to succeed than ambitious or complex operations in countries with weak institutional
        and administrative capacity;

    e   Restructuring and/or privatization o f state-owned enterprises (e.g. cotton) should be planned
        over the mediumterm rather than short-term periods; the focus should be on best practice in
        privatization; and single adjustment operations may not be the best way o f achieving
        specific privatization objectives;

    e   Effective coordination with the IMF and other donors i s critical; and,

    e   Ensuringthat key implementinginstitutions have adequateresources (e.g., provision o f TA)
        i s important for implementation.

4.14    The SAC IV continued the SAC It1reform agenda with a slight expansion on growth-
oriented measures in the financial and irrigation sectors, as identified in the context o f ongoing
operations in the respective sectors-the      Financial Sector Development Project (a TA operation)


                                                     16

and the National Rural Infrastructure Project (an investment operation). SAC lV achievements in
those sectors-rated      satisfactory in the Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) o f the Bank's Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) in August 2005-demonstrated the merits o f including in policy-based
lendingoperation, policies and institutional measures complementary to and supportive o f ongoing
sector operations. The EPPFMC deepens this practice in the financial and irrigation sectors and
adding other growth-oriented policies in transport, trade facilitation and private sectors that
complement investment operations inthe respective sectors.

4.15      Deepeningo f the growth-oriented agenda under EPPFMC addresses the QEA's concern of
the need for strengthened structural, financial and macroeconomic aspects in the SAC IV.
EPPFMC thus draws from various diagnostic reports including the Bank's 1997 IDF to assist Mali
in assessing constraints to growth and formulate a growth strategy12,the FY04 ESW on Transport
Support to Sustainable Economic Growth, the FY04 Integrated Framework Trade Diagnostic
Report ("Expanding and Diversifying Trade for Growth and Poverty Reduction"), a report
assessing factors underlyingsuccess o f Mali's imgation reforms13, andbackgroundreport under the
Mali Country Economic Memorandum on Growth (forthcoming FY06).                               The EPPFMC sector
coverage inthe growth agenda i s strategically selective, incorporating measures on which dialogue
with the authorities on the needed reforms is established. Thus at least one sector, energy, was not
includedunder EPPFMC despite its importance for Mali's growth, because the sector dialogue was
in a state o f flux due to ongoing contract renegotiations between the Government and the private-
sector managers o f the energy utility c~mpany.'~Under the next operation, it i s envisioned to
deepen the growth agenda further, and possibly expand it into additional sectors (such as energy) if
the nature o f the dialogue on those sectors i s sufficiently developed.


                                        ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

4.16      The EPPFMC benefits from a number o fpieces o f analytical and fiduciary work undertaken
by the Bank and in some cases by the Government and other partners. These are summarized in
Table 4.1. First and foremost, a considerable analytical effort has been conducted in assessing the
effectiveness of public spending in Mali, including a CFAA, CPAR, the WB/IMF HIPC AAP
report, an IMF ROSC, an EU audit o f reform implementation to improve public finance
management procedures, and a study on implementing the decentralization policy based on two
pilot regions. These helped identify the strengths and main shortcomings in Mali's fiduciary
system, and helped the authorities prepare two key action plans for reforms that integrate the
various studies-one on public finance management (the Government Action Plan for Modernizing
and Strengthening Public Finance Management 2006-2008), and the other the Institutional
Development Program to support implementation o f the decentralization policy). These action

The concession contract between the international strategic partner and the government collapsed in October 2005,
After about 18 months o f contract renegotiations, the mainstrategic investor in the energy utility decided to pull out o f
the company leaving the government with a 66% majority stake in the company along with a minor private sector
partner, and with critical supply and financing issues to be resolved in the short term in order to clarify the sector
 strategy going forward.

plans, now supported by all donors, are key instruments in toward increased donor harmonization
inMali. Technical assistance to Mali for development o f its sector medium term frameworks for
health, education, and transport, as well as informal reviews of Mali's government-wide medium
term budget framework, underpinthe MTEF proposals inthe EPPFMC.

4.17    The underpinnings to the growth component stem from a series o f studies to identify
sources o f growth and refine the growth strategy. In 1997 the Bank approved an IDF grant to assist
Mali in diagnostic work toward formulating a long term growth strategy. That IDF resulted in a
government-issued 2010 Growth and Development Proposal, which underpinned the 1998 CAS
and the subsequent support to Mali. The proposalreoriented government activity and Bank support
toward structural constraints (e.g., judicial/regulatory environment for business, weakly organized
economic activity), constraints with infrastructure and infrastructure services (transportation,
telecommunications, energy, irrigation), constraints to priority producing sectors (agriculture and
rural development, industry, mining, tourism), human resource development needs (education,
health), and constraints to other private sector supporting activities (financial sector development).
Subsequent studies that have deepened the knowledge base and sector strategies have been
conducted inthe context of project preparation and/or implementation (of primary relevance to the
EPPFMC are studies under the financial sector development TA project, the agricultural
competitiveness     and diversification    project,   and national rural infrastructure project).
Documentation o f Bank-supported irrigation reform success factors inAw and Diemer (2005) that
underpin an aspect o f the EPPFMC program, highlight the critical importance o f irrigation in
overcoming vulnerability to climate shocks and enhancing food security in Mali. Those reforms
enabled dramatic sustained increases in rice productivity (from 1-2 tons per hectare in 1980 to 5-6
tonsiha in late 1990s) during a period when productivity o f other crops (including cotton) stagnated
or declined.

4.18    A recent supply chain analysis o f the textilelgarments, leathenvork and handicraft sectors
conducted under the growth support project, an InvestmentClimate Assessment (FY05) highlighted
concrete micro-level constraints to Mali's growth, including regulatory and non-price barriers that
increase the time and monetary costs o f doing business. An integrated trade diagnostic study
completed in 2004 also highlighted micro-level constraints in addition to cross cutting constraints
stemming from the transport, trade facilitation and finance sectors. These studies, which have
underpinned discussions at the President's Investor Council consultations (conducted bi-annually
since September 2004), have laid the foundations for strengthened government commitment to
improve the investment climate and remove other unnecessary impediments to private sector
growth. A Country Economic Memorandum on growth (forthcoming FY06) builds on these
findings with the purpose o f aiding Mali articulate an integrated growth strategy combining micro-
and macro-level dimensions in a consistent framework. Background studies under the CEM
underpin aspects of the EPPFMC program (notably growth performance study and transport and
trade facilitation).

                                     OPERATIONDESCRIPTION


The Contextof the EPPFMC

5.1    The EPPFMC would be the first annual program o f budget support for Mali's growth and
poverty reduction strategy and it meets the requirements o f OD8.60 o f appropriateness, country
ownership and commitment, and adequate financing. The EPPFMC would continue the SACSIII
and IV reform agenda and expand upon it in certain areas. However, moving to higher levels o f
support will require reducing the fiscal risk o f the cotton sector through improved sector financial
management, or eventual privatization o f the national cotton ginning company CMDT
(programmed completion date i s 2008). Progress on implementing the cotton sector reforms, and
the fiscal risk o f CMDT, will be closely monitored to determine the appropriate time to shift to a
three-year program o f support. The EPPFMC, to be disbursed ina single tranche o fUS$25 million
inthe first quarter of2006uponcredit effectiveness, comprises three components describedbelow.

5.2     As already mentioned, the 2003 CAS (July 2003) directly supports the four PRSF pillars
under various lending and non-lending instruments, and places particular emphasis on improved
resource management for achieving the poverty objectives.         The Government's commitment is
evident in their successful completion o f the reforms supported under SAC III(December 2001)
and SAC IV (March 2005), and by their request for a successor operation in aid o f next phase
reforms under its PRSF. Inthis respect, the borrower's commitment to and ownership o f reforms in
the proposed EPPFMC is deemed adequate. The EPPFMC together with resources pledgedbyother
donors, would ensure adequate financing o f Mali's reform program.             The Bank's positive
experience with structural adjustment in Mali has shown that policy-based lending i s an effective
mechanism o f support.

5.3     Expanding on the SAC 111and SAC IV programs, the EPPFMC, therefore, i s designed in
support to Mali's first, second and fourth PRSFpillars. Specifically, the EPPFMC aims to:

    (i)contributetogrowth andpovertyreductionthrough (a) strengtheningmacroeconomic
    and fiscal management; and (b) implementing key cross-sectoral policy reforms
    underpinning to long-term growth and competitiveness. Macroeconomic management would
    be strengthened through prudent expenditure management; greater linkage between the
    macroeconomic framework, the budget and the implementation o f the PRSF. This will de done
    by strengthening the global and sector mediumterm expenditure framework process; continued
    implementation o f cotton producer price mechanism to reduce risk o f budgetary transfers;
    commenced implementation of cotton sector reforms while ensuring close monitoring o f cotton
    sector financial position; and strengthened institutional framework in the Ministry o f Finance
    (MEF) for monitoring/coordination ofthe PRSFand the growth agenda.

    The growth support agenda would be strengthened through continued implementation o f
    financial sector development actions to strengthenthe health o f the sector and enhance access to
    finance particularly longer term funds; implementation o f key transport sector actions to



                                                   20

       improve quality and lower cost o f transportation services; and implementation o f trade
       facilitation measures to reduce processingltransactions costs o f trade.

       (ii)improve efficiency, accountability and transparency in public finance management
       through strengthening (a) public expenditure management at central and decentralized
       levels; and (b) thepublicprocurement system. Public expenditure management (PEM) would
       be strengthened through continuing the automation o f information flows between key MEF de-
       concentrated departments (notably, treasury, budget and financial control) to increase
       information quality and transparency, improving the quality o f published material on the
       financial and expenditure situation o f the Government to increase transparency; and continued
       improvements inPEM processes, particularly internal and external budget control mechanisms.

       Public procurement would be strengthened through adoption of a coherent action plan and
       commencing its implementation, comprising updating o f the legislative/regulatory framework,
       strengthening the linkages between public procurement and public finance management
       processes, and strengtheningthe private sector's access to public procurement opportunities.

  5.4      The prior actions for the Mali EPPFMC are listed in Box 5.1. They comprise a restricted
  set o f actions most critical to success o f the program. These closely match the triggers identified in
   SAC IV for the EPPFMC. Linkage o f the EPPFMC prior actions to the triggers identifies in the
   SAC IV operation are presented inAnnex 2.

    Box 5.1: Prior Actionsfor EconomicPolicyand PublicFinanceManagementPolicyto Mali

The government has agreed upon and implementedthe following prior actions before the presentation o f the credit
to the Executive Board:


     0   Maintain a prudent budget policy consistent with the agreed macroeconomic framework;.
     0   Adopt an overall logical framework for operationalizing and appropriating the medium term budget
         framework (MTBF) and medium term sector expenditure framework (MTEF), synchronized with the
         processing timelines for the macroeconomic framework, budget preparation cycle, and preparation o f the
         2007-20 1IPRSF;
     0   Adopt Terms o f reference for preparing the 2007-2011 PRSF, that integrates a work program for
         coordination o f the formulation and implementation o f an economic growth support strategy;
     0   Continue implementation of the cotton producer price setting mechanism with a view to limiting the state
         budgetary risk o f the national cotton ginningcompany CMDT;
     0   Re-constitute the Board o f Directors o f the Malian Housing Bank (Banque de Z'Habitat du Mali      -  BHM)
         with the addition o f three private sector specialists independent o f the shareholders; and canvass existing
         and potential new investors to invite them to participate inthe recapitalizationo f BHM; and,
     0   Establish the institutional framework for implementing the Government's action plan for modernization
         and improvement o fpublic finance management; define the mechanisms for its implementation, monitoring
         and evaluation; and inscribe resources inthe draft 2006 budget for the 2006 time slice o f the action plan.



   Benefits

   5.5     The proposed operation would support the Government in the pursuit o f its policy
   objectives laid out in the PRSF within a structure macroeconomic framework, by providing sound
   financing for execution o f the Government's 2005 budget. It would also provide the incentives to

implementkey economic, social and institutional reform to strengthen overall performance o f the
economy and contribute to poverty alleviation.           Implementation o f the EPPFMC program
contributes to strengthen public finance management, thereby enhancing efficiency and
effectiveness o f public sector spending. This includes strengthening governance and performance
of the procurement system. In agriculture, the operation would contribute to stabilizing the
performance o f the cotton sector and farmer incomes; and to laying the foundations for private
sector led expansion o f the OfJice du Niger (ON) imgation zone. The operation would also
contribute to enhancing the export prospects o f handicraft products (typically produced by small
informal sector firms) through removal o f the export assessment tax, thereby improving the
incomes o f the poor. It would also improve the investment climate by lowering the administrative
and financial cost o f starting a business, and strengthening property rights over land.

5.6     Over the medium term, the operation would contribute to reducing transportation costs by
ensuringregular roadmaintenance and lowering the cost burden(inmoney andtime) on the private
sector o f customs administration, and to increase agnculture growth and food security due to
expansion o f the ON area. It would lower the costs o f financial services (and therefore enhance
access to credit) through cleaning up non-performing loans from bank balance sheets. It would also
improve access to longer term resources vitally needed to stimulate private sector led growth,
through strengtheningthe prospects o f institutions with long term assets whether financial (pension
funds, housingbank, insurance companies) or physical (leasing companies).


                                   CREDIT AMOUNTANDTRANCHING

5.7     The one tranche in the amount o f SDR 17.3 million (US$25 million equivalent), will be
available for disbursement upon credit effectiveness. The credit will become effective upon due
authorization or ratification by all necessary legislative and governmental actions and IDA'Sreceipt
o f a legal opinion confirming that the Development Credit Agreement has been duly authorized or
ratified by, and executed and delivered on behalf of, the Borrower and i s legally binding upon the
Borrower in accordance with its terms.

5.8     The policies supported by the EPPFMC are outlined in the Letter o f Development Policy
(Annex 1) and policy matrix (Annex 3) under the following three components: (i)Strengthening
macroeconomic framework and budgetary policy; (ii)         Support to growth; and (iii) Strengthening
public expenditure management, transparency and verification procedures.

Strategy Framework

Description and Challenges

5.9     With the adoption o f its first National Poverty Reduction Strategy in 1998, the Government
commenced preparation o f annual Program Budgets (annexed to the Budget Law) aimed at linking
government programs to poverty reduction objectives and initiating a process o f results-oriented

                                                    22

budgeting.Following adoption o f second povertyreduction strategy comprising enhanced coverage
o f macroeconomic considerations (the Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework-PRSF)              in May
2002 (see paragraph 3.1), the Government intensified its efforts to translate the strategy into action
through integration o fthe PRSF into the Government's regular operations.

5.10    An indicator o f successful integration o f the PRSF is the extent to which programs funded
by the annual budgets reflect PRSF priorities toward achieving growth and poverty reduction
objectives. To this end the authorities aim to maintain prudent macroeconomic and budgetary
policies so as to ensure macroeconomic stability and foster growth. They have developed tools
over the past couple years to facilitate the translation o f the poverty reduction strategy into
expenditure terms: medium term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) were developed for the health
and education sectors;     an initial MTEF for the transportatiodpublic works Ministry was
constructed; and a medium term budgetary framework (MTBF) covering the entire government
was also developed to strengthen inter-sectoral resource allocation (Le., sector budget envelopes)
by the Economy and Finance Ministry, consistent with priorities o fthe PRSF. The annual Program
Budgets were strengthened progressively each year, and since 2003 they became medium term
documents covering three year periods instead o fjust one.

5.11 A consequence o f these developments i s that the Government now disposes o f several tools,
instruments and processes that are inadequately linked. This situation is problematic on three
levels, which hamper the Government's ability to consolidate its achievements o f the past in the
area o f macroeconomic management and budget policy. First, a major concern i s that the various
instruments(PRSF, MTEF, MTBF, ProgramBudget, BudgetLaw, macroeconomic framework) are
processed on somewhat separate timelines, with inadequate consideration for synchronizing those
timelines despite the fact that some instruments serve as inputs into others (e.g., the
macroeconomic framework feeds into the MTBF, which together are required for the sector MTEFs
and budget elaboration).     In addition, untimely availability andor updating of some of the
instruments (particularly the macroeconomic framework, MTBF, MTEF, PRSF implementation
status report, and annual expenditure reviews) relative to the budget preparation schedule weaken
their relevance to thebudgetpreparationandbudget management process. Inadequate incorporation
o f recommendations o f implementation status reports or o f expenditure reviews further aggravate
this situation.

5.12    Second, sector MTEFs that should serve as the analytical/simulation tools to support sector
ministry budget negotiations with the Ministry o f Economy and Finance, and underpin sector
program budget preparations, do not adequately live up to those expectations. Inreality, the sector
MTEFs are largely distinct from the Program Budget process (i.e., separate MTEF and Program
Budget documents are prepared), and the program budgets show minimal if any linkage with the
Budget Law to which it is annexed. Furthermore, the MTEFs (though used somewhat for budget
negotiations) are not adequately appropriated by the respective sector ministries neither for budget
preparation nor management/monitoring o f program implementation-indeed,               they currently
appear to beprepared largelyto satisfy donor conditionalities.

5.13    Third, gaps inthe PRSF-particularly     the absence o f a clear economic growth strategy and
action plan, despite growth being highlighted in the PRSF as a precondition for poverty
reduction-by     implication weaken the results-orientation o f the Government's expenditure
program.     In absence of a concrete growth strategy, the PRSF's reliance on macroeconomic
stability alone i s proving insufficient (as expected) for achieving the higher growth objectives

                                                   23

identified inthe PRSF (target o f 6.7 percent average during 2002-2006 relative to the actual annual
average o f 5.5 percent over the period 1994-2004).

Government Action to date

5.14    The Government has consistently maintained prudent macroeconomic policies in recent
years in partnership with the donor community, despite several exogenous shocks that risked
destabilizing the macroeconomic framework.       As part o f that effort the authorities established a
mechanism to minimize the risks o f cotton sector deficits and their potential impact on the budget
(as noted in paragraph 5.26, a tri-partite protocol was signed with farmer organizations and the
CMDT to regulate the setting of the cotton producer price in line with international market
developments). Taking into account the lessons drawn from implementation o f the PRSF,
preparation o f the 2005 Budget Law explicitly ensured consistency with the macroeconomic
framework while ensuring adequate resources were allocated to accelerate implementation o f the
PRSF, on the basis o f strategic sector budgetprogramming tools.

5.15    As regards strengthening of budget formulation, the Government fully operationalized the
medium term budget framework during 2004, leading to preparation of the 2005 Budget Law on
the basis o f three-year sector envelopes furnished by the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. Those
envelopes were on a sector basis rather than Ministry basis, providing insufficient information to
some ministries on the budgetary constraints they faced. The two existing sector MTEFs, while
perhaps not hlly appropriated by all the ministries concerned (health, education), are progressively
being used each year to prepare sector budget proposals and negotiate budget allocations with the
Economy and Finance Ministry, with favorable results.            The Health Ministry-particularly
advanced in appropriation o f its MTEF-established    mechanisms for systematic annual updating of
their MTEF for use during each new budget cycle, and for use as the financial framework for
preparing the 2"d phase of the ten-year sector development program (PRODESS). A third ministry
(transport and equipment) initiated development o f its MTEFwith Bank support.

5.16    The outcome o f the budget process during 2005 is a draft 2006 Budget Law reflecting
enhanced links with the poverty reduction strategy. Conscious o f the importance o f synchronizing
the PRSF with the budget, the Government has committed to prepare the PRSF implementation
status report and the second PRSF during 2005-2006 on a schedule linkedto the budget preparation
cycle, with a view to completing those documents by June 2006 inline with preparation o f the 2007
BudgetLaw.

5.17    As regards monitoring and evaluation(M&E), an M&E schedule for the PRSFwas adopted,
allowing the authorities to incorporate conclusions o f the evaluation of PRSF implementation into
the draft 2006 Budget Law. Also, the recently produced second evaluation report o f PRSF
implementation i s in process o f being adopted according to the M&E schedule. Additionally, the
current system of programming and monitoring o f public investments is being improved, to
facilitate its incorporation in the budget management process. A new software application was
developed and tested, and is in the process o f being installed to manage the Triennial Investment
Program and its annual component (the Special Investment Budget).

5.18     The authorities conducted an institutional audit o f the PRSF implementation process in
2004 and are committed to implementing the audit's findings, comprising reorganization o f the
PRSF Unit, enhancing the skills mix o f the Unit, and ensuringappropriate capacity building of the

                                                  24

institution. A Terms o f reference outlining the improvements has been prepared, and is being
discussed with the donor community prior to finalization and submission to the Council o f
Ministers for consideration and adoption.

Bank's assessment and Recommendation

5.19    As noted, the authorities make the concerted effort to implement prudent macroeconomic
policies in the face o f tight budgetary constraints and various unexpected exogenous shocks. The
Bank recommends continuation o f those efforts by the Government, including continued
implementationo f the cotton price setting mechanism, inclose dialogue with its external partners.

5.20    Institutional strengthening for coordinating and monitoring the PRSF process appropriately
reflects, as currently envisioned, the needs o f the current PRSF-it     i s based on the institutional
audit taking account o f the current PRSF. However, the institutional audit did not reflect what the
PRSF should be (based on the two previousjoint staff assessments o f the PRSF and PRSF progress
report). Indeed, as the current PRSF lacks a coherent growth strategy, the recommendations o f the
audit did not adequately take into account the need for strengthened coordination inthe PRSF Unit
of preparation and monitoring o f a growth strategy. Inview o f the imminent preparation o f the 2"d
PRSF in late 2005 to mid 2006, with implementation to commence January 2007, it is preferable
that the new institutional structure o f the PRSF Unit anticipates the content o f the new PRSF to the
extent possible. The Bank thus recommends that treatment o f growth strategy issues in the 2nd
PRSF Unit be strengthened, and that the new structure o f the PRSF Unit reflect the need for
appropriate skills mix to enable coordinating the preparation (and implementation monitoring) o f
the growth strategy.

Measures taken as part o f the proposed operation

5.21     Regarding Macroeconomic framework and budget policy, the specific actions in the
EPPFMC are part o f a mediumterm reform agenda emanating from the Government's Institutional
Development Program (PDI) and Governmental Action plan for Modernization and the
Strengthening o f Public Finance Management (PAG). O f particular importance is deepening the
results-based budgetingprocess through strengthening the links between various budget preparation
instruments (MTBF, sector MTEFs, program budgets), sector strategies and the PRSF. As a first
step the authorities will prepare a logical framework that rationalizes the content and
preparatiodupdating schedules o f those various instruments and strategies consistent with the
budget preparation cycle. The authorities will also update the MTBF, sector MTEFs (health,
education and transport), macroeconomic framework, in line with the final outcome o f the budget
arbitrage (the draft 2006 Budget Law) and the logical framework schedule. The following actions
are included inthe EPPFMC:

    0    Maintain a prudent budget policy consistent with the agreed macroeconomic framework;

    0    Update the projections for the Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) for 2006-2008,
         consistent with the macroeconomic framework;

    0    Produce an overview report presenting the draft 2006 Budgetthat discusses the consistency
         o f the budget with the macroeconomic framework for 2006-2008, with sector priorities
         defined in the PRSF, and with recommendations o f the 2003-2004 PRSF Implementation
         Progress Report;

                                                   25

   0    Adopt an overall logical framework for operationalizing and appropriatingthe mediumterm
        budget framework (MTBF) and sector medium term expenditure framework (MTEF),
        synchronized with the processing timelines for the macroeconomic framework, budget
        preparation cycle, and 2007-2011 PRSF preparation;

   0    Update the health sector medium-tern expenditure framework for 2006-2008, with the
        2006 tranche consistent with the Ministry's component o f the draft 2006 Budget. The
        MTEF should be consistent with (i) MTBF of the Economy and Finance Ministry, and
                                              the

   0    Update the education sector medium-tern expenditure framework for 2006-2008, with the
        2006 tranche consistent with the Ministry's component o f the draft 2006 Budget. The
        MTEF should be consistent with (i) MTBF o f the Economy and Finance Ministry, and
                                              the

            the

    0   Prepare the MTEF for the Equipment and Transport Ministry for 2006-2008 consistent with
        the MTBF.

5.22    Regarding Strengthened links between budget policy and the PRSF, the EPPFMC covers
the following three aspects: (i) institutional framework for implementation M&E; (ii)
                                   the                                                        linkage
with the donor harmonization process; and (iii)   improving the quality and credibility o f the PRSF.
The specific actions under the operation are as follows:

        Completion o f the 2003-2004 PRSF implementationprogress report;

        Adoption o f a Terms o f reference for preparing the 2007-2011 PRSF, that integrates the
        work required to coordinate the formulation and implementation o f an economic growth
        support strategy, and includes a work program and implementation schedule o f the various
        steps involved (e.g. surveys, participatory process, etc);

        Launching o f the preparation process for the 2007-2011 PRSF on the basis o f a defined
        implementation schedule;

1.C. Cotton Sector Reforms

Description and Challenges

5.24     Cotton cultivation and ginning for exports i s an important sector for Mali's economy whose
performance-vulnerable          to climatic, terms o f trade and exchange rate shocks in addition to
management quality o f the national ginning company and sector policy decisions-has                             direct
repercussions on the government budget in view o f the Government's 60 percent shareholding o f
the national cotton ginning company CMDT. The sector (cultivation and ginning combined)
accounts for about 7 percent o f GDP and about 30 percent o f export earnings, and involves about
30 percent o f Mali's population. Vulnerability o f the sector results inperiodic financial crises, the
latest one in 200415which i s beingmanaged inpart through budget support provided by the Bank
(under SAC IV) and other donors. The estimated deficit for the 2004-05 crop season i s CFAF 50.3
billion (US$ 93 million equivalent), o f which CFAF 28.5 billion i s provisioned for in the 2005
budget as a loan to the CMDT. The recurrence o f financial crises inthe sector is attributed inpart
to the sector's uncompetitive structure that i s dominated by a single ginning company that enjoys a
monopsony on cotton purchases from farmers and a monopoly on sales o f cotton fiber. Despite
these risks, it must be acknowledged that the current structure has facilitated the sector's rapid
development from cultivation o f 5000 tons o f cotton inthe 1960s to over 500,000 tons today.

5.25     Following the previous cotton sector financial crisis in 2000, the Bank supported the
Government in its adoption o f a reform strategy for cotton sector comprising improved financial
management in CMDT and partial privatization o f CMDT in the first phase o f reforms, and full
privatization CMDT in the subsequent phase.16 Following completion o f the first phase, however,
implementation o fthe reforms stalled in2004, and CMDT privatization was officially delayed from
2006 to 2008. At the same time, the authorities agreed to a highcotton producer price (CFAF 210
per kilogram versus CFAF 190 per kilogram in neighboring countries) based on incorrect
implementation o f the price mechanism at the time, which resulted in a ballooning sector deficit as
the internationalprice fell precipitously.

5.26     To resolve the immediate financial crisis in the sector from the 2004-05 crop season the
World Bank agreed, inconsultationwith other partners, to proceed with the SAC IV on the basis o f
(i)financingplanforCMDT'sdeficitand(ii)crediblereformoftheproducerpricemechanism.
    a                                                    a
The negotiation o f a new timetable for the privatization would be addressed through a dedicated


l5Other cotton sector crises were in 1986, 1991 and 2000.
l6The strategy, negotiated with all stakeholders inthe sector over a period of three years, was endorsed by the Council
of Ministers inNovember 2003 following completion o f the first phase cotton sector reform program. It aimed at the
creation of 3 or 4 new cotton ginning companies by sale of CMDT's existing assets to strategic private investors.

cotton sector dialogue with the authorities. InJanuary 2005, the Government, CMDT and farmer
organizations signed a new protocol for setting the cotton producer price. This included an agreed
range (applicable for three years) for the initial price set inApril each year based on the world price
trends, and the possibility o f an adjustment inAugust each year ifthere was a significant change in
the world price trend. Consistent with the protocol, Mali's cotton producer price setting committee
announced a price of CFAF 160 per kilogram for the 2005-06 crop season.

5.27     In the course of 2005, the CMDT announced it was near bankruptcy and scheduled an
Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting as required by WAEMU law (OHADA) to agree on
recapitalization or dissolution of the company. The Meeting, held in September 2005, reached a
decision to recapitalize the company. With only the Government participating in the
recapitalization (of CFAF 6 billion), the Government's share o f the company will increase to 75
percent and that o f the foreign shareholder DAGRIS falling to 25 percent. The near bankruptcy of
the CMDT underscores the dire situation Mali's cotton sector is facing, and that must be addressed
inthe mediumterm to safeguard the sector's performance and competitiveness into the future (see
Annex 10 for further information).

Government Action to date

5.28     As noted above, the Government signed a protocol defining an improved producer price
setting mechanism, together with the CMDT and farmer organizations, that i s to be in force until
CMDT's privatisation. A special feature o f the new price mechanism i s its objective to minimise
budget risks through setting the initial price in April each year within a conservative range (CFAF
160-175 per kilogram), reviewing price parameters in August for possible revision o f the producer
price depending on cotton market developments, and distributing the sector's gross (as opposed to
net) income to producers (60%) and the CMDT (40%). InJanuary 2005 the Government adopted
an updated timetable for cotton sector reforms with the objective o f supporting the funding o f
CMDT crop season campaigns, implementation o f support measures for CMDT privatisation, and
CMDT privatisation in 2008. To strengthen producers' ability to participate in sector decision
making, the authorities implemented an information awareness session with farmers on the content
o fthe validated proposals from the study on the producers' inter-professionalassociation.

5.29     The authorities also concluded the privatization o f the cottonseed oil company HUICOMA,
an action envisioned in 2002 under SAC IIIthat was not achievedI7 due inpart to adverse market
conditions linkedto the Cote d'Ivoire crisis which eventually soured investor interest.

Bank assessment and Recommendation

5.30     The Government's actions to correctly implementthe cotton producer price mechanism are
an important first step in stabilizing the performance o f the sector, thereby minimize the risk o f
deficits placing burden on the government budget. Inview o f the dire situation the sector faces, the
authorities should make progress on the broader cotton sector reforms. Medium term actions for
the sector are discussed inAnnex 10.

Measures taken as part o fthe proposed operation

5.31    The following actions are included under the EPPFMC: regarding the producer price
setting mechanism, continued implementationo f producer price determination for the 2005-06 crop
season; regarding monitoring o f CMDT management, transmission to the Bank o f the outcome o
the Extraordinary General Assembly o f CMDT shareholders; regarding farmers involvement, the
producers should designate their representatives for monitoring the CMDT privatization process
while waiting for the establishment o f the inter-professional association. The authorities also
finalized the strategy action plan for the privatizationo f CMDT.

Indicative triggers for the next operation

5.32     The policy matrix includes the actions under the next operation. Proposed triggers for the
next operation are as follows:

     0   Continued implementation o f the cotton producer price setting mechanism for the 2006-07
         crop season;

     0   Define the zones (3 or 4) to be privatized by end January 2006); adoption by the
         Government o f the final design o f the full privatization operational scheme (by end-
         September2006); and,

     0   Launchthe bids for the selection o fthe privatization advisor (by July 2006).

2. Support to Growth

5.33     Under SAC IV selected growth-related measures were introduced into the development
policy dialogue, based on existing analytical work, with the intension o f expanding the growth
component into other sector as updated analysis became available and if those actions were not
already covered under existing operations.         The growth measures under SAC IV comprised
financial sector measures emanating from extensive analytical work conducted under the financial
sector development TA project (FYOO), and irrigation measures complementing the investment
program underthe national rural infrastructure project (FYOO).

5.34     The EPPFMC follows up on the SAC IV financial and irrigation sector program, and
includes measures relative to transportation and private sector development based on the integrated
trade diagnostic study, the findings o f the transport background study to the growth CEM, the
investment climate assessment (FY05) and the supply chain analysis undertakenduringpreparation
of the growth support project (FY05). As evident by the preliminary results o f the C E M growth
analysis (Box 5.2), key driving forces o f Mali's growth over the last decade were the private sector
(gold mining, other industry, services), transport activities, irrigation reforms enablingproductivity
increases in rice, and financial sector development enhancing overall efficiency o f private sector
investment. Selection o f these policy areas under the EPPFMC growth component rests on the fact
that further reforms are needed to strengthentheir contributionto Mali's medium term growth. The
next sections discuss the policy issues in each o f these four sectors-financial     sector, transport,
private sector, and irrigation.

                                      Box 5.2: Growth determinantsin Mali


 Mali's average growth has improved dramatically over the past twenty years, and its volatility has also dropped
 significantly (Table 1). This performance, a result o f steady market-oriented reforms, today puts Mali among the top three
 highest performing WAEMU countries. Mali's GDP growth has improved from -1.3 percent on average during 1980-1986
 (early days o f the reform from socialist to market oriented system), to zero on average during 1987-1993 (implementation
 of agricultural cereal marketing liberalization), and to 5.7 percent on average during 1994-2004 following the devaluation
 o f the CFAF in 1994. Growth since 1994 has been driven by industry (10.5 percent growth) and services (6.3 percent),
 dramatically over-performing agriculture growth (2.6 percent). Furthermore, the contribution of industry and services to
 GDP growth (40 percent each) has dominated agnculture's contribution to growth (20 percent), despite agriculture's larger
 share in the economy (Table 2) and presumed comparative advantage. A puzzle i s the fact that agriculture growth after the
 devaluation (2.6 percent) was lower than it was inthe period before the devaluation (3.5 percent).

 Industry growth has been fueled largely by the dramatic expansion o f gold production and exports after 1998, in response
 to a revision o f the mining code. Services growth has been in trade and transport sub-sectors, activities accompanying the
 export expansion in gold and cotton as well as growth in other sectors such as rice. Growth o f agnculture stemmed from
 expansion o f rice production (7.8 percent) for domestic consumption and cotton (4.5 percent) for export. O f note is that
 rice sector growth stemmed largely from productivity increases in response to sector reforms, while cotton sector growth
 was due exclusively to cultivated area expansion.

 A growth accounting decomposition attributes about half of Mali's GDP growth during 1994-2004 to factors other than
 physical and quality-adjusted human capital growth (or in other words, to growth in total factor productivity). Analysis o f
 TFP growth determinants during the same time period indicates that about 50 percent o f TFP growth was explained by
 policy variables. Inparticular, policies that resulted in increases in credit to the economy and in the share o f credit going to
 the private sector, accounted for 36 percent o f TFP growth, highlighting the critical importance o f financial sector
 development for growth in Mali. A further 13 percent o f TFP growth was due to better public expenditure allocations that
 reduced the share o f wages and salaries in public expenditures, highlighting the importance o f the quality of public
 expenditures for growth. Favorable trends o f two exogenous variables-terms           o f trade and rainfall-together accounted
 for 15 percent o f TFP growth during the period.         When viewed in terms o f their potential negative impacts, these
 exogenous variables highlight the importance to Mali's future growth o f trade diversification (to counter terms o f trade
 shocks) and irrigation management (to help stabilize agncultural production).




2.A. FinancialSector

Description and Challenges

5.35     There are currently ten banks, including seven commercialbanks, one agricultural bank, one
housing bank and one bank targeted at micro, small and medium enterprises and microfinance
institutions. In addition, there are four financial establishments. The size o f these financial

                                                               30

establishments is small compared to that of the banking sector. Altogether, there are 480
microfinance institutions organized in 26 networks with 614,2 11 members. Six insurance
companies and two social security institutions (providing pension benefits, family allowances and
workers compensation for work related accidents and illnesses) complete the financial scene.

5.36     The banking sector suffers from several weaknesses: (a) it is highly concentrated and lacks
competition-the     assets of the largest bank, BDM, account for 40 percent o f the total; (b) it i s
heavily concentrated in Bamako; (c) it lacks medium and long term resources and as a result its
credit activities are highly concentrated on the short term; (d) it has a highlevel o f non-performing
loans that contribute to keep interest rate spreads high; and (e) some banks and financial
intermediaries experience difficulties. BHM and Credit Initiatives, a financial establishment, have
negative net worth and serious liquidity problems; BIMremains fragile.

5.37     Micro finance institutions are facing a number o f challenges: (a) the absence o f internal
controls and adequate procedures; (b) inadequate governance; (c) inadapted Management
Information Systems for the major networks, (d) vast disparities between microfinance players,
with a few strong institutions and a plethora o f smaller and weaker institutions; (e) increasing loan
delinquency; and (f) rising costs. As a result, very few institutions have reached self-sustainability.

5.38     Inaddition, barring a correction inthe situation, the sector will suffer from weaknesses in
supervision. The supervisory unit, CASISFD, has recently been placed under the authority o f the
Ministryof InvestmentPromotion, which is in opposition with the regional legal framework that
stipulates that the microfinance supervisory body should be under the authority o f the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. This also signals a shift inpriority from supervision to promotion.

5.39     The critical challenge is for the financial sector (comprising banks, non-bank financial
institutions, and microfinance institutions) to fully contribute to shared growth in Mali. InMali
this translates into the need to create appropriate market-oriented incentives that encourage banks
to lower the cost of credit and offer more mediumto long term resources as loans. Ability to lower
costs o f credit depend on cleaning up non-performing loan portfolios o f banks; and the availability
o f longer term resources depends on improved prospects o f various financial sub-sectors notably
insurance, equipment leasing, and social security (public and private). Specific reforms needed in
Mali immediately to address these challenges have been identified and are addressed as part of the
continuing dialogue between the authorities and the World Bank team and as part o f the support
provided by the Bank's financial sector technical assistance project (PDSF). Deeper next phase
reform measures will be identified in the context o f a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) on
growth that i s nearingcompletion, and an FSAPplanned for third quarter o f 2006.

5.40     Strengthening commercial bank management is also a challenge, as doing so on a
sustainable basis typically entails privatization o fbank shares still owned by the Government while
the latter sometimes faces difficulties (whether political or market based) in divesting banks or
enterprises. Privatization would serve as an assurance o f no potential (or no further) government
interventions inbank operating decisions. It would also greatly improve bank management through
the application o f private sector management principles. Currently three banks are fully privately
owned, yet the Government of Mali i s present in the capital o f Banque de De'veloppement du Mali

(BDM)" and Banque Commerciale du Sahel (BCS); and it is the major shareholder of Banque
Internationale pour le Mali (BIM)19,the housing bank, Banque de 1'Habitat du Mali (BHM), and
the agricultural development bank, Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole (BNDA).
Although most o f the capital o f the Banque Malienne de Solidarite' (BMS) i s owned by micro-
finance institutions, this was at the request o f the State which keeps some influence over the bank.
The Government has committed to fully disengage from commercial banks, but this disengagement
has not yet been completed.

5.41     Inthe insurance sector, two institutions are inpoor financial condition and have a negative
impact on the market. The regional regulator, CIMA, has been involved with these two institutions
for several years, with no visible improvement. In addition the sector suffers from low business
activity compared to its potential. Finally the two social security institutions suffer from an
imbalance between benefits paid and contributions collected. The challenge i s to bring the two
institutions closer to long term sustainability.

5.42     Microfinance sector. Giventhe rapid growth o f the sector and its difficulties as well as the
lack o f sustainability, it i s imperative to strengthen the supervision o f microfinance institutions
(MFIs) to maximize their impact on growth and poverty alleviation. This implies, in the first
instance, the split o f the CAS/SFD into two units. The first unit, in charge o f supervision o f MFIs,
would returnunder the purview o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The second, in charge o f
promotion o f MFIs, would remain within the Ministry for InvestmentPromotion.

Government actions to date

5.43     Actions initiated under SAC IV have been completed or are close to completion. Inthe
commercial banking sector, the authorities launched an audit o fthe non-performing portfolios o f all
commercial banks with a view o f developing a cleaning up strategy. Due to difficulties in securing
the cooperation o f some o f the banks, the study i s still in the process o f being completed. Inthe
insurance sector, the study on the domiciliation o f insurance policies which would contribute to
significantly increase the business o f insurance companies has been completed. An implementation
committee has met about 15 times to follow up on the recommendations o f the study. Regarding
equipment leasing, a studyon the fiscal problemshinderingthe development o fthe leasing industry
has been completed. Regardingpension system, the Government launched a study o f its debt to the
private sector social security institution; it also launched actuarial studies o f the private and public
sector institutions with a view to modifjmg the mainparameters to reduce the imbalances.

5.44     Inresponse to emerging financial difficulties of the housing bank (BHM) in 2005, the
Government has been active inthe restructuring o f BHM. A team o f experts has beenplaced next
to the general manager to assist with the daily management (particularly the management o f
liquidity) and a restructuring action plan has been elaborated. The Government canvassed existing
and potential shareholders for the purpose o f inviting them to participate in the recapitalization o f
the bank. It has decided to renew the Board o f Directors and include three directors chosen for
their expertise who are not directly linkedto the shareholders, as allowed under OHADA.




l8The Government has postponed the sale o f its 20 percent stake until the central bank (BCEAO) i s ready to sell its
own 20 percent shareholding.
l9The Government acquired this historicallyprivate bank when the latter went into receivership in2000.

                                                        32

5.45    The Government had launched the privatization o f the BIM with the hiring o f a
privatization adviser.    A call for expression o f interest was successful in bringing six good
candidates for the acquisition o f at least 51 percent o f the capital o f the bank. The Government i s
hesitating between putting for sale at least 51 percent of the capital o fBIM to a reference partner or
limiting the sale to 33 percent o f the capital (which would render the deal much less attractive to
partners with an established international reputation). Ln addition, the Government put the process
on hold until the Supreme Court renders ajudgment on the ownership o f the shares o f BIMby end
2005.

5.46    With respect to microfinance, the Council o f Ministers has adopted the 2005-2008
microfinance action plan which includes the above mentioned split o f the CAS/SFD. The legal
texts specifying the split and the transfer o f the supervisory arm to the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance have been prepared and sent to the Council o f Ministers for adoption.              They will
subsequentlybe sent to the NationalAssembly for adoption into law.

Bank's assessment and Recommendation

5.47    The authorities have completed the key analytical work which i s enabling the formulation o f
policies to strengthen financial sector institutions (bank and non-bank). Prompt action to redress
financial crisis in the housing bank has been appropriate, but protracted privatization process for
the BIM contributes uncertainty in the sector. The decision to split promotion and supervision
functions for microfinance i s a welcome step. It i s important now to proceed to implementation of
the policies emanating from the studies, complete the restructuring o f BHM, and separate
microfinance supervision and promotion functions. It i s also important to proceed as quickly as
possible (following resolution o f the judicial issue) with the privatization o f BIM (e.g. the sale to
the reference partner o f 51percent o fthe capital).

Measures taken as part o f the proposed operation

5.48    The EPPFMC programcomprises the following financial sector actions:

    a   Completion o f the final audit o f Bank portfolios, including the proposed strategy to clean up
        bad loans o fthe banks;

    a   Holding o f a meeting o f the validation committee for the study o f the leasing industryfiscal
        regime; Established the monitoring committee; Finalize the draft texts;

    a   Reaching o f an agreement between the state and INPS on the amount o f arrears to be paid,
        based on the consultant study;

    a   Re-constitution o f the Board o fDirectors o f the Malian Housing Bank (Banque de Z'Habitat
        du Mali - BHM) with the addition o f three private sector specialists independent of the
        shareholders, and a canvassing o f existing and potential new investors to invite them to
        participate inthe recapitalizationo f BHM;

    a   Adoption (by the Council o f Ministers) o f draft laws (to be submitted for adoption by the
        National Assembly) that (i)  separate microfinance supervision and promotion activities, and

Indicative triggers for the next operation

5.49   Actions for the next operation are identified in the policy matrix. The proposed trigger
under the financial sector component is: undertake negotiations with commercial banks to develop
strategy to clean up their respective non-performingloans (NPL) (first half 2006).

2.B. Road Transport and Trade Facilitation

Description and Challenges

5.50   Competitiveness o f goods sold or produced in Mali has been continuously hampered by
high transport costs. As the trade regime has been liberalized and tariffs significantly reduced,
transportation constraints have become one o f the bindingconstraints to market access (both within
Mali and externally), and to improving Mali's growth prospects. International and regional trade o f
Mali i s penalized compared to coastal countries because o f the country's status o f landlocked
country. A 2004 study estimated that landlocked countries inWest Africa trade 92 percent less than
coastal countries. Obstacles result from infrastructure in poor condition, inefficient customs
operations and unofficial payments at unauthorized road blocks along the regional corridors. A
2003 survey estimated that on average on the regional corridors in West Afiica, trucks were
stopped at 48 check points, spend Iialf an hour at each stop and paid on average US$240 per trip
per direction. At 100vehicles per day during300 days, unauthorizedpayments total US$7.2 million
annually on the corridor Mali-Burkina Faso-Ghana. This situation has been aggravated by the C8te
d'Ivoire crisis which has diverted international traffic from CBte d'Ivoire to Ghana, Togo and even
Benin. The additional transport costs are estimated at about CFAFlO billion annually due to the
additional distance to reach these ports compare to the distance to Abidjan.

5.51    Domestic trade suffers also from high transport costs which have increased on average on
the entire road network by 7 percent in real terms between 1995 and 2002. This aggravation o f
transport costs is the result o f a policy which favors upgrading at high standards and paving o f a
limited number o f roads while insufficient resources are allocated to maintenance o f the rest o f the
network. Rural roads especially have suffered from a lack o f resources and it is estimated that 90
percent o f rural roads are in poor condition, which severely hampers the potential o f growth of
agricultural production and thus o f growth o f the entire economy. While the Government has
agreed to increase road maintenance resources from CFAF5.6 billion in2003 to CFAF 13 billion in
2007, it has been unable to meet the agreed target in 2005. Only CFAF 7.5 billion were budgeted
that year and by mid-year only CFAF 1.6 billion had been actually disbursed to the Road Fund
which manages road maintenance resources. In addition, road user charges which are collected
from road users and supposed to be transferred to the Road Fund were not increased in 2005 as
agreed by the Government in its 2004 letter o f transport sector policy and resources generated by
the road user charges were partially retained by the Treasury. This lack o f resources for road
maintenance i s likely to result inadditional road deterioration and further increase inroad transport
costs.

5.52    High transport costs and inefficient road transport services are closely interlinked. The
taxation system of the trucking industry favors companies with less than three trucks and thus
informal companies which are not well organized to maintain their fleet o f trucks or to provide a
quality service. Quotas define rules to share international traffic among corridor countries. Malian
truckers have the monopoly for the transport o f petroleum products for Mali. Tariffs, while

                                                  34

maintained high by the cartelized organization o f the industry, are insufficient to make the activity
profitable because o f the overcapacity and the protection o f inefficient transporters resulting from
the quotas and the allocation o f freight among transporters by turns. Transporters are forced to
overload their trucks to increase their revenues per trip as well as to cover the unauthorized
payments along the road corridors. Overloading o f trucks inturn accelerates the deterioration of the
roads resulting inadditional fundingrequirements to build or rehabilitateroads using higher design
standards. The overall condition o f trucks i s poor as a result o f the low profitability o f the industry.
The Government recently decided to exempt the import o f trucks o f customs duties to reduce the
price o f new trucks and modernize the fleet o f international trucks. As long as the root issues
described above have not beenaddressed, however, this measure will only have a short-term impact
and i s likely to further exacerbate the sector inefficiency inthe long term.

5.53     To facilitate international transit and subsequentlyreduce transit costs, the Government has
to face two main challenges:

    0    The first one i s to implement a complex set o f measures which however are all necessary to
         ensure the success of each o f them. The measures involve several administrative services
         (customs, trade, health, transport) as well as several categories o f private operators
         (truckers, freight forwarders). Implementation will require a significant amount o f
         resources. The capacity to coordinate reforms as well as investments provided by several
         donors will be key to achieve all the objectives successfully. Implementation o f some
         measures need also to be coordinated at the regional level with other countries and the
         regional institutions as simultaneous execution i s requiredto be successful.
    0     The second challenge i s to overcome vested interests which oppose the reforms. Numerous
          categories o f personnel in some administrations are benefiting from monies unduly
          collected at unauthorized road blocks and will lose these revenues after these road blocks
          are removed. Private customs agents helping the truckers at the borders to go through the
          administrative hurdles will not be needed after data on transit goods are electronically
          transmitted to customs offices at the borders.

5.54      With respect to financing of roadmaintenance, the challenge will be to build the capacity to
manage the road sector, to absorb increased and sustained revenues and to use efficiently these
resources and demonstrate to the road users that they ultimately benefit from the road user charges
that they are paying. After road maintenance execution was privatized in the late 199Os,
management remained inthe hands o f the Public Works Department which suffered o f inefficiency
problems typical of a department o f the administration (lack o f resources, lack o f accountability,
lack of autonomy) while having competent technical staff. In2004, the Public Works Department
was restructured to concentrate on planning and programming or road works. Management o f
programs' execution was transferred to two autonomous agencies (Agency for the execution o f
small civil works, Agency for the execution o f rural infrastructure works). While efficiency in the
execution o f programs improved, sector management remained weak. The Department o f Public
Works had difficulties to fulfill its role o f supervisor o f the two agencies. The Road Data Bank
created when the Department o f Public Works was restructured was unable to prepare road
maintenance programs based on a survey o froad conditions inthe absence o f resources to carry out
these surveys.




                                                     35

Government Actions to date

5.55    Mali i s one o f the country part o f the regional corridor Ghana-BurkinaFaso-Mali which i s a
priority inUEMOA'sregional road transport and transit facilitation program. The program is being
implementedon the priority corridor with support from African Development Bank, West Africa
Development Bank, European Union and the World Bank. It includes physical investments to
improve condition of regional roads, and support to implementation o f facilitation measures
(construction o f joint border posts, electronic tracking o f vehicles, computerization o f transit
documents and electronic data interchange between countries along the corridor, control o f axle
load, suppression of road barriers). With support of the European Union and France, Mali has also
launched a program on the 2004-2007 period to improve customs performance. Limited
computerization o f customs procedures has been implementedunder the program.

5.56    The Government defined its road maintenance budget objectives in its Letter o f Sector
Policy attached to the Transport Corridor Improvement Project (February 2004). The authorities
are making the effort to provide the required resources for road maintenance even in difficult
macroeconomic circumstances. A supplementary resource allocation o f CFAF 1 billion for road
maintenance was made available in May 2005 to enable achievement o f the 2005 budget target
specified inthe Policy Letter.

5.57    Inearly 2005, the Government created the RoadAgency to manage the execution ofroad
maintenance programs. The Agency i s expected to be operational in early 2006. Its staff has a
private statute and the Agency i s managed according to private procedures. Annual technical and
financial audits will review and analyze the use o f road maintenance resources in conformity with
the annual programs. The Agency i s managed by a Board with five membersout o f twelve coming
from the private sector. The Agency receives its resources from the Road Fund, created in 2002,
which was established on the basis o f the principles said o f c`2ndgeneration road funds" which have
been agreed between the World Bank and the IMF. Resources for road maintenance come partly
from the Government budget and increasingly from road user charges. The Fund i s managed by a
RoadBoard half of whose the members represent road users and the other halfprivate stakeholders.

Bank's assessment and Recommendation

5.58    The authorities have established the institutional and financial foundations enabling the
implementation of regular road maintenance activities.            The financial underpinnings o f that
framework, however, need to be further strengthened to ensure sustainability o f the road
maintenance program.        In particular, the authorities need to increase the share o f the Road
Authority's budget derived from road user charges, by increasing the level o f existing fees (e.g. the
levy on petroleum product imports or axle load fee) or by introducing new fees. The authorities
also need to ensure that the fees collected and sent to the state Treasury are transferred to the Road
Authority (RA) in a timely manner, thereby enabling efficient planning and management o f the
RA's resources. The measures proposed for the EPPFMC and next operation address these needs.

Measures taken as part of the proposed operation

    >   Transport and transit facilitation:
        o Operationalized the information system SYDONIA++ being extended to the Bamako
           rail station office.

                                                     36

    >  Road maintenance:
       o Confirmed that the road maintenance budget i s CFAF 11.5 billion in the 2006 Finance
            Law, as agreed between the Government, the World Bank and the European Union
            under existing transport programs;
       o Preparation bythe Road Fundof monthly cash-flow requirements for road maintenance
            based on the progress inthe execution o f road maintenance programs;
       o Established a mechanism in the Treasury Department to ensure regular monthly
            transfers o f revenues from roaduser charges and the budgetto the Road Fund's account,
            so as to ensure unconstrained contracting operations o f the RF during the year. (The
            collected fees must be transferred to the Road Authority by the end o f the subsequent
            month at the latest); and,
       o Did not renew the law under which imports of new trucks are exempt fiom import and
            value added taxes.

Indicative triggers for the next operation

       o Confirm that the share o f the road maintenance budget stemming from fees reaches 40
            percent in2007; and determine the level o f the fees @e., axle load fee, road user charge
            on petroleum product imports, other fees) neededto reach the 40 percent target.

2.C. PrivateSector: ExportpromotionandInvestmentClimate

Description and Challenge

5.59    The proposed operation addresses selected issues pertaining to investment climate in Mali,
namely business start up, property registration and handicrafts export taxation. These issues were
selected for the EPPFMC in light o f their quick-win nature and their potential high impact on
opportunities for the private sector. Mali needs a good investment climate so as to provide
opportunities and incentives to firms to invest productively, create jobs, and contribute to growth.
The private sector, both domestic and international, need the removal o f unjustifiedcosts and risks
stemming from administrative procedures and various regulations that implicitly encourage
informality, limit market opportunities, and reduce the propensityto invest.

5.60    Inthe area of business start up, entrepreneurs have to go through a process that entails 13
procedures, 42 days and whose cost i s about twice the per capita income. Reforms are needed to
ease the burdeno f enterprise creation and expand the formal sector.

5.61   Regarding hundicrufs "export taution", Mali needs to take every action to unleash the
potential o f crafts products for income generation outside agriculture for the poor inboth rural and
peri-urban areas. However, there are currently obstacles to competitiveness o f export o f Malian
crafts:   a de facto 10 percent "export tax" on handicraft products (the "taxe d'expertise" or
assessment tax) is collected by the national museum (ostensibly to certify that the product being
exported i s not an antiquity) prior to granting an export authorization. While export taxes were
removed in the early nineties, this de facto "export tax" on crafts products is a hindrance to the
development o f the sector. Moreover, the national museum has no clear definition of a Mali
cultural product, no system of determiningthe age o f the products, and no reference pricing system
to assist exporters to price their products properly. Evenfor products other than handicrafts exports,


                                                   37

such a fee should correspond to a technical service requested by the exporter to determine the value
and to brand the product so as to facilitate its sale on export markets.

Government actions to date

5.62    Inorder to facilitate business start up, the Council ofMinister agreed to the principle of
having a single national identification number that would help simplify, inter alia, business
registration procedures. The single identification number, which will be managed by the Statistics
Directorate in the Planning Ministry, would collapse the number o f departments involved in the
process from five to one. Whereas currently a candidate for business start up has to secure different
identification numbers from the statistics, tax, treasury, employment, and social security
departments, the new system would allow the investor to get all this captured inone number issued
bythe statistics directorate.

5.63    The regulatory framework for the collection o f the handicrafts export assessment tax i s
spelled out inthe following texts: a law and its implementation decree, both dated 1986, settingthe
conditions for dealing with cultural goods exports, and an inter-ministerial decision taken by the
Ministers o f Culture and Tourism in 1996. Articles 20 and 21 o f this inter-ministerial decision are
abusively interpreted. While these texts are aimed at protecting the cultural heritage, the assessment
tax and the export authorization are applied to all crafts products exports. This indiscriminate fee i s
appliedpresumably because many crafts products could be artistically aged and sold as antiques.

Measures taken as part o f the proposed operation

5.64    The following measureswere achieved under EPPFMC:

    0   Adopted an interministerial law (arrgte? specifying that handicraft products are subject
        neither to the expertise tax nor to the export authorization issuedby the National Museum;

    0   Launched an awareness campaign to inform artisans that they are not required to obtain
        export authorization from the National Museumnor pay the expertise tax; and,

    0   Prepared and submit a law to the National Assembly specifying a reduced number of
        departments inthe process for registering a business from five to one.

Indicativetrigger for the next operation

5.65    The proposed trigger for the private sector component is:          Adoption by the National
Assemblyo f a law confirming that issuance o fthe single identification number for new businesses
would be handledby one department (the Statistics department) instead o f five.

2.D. Office duNiger IrrigationReforms

Description and challenges

5.66    The OBce du Niger (ON) irrigation zone has undergone some institutional reforms during
the decade o f the 90s, which resulted in the ON becoming one o f the best performing irrigated
zones in sub-Saharan Africa. Following a period o f stagnation in the production o f paddy rice,
there was an extended production boom from 1988 due to rehabilitation o f canals, on-farm
technical reforms and changes in fertiliser use, all resulting from significant institutional reforms at

                                                    38

within the ON and policy reforms at the national level (e.g., rice market Iiberalisation, tax reforms,
CFA franc devaluation). This spectacular expansion attracted large numbers o f people who, with
no available developed lands in the OfJice du Niger area, started to cultivate lands not initially
intended for that purpose and thereby generated some problems still faced today. Management o f
the Office du Niger i s governed by Performance Contracts agreed with the farmers and the
Government-the       first dating back to 1996-98; and the current fourth contract in force for the
period 2005-2007.

5.67    The ON currently comprises 82,000 hectares o f fully-controlled irrigation areas, out o f a
potential o f at least 600,000 hectares. Concerns have been expressed recently about the ON'S
capacity to continue implementingreform measures to further improve its performance. The Bank-
supported National Rural Infrastructures Programme (PNIR) includes new reforms under the Large
Irrigation component to improve the funding mechanism for irrigation, specifically introduction o f
approaches to attract private sector funding to enable more rapid expansion o f irrigated areas inthe
Ofice. Two activities were implementedin connection with the private sector financing objective:
(i)anexperimentaltesttointroducetheprivatesectorintotheKomounazone; and(ii)studyon          a
irrigation funding mechanism. Additionally, an organizational audit o f the Ofice du Niger i s
underway as part o f the effort to improve the performance and corporate governance o f the ON.
The outcome o f these activities are reflected inthe current Performance Contract (or Contrat Plan)
for 2005- 2007.

5.68    The challenge will be: (i) adopt a reliable and attractive irrigation funding mechanism for
                                    to
the private sector (inclusive o f small holders, agro-businessmen as well as the financial market) and
to establish an execution agency-the       Land Tenure Agency-to     manage irrigation development
funds and the land sale; and (ii) adopt relevant proposals to rationalise ON management and
                                     to
improve ONperformance.

Government Action to date

5.69    Underthe PNIR the Government has already developed the Koumouna plot (1115 ha) inthe
ON. Private sector bids to purchase lands are in process o f being analysed. The study on the
irrigation financing mechanism has been completed, and the decree on the installation o f private
operators has been signed. An acceptable Performance Contract for 2005-07 has been signed by
the Government, ON, and the producers.

Measures taken as part o f the proposed operation

5.70    These measures are the following:

    o Continuedimplementing the 2005-2007 Performance Contract program agreed between the
        OfJice du Niger, producers, and external aid partners;
    o Reviewed implementation o f the 2005-2007 Performance Contract for the OfJice du Niger
        and its annual budget;
    o Finalized the attribution o f land to the private sector inthe Koumouna test zone, according
        to the criteria detailed inthe Legal Agreement for the Rural Infrastructure Project;
    o Moved the Land Management Unit to the CEO's Office and nominate the Manager o f the
        Unit;



                                                   39

        o Signed the contract for the consultant conducting the organizational audit of the Office du
           Niger.

  Indicative triggers for the next operation

  5.71     The proposed trigger for the private sector component is:         Strengthen the report on the
  irrigation financing mechanism in line with the original objective o f augmenting resources
  allocated to irrigation through capital markets and private operators in the agriculture sector; and
  adopt the revised report.

  3. StrengtheningPublicExpenditureManagement,Transparencyand Controls

' 3.A-E. PublicExpenditureManagementReforms

  Description and Challenges

  5.72     A series of studies over the past few years (e.g. CPAR, CFAA, ROSC, EU's audit o fbudget
  support flows) have clarified the strengths and weaknesses o f Mali's budget system. Each o f these
  studies comprised recommendations and an action plan, requiring the authorities to monitor and
  report on the status o f implementation o f multiple plans for multiple donors, placing a burden on
  the already stretched capacity o f the Government. Inthe spirit o f donor harmonization aimed at
  easing the burden on government institutions,               a consolidated action plan comprising
  recommendations of the various studies and based on a consolidated diagnostic o f those studies, .
  was agreed with the donors and adopted by the Government.

  5.73     Overall Mali's budget system i s reasonably good, particularly at central government level.
  However, the system requires further strengthening to consolidate past achievements so as to
  support implementation of the Government's medium term budget reform program, and strengthen
  the role o f the budget as the key instrument for PRS implementation and the dialogue with the
  external partners. A major challenge for Mali i s to strengthen all budget control-related functions
   (i.e., administrative, internal, external, jurisdictional and legislative), so as to assure reliability of
  the budget system. Inparticular, emphasis needs to be on capacity building and establishment of an
   adequate institutional framework for independentjurisdictional audits. Progress inthis area would
   also assure external partners of the effectiveness o f Mali's budget system and facilitate the move to
   greater budget support flows.

   5.74    Mali initiated its decentralization process in the early 1990s and has been working
  progressively over the years toward making it a reality.           To advance implementation o f the
   decentralization process, the Government adopted the Institutional Development Program and in
  2004 to accelerate the transfer of resources and competencies, the coordination and harmonization
   of functions, and the strengthening of the capacities o f authorities in the local govemments (the
   coZZectivith territoriales) in resource mobilization. The Government also adopted the texts
   governing the transfer of competencies in the priority sectors o f health, education, and water
   supply. Some important progress was achieved towards strengthening capacities of actors at sub-
   national level, such as the establishment of functioning Commune Advisory Centers (CACs) and o f
   technical and financial structures supporting the local govemments.

5.75    The Government i s nonetheless conscious o f the remaining challenges to implementingthe
decentralization the process, notably: (i)  the slow transfer o f the competencies and resources from
the national to the local governments;       (ii)the weak mobilization oflocal governments' own
resources; (iii)the lack o f articulation between the sector programs (health, education, rural
infrastructure) at the national level and the programs developed by local governments with the
assistance o f the CACs; and (iv) some gaps inthe legal texts on decentralization resultinginweak
coordination o f planning and management o f regional and local development. A key element of the
process i s to ensure that public finance mechanisms are established and strengthened to enable
progress in transferring resources to, and monitoring expenditure execution, o f the local
governments.

Government Action to date

5.76    Under the SAC IV, improvements to Mali's public finance system fell under two broad
thematic areas: (i)strengthening o f budget execution and public expenditure control systems
(integration o f the information systems,         improvement o f budget execution procedures,
strengthening o f internal and external controls, and introduction o f monitoring and evaluation
tools); and (ii) improvement o f the transparency and the traceability o f public funds (to ensure a
wider diffusion of the Government's consolidated accounts). As regards budget execution, the
interconnection o f key budget-related departments in MEF, inclusive o f the establishment o f a
shared data base covering all phases o f budget execution process (commitment, confirmation,
authorization, payment), has been an important step in assuring the quality o f budget data and of
budget management overall. The interconnection was achieved at the central government level,
and actions toward achieving it at decentralized government level (regional units o f the MEF
departments) were initiated. Actions were also initiated to establish an automated auxiliary
accounting system in the Treasury department. To facilitate management o f procurement costs, a
reference list o f prices was updated based on a 2004 survey and made available to staff
electronically (on CD-ROM). To strengthen public procurement monitoring, terms o f reference
were prepared to establish a data base o f information from the different phases o f the procurement
process.

5.77    Budget control system.         Regarding strengthening o f budget control activities, the
authorities: (i) introduced monitoring indicators inMEF's Financial Controls Department to track
the quality o f control activities and improve effectiveness through performance-based audit
processes; (ii)  established a classification system for invoices, and its difhsion to staff to facilitate
ex-ante controls and reduce the number o f payment commitment requests that are rejected; and
(iii)provisionedresources inthe 2006 Budget Law to fund actions needed to transform the
Accounts Section o fthe Supreme Court into an independent Court o fAccounts.

5.78    As regards improvement o f the transparency of budget management, the capability to
provide data on budget execution status was strengthened at central and decentralized levels. This
contributed to strengthening the quality o f the quarterly information report produced by the
MinistryofEconomy andFinance, which now includes information onbudgetexecutioninpriority
sectors. The authorities commenced dissemination through the Internet o f the expanded quarterly
report, made possible due to the software and database interconnection discussed above (paragraph
5.76). As regards accountability, the authorities made significant progress intimely completion o f
the annual budget execution report (Loi de R2gZement)-the           2003 report was submitted to the


                                                   41

National Assembly in December 2004 only three months behind schedule, and the 2004 report was
submittedat the end of September 2005 as requiredbythe statutes.

5.79     The authorities prepared and adopted a Consolidated Government Action Plan to
Modernize and Strengthen Public Finance Management (PAG) over the medium term (2006-2008),
signaling the Government's commitment to achieving increased aid flows through budget support
for PRSF implementation. They have provisioned resources in the draft 2006 budget for the 2006
actions in the FAG, and are implementing precursor actions identified for 2005 to enable timely
implementation o f the PAGin2006.

Measures taken as part o f the proposed operation

5.80     As regards budget execution, the actions supported by the EPPFMC continue the process
of interconnection o f key MEF departments at decentralized level that was initiated inthe SAC IV.
This process i s consistent with the Government's Institutional Development Program (PDI) to
operationalize the decentralization policy comprising de-concentration o f central government
operations (specifically health, education and water supply) to regional departments so as to
facilitate the operations o f local governments. It i s also consistent with the coordination framework
with other external partners supporting Mali's decentralization program, with the Bank focusing on
public finance aspects inwhich it has a comparative advantage and other external partners focusing
on institutional capacity building o f the local governments. Scheduling o f the interconnection
activity under the EPPFMC i s in line with the January 2007 target date under the PDI for
transferring responsibility for health and education programs to the local governments. Specific
actions under the EPPFMC are:

    0    Establishment o f the institutional framework for implementing the public finance action
         plan; defining the mechanisms for its implementation, monitoring and evaluation;           and
         providing adequate resources in the draft budget 2006 for implementing the 2006 activities
         o fthe actionplan (prior action); and
    0    Steps taken to ensure the implementation in 2005, o f 2005 actions from the Modernization
         Plan that have no budgetary implications.

5.81     Budget control functions.      Under the EPPFMC the authorities are focusing on capacity
building o f audit departments and enhancing performance-based management. The following
actions are included inthe policy matrix:

    Strengtheningadministrative control o fthe budget:

    0    Establishment o f a framework for consultations between all participating entities in the
         public expenditure control system;
    0    Provision o f adequate resources (financial and human) for implementation o f 2006
         activities o f the Finance Inspection department (IF), as determinedby its specific objectives
         for 2006 and their control responsibilities;
    0    Provision o f adequate resources for 2006 activities o f the General Public Service Audit
         Department (CGSP), as determined by their audit and capacity buildingprogram for 2006;
    0    Production o f semi-annual reports on ex-post (IFandCGSP) administrative control activity;
         and


                                                    42

   0   Production o f quarterly expenditure activity reports on the basis o f ex-ante control
       performance indicators.

   Strengtheningjurisdictional control ofthe budget:


   0   Provision o f adequate resources in the draft 2006 budget for the Accounts Section o f the
       Supreme Court as determinedbythe Section's agreed work program for 2006;
   0   Provision o f adequate budgetary resources in the draft 2006 budget for the eventual change
       inthe statutory numbero fstaff for the Accounts Section o fthe Supreme Court;
    0  Definition o f the timeline for the establishment o f the Court o f Accounts consistent with
       Mali's commitment under WAEMU;
    0  Rewriting o f the legal texts to increase the statutory number o f magistrate staff in the
       Accounts Section o f the Supreme Court from 15 to 67 by 2008; and
    0  Commenced implementation o f actions required to redefine the status o f magistrates o f the
       Accounts Section o f the Supreme Court.

5.82   Budgetary transparency and accountability. The EPPFMC supports the systematic and
timely production o f budgetary information so as to strengthen public finance management and
transparency. The following actions are included inthe policy matrix:

    0  Establish the website o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance along with the institutional
       framework to daily management and regular updating o f the site. Complete compilation o f
       information to be posted on the site, including the MTBF o f the budget department, and the
       budget execution status prepared by the Financial Controls department DNCF,
       disaggregated by Ministryat the engagement and liquidation stages.

    0  Prepare and submit the draft 2004 Budget Execution Law ( h i de r2glernent) to the National
       Assembly.

Indicativetriggers for the next operation

5.83   The proposed trigger for the public finance management component is:                Implement
mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation o f the Government's public finance action plan; and
implementthe actions inthe plan.

3.F. ProcurementReforms

Description and Challenges

5.84   The 1998 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) prepared by the Malian
Government and the Bank concluded that Mali possesses a corpus o f legislation and regulations
that was remarkable for the sub region and that the private sector operated satisfactorily, benefiting
from a widespread network and modem commercial practices. However, the report showed that
far-reaching measures had to be adopted to (i)increase the public sector's efficiency and
transparency o f its procurement system; (ii)improve the dialogue with the private sector, so that it
can develop and become more competitive; and (iii) smuggling and import fraud. The 2004
                                                     reduce
CPAR o f the Malian procurement system was based on an analysis of four pillars that define the
structure o f a public procurement system, namely: (i)the legislative and regulatory fi-amework; (ii)

                                                  43

the institutional framework and capacity; (iii) procurement operations and market practices; and
                                               the
(iv) the integrity of the public procurement system. The report concluded that the system continues
to harbor a significant number o f deficiencies inthe four pillars as indicated below:

(i) I: ThelegislativeandRegulatoryFrameworkisthestartingpointforthedevelopmentof
   Pillar
a governance system and sets the rules o f the process and provides the legal basis for enduringthe
rights of participants and establishing their responsibilities.

        Public Procurement Legislative and Regulatory Framework achieves the agreed standards
        and complies with applicable obligations:The legislative framework which i s governed by the
        Procurement Code - Dkcret No 95-401P-Rm o f November 10, 1995 needs to be completed
        and modernized to meet the agreed international standards and comply with applicable
        internal and external obligations.
        Existence of Implementing regulations and Documentation: Mali possesses a set o f
        implementing regulations and documentation (ministerial arr&tks, standard procurement
        documents and a manual o f procedures). However, like the code, they need to be completed
        andmodernized.

(ii)Pillar 11: TheInstitutional Framework and Capacity is designed to examine the central
government institutional framework and its capacity to oversee, manage and support efficient
implementation as well as to provide leadership in modernizing and maintaining the public
procurement system.

      Mainstreaming Procedures into Public Financial Management: Public procurement inMali is
        not an integral part o f the overall public financial management and public sector governance
        systems in a country. The procurement system should be strengthened to provide information
        to support the process o fbudgetdevelopment and execution. It should also be made to benefit
        from the public financial management system with regard to timely appropriations and
        availability o f funds to support the award and payments o f contracts. The lack o f integration
        between the budgeting and procurement processes may lead to cancellations and/or
        insufficient funds to make timely payments, resulting in increased costs and inefficiencies in
        the use o fpublic h d s .

      Existence of Functional Management Regulatory Body: Mali should benefit from the existence
        o f a regulatory body within the central government to provide a range o f functions that support
        the consistent development, maintenance and application o f the legislative and regulatory
        requirements o faprocurement system. This body canprovide guidance on interpretation o frules
        and support training and capacity development and can develop and overseethe implementation
        of the use o f technology to support procurement, including development and support to e-
        procurement solutions. The present system in Mali lacks independence and i s not efficient
        enough to respond to the needs o f a sound public procurement system. DNMPis supposedto
        be the bothregulatory and control body; there i s no separationo fresponsibilities andit gives rise
        to situations o fconflict o finterest.

      Existence of Institutional Development Capacity: The performance o f the system relies heavily
        on the capacity o f the participants, both public and private sector, to understand and
        implement the procedures. Performance is also reliant on the capacity o f the various
         stakeholders who interact with the system. There i s not an efficient system for collection and

                                                    44

        dissemination o f procurement information, including tender invitations, requests for proposals
        and contract award information or for collection and monitoring of national procurement
        statistics. In addition, Mali does not have a national sustainable training strategy to provide
        training, advice and assistance to develop the capacity o f government and private sector
        participants to understand the rules andregulations andthe how they should be implemented.

(iii)Pillar III:Procurement Operations and Market Practices: Public procurement requires
performance from both the public sector and private sector participants. A functioning and
competitive private sector market i s therefore a key partner to the public procurement system in a
well-functioning system. To be an effective partner, the market must have confidence in the
competence o f the contracting authorities at all levels within the system to implement and administer
the public procurement system inaccordancewith the legislative andregulatory framework.

      EfJiciency of Procurement Operations and Practices: Procurement operations capacity and
        practices are at the core o f a well-functioning procurement system. They depend on the
        staffing, knowledge, skills and capabilities o f the human resources and on the incentives and
        controls in the systems that influence human behavior and institutional performance. The
        assessment has shown that the level o f procurement competence among government officials
        within the entity is not consistent with their procurement responsibilities; the procurement
        training and information programs implemented for government officials and private sector
        participants i s not consistent with demand and the administrative systems for public
        procurement operations, and information databases, to support monitoring o fperformance and
        reporting to and responding to the information needs o f other related government systems are
        inadequate just as the internal control mechanisms for the undertaking o f procurement
        operations at the contracting level which includes a code o f conduct, separation o f
        responsibilities as a checkhalance mechanism and oversightkontrol o f signature/approval
        authority.

      Functionality of the Public Procurement Market. A developed private sector able to respondto
        procurement opportunities i s important to a well-functioning public procurement market.
        The assessment has shown that there are major systemic constraints (e.g. inadequate access
        to credit, access to information on business opportunities, non existence o f an efficient
        complaint mechanisms, and other contracting practices etc.) inhibiting the private sector's
        capacity to access the procurement market. The report lists a few recommendations to
        improve the partnership betweenthe public and private sector.

  (iv)    Pillar IV: The Integrity of the Public Procurement System. The system in Mali i s
  characterized by a lack of transparency, credibility and fairness. The report makes
  recommendations to strengthen the system by putting in place efficient mechanisms for
  independent control and audit o f procurement operations to provide for accountability and
  compliance. Similarly, there is a recommendation to put inplace a complaint mechanism to allow
  participants to file complaints and challenge decisions with administrative andjurisdictional review
  bodies having both appropriate levels o f independence and the legal power to impose corrective
  measures and remedies against contracting entities inbreach o fthe legal andregulatory framework.
  Even though corruption has been adequately addressed in legislation, there i s a lack o f
  accompanying measures for its enforcement. The Government o f Mali should address the issue of
  ii-aud, corruption and conflict of interest inlegislation as well as through special measures inorder to
  createa soundandfair environment for public procurement system.

                                                     45

Government Action to date

5.85   Following the action plan o f the 1998 CPAR, the Government engaged in a reform program
with the assistance of an InstitutionalDevelopment Fund(IDF) Grant o f an amount o fUS$434,000.
This grant's objectives were to allow the Government to (i) the National Procurement Code
                                                              revise
(Code national des marchis publics) in 1999; (ii)redefine the attributions o f the National
Procurement Department (Direction ginhale des march& publics, DGMP); (iii)prepare the
procedures manual and standard procurement documents; (iv) organize training sessions for staff
involved inprocurement both at the central and decentralized levels o f the administration; and (v)
put in place an information system in DGMP to strengthen its capacity to be more effective in
managing and controlling the system.

5.86    The Government implementedonly some o f the above actions financed by the IDF and its
impact on the public procurement system as a whole was limited. The Government failed to
provide the number o f trained procurement staff to support the decentralizationpolicy andthe tools
neededto do their work more efficiently. Inaddition, the Government did not implement the full
range o f the recommendations made inthe 1998 CPAR which i s believed to have contributed to the
degradation o f the system and its environment. Nonetheless, the authorities recently established a
procurement reform committee comprising representatives from all stakeholders (Government,
private sector, civil society) to review the 2004 CPAR update. This bodes well for implementing
procurement reforms going forward.

Bank's assessment and recommendation

5.87    Given the fact that procurement cuts across all sectors and given its sensitivity, there is a
need for the Government to involve other national stakeholders such as the private sector, the civil
society and other key ministries in the diagnostic study and reform. The stakeholder committee
established by the Government i s deemed to be too large for effective discussion and decision
making on procurement reforms. Furthermore the committee i s not sufficiently independent of the
Government. It i s advised that the size o f the committee be reduced to a workable number of
stakeholder representatives. The Government should also invest the new committee with full
authority to steer the procurement reform process inpartnership with (rather than in subordination
to) the Government.

Measures taken as part o fthe proposed operation

5.88    The following measures have been achieved under the EPPFMC:

    0   Establishment o f a tripartite national steering committee (comprising a restrained number of
        administration, private sector and civil society representatives) to coordinate and monitor
        implementation o fprocurement reforms (CNCS); and,

    0   Adoption by the committee o fthe revised CPAR.




                                                   46

Indicative triggers for the next operation

5.89    The proposed trigger for the procurement component is:        Adoption (by the Council o f
Ministers) o f the revised CPAR.



                            6.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                   POVERTYANDSOCIAL IMPACTS

6.1     The poverty and social impacts o f the EPPFMC are expected to be favorable overall. Many
of the measures have an indirect poverty and social impact through creating the conditions for
improved governance and provision o f public services (Le., macroeconomic and public finance
management), improved quality o f infrastructure services (Le., transport road maintenance,
irrigation reforms), health or and access to financial sector services (i.e., financial sector reforms)
and lower cost o f goods and services (transport road maintenance, trade facilitation). The potential
increase inthe road user fee on petroleum product imports would tend to negatively impact better-
off households rather than the poor since the former consume much more petroleum products than
the poor (see Annex 13). The elimination o f the export-related "expertise tax" on handicrafts
would benefit the poor since handicrafts are a major source o f income for large numbers of the
poor. Handicraft activities are also the main source o f diversification outside agriculture in the
rural areas, thereby translating into economic opportunities for the poorest Malians. As regards the
cotton sector, the findings o f the poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) o f the cotton producer
price reform, suggest a much less adverse impact on farmers o f the drop in producer prices than
initially feared. Annex 11 explains the dynamics underlyingthose findings.


                        IMPLEMENTATION,     MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                           AND

6.2     Supervision and monitoring o f results. The Ministry o f Economy and Finance i s the main
interlocutor o f this operation, and i s responsible for overall coordination o f supervision and
monitoring o f program implementation through a commission chaired by the Secretary General of
the Ministry o f Economy and Finance. The commission will comprise designated representatives
o f concerned sector Ministries (Transport, Industry and Trade, Investment Promotion and Small
and Medium Enterprises, Culture, Tourism and Artisan Activities, Health, Education, State
Patrimony), MEF Departments (Treasury, Budget, Financial Controls, Internal Controls, Fiscal,
Customs), Agencies (Procurement (DGMP); the Financial Sector Development Project Unit
(PDSF), Mission de Restructuration du Secteur Coton (MRSC), the Road Authority; National
Highway Department; Public Sector Retirement Fund (CRM); Private Sector Insurance Agency
(INPS); Office du Niger, the Central Bank) or Companies (CMDT); and the various private sector
banks (BIM,BHM,BDM).

6.3     The participating Ministries and Agencies will furnish relevant documents to the MMU
accompanied by an explanatory note (see below for hrther sector information as applicable). The
MMUwill confirm and validate those notes and other documentation, and consolidate them into a
package to be provided to IDA. The package will cover: (i)     progress on the implementation o f the
actions inthe policy matrix, (ii) progress on the jointly agreed key performance indicators; and (iii)
macroeconomic developments, particularly budgetary outcomes.           On a monthly basis, budget

                                                  47

revenues and expenditures, reconciled bank accounts and statements o f the EPPFMC's deposit
account will be submitted to IDA. On a yearly basis, the detailed draft budget will be provided for
review and discussion, prior to its adoption by the Council o f Ministers. IDA supervision missions
will also monitor EPPFMC implementation, incoordinationwith the IMFand other major donors.

6.4      For Transport and trade facilitation, the Road Authority will produce monthly reports
detailing: resources transferred from the Government budget, revenues from the axle load duty,
revenues from the road user charge on petroleum products and revenues from road tolls. The 2006
road maintenance program will be prepared by the National Highway Department. A convention
will be signed between the National Highway Department and the Road Agency delegating to the
agency the management o f the execution o f the roadmaintenance program. In2007, a technical and
financial audit o f the Road Agency and the Road Authority will review the financial and technical
execution o f the 2006 road maintenance program. The service o f the Road Data Bank will carry out
a survey in2006 and 2007 which will provide information on the condition o f the road network and
the impact o fthe roadmaintenance program executed in2006.

6.5      For private sector development measures (Export assessment tax and Investment Climate),
the Ministry o f Investment Promotion will be responsible for policy measures pertaining to
business start up and property registration and will work closely with the Planning Ministry
(regarding the single identification number) as well as the "MinistBre des Domaines de Z'Etat"
(regarding property registration issues).

6.6      For handicrafts exports, whilst the Ministries in charge o f handicrafts and culture are
responsible for the passing o f the "arre"tk interministe`rel" and for the communication campaign, the
Ministry of Finance retains the primary responsibility o f making things happen as agreed upon in
the context o fthe proposed operation and reporting onprogress.


                                          FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS

Publicfinancialmanagement(PFM) system

6.7      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was completed in FY03. The
main conclusions o f this report are that the Malian PEM system is quite coherent, with a strong
budget process, functioning ina clear organizational framework with an improvingcontrol system.
However, there are areas that need improvement. To further strengthenthe financial accountability,
an integrated action planover the mediumterm (paragraph 4.16) was discussed and agreed with the
Government and donors. Implementation o f the action plan is being supported under EPPFMC and
will be supported under subsequent operations.

Fundsflow arrangements2'

6.8      An on-site safeguards assessment o f the BCEAO proposed specific remedies to alleviate
vulnerabilities that were identified by IMF staff. Although Fund staff and BCEAO authorities
disagreed on the initial modalities o f the recommendations, the following specific understandings
were subsequentlyreached regarding the keyremedies.

6.9    Financial reportingframework. Fund staff recommended that the BCEAO formally adopt
International Accounting Standards (IAS) and publish a complete set o f financial statements,
including detailed explanatory notes. It was agreed between the BCEAO and Fund staff that the
BCEAO will strive to improve its financial and accounting reporting by aligning its practices with
those recommendedby IAS, as adopted internationally by other central banks.

6.10   Internal controls system. The staff noted that the absence o f oversight o f the bank's
governance, financial reporting, and internal control practices by an entity external to the
management o f the BCEAO represented a significant risk. It was agreed between the BCEAO and
Fund staff that, after seeking the opinion of the external auditor (Commissaire Contrdleur),
BCEAO staff will propose to the BCEAO Board o f Directors that it adopt a resolution whereby the
external auditor will be required to apprise the Board o f Directors, during its annual review and
approval of the financial statements, o f the state and quality o f internal controls within the bank.

6.11    Based on the 2002 financial statements, the staff noted that the BCEAO has improved the
explanatory notes to the financial statements and further changes are scheduled for the next fiscal
year, with a view toward a graduated alignment with I A S accounting to the extent applicable to
central banks by 2005. The external auditor has apprised the Board o f Directors o f the BCEAO o f
the quality o f internal controls in June 2003, and the financial statements for the year 2002 were
published on the bank's website. The staff will continue its follow-up on the progress of the
BCEAO in implementing the proposed recommendations as part o f the ongoing safeguards
monitoring process.


                                   DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                     AND

6.12    The proposed credit will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy credits. The untiedbudget support will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of
the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirementswill be needed. Once the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the
proceeds o f the credit will be deposited by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower at the
Central Bank o f West African States (BCEAO) in Bamako at the request o f the Borrower. The
Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount i s
credited in the Borrower's budget management system. If the proceeds o f the credit are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the
Borrower to promptly refund upon notice from IDA, an amount equal to the amount of said
payment to IDA. Amounts refundedto the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. Although
an audit o f the deposit account will not be required, IDA reserves the right to require audits at any
time. The administration o f this credit will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance.


                                     ENVIRONMENTAL       ASPECTS

6.13    The implementation o f the EPPFMC reform program is not expected to have any negative
 environmental impact, especially inthe short-term horizon o f this operation. Implementation of the
 sector reforms under the operation (cotton, irrigation and transport) may have environmental
implications. Potential implications o f irrigation and transport measures are being addressed under
the respective ongoing sector operations-the         National Rural Irrigation Project (FYOO) and


                                                    49

Transport Corridor Improvement Project (FY04). Implementation o f the longer-term cotton sector
reforms may have environmental implications due to the potential increase incotton production and
attendant increase in fertilizer/pesticide use. An assessment of the likely environmental impact
shows, however, that the magnitude o f environmental risks strictly associated with the cotton sector
i s very limited, as no major expansion o f cotton cultivated areas i s expected. Specific measures that
will address the minimal potential environmental impact of the cotton recovery program are
included inthe ISDS o f the Agricultural Services Project (PASAOP, FY02). Environmental issues
associated with the cotton privatization program will be incorporated in the biddinghegotiations
process for each company privatized.

6.14     The EPPFMC program, ifsuccessful, would likely contribute to expansion o fprivate sector
activity, inclusive o fproduction operations inpolluting sectors. These impacts will be addressed to
some extent under future Bank projects, but would best be tackled in a perennial manner through
the country's environmental management agency.              Yet Mali's capacity to guide industrial
development in sustainable manner (through, for example, the review o f proposals, issuance o f
permits, and enforcement o f standards) i s currently assessed to be weak.            Consideration for
providing Bank support to strengthen Mali's environment management capacity should be
discussed inthe context of the upcoming CAS exercise.


                                     R I S K S ANDRISK MITIGATION

6.15     The operation faces the external, institutional, and political risks. External risks stem
mainly from the well-known vulnerability o f the Malian economy to vagaries o f weather and
commodity price fluctuations (cotton, oil) as well as regional crises (e.g., Cote d'Ivoire, cricket
infestation).   Mitigating these risks over the horizon o f the proposed project remains difficult.
However, the project would be broadly consistent with policies and initiatives to reduce Malian
economy's structural vulnerabilities over the medium term by the inclusion o f key measures for
financial sector development, transport diversification and trade facilitation measures (including
customs reform). Additionally, the country dialogue would allow for some budget flexibility to
address crisis-related expenses within the context o f a prudently managed budget supporting
priority growth and poverty reductionprograms. Increasingprogress toward predictable and timely
donor support and coordinationpromoted under the project will also bekey.

 6.16    Institutional risk comprises the threat o f weak capacity and governance to program
implementation and outcomes. This risk o f slower-than-desired program implementation stemming
 from capacity constraints will be reduced through continued technical support by the Bank and
other donors to        strengthen capacity,      particularly in coordination o f the        PRSF and
 growtWmacroeconomic programs. Project design also includes strengthening growth-critical areas
 such as prudent fiscal policy, financial sector development and transport and trade facilitation.
Furthermore, by building on the good record o f policy reform in public finance management, the
 Credit itself will contribute to the institutional strengthening o f various agencies involved inpublic
 finance management including at sub-national levels.

 6.17    Political risk remains that the Government's current commitment to the continued reforms,
 including privatization and liberalization program (banking, cotton, transport, telecommunication
 sectors) could wane. Potential re-opening o f discussion on agreed measures could cause a loss o f
 momentum in reform implementation. This risk i s constantly monitored by the country team in
 order to detect problem areas early on and adjust the Bank response as needed. Finally, and

                                                     50

perhaps most importantly, given the low international cotton prices, there i s a critical political risk
that insufficient recovery o f world cotton prices would dictate a sharp downward adjustment in
local producer prices, an adjustment that could prove politically extremely difficult. While this risk
i s not possible to control, the operation draws from estimates o f the potential poverty and financial
impact o f various cotton prices in order to inform the policy choices and trade offs between the
need for local prices to reflect world market conditions and the desirability o f cushioning the
temporary impact on the poor.

                         REFORM PROGRAMSUPPORTED BY THE
  ECONOMIC POLICY AND PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT CREDIT (EPPFMC)




1. OBJECTIVES OF THE REFORM PROGRAM SUPPORTEDBY THE EPPFMC

1.      The Economic Policy and Public Finance Management Credit (EPPFMC) falls within the
scope o f continued assistance by the World Bank to Mali to achieve macroeconomic stabilization.
It seeks to support the Government's efforts to strengthenthe fundamentals for robust, sustainable,
and equitable economic growth. To this end, it focuses on: (i)   strengthening and deepening the
reforms undertaken by the Government in recent years as part o f the Third and Fourth Structural
Adjustment Credits (management of the budget, financial sector, cotton sector, and Office du
Niger); (ii)providing assistance to the Government with implementation o f its poverty reduction
strategy prepared in 2002 and the establishment o f conditions conducive to greater support for the
strategy through direct budgetary assistance. The reform program revolves around three principal
components.

2.      The first program component is aimed at strengthening the macroeconomic, budgetary,
and poverty frameworks. It encompasses those activities whose implementation should contribute
to: (i)
      maintaining a coherent macroeconomic framework; (ii)    enhancing consistency between fiscal
policy and the poverty reduction strategy; (iii)strengthening implementation o f the poverty
reduction strategy framework (PRSF) and preparing the second generation PRSF (2007-2011
period); and (iv) pursuing cotton sector reforms, including implementation o f ajoint vision o f the
Government and all partners on progress made with cotton sector reform and the privatization o f
the Mali cotton ginning company Compagnie Malienne pour le De'veloppement des Textiles
(CMDT).

3.      The second component covers reforms aimed at supporting equitable economic growth,
with a view to achieving the poverty reduction objectives that the Government has set itself. It is
deepeningthose reforms already undertaken as part o f the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit in
the financial sector and OfJice du Niger, and is expanding reforms to other key growth areas o f the
Malian economy, such as transport and trade facilitation, export promotion, and the business
climate.

4.      The third component is aimed at strengthening budgetmanagement. The objective o fthis
component i s the operationalization o f modem management tools that have been successfully
implemented in recent years, with emphasis on streamlining the budget process and achieving
greater transparency and dissemination o f budget information. This component also includes the
basic elements for more extensive reform o fnational public procurement procedures.




                                                 53

2. STRENTHENING MACROECONOMIC AND BUDGET MANAGEMENT AND THE
    POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY

2.I Specific Objectives

5.      Implementation o f this component should contribute to stabilization o f the macroeconomic
framework and to greater consistency in fiscal policy. Specifically, the actions planned should, as a
whole, contribute to: (i)   maintaining prudent fiscal policy within a coherent macroeconomic
framework; (ii)  strengthening the overall consistency betweenthe budget and the poverty reduction
strategy and improving mechanisms for the sectoral allocation o f resources (Medium-TermBudget
Framework    - MTBF); (iii)improving the allocation of intra-sectoral resources that target the
development objectives sought by sectoral policies (Medium-Term Expenditure Framework in the
health, education, and infrastructure sectors); and (iv) strengthening the PRSF process as a whole
(implementation o f the 2002-2006 PRSF and preparation o f the 2007-2011PRSF). These actions
fall within the scope o f deepening the activities supported by the Fourth Structural Adjustment
Credit (SAC IV).      The objective o f this component was to provide overall visibility to public
policies and medium-term fiscal policy, with a view to a gradual shift from project assistance to
budgetassistance for Mali.

2.2Reform Program

2.2.1   Macroeconomicframework and budgetpolicy

6.      Macroeconomic framework. In this regard, the Government is continuing the prudent
policy it adopted a few years ago, in particular since the shocks experienced by the Malian
economy resulting from the deterioration inthe socio-political environment inthe sub-region. This
prudence i s reflected in the design and implementation o f a rigorous fiscal policy which
nonetheless ensures the allocation o f resources to the social sectors.       In general terms, the
Government has therefore pursued a macroeconomic management approach conducive to the
stabilization of economic conditions, despite climatic vagaries and unfavorable price fluctuations
on the international market (raw materials and petroleum products in particular). It intends to
continue this rigorous macroeconomic management in 2006, as reflected in the draft proposal
submitted for approval by the national assembly, the thrust o f which i s globally in line with the
economic outlook for 2006.

7.      Fiscal policy. With a view to obtaining the tools for ensuring that public policy i s in line
with the state budget, the Government has developed and incorporated several instruments into the
budgetary process inrecent years. The results-based fiscal management approach adopted in 1998
has beenbolstered by the introduction o fthe Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (METF).

2.2.1.1 Actions taken in2005

8.      Ingeneral terms, areviewprocessundertakenbythe Governmenthaspointedto theneedto
organize the use o f these current public policy management tools in such a way that the process i s
assimilated by government departments and that second generation PRSF objectives are supported
bycredible and financially sustainable strategies. To this end, the Government has decided to make
the organizational framework for the budget formulation process clearer, introducing an overall


                                                  54

logic into multi-year public expenditure programming by: (i)establishing stronger linkages
between the macroeconomic framework and the state budget preparation process, in order provide
economic forecasts and analyses on a more regular basis and to integrate them fully with the budget
formulation process, thereby enabling them to feed into the other phases (drafting and execution);
(ii)establishing strong linkages betweenpreparation ofthe Medium-Term BudgetFramework
(MTBF) and the sectoral Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks; and (iii)creating stronger
linkages between this process, on the one hand, and budget formulation and the PRSF
monitoring/evaluation on the other.

9.      Logical framework. Inorder to implement an organizational framework for the integration
o f the PRSF process into the budget process, a logical framework has been adopted with a view to
establishment o f the schedule to take effect in2006, inorder to ensure greater consistency between
the budget, macroeconomic framework, sectoral priorities, and the PRSF process (preparation and
implementation). This logical framework can beensummarized as follows:

          Conducting a review o f the programs during the first quarter o f the year in question in
          order to draw lessons from the program budget implementation process and to obtain
          information for programbudgetpreparation for the three years ahead;

          Establishing a macroeconomic framework (first quarter) in order to provide medium-term
          macroeconomic projections and the basic elements for preparing a Medium-Term Budget
          Framework (March-April) as well as a budget circular letter (May);

          Updating the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework o f the sectoral ministries (April-
          May) in order to simulate the intra-sectoral allocation o f resources, taking into account
          sectoral policy objectives and the poverty reduction strategy;

          Submitting sectoral draft budgets (program budgets and accounting budgets) to the
          Ministry of Economy and Finance (July) so that the technical and policy arbitrage
          processes can be carried out (August). These processes should be clarified through
          updating o fthe macroeconomic framework; and

          Submitting the draft state budget, taking into account the findings o f the PRSF
          implementation report (June), with the different arbitrage processes being finalized
          (August-September), for approval by the Council o f Ministers (September), followed by
          submission by the Government to the National Assembly for approval (October).

 10.     Medium-TermBudget Framework(MTBF). Overall, from the standpoint o fpreparation
o f the 2007-2011 PRSF, the Ministry o f Economy and Finance has updated the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF), allocating indicative sectoral financial packages to all ministries and
institutions duringthe 2006-2008 period. The MTBF:

     (i)  I s based on recent macroeconomic trends in Mali (2004-2005) and on the medium-term
          outlook, taking into account the environment in West African Economic and Monetary
          Union (WAEMU) countries and constraints linked to international conditions;




                                                 55

    (ii)Makes    projections regarding budgetary resources over the 2006-2008 period (internal and
          external resources); and

    (iii)Decides on the provisional allocation of expenditures, determined by the Mali's
          macroeconomic constraints and other sectoral priorities outlined for the social sectors and
          those sectors that support production.

11.     The Government will systematize this highly effective exercise in the context o f PRSF
implementation and dialogue with its partners on external support for PRSF implementation. The
2006 updating exercise will, in particular, facilitate operationalization o f the second generation
PRSF from a programming andbudgetary standpoint for the 2007-2011period.

12.     Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). At the sectoral level, the MTEFs
for the education and health sectors have been updated for the 2006-2008 period and the Ministry
of Equipment and Transport has prepared an initial MTEF for the 2006-2008 period.              These
activities have paved the way for: (i)ensuring consistency between the sectoral health and
education strategies (as envisioned inthe second PRODESS and PRODEC phases), along with the
medium-term macroeconomic outlook and the longer term objectives (millennium development
goals); and (ii) linking the draft 2006 budget o f the Ministry o f Health and Education with 2006
PRODESS and PRODEC programming.

2.2.1.2. Medium-term actions envisioned

13.      These actions will be carried out and strengthened in the years ahead (post-EPPFMC)
period, through the following, among others: (i)preparing a Medium-Term Budget Framework
(MTBF) for the 2007-2009 period consistent with the 2007-2001 1 macroeconomic framework,
which allocates resources by ministry, sector, and expenditure type (deadline: April 2006); (ii)
improving the content o f the budget framework letter, along with the provisional allocation o f
resources to ministries and institutions as set forth in the MTBF (deadline: end-May 2006); (iii)
systematizing the updating o f the health and education MTEFs within the ministries; (iv) updating
the Equipment and Transport MTEF for the 2007-2009 period; (v) establishing a schedule for
transition from the National Budget Directorate's computer system to the new PTLBSI
(GEPRIMA) application for management o f the system (deadline: end-December 2005).

2.2.2. PovertyReductionStrategy Framework

 14.     The 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework (PRSF) prepared by Mali i s based on a
projection o f the poverty situation and a shared vision o f its fundamental driving factors. The
PRSF sets forth an overall strategy aimed at significantly reducing the incidence of poverty in the
country inthe medium-term.

2.2.2.1 Actions taken in2005

 15.     In2005, the Government undertook a number of activities, the general objective o f which
was to strengthen the PRSF process through: (i)        an institutional mechanism for purposes o f
monitoring, implementation, and evaluation (institutional matters, strengthening o f entities, and
oversight procedures); and (ii) linkage with the aid harmonization process, and; (iii)bolstering the


                                                 56

credibility o f the poverty reduction strategy (defining a clear growth strategy to support the PRSF
objectives for the 2007-2011period).

16.     Inlinewiththe above, the Government has:

    (i)   Adopted the official documents to restructure the PRSF coordination unit in order to
          accord it an expanded role in PRSF implementation and monitoring and allocated
           significant resources to this unit inthe draft 2006 budget so that it can properly serve as a
          driver o fthe second generation PRSF process;

    (ii)Produced the second PRSF implementation report based on a process of broad
          consultation with all stakeholders. This report covers the 2003-2004 period and provides
          guidance for orienting preparation o f the second generation PRSF, to cover the 2007-2011
          period; and

    (iii)Draftedthetermsofreferenceforthe2007-2011PRSFinlinewith:(1)theprocessfor
           drafting the 2007 budget and 2006 budget execution; and (2) the formulation o f the
           second phases o f the sectoral strategies, which will facilitate implementation o f a health
           and education policyinthe years ahead.

17.     Inview ofthe needto basethe 2007-2011PRSF on aclear growth strategy, the Government
has incorporated the coordination aspects o f the formulation o f the economic growth strategy into
the missions o f the PRSF coordination unit. It i s in the process o f making arrangements to
formulate an economic growth strategy that will lay the groundwork for identifjmg objectives for
the 2007-2011 PRSF. Inaddition, the 2007-2011 PRSF will provide an opportunity to implement
more effective mechanisms for harmonizing the schedule for production o f PRSF implementation
and annual evaluation reports, the budget cycle schedule, and implementation o f the joint
framework      (Govemment/technical-and-financial      partners) for monitoring PRSF budgetary
assistance.

2.2.2.2 Medium-term actions envisioned

18.     During the post-EPPFMC period, the Government will implement a more functional
mechanism for PRSF monitoring and implementation, inlight o f the experience gained with 2002-
2006 PRSF implementation.          Special attention will be paid to capacity-building within the
coordination unit that will pilot the process, as well as the entities involved with monitoring the
statistics o fministerial departments.

2.2.3. Cotton sector reforms

19.      Implementation and strengthening o f the cotton sector reform process i s a priority for the
Government inorder to reinforce the sector's role as the driver o f economic growth and provider o f
revenue to the rural populations. From the standpoint o f possible access to increased budgetary
resources from the World Bank, the Government i s cognizant o f the importance o f continuing the
reform process until the CMDT i s fully privatized, and it pledges its firm commitment to this
process.



                                                    57

20.     In view of the major shortfall experienced during the 2004-2005 crop year, which
underscored the risks posed by the cotton sector vis-a-vis the state budget, the Government has
adopted a new mechanism for determining the price o f seed cotton through a Memorandum o f
Understanding signed by the State, the CMDT, and producers in January 2005. This should
contribute to signification mitigation o f the risks tied to the cotton sector and to improved
distribution o frevenue among CMDT producers.

21.     Duringthe current crop year (2005-2006), all the principles o fthe mechanismwere adopted
in fixing producer prices. Based on grain prices in August 2005 (65 cts/lb), projected production
(600,000 tons o f cotton seed), and the exchange rate to the dollar (CFAF 500/US$l), the sector
should post a surplus for the 2005/2006 crop year.           Producers should benefit from a price
supplement; consequently, the initial price for the crop year, set at CFAF 160Kg for the highest
quality, should not have to be adjusted for reasons offorce majeure (Article 8 o f the January 13,
2005 Memorandum).

22.     Moreover, the Government has reached ajoint agreement with all stakeholders on the main
steps that should lead to privatization o f the CMDT in 2008. This agreement has resulted in a
detailed timetable, implementation o f which should send a strong signal o f its desire to move the
process forward.

2.2.3.1 Reform follow up

23.     In view of the fact that the key steps during the 2006-2008 period have been clearly
identified, the Government will adopt the measures it deems necessary to ensure that the reform
process that will lead the sector to the watershed point o f full privatization can be reached by 2008.
These steps entail: (i)defining the zones (3 or 4) to be privatized (by January 31, 2006) and
adopting a final operational plan for full privatization (by September 30, 2006); (ii)    launching the
bidding process for recruitment o f the privatization council (by July 30, 2006); (iii)    adopting the
draft privatization law (September-November, 2007); (iv) issuing invitations to tender for the
privatization o f zones (January 2008); and (v) executing o f the process o f privatization until the
actual sale takes place (August 2008).

3.      SUPPORTTO GROWTH

3.1     Objectives

24.     The Government has already implemented the reforms supported by the Fourth Structural
Adjustment Credit (SAC IV), based on the results of analytical studies conducted by it. These
reforms include the development o f the financial sector and reforms applicable to the Ofice du
Niger. These measures have been undertaken within the EPPFMC framework, and have been
expanded to encompass other growth-supporting sectors such as transport and trade facilitation,
export promotion, and the business climate.




                                                  58

3.2.    Reform program

3.2.1    The financial sector

25.     The financial reforms implementedby the Government over the past two years are part of
an effort to strengthen the role o f the private sector based on a joint approach to growth.
Consequently, it has sought to establish a framework that i s favorable to banks, so that they can
mobilize long-term resources that permit them to offer financial services and medium- and long-
term loans at lower cost. The actions supported by the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit are
taking place against this backdrop. Ingeneral, these actions have either been implementedor are in
the process o f implementation.

3.2.1.1. Actions undertakenin2005

26.      Specifically, within the framework o f the EPPFMC, the Government has continued and
deepened actions undertaken as part o fthe Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit.

27.      Consequently, it has:

          Undertakena review o f proposals related to a settlement planfor doubtful debt inthe final
          audit report completed this year. It has also adopted a final plan to be implemented in
          2007;

          Prepared the official tax reform documents deemed necessary following validation o f the
          findings o fthe 2005 study on the tax system applicable to leasing;

          Renewed the term o f the Administrative Council o f the Malian Housing Bank (Banque de
          I'Habitat du Mali (BHM)) and appointed three specialists who have no ties to
          shareholders. The recapitalization plan for the bank has been implemented(State, INPS,
          OMH, and Chamber o f Commerce).          O f the CFAF 18 billion needed, the State has
          contributed CFAF 15.5 billion;

          Adopted, in the area o f microfinance, an action plan for the 2005-2008 period, as well as
          draft laws separating supervision and promotion activities, and reassigning supervision to
          the Ministry o f Economy and Finance through the National Assembly (by December 31,
          2005);

          Started the privatization process o f the Banque Internationale pour le Mali (BIM) and
          hired a privatization expert. The call for expressions o f interest has produced satisfactory
          results with six bidders expressing an interest in acquiring at least 51 percent o f the
          Bank's capital. However, a decision was made to suspend the process until the decision
          o f the Supreme Court to be handeddown in late November on the dispute regarding the
          ownership o f shares; and

          Reached an agreement with the INPS regarding the amount o f state arrears (CFAF 5.1
          billion), with a three-year settlement plan being agreed upon between the two parties.
          Implementation o f this plan will begin in the context o f the 2006 budget (CFAF 5.1
          billion over three-years).

                                                  59

3.2.1.2 Medium-termreforms

28.     Duringthe post-EPPFMC period, the following actions will be taken: (i)      negotiations with
commercial banks with a view to identifyng final settlement and implementation strategies; (ii)
adoption of amendments to tax system for leasing activities included in the amendments to the
General Tax Code (Code ge'ne'ral des imp6ts); (iii)   strengtheningo f oversight inthe insurance area;
(iv) continuation of the BHM restructuring plan; and (v) implementation o f the privatization
strategy for the BIM.

3.2.2   Transport

29.     Inthe area of transport, efforts have focused largely on maintenance of the current road
network. As part o f the 2006 budget, the Government has increased the resources earmarked for
road maintenance to CFAF 11.5 billion, inaccordance with the commitment made inthe context o f
the sectoral transport program. However, the share of own resources of the Road Authority, which
should amount to 30 percent o f the financing o f road maintenance, will amount to a mere 16
percent (CFAF 1.7 billion instead o f 3.5 billion). Inorder to ensure the actual performance o f road
maintenance work in 2006, the Government has decided to finance the CFAF 1.8 billion gap
through inter-ministerial communal charges during execution o f the 2006 budget. The Government
undertakes to make these additional resources available to the Road Authority on a semi-annual
basis.

30.     With regardto the post-EPPFMC period, the Government is confirming, at thisjuncture, its
commitment to augment to CFAF 13 billionthe resources allocated to current road maintenance. It
will adopt measures to increase the share o f resources o f the Road Authority to 40 percent o f total
resources allocated to the Road Authority. Moreover, in order to lay the groundwork for an
effective survey o f road data, the road data office will be given budgetary resources commensurate
with its mission and the results expected o f it in terms o f the availability o f information for
purposes o f road maintenance.

3.2.3   Exports and the investment climate

31.     The actions taken in this area by the Government in the context o f this credit are aimed at
enhancing the business climate in Mali. These actions will be deepened in the medium-term, and
concern, inparticular, procedures regarding the establishment o f enterprises, export promotion, and
implementation o f an integrated, trade-related technical assistance framework.

32.     In order to streamline enterprise establishment procedures, the Government has agreed to
the principle o f assigning responsibility for this task to a single government department, instead o f
the five departments that were formerly involved in this process. In May 2005, it approved the
official documents assigning a single identifier to the National Statistics Department (Direction
Nationale de la Statistiqueet de I'Informatique (DNSI)).

33.     Inorder to promote exports, the Government introduced aninter-ministerial decree that will
allow for the exemption o f handicraft products from the expert's assessment tax (taxe d'expertise)



                                                    60

and an export permit from the national museum. Informationon this initiative will be disseminated
largely through an awareness-building campaign targeting artisans.

3.2.4   Office du Niger reforms

34.     In general, the actions supported by the EPPFMC are aimed at establishing a reliable
irrigation financing mechanism for the private sector and establishing an improved system for
managing and evaluating the performance o fthe Ofice.

3.2.4.1 Progressmade in2005

35.     The activities undertaken in 2005 fall within the scope o f those carried out earlier by the
Government in the context o f the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, supported by the national
rural infrastructure project, for which the World Bank i s providing assistance.

36.     Consequently:

    (9    Implementation o f the 2005-2007 contract plan has continued and the Government has
          assigned the initial parcels inthe Koumona pilot zone to the private sector. Based on the
          feedback provided by the technical and financial partners, it will undertake a more in-
          depth analysis o f results and will appoint the commission so that allocation can be
          resumedwith greater consideration being givento the objectives and specifications o f the
          pilot;

    (ii)The steps necessarywill betakenwith aview to amorein-depthassessmentofthe
          irrigation financing mechanism, taking into account the shortcomings identified in the
          findings o f the study conducted in relation to the initial objective to seek additional
           financing inorder to increase irrigated surface areas; and

     (iii)Thelandmanagementunithasbeenplaceddirectlyunderthegeneraldirectorateofthe
           OfJice with a view to enhancing its performance.

3.2.4.2 Reform follow up

37.      During the post-EPPFMC period, the Government will take steps to ensure the
dissemination of the results o f the Master Plan for the development o f the ON zone to producers,
prior to its adoptionby the Council o fMinisters, and to allocate parcels inthe Koumona zone to the
private sector, based on feedback receivedfrom technical and financial partners.

4.       STRENGTHENINGPUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT, TRANSPARENCY,AND
         OVERSIGHT

4.1      Objectives

38.      Over the past three years, noteworthy improvements have been made to the budget system
in Mali. The authorities have concentrated their efforts on the design and implementation of
management instrumentswhich, by and large, are currently operational. The following are some of
the actions taken: (i) o f key entities o f the Ministry o f Economy and Finance involved with
                       linkage

                                                   61

the budget process (Budget Office, Financial Control Directorate, and Treasury Directorate), a
measure that has significant implications for the reliability o f budget data; (ii)adoption o f a
complete budget nomenclature showing budget allocations according to accepted international
standards; (iii) establishment o f a budget and accounting nomenclature for the national authorities
which i s consistent with budget nomenclature and WAEMU recommendations; and (iv) the design
of tools for budget administrators and financial comptrollers with a view to improving execution of
the state budget.

39.     The main objectives sought in this component are: (i)establishment o f the fundamental
elements for implementation o f a three-year budget program prepared by the Government on the
basis o f the various public finance projections made in recent years (World Bank's CFAA, IMF's
ROSC, and EuropeanUnion's Audit, among others); (ii)         continuation o f actions undertaken as part
o f the Third and Fourth Structural Adjustment Programs in the areas o f strengthening budget
execution, enhancing the effectiveness o f public expenditure, and improving budget transparency;
and (iii)commencement o fthe reformprocess o f national public procurement procedures.

4.2     Implementation of the actionplan

4.2.1. Action plan to strengthen fiscal management

40.     In recent years, studies conducted and projections made have fostered a better
understanding o f the strengths and weakness o f Mali's budget system. Based on these findings and
on reform recommendations made, the Government drafted and adopted a government action plan
for the modernization and strengthening o f public finance management proposing, over the
medium-term (2006-2008), in-depth reforms which also provide guarantees with respect to the
budgetary process.      This action signals the willingness o f the Government to organize PRSF
assistance through budgetarysupport.

4.2.1.1 Actions taken in2005

41.     Based on the institutional mechanism proposed for implementation o f this action plan, the
Government has:

     (9    Entrusted monitoring and implementation activities to the budget reform support unit
           (CARB), based on the mechanism for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation o f the
           action planproposed inthe consultants' study;

     (ii)Madeprovisionsforthe2006actionplantrancheinthedraftbudgetlawforthatyear(a
           total o f CFAF 7 billion). Amounts have beenearmarked for each beneficiary entity; and

     (iii)Takenstepstoensurethat2005projectedactionsthatdonothavebudgetaryimplications
           can actually be implemented duringthe course o f the year. These 2005 actions are being
           carried out (preparation o f a logical framework).




                                                     62

4.2.1.2 Reform follow up

42.     Duringthe post-EPPFMC period, the Government will accord all the attentionneeded to its
action plan for the modernization and improvement o f pubic finance management. Consequently,
it will ensure that the following actions will be taken: (i)  implementation o f the mechanisms for
follow up and evaluation of the action plan (from January 2006); (ii)   implementation o f the action
plan (2006); and (iii)   updating o f the 2006 programmed actions to reflect 2005 achievements
(January 2006).

4.2.2. Budget execution

43.     The actions undertaken in the area o f budget execution pertain largely to the
computerization of the flow o fbudget information. These actions were all undertaken as part o f the
Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, based on a timeline that extends beyond that o f the EPPFMC.
Consequently, during the post-EPPFMC period, the Government will continue the following
actions, in particular: (i)computerizing auxiliary accounting with a view to exercising better
control over shortfalls; and (ii)linking the deconcentrated services o f the National Budget
Directorate, the National Financial Control Directorate, the National Treasury Directorate, and the
Public Accounting Office.

4.2.3. Budget oversight and transparency

4.2.3.1 Strengtheningbudget oversight

44.     One major challenge faced by Mali in the context o f its budgetary system is the
strengthening o f all dimensions o f the oversight function (administrative, internal, external,
judicial, and legislative). This i s necessary not only to ensure the reliability o f the budget system
but also to facilitate dialogue between the Government and its partners on the effectiveness o f
public expenditure, official development assistance, and poverty reduction policies.          The core
problem lies in capacity-building within the oversight entities and the establishment of an
appropriate institutional framework for the autonomous exercise o fjudicial oversight.

45.     Although efforts have been made in the context o f the SAC IV to produce draft budget
execution laws within reasonable timeframes; a commensurate level o f progress needs to be made
in the areas of a priori controls (monitoring o f control performance and the quality of the
expenditure request files) as well as aposteriori controls (quality of the controls and audits, as well
as follow up related to the recommendations contained in the control reports).            The EPPFMC
expects to provide very targeted assistance in order to strengthen the oversight bodies as well as
results-based management.

4.2.3.I.I Actions taken in 200.5

46.     With regardto administrative budget oversight, the Government has:

    (i)   Provided the Inspection des Finances (IF) and the Contrde Gknkral des Services Publics
          (CGSP), in the context o f the 2006 draft budget, with resources that are generally in line
          with the results expected o f these entities from the standpoint o f their oversight functions
          and the quality o f oversight reports;

                                                   63

    (ii)  Prepared progress reports on the entities regarding a priori controls (IF and CGSP)
          (September 2005); and

    (iii)Prepared third-quarter progress reports on apriori control based on apriori control
          performance indicators.

47.     With a view to enhancingjudicial budget oversight, the Government has:

    (i)   Provided the Accounts Section (in the 2006) budget with resources determined on the
          basis o f the work program adopted for 2006 (September2005);

    (ii)Made      provisions in the 2006 budget for the budgetary implications o f the Accounts
          Section staff review, programmed as part o f the Government action plan for the
          modernizationand strengtheningo f fiscal management;

    (iii)Undertakenthereviewofthelegaldocumentsneededtoincreasethenumberofstaff in
          the Accounts Section from 15 to 67 magistrates; and

    (iv) Begun a review o f the preliminary activities involved in the drafting o f the statutes for
          magistrates inthe Accounts Section.

4.2.3.1.2  Follow up actions

48.     In the context of administrative oversight, the Government will review the documents
establishing and organizing the oversight entities and will implement a training program with a
view to the systematic application o f the international auditing standards and practices for a
posteriori administrative oversight entities (IF-CGSP). Furthermore, it will adhere to the standards
adopted in the framework of 2006 budget preparation in order to provide oversight entities with
humanresources.

49.      The following actions will be taken inthe area o fjudicial oversight: (i)implementation o f a
training program with a view to the systematic application o f international audit standards and
practices, (ii)systematic inclusion o f budgetary allocations in order to make allowances for the
review o f staff inthe Accounts Section (2006-2007); (iii) o f a minimumo f 12 magistrates in
                                                            hiring
2006 and the necessary administrative support staff; and (iv) drafting o f a statute for magistrates in
the Accounts Section (end-March 2006).

4.2.3.2. Enhancing transparency and strengthening budget execution reporting mechanisms

50.      The EPPFMC-supported program i s structured in such a way as to provide support, within
reasonable timeframes, for the systematic production o f budget information, with a view to better
public management and greater transparency o f this process. Noteworthy progress has been made
intwo areas:

    (i)   Transparency and the publication o f economic and financial information, as evidenced by
          the establishment o f a website that provides the public with the main data on budget
          execution by the state and improvement inthe content o f the quarterlypublic finance note.

                                                   64

        These efforts should be continued and systematized from the standpoint of content and
        regularity.

    (ii)PreparationandsubmissionbytheGovernmentofthe2004draftbudgetexecutionlawto
        the National Assembly, thereby meeting institutional deadlines. This regularity will be
        maintainedinthe years ahead.

5 1.   These activities will be strengthened during the post-EPPFMC period, with production
taking place in accordance with the institutional deadlines applicable to 2005 draft budget
executionlaw.

4.2.4. Public procurement

52.    The World Bank has done a CountryProcurementAssessment Report (CPAR) for Mali and
made a number of recommendations intended to strengthen the public procurement institutional
framework and improve actualprocedures. This report is currentlybeingreviewedandis shouldbe
adopted by end-December 2005.        Steps have already been taken to ensure that the Public
Procurement Reform Coordination and Monitoring (Coordination et le Suivi de la Rkforme des
March& Publics, CNCS) committee will be limited in size and will have a tripartite structure
(Government, private sector, and civil society).

                          ANNEX 4: FUNDRELATIONS NOTE
                                    (As ofDecember 5,2005)


1.      The Fund supports Mali's economic program for 2004-07 under a three-year
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) approved in June 2004. Total access
underthe arrangement is SDR 9.33 million, or 10percent o f quota, ofwhich SDR 2.66
million has been disbursed. The second and thirdreviewsunder the arrangement have been
combined because o f delays inreaching understandings on fuel taxes. Followingdiscussions
duringApril 28-May 12, August 28-September 1,and October 1%November 1,2005, staff
supports completion o f the outstanding reviews and approval o fwaivers for nonobservance of
three structural performance criteria. The Executive Board meetingi s tentatively scheduled
for December 19. A disbursement of SDR 2.66 million becomes available on the completion
o fthese reviews. The PRGF-supported quantitative program i s broadly on track through end-
September 2005. Although the recordon the structural programhasbeendisappointing,
steadfast implementationof the program for 2006 would mark significant progress on
addressing key challenges.

2.      The 2005 Article IV Consultations have focused on the management of recent
exogenous shocks and progress toward accelerating growth and poverty reduction. The
policyresponse to shocks has been broadly appropriate and helpedmaintainmacroeconomic
stability. Adverse exogenous shocks during 2004-05 weakened economic growth, budget
finances, and the performance of several significant state enterprises. Agriculture i s beginning
to recover from drought and locusts in2004, while the terms o ftrade declined 13 percent in
2005 to a 25-year low. Measured progress is beingmade toward growth andpoverty reduction
goals. The staff view an acceleration of growth as unlikely unless the vulnerability to shocks
is reduced and structural reforms, particularly private sector development, are accelerated.

                         COPINGWITH ADVERSE EXOGENOUS           SHOCKS

3.      The Malian authorities have put in place broadly appropriate policies to address
the terms of trade shocks that have contributed to weaker income growth and
threatened budgetary objectives. Central to these efforts i s the successful implementation o f
a flexible cotton producer price mechanisminfull consultation with producers. The new
mechanism protects farmer interests while also limitingrisks of budget support to the cotton
sector. The courageous decision to set seed cotton prices at the floor o f the price range for
the 2005/06 seasontackles a significant risk that was hanging over the 2006 budget. Further,
the authorities have continued to pass through increases o f international oil prices to pump
prices to protect budgetary revenue, albeit partially and with some delay. A formula for full
but gradualpass-through andmeasuresto protect the poor couldbetter balance consumer and
revenue objectives.

4.      Maliwill remain vulnerable to further shocks, linkedto climatic conditions and
deteriorating terms of trade, and needs to be prepared to strengthen adjustment efforts
ifnecessary. While the prompt sale anddistributiono ffood stocks contributedto anarrow
avoidance o fwidespread food insecurity, the efficiency o f food markets remains indoubt,
with substantial spatial and temporal price differences. More attentionshould be focused on
impedimentsto food trade, particularly at a regional level. Furtherincreases inoil prices, and

                                               106

declines incotton or gold prices, inthe context o f an undiversifiedeconomic base and a
peggedexchange rate, are also major challenges to continued macroeconomic stability and
growth. Stronger adjustment efforts may be needed, inparticular maintaining a prudent fiscal
position and allowing prices to adjust.

5.       The continuedsupport of developmentpartnershas contributedto a relatively
smooth adjustmentto the difficult externalcircumstances. While some donor budget
support has been delayed into early 2006 for procedural reasons, other donors have increased
their support in2005. Nonetheless, the staffbelieves that continued increases indonor support
are contingent on concrete steps to open up the cotton sector to private capital, financial
management reform, and other operational reforms. However, progress toward privatization
of CMDT has stalled. The initial steps taken by the authorities to improve surveillance o f the
financial operations o fthe state-owned cotton company, CMDT, are welcome. To build on
this success, a comprehensive business plan is requiredto chart the course to privatization, a
clear strategy to disengage the Government from the cotton sector while protecting farmers'
interests, and firm evidence that this strategy i s being implemented.

6.       The staff recommendcloser surveillanceof the financialsector inMali, andin
particular a significant reduction o f forbearance as regards observance o fprudential ratios,
taking into account the unavoidably highlevels o f exposure to the cotton sector. Increased
vigilance i s called for on the part o f the supervisory authorities, notwithstanding ample
system-wideliquidity. Within the constraints o fprudential norms, the authorities should
examine ways o freinvigorating financial intermediation and private sector lending.

7.       As a memberof the West African Economicand MonetaryUnion,Malidoes not
independentlydetermineits exchange ratepolicy.Nonetheless, the staff is o fthe view that
the fixed peg o fthe CFA franc to the euro remains an important nominal anchor for inflation
and remains credible inlight o fthe levels o f reserve coverage. Inconnection with its
WAEMUcommitments, Mali has acceptedthe obligations o fArticle VI11and maintains an
exchange system that i s free o frestrictions on current transactions. Moreover, the Union has
succeededinsubstantially reforming the trade regimewhile economic convergence criteria are
useful discipline on the conduct o f fiscal policies. Competitiveness issues are best addressed
through reforms that will reduce the costs o f doing business and factor price flexibility.

8.       Implementationof other structuralreformsunder the programhas been
generallydisappointingand risks underminingboththe program's medium-term
growth objectiveand poverty reductionobjectives.Although the privatization o fthe
cottonseed oil company i s a move inthe right direction, the broader picture appears to be a
waning commitment to pursue private sector development characterized by continued delays
inthe disengagement from the bankingandtelecommunications sectors. Further,the
deterioration o frelations with companies inrecently privatized sectors, notably electricity and
water, does not augur well for attracting future investment.Implementation o fthe 2006
program o f structural reforms regardingprivatization and management o f state enterprises
would provide a clear signal of the authorities policy priorities.

9.       The authoritiesneedto complement their clear vision of the growthpotentialof
various sectors, with determinedimplementationof reformsto improvethe investment
environmentand boost productivity.Mucho fthe diagnostic work is inplace, andthe next
Poverty Reduction Strategy should, inthe view o f the staff, make explicit the link between a
growth strategy and poverty reduction, as well as maintaining a realistic assessment o f the
growth potential. The discussions o f exchange rate competitiveness inthe context o f a fixed
peg underscore the importance o f increasing the flexibility o f other prices, notably wages and
key product market prices (cotton, fuel), to send market signals to producers and consumers
and improve the efficiency o f resource allocation.

10.      The concept of creatingand usingfiscal space is a usefulterm for analyzingthe
medium-termbudgetaryoutlookand the scope for poverty reductionin Mali. While
public finance management reforms continue to progress and are likely to support revenue
growth over the mediumterm, the specifics o f key budgetary policies relating to pensions, the
efficiency o f spending, and social safety net payments have not receivedthe attention
commensurate with their potential impact on fiscal space. The staff will continue to focus o n
policy advice inthese areas inthe remainder o f the PRGF.Nonetheless, economic growth
remains the key factor increating fiscal space for poverty reducing spending over the medium
term, even inthe context of MDRIand higher thanprojected external assistance. This, inturn,
underscores the importance o f accelerating structural reforms, particularlyrelating to private
sector and financial market development, while addressing the numerous impediments to
doing business.

               ANNEX 5: COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFONMALI


                                  Mali: IMF-World Bank Relations
                                      (As ofDecember 6,2005)


A.      Partnership in Mali's development strategy

1.      Mali's development strategy increasingly emphasizes growth and poverty reduction. Its PRSP
(adopted by the government in May 2002) highlights growth as a precondition for poverty reduction,
and outlines programs for (i)institutional development and improved governance, (ii)human
development and access to basic social services, and (iii)  infrastructure development and support for
key productive sectors. Mali's growth strategy aims to be private sector led and market oriented
toward the West Africa region as well as the global market.

2.      The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a collaborative relationship in supporting the
government's macroeconomic and structural reforms, in line with the guidelines for enhanced Bank-
Fund collaboration. This includes regular participation of Bank staff in the meetings with the
government on the Fund's program review missions, IMF staff participation in Bank development
policy missions and Bank internal review meetings. The IMF takes the lead in macroeconomic
stabilization and the World Bank in social and structural areas, with close collaboration on a few
structural areas that have a particular impact on macroeconomic stability. The Fund's dialogue and
conditionality are consistent with the structural programs agreed with the Bank, and the Bank's
dialogue and conditionality have maintained consistency with the macroeconomic framework
endorsedby the Fund.

B.      World Bank Group strategy

3.      The World Bank Group's strategy, outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board o f Directors on July 31,2003, emphasizes three broad themes in line with the
country's PRSP: (i)promotion o f economic growth; (ii)human resources development; and
(iii) finance management and governance. Mali also benefits under the Bank's Regional
     public
Integration Assistance Strategy (2001), notably a program for connection to the West Afnca Power
Pool, harmonization o f country policies and/or regulatory frameworks (telecommunications,
agrlculture, financial sectors), water resource development o f the Niger and Senegal Rivers,
strengthening o f road transport corridors, and strengthening the regional payments system.

4.      Support to Mali duringfiscal years 2004-06 amounts to US$400 million inthe base case, with
about 30 percent in grants. Budget support o f $25 million i s provided annually through development
policy credits (DPCs), subject to satisfactory macroeconomic management. This i s complemented by
selected investment operations (targeting education, support to growth, and infrastructure
development) and a community-driven development operation. The Bank will prepare a new CAS in
the course o f FY07 in support of Mali's next PRSP (under preparation inthe first half o f 2006). In
that context, the Bank envisions aligning its annual budget support with Mali's budget cycle during
2007, possibly inthe form o f programmatic lendingalong the lines o f a PRSC.

5.      The CAS also includes non-lending activities. Recently completed activities include a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Macroeconomic Growth and Water Variability study,
first phase Poverty Assessment, Country Procurement Assessment Review, and an Integrated
Framework Trade Diagnostic Study. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the cotton sector i s
nearing completion. The Bank has also assisted with development o f medium-term expenditure

frameworks (MTEF) for health, education, and transport, and MTEF support i s envisioned for the
agnculture-livestock-fisheries sector. Planned activities during FY06-07 include a Country Economic
Memorandum on growth and a Public Expenditure Review.

C.       IMF-World Bank collaboration

6.       Areas in which the Fund leads. The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization
including macro-fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial stability and risk
management.

7.       Areas in which the Bank leads. The Bank takes the lead in structural areas where both
institutions have conditionality, including cotton sector reform, privatization and regulatory reform
(telecommunications, banking, financial and energy sectors), and pensionreform. The Bank also leads
in other areas such as: agricultural competitiveness/diversification; rural development (irrigation,
roads, support to producer organizations); private sector development (strengthening the investment
climate, access to business services, support to small/medium enterprises); urban development
(historic rehabilitation/ preservation, landhousing market development, watedroad infrastructure);
transportation policy/infrastructure; energy sector reforms; and social sectors (health, education and
social protection, including HJY/AIDS).The Bank's work in structural areas includes analytical work
and dialogue on trade and growth policies, which form part o f the overall economic policy dialogue.
The Bank collaborates with other donors whenever possible (notably in health, education, agnculture
and cotton sectors), and i s pursuinga harmonized approach for donor support to health and education
reforms as well as on budget support more broadly.

8.       Areas of shared responsibility. Both Bank and Fund collaborate in assessing performance
o f HIPC resource use. Both also monitor progress on budgetary and public expenditure management,
yet emphasize different aspects of the government's reform program in the respective support
operations. The Bank emphasis in this area i s on strengthening all phases o f the public expenditure
system-budget     preparation, budget execution, and budget controls-to     support the government's
objectives o f progressive shifts toward result-based budgeting and improved effectiveness of
expenditures. Bank support i s at the national level in the finance ministry (global MTEF, integrated
information technology system, audit capabilities, budget reporting) and sector ministries (selected
sector MTEFs, inter- and intra-sectoral allocations), as well as at de-concentrated levels (budget
nomenclature, IT system, capacity building). The Fund's emphasis i s on fiscal management,
expenditure management (including financing o f transfers to parastatals), revenue enhancing
measures, and audit capabilities. Table 1 summarizes the areas o f Bank-Fund collaboration inMali.

                            ANNEX 8: PROGRESSON THE MDGs

        Progress to datefor various indicators suggest that Mali may not reach some of the MDG
targets. There are eight MDGs in the declaration adopted by the United Nations. Thefirst seven
MDGs can be grouped intofour categories: a) eradicating extreme poverty; b) eradicating hunger;
c) Achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality; and d) improving health
outcomes and ensuring environmental sustainability. The eighth M D G relates to the development of
a global partnershipfor development. Data on theprogress achieved sofar for the indicators related
to these goals are given in Table A8.1. A more detailed discussion (together with explanations on
the data sources usedfor the estimation) is available as well as in the November 2004 report entitled
Rapport de suivi de la mise en oeuvre des Objectifs du Millhaire pour le Developpement (OMD)
andprepared with the support of UNDP.


    0   Eradicating extreme poverty (Goal 1). The first MDG includes two objectives, the first one
        o f which i s the eradication o f extreme poverty understood as the inability for households to
        generate enough resources in order to meet their basic needs. To monitor progress, the
        target i s to reduce extreme poverty by half between 1990 and 2015, and the main indicator i s
        the share o f the population living below a Purchasing Power Parity poverty line o f US$1 per
        day. Inpractice, rather than using the USSl poverty line, it i s better to rely on a country-
        specific methodology for the estimation o f poverty in order to track progress towards that
        goal.    Estimates prepared by DNSI suggest relatively slow progress towards reducing
        poverty, with the share o f the population in poverty declining from 72-73 percent in 1989 to
        68.3 percent in2001. Alternative estimates based on the cost o f basic needs method suggest
        faster progress, with the poverty headcount reduced from 63.8 percent in 1989 to 56.5
        percent in 2001. In fact, the reduction has been larger since the 1994 devaluation, and this i s
        confirmed using data on assets owned by household in repeated demographic and health
        surveys. But even then, achieving a reduction by half o f poverty by 2015 will require higher
        growth rates in the future as compared to the (already relatively good) performance observed
        inthe 1990s.

        Eradicating hunger (Goal 1). The second objective in the first MDG i s the eradication of
        hunger, with as target a reduction by half the share o f the population which suffers from
        hunger. The indicators for this target are the prevalence o f child malnutrition, as well as
        estimates o f the share o f the population without adequate dietary energy consumption. Data
        on child malnutrition are available from the nationally representative Demographic and
        Health Surveys. Child malnutrition as measured by stuntingactually increased between 1991
        and 2001, from 27.1 percent to 38.0 percent, but other indicators such as wasting showed an
        improvement, from 42.9 percent to 33.0 percent.            Overall, despite progress in some
        indicators, it remains unclear whether a reduction in the various indicators o f malnutrition
        and hunger by half in2015 versus 1990 levels i s likely.

        Achieving universal primary education and promoting gender equality (Goals 2 and 3). The
        next two MDGs are to achieve universal primary education and promote gender equality.
        The target for universal primary education i s the completion o f a full course o f primary
        schooling by boys and girls alike. There are three indicators to measure progress: the net
        enrollment ratio in primary education, the proportion o f pupils starting grade 1 who reach
        grade 5, and the illiteracy rate o f 15-24 year-olds. The target for gender equality and the
        empowerment o f women i s the elimination o f gender disparities in primary and secondary
        education by 2005, and for all levels o f education by 2015. The four indicators suggested for
        monitoring progress over time are the ratio o f girls to boys inprimary, secondary and tertiary
        education, the ratio o f literate females to males o f 15-24 year-olds, the ratio o f women to

                                                   114

  men in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector, and the proportion o f seats held by
  women in national parliament. The data in Table A8.1 suggests significant progress. For
  example, the gross enrollment rate in primary school increased from 26.0 percent in 1990 to
  67.0 percent in 2003, and the ratio o f girls to boys in primary schools increased from 0.62 to
  0.73 over the same period. As for the literacy rate among the population aged 14 to 25, it has
  increased from 18.8 percent in 1991 to 41.5 percent in 2001. A continuation o f this trend
  might enable Mali to reach the MDGs.

e Improving health outcomes and ensuring environmental sustainability (Goals 4 to 7). The
  fourth and fifth MDGs are essentially to reduce child and maternal mortality. The targets for
  child mortality are to reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality
  rate (with three indicators: the under-five mortality rate, the infant mortality rate, and the
  proportion o f one year old children immunized against measles). The targets for maternal
  mortality are to reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality
  ratio (with two indicators: the maternal mortality ratio itself and the proportion o f births
  attended by skilled health personnel). Unfortunately, as shown in Table A8.1, progress i s
  fairly limited in the indicators for infant, child, and maternal mortality.     Today, only a
  minority o f women benefit from a medically assisted delivery. The sixth MDG i s also
  related to health: it consists in combating and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria,
  and other communicable diseases. There, some progress i s achieved, in so far as M a l i has
  been able to avoid high rates o f HIV/AIDS infection. The seventh MDG i s to ensure
  environmental sustainability.     While there are many indicators here, an important one
  consists in halving by 2015 the proportion o f people without sustainable access to safe
  drinking water. Strong progress has been achieved here, with the share o f the population
  with such access increasing from 38.0 percent to 54.1 percent.

e Building a global partnership for development: Selected indicators related to this goal are
  also provided in Table A8.1. After the adoption o f its PRSF, Mali became in March 2003
  the 7" country to achieve the completion point for debt relief under the HIPC initiative,
  which has enabled the country to reduce key debt ratios, including the debt service to export
  ratio which has been reduced by more than half. In line with the priorities established in
  Mali's PRSF, resources from debt relief are being allocated to priority social sectors and
  poverty reduction activities. More generally, during the period 1993-2002, about 60 percent
  of development assistance was allocated to basic social services.

            ANNEX 9: MALI:EXTERNAL              DEBTSUSTAINABILITY         ANALYSIS(DSA)'


1.       Since the 1994 CFA franc devaluation, which increased debt and debt service
indicators substantially, M a l i has benefited from a series of debt relief measures that have
reduced debt service, including the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative. The
HIPC Initiative reduced debt service to sustainable levels as defined by a specific threshold
for the NPV of debt to exports (200 percent original HIPC Initiative and 150percent for the
enhanced HIPC Initiative). Despite the implementation o f sound macroeconomic policies and
prudent debt management, the capacity to repay debt remains subject to moderate risks from
natural and commodity price shocks. Accordingly, lessening the exposure to such shocks
through diversification and improving productivity remains key to lessening medium-term
debt vulnerabilities.

2.       This D S A applies the l o w income country template to the staffs baseline projections,
and applies various robustness checks.2 The analysis shows that external debt sustainability is
broadly achieved under baseline projections in relation to the policy dependent debt burden
thresholds. However, adverse external and internal shocks could result in breaching debt-to-
exports and debt-to-GDP thresholds over the medium term. Accordingly M a l i i s assessed as a
having a moderate risk o f debt distress. Accelerating export growth and maintaining highly
concessional loan assistance are important factors in maintaining debt sustainability. The
multilateral debt reduction initiative (MDFU) expected to b e implemented in 2006 is also
projected to improve the debt ratios significantly over the medium term.

3.       The D S A focuses on the external debt situation, since the existing domestic debt
stock is negligible (less than 2 percent o f GDP) while projected budgetary financing needs
are likely to b e covered by external grant and concessional loan assistance for the foreseeable
future.

  The low income debt sustainability framework compares debt burden indicators to indicative policy-based
thresholds. The thresholds are based on the empirical finding that low-income countries with stronger policies
and institutions tend to have a higher debt carrying capacity. See IDA and IMF, "Operational Framework for
Debt Sustainability Assessments in Low-Income Countries-Further          Considerations" (IDA/R2005-0056),
April 2005.

4.     Mali's external debt ratios have improved compared to the projections made at the
completion point (2003) mainly reflecting a CFA franc appreciation against the U.S. dollar
that has lowered the ratio o f external debt to GDP, and better-than-expected U S dollar-
denominated exports in 2004 that has improved the debt service ratio and the NPV of debt-
to-exports ratio. The NPV o f debt-to-GDP in 2004 has dropped from 33 percent at the
completion point to 25 percent in the DSA. The NPV o f debt-to-exports in 2005 i s reduced
from 118 percent to 106percent while the debt service ratio i s unchanged at 6 percent inboth
analyses.

5.     Macroeconomic projections are based on 2004 actual data, 2005 estimates for debt
and the principal macroeconomic indicators. Projections for key macroeconomic variables
have not been substantively changed compared to enhanced HIPC Initiative completion point
projections made in March 2003. Under the baseline scenario, projected GDP growth rises
gradually compared to the ten-year average o f 5.5 percent (1995-2004), from 5.6 percent
during2005-10 to 6 percent during2011-25. The improvement in growth reflects an
assumption that a gradually increasing role o f the private sector leads to more efficient
investment and production decisions, as well as gradual improvements in the quality o f
human capital. The key sector developments incorporated inthis scenario are: (i)        broad-based
production growth-agriculture       (reflecting both increased planted area and yield), cotton
processing, energy, trade, and services; (ii)   a projected decline in gold output after 2008,
followed by an assumed leveling off o f production from 2014 onward (at 50 tons per year
equivalent to 2005 estimated production); and (iii)    increased growth in non-mining exports
over the longer term, helpingto offset the substantial slowdown inexport growth in2010 and
subsequent years as a result o f the fall in gold production (Box 1). This improvement results
from diversification engendered by removing impediments to trade and investment at the
country and sub-regional level, and a gradual improvement o f financial intermediation by the
banking system.

         average during2011-25.
         Inflationremains at about 2.5 percent duringthe projection period.
         Government revenue i s stable at about 19 percent o f GDP.
         The fiscal deficit, excluding grants, declines to 6.3 percent o f GDP in2010 and to less
         than 6 percent thereafter. Including grants, the deficit declines to less than 3.7 percent
         o f GDP.
         The non-interest current account deficit averages 8.0 percent o f GDP during 2005-10
         then weakens to 9.3 percent o f GDP during 2011-25.
         The volume o f exports grows by about 9 percent during2005-10; given the expected
         decline in gold exports, it averages 4 percent thereafter. The terms o f trade and real
         exchange rate are projectedto remain unchanged from 2010 onwards.
         The volume o f imports i s projected to grow inline with real GDP.
         Public sector external borrowing averages 4-5 percent o f GDP a year; loans are
         assumed to have an average maturity o f 28 years, a grace period o f 7 years, an average
         interest rate o f 0.7 percent, and a grant element o f 50 percent. It i s assumed that
         65 percent o f the new borrowings will come from multilateral sources and the
         remaining 35 percent from bilateral sources. IDA disbursements are assumed to be
         loans.
         Net private capital inflows are assumed to average 2% percent o f GDP a year
         (compared to 2.3 percent over the period 1995-2003).
         A uniform discount rate o f 5 percent is used for NPV calculations.




6.    Mali's external debt ratios are projected to remain below, or close to, applicable
debt thresholds over the period 2005-25 (Box 2, Figure 1, Table 1). Based on the 2004
World Bank Country Policy Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings, Mali i s classified as a
mediumperformer, which determines the relevant debt thresholds. Inparticular:

   0   the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to fall from an average of 28 percent
      during2005-10 to 22 percent in2025, as a result o f steady GDP growth;

      after 2010 as export growth slows, and breaches the threshold level o f 150percent by
      a moderate amount at the end o fthe projection period; and,


   0  the debt service-to-export ratio is projected to decline marginally during the

                           STANDARD AND BOUND TESTS FOR BASELINE

7.       The standard set of sensitivity checks on the evolution of debt ratios suggest that
M a l i continues to be vulnerable to external shocks over the period 2005-25 (Figure 2,
Table 2). Under an alternative scenario which sets key parameters to their historical average
values, debt to GDP and the W V o f debt to exports rise above the relevant threshold levels
by2010, although owing to a high degree o f concessional loan assistance, the debt service
ratio remains below the threshold. The key factor in the historical scenario i s the high
noninterest current account deficit (14.3 percent o f GDP compared to projections o f around
9 percent o f GDP). Ina second scenario, with public sector loans at less favorable terms, the
external debt stock ratio indicates that Mali becomes at risk o f debt distress by the end of the
projection period, underscoring the importance o f retaining high levels o f concessional
assistance (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1).

8.       The bound sensitivity tests, assume adverse shocks to key parameters first
separately, and in some cases jointly. The main results o f these sensitivity tests are that
despite improved GDP growth and containment o f inflation, Mali remains vulnerable to
exogenous shocks, particularly:

0   a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline would result ina sharp
    increase in the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio in2006, which would cross the threshold
    by2007 placingMali at risk o fdebt distress until2022; and,

0   a temporary shock on export growth o f one standard deviation i s significant inmagnitude
    owing to the highstandard deviation o f exports. The NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio reaches
    153 percent in2007.

9.       Based on these findings, this analysis suggests that Mali has a moderate risk of
debt distress. The baseline scenario indicates that the debt-to-exports ratio is marginally
above the debt burdenthreshold toward the end o f the projectionperiod. Stress testing results
in the debt-to-GDP and debt-to-exports indicators exceeding thresholds over the medium
term (for export shocks, a 30 percent devaluation scenario and using historical averages o f
key data), though the debt service-to-exports indicator remains well below the 20 percent
threshold in all cases. The low level of the debt service-to-exports indicator in both the
baseline and the stress testing highlights the importance o f maintaining a high degree o f
concessionality in future lending to Mali. Risks would clearly increase if, over the medium
term, the level o f concessionality were to decrease.

10. Debt sustainability was also assessed under a Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) scenario. The MDRI scenario assumes a cut-off date of January 1,2005 for IMF
and African Development Fund debt, and January 1, 2004 for IDA (International
Development Association) loans. The scenario assumes an implementation date o f
January 1,2006 for IMF and AfDB and July 1,2006 for IDA. The projected loan
disbursements from multilaterals are assumed to be somewhat lowered relative to the
baseline as a result o f MDRI, reflecting the amount and distribution o f compensatory
financing for IDA and the AfDB relative to debt service relief. Nonetheless, net transfers
from multilaterals would increase as a result of MDRIover the medium term. This scenario
results in a halving o f the debt-to-GDP ratio in2006 and reduces the debt service ratio by half
over the medium term to a range o f 3-5 percent o f exports. However, over the longer term
(twenty years) the MDRI scenario debt indicators approach those in the baseline scenario
(determined by new borrowing over the period 2005-25). The risk of debt distress in the
MDRIscenario is low over the mediumterm, but inthe long term would returntowards the
moderate risk level assessed in the baseline scenario. The scenario i s based on current
assumptions and may need to be revised when the institution-specific terms o f MDRI are
finalized.

                                         CONCLUSION

11.     The analysis indicates that external debt sustainability is broadly achieved under
baseline projections in relation to the policy dependent debt burden thresholds. However,
adverse external and internal shocks could result in breaching debt-to-exports and debt-to-
GDP thresholds over the mediumterm. Accordingly Mali is assessedas a having a moderate
risk o f debt distress. Accelerating export growth and maintaining highly concessional loan
assistance are important factors in maintaining debt sustainability. The multilateral debt
reduction initiative (MDRI) expected to be implementedin2006 i s also projectedto improve
the debt ratios significantlyover the mediumterm.

   ANNEX 10: BANK VIEW ONMEDIUMTERM COTTON SECTOR REFORMS


The competitiveness of Mali's cotton. Competitiveness can be measured by comparing
production cost structure with neighboring countries, as summarized in the table below. Even
though some factors can explain the difference in cost price, like the price paid to farmers and
the level o f interest payments, CMDT's overheads are still highby industry standards (Table
A1O.l). Moreover, incentives are insufficient to push CMDT to permanently improve its
efficiency and reduce its expenses and overheads.

To date, Mali has expanded cotton production by expanding the amount o f land under
cultivation. However, as accessible and viable land becomes constrained, it i s increasingly
important for Mali to focus on increasing yields. Mali is lagging behind in research and
technology for productivity improvements and quality management. This includes a need to
focus on improved pest resistance, soil fertility, and seed de-linting. Many o f Mali's
competitors are using genetically modified cotton that i s pest resistant and thus higher
yielding, but Mali has not yet beguntesting this new variety. At farm level, productivity and
yields have been declining for 15 years. Incentives are absent for the various actors to take
risks, innovate and invest in productivity improvements.         Because o f the CMDT's weak
financial    situation stemming from its weak commercial orientation and corporate
governance-a       contributing factor beingthe lack of private sector involvement inthe sector-
there i s a backlog o f neededcapital investmentinginning equipment.

Proposed Bank Strategy. The World Bank i s committed to continuing support to Mali's
cotton sector reforms; however, conscious that there are competing priorities for investment in
health, education and infrastructure, the Bank i s reticent about supporting continued sector
deficits in the absence o f significant reforms. Whatever the level o f aid provided, there i s a
highopportunity cost for the use o fthese funds to cover CMDT's deficits. Eventhough some
of this funding also subsidized producers in Mali, it is not well-targeted assistance, since
cotton producers do not in all cases represent Mali's poorest. As such, Mali's partners believe
that in the coming year there i s a need to work together to accomplish the following goals in
the cotton sector:

    o Re-establish a credible dialogue on reform inthe cotton sector, including pursuingthe
         new calendar for privatization, agreeing on an acceptable privatization scenario, and
         developing a plan for managing the sector until privatization can be achieved.      This
         plan should minimize the risk o f a large contingent liability on the Government's
         budgetfrom CMDT's deficits between now and2008.

    o Discuss with all partners the needto increase Mali's competitiveness in the medium
         term. The Government will need a clear strategy and action plan that the donors can
         support. The Bank i s moving ahead with its support to rural development in Mali

                                                125

       through two investmentoperations (PCDA and PACR) due to be effective at the end o f
       FY06. These instrumentsare flexible and can be adjusted to help the cotton sector by,
       among other possibilities, building capacity among producer organizations and
       accelerating technology adaptation.

   o The partners will also continue to work with the Government on risk and price
       management inthe sector.

Strategic actions: As Mali is a price taker on the international market, strategic actions
resulting from these proposals are the following:

Inthe short term:

   o Close surveillance of CMDT management with a view to reducing national budget
       risks;
   o Implementationo fthe new cottonproducerprice mechanism;
   o Transparent information of sub-sector stakeholders and political authorities on the
        reform process through implementation o f a coherent communication programme;
   o Support to diaIogue with WTO with a view to suppressing/modelling subsidies inthe
       North.

Inthemediumterm:

   o Upstream, control production costs through resolutiono f farm-level technical problems
        related to improvement o f cotton yields (less than 1 ton per hectare today), socio-
        economic analysis o f farming units, and downstream, improvement o f cotton quality;
   o Buildingproducers' capacity to position them as stakeholders recognized by the new
        economic environment;
   o Treatment of critical functions o f the sub-sector especially those as research, seed
        production, input funding, cotton tracks;
   o CMDT pnvatisation in 3 or 4 blocs by 2008 and liberalisation o f the sub-sector inthe
        mediumterm period thereafter.

     ANNEX 11: COTTON PRODUCTION, MALI'S ECONOMY AND POVERTY
                                        (Preliminaryfindings)'


This annex provides estimations o f the potential impact of different levels o f cotton production and
producer prices on Mali's economy, and on cotton producers. Following the agreement signed
between the Government, producers, and C M D T on January 13, 2005, the baseline price level for the
campaign 2005-06 was set at 160 CFAFkg, a sharp drop versus the price o f 210 CFAFkg that had
been provided to producers in 2004-2005. This reduction in price i s not expected however to lead to
an immediate reduction in production, as total production i s expected to reach 600,000 tons in 2005-
2006, an increase over the previous year. This annex provides some background to explain this
apparently surprising outcome and documents what might happen if, under sustained lower prices,
producers would decide to reduce production inthe future.

1. Why do farmers continue to produce so much cotton despite lower prices? Five main reasons may
explain the paradox. First, to produce cotton gives producers the certitude they will get a monetary
income at a predetermined moment. This income helps them to face current and unexpected expenses
(health, education). Cotton production offers them a certain security despite the price decrease, with
the guarantee that CMDT will buy the whole production and that they will be paid relatively quickly
(an advance o f 80 percent o f the production value as soon as the CMDT receives the production and
20 percent at the end o f the season). Second, to produce cotton gives them access to credit. Producers
need this credit to get access to inputs but also to improve their productive material or for
consumption purposes. In the cotton areas, the banking system and the micro-finance institutions do
not deliver credits to farmers who do not produce cotton. The access to credits usually goes through
guarantees linked to cotton production. Third, to produce cotton gives farmers access to inputs. The
C M D T no longer delivers inputs for cereals production. Farmers need those inputs for the cotton
production but also for the cereals production. That i s the reason why some farmers decide to produce
small plots o f cotton and use part o f the CMDT-provided inputs for their cereals fields, which are the
basis o f food self-sufficiency. Fourth, to produce cotton gives farmers access to training and education
concerning new varieties, technical improvements, etc. Finally, cotton production in any given year
has positive "after effects" on cereal yields in the next year as the use o f chemical and/or natural
inputsneeded for cotton cultivation improves soil fertility at crop rotation time. In other words, to
belong to the "cotton club" brings many advantages to farmers, which may explain why most o f them
will continue to produce cotton at least for some time, despite the falling prices.

2. I s cotton production profitable at the existing lower prices? Few data are available to assess how
profitable cotton production i s to farmers. Preliminary analysis o f a survey o f cotton producers
implemented in the summer o f 2004 suggests that only those producers who are better equippedmake
substantial gains on their production.       More precisely, while in the 2003-2004 crop season the
nominal price paid to producers was 190 CFAFkg, the net price received was o f the order of 100
CFAFkg. The main costs that explain the difference between the nominal and net prices are the costs
of inputs (estimated at about 70 CFAFkg in'the survey, but other data suggest that this cost may reach
up to 90 CFAFkg, whish is fairly high), and the reimbursement o f loans, most probably to CMDT at
about 15 CFAFkg. Other costs include cotton land maintenance costs, cotton harvest costs, and
cotton transportation costs, as well as broader investment costs, production costs, and taxes and fees.
The total "non-CMDT" costs vary from 43 CFAFkg to 131CFAFkg depending on the method used
for allocating part of these costs to the production o f cotton, and depending on the type o f producer
considered. The key finding was that producers belonging to the better equipped groups (groups "A"
and "B" in the CMDT typology) were the most profitable. For poorer households who do not have

good equipment, cotton production i s less advantageous. This means that poorer households could
very well be those who will stop producing cotton if prices remain low for extended periods o f time.
Now, one important feature o f the new price mechanism i s that producers will benefit from a higher
share of the world price. This means that they will not have to suffer from the full impact o f the drop
inprices for the present season.

3. What may happen to the economv and poverty in case o f a reduction in cotton production over time
due to low prices? Two types o f simulations were implementedusing recent data for Mali.


    0   Usinga Social Accounting Matrix, the impact o f a hypothetical25 percent drop inproduction
        and processing o f cotton was analyzed. The extent o f the impact on the economy and various
        household groups depends in large part on the extent to which areas cultivated under cotton
        would affect other crops.    For example, if a 25 percent drop in the cotton sector were
        compensated by a 5 percent increase in production o f food crops and livestock, the impact on
        aggregate output would be o f the order o f 2.1 percent o f GDP.         Aggregate household
        income/consumption would be reduced by 1.9 percent. Interestingly, apart from rural
        households in cotton producing areas, the most affected groups would be industrial
        households engaged in the ginning and value added process.          This means that it i s not
        necessarily the poorest households who would be affected the most.


    0   Additional work was conducted with an agricultural model for Mali. The simulations assess
        the impact o f a decrease inproducer prices up to 155 CFAFkg. Under such pricing structure,
        the land area under cotton cultivation i s reduced by about 30 percent, while the area for other
        crops i s increased. The model makes it feasible to estimate the impact on the FA0 measure
         of under-nutrition, by computing the amount o f food available in the country from domestic
        production and imports. The total availability o f food combined with household survey-based
         estimates o f the inequality in food consumption provides estimates o f the probability o f
        under-nutrition which are o f a similar order o f magnitude as existing estimates o f child
         malnutrition. Because food production would increase after a drop in cotton prices, and
        because this would help to reduce food prices, the net impact o f the loss o f income from
         cotton production and prices would be fairly small at the national level, but the situation o f
         households inareas such as Sikasso would be threatened.

The conclusion from the above simulations is that the impact o f the drop in producer prices on
poverty and Mali's economy i s not necessarily straightforward. On the one hand, the reduction in
prices implies a loss in income and profitability o f cotton production for producers, but so far these
have not reduced their production for a number o f different reasons. Ifprices were to remain low for
some time, some producers may quit producing cotton, which would have a negative impact on GDP,
poverty, and under-nutrition. Yet the magnitude o f this negative impact need not be very large, as
producers would probably shift to other crops or livestock production, which may have other potential
benefits, for example in terms o f food security. Perhaps the key message o f the work i s that close
monitoring o f the impact o f changes in prices and production i s required, so as to be able to provide
compensatory measures for producers if and when needed.

         ANNEX 12: ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OIL PFUCE DEVELOPMENTS


1. Inflationaryimpact

Up until August 2005, there has beenvirtually no inflationary impact of oil prices since oil is a small
share o f the CPI and the authorities have partially offset the petrol price increases by reducing the tax
on petroleum products in the face of rising prices due to food shortages (see next paragraph). Pass-
through was initially partial during end 2004 for some petroleum products (premiudregular gasoline
and fuel oil), zero for other products (kerosene, gas-oil, diesel).                    In recent months, prices o f all
categories have been allowed to increase somewhat (Table A12.1) thereby allowing partial pass
through o f international prices to the pump (Figure 1).

Oil price pass through in itself has had minimal impact
on inflation, relative to the impact o f the food price
component o f the CPI.        Inflation in Mali i s driven
mainly by food product imbalances. Due mainly to the
2004 drought (and partly to the locust invasion) food i s
in short supply and food price inflation has risen 19
percent, including a 45 percent increase incereal prices.
Average nonfood inflation remains near zero, although
fuel prices have increased by 14 percent (see graph).
As a result o f food price inflation, CPI inflation has
increased significantly on month-to-monthbasis, and on
annual basis i s projected to increase from previous


                                                             129

estimate o f 2.5 percent in 2005 to 5.5 percent. This follows an inflation rate o f -3.1 percent in 2004
and a rate o f -1.3 percent in2003.

In view o f its small share (as a component in the nonfood component) of CPI, high oil prices are
unlikely to have major impact on inflation in 2005. As oil prices continue to rise however, we can
anticipate a greater impact on inflation next year, at a time when food price inflation i s expected to
drop (due to relatively good rains this year).

2. Fiscal impact

There i s no subsidy on petroleum products since importers (all private) purchase oil at international
market prices.'     However, pass through o f international prices to the pump i s regulated through
adjustments in the petroleum tax, and thus results in foregone fiscal revenues. A systematic estimate
of foregone revenues due to the petrol tax reductions i s not currently available; however, available
information points to foregone revenues inthe order o f 1percent o f GDP over the past year.

At the same time, Mali is currently facing rising shortfalls intax revenue collections across all major
tax categories (amounting to about 1percent of GDP duringJanuary-July 2005), against a backdrop of
increasing food security demands on the budget. As a result, budget execution at initial programrates
i s under strain.     While there's no indication yet o f expenditure tightening, some expenditure
tighteningmeasures (for non-povertyprograms) may have to be made inthe fourth quarter 2005.

3. BOPImpact

The terms o f trade i s projected to deteriorate in 2005 relative to initial projections (to 13 percent year-
on-year from 10 percent), due to combined effect o f rising oil prices and falling cotton prices. Rising
oil prices have increased the petroleum share o f imports by 5 percentage points in 2005 (an amount
equivalent to US$78 million) relative to initial projections. This i s only partially offset by an increase
in exports-the     decline in non-gold non-cotton exports relative to initial projections undercuts the
expected increases ingold and cotton exports, which otherwise would have fully offset the increase in
petrol imports. Together, these shifts contribute to an overall weakening o f the current account
balance by CFAF 43 billion (a worsening o f 1.6 percentage points o f GDP).

4. Growthprospects

The extent to which rising oil prices has impacted on GDP growth i s unclear, relative to the negative
GDP shock stemming from the fallout o f the 2004 drought.

5. Governmentresponseto rising oil prices

As mentioned above, the Government has regulated the petroleum tax to limit the pass through o f
higher oil prices to the economy. This measure comprises a targeted component to the poor, to the
extent that price increases on household oil have so far been avoided. However, whether overall the
tax measure overall i s regressive or progressive i s yet to be determined.                 However due to other
simultaneous shocks to the economy, in particular the drought impact on food prices mentioned
above, oil on its own i s not expected to be a major cause o f social disruption.

 'Oilimports  to Mali are entirely handled by private sector firms, at prices that reflect international market prices.
A Commissionto Monitor the PetroleumTax Mechanism (comprised o frepresentatives fromthe government, oil
retailers, and consumers) meets monthly to, among other items, review price trends of the oil suppliers and
determine the price for oil at the pump (by setting the petroleum tax) at levels that also ensure that oil retailers are
able to cover their costs plus a small margin.

         ANNEX 13: SIMULATING THE EFFECTS OF AN OIL PRICE SHOCK:
                      A SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRIX FRAMEWORK


Rising fuel prices have not generated high levels o f inflation in Mali, inpart because o f a reduction in the
taxes imposed on a range o f oil-related products. This annex provides an estimation o f the impact that the
increase in oil prices might have had on the Malian economy and on specific groups o f households in the
absence o f such measures and other adjustments that may have taken place in the economy. As such, the
results can be interpreted as a first very rough estimation o f the impact and benefit incidence o f the
measures that have been taken inorder to avoid large increases inprices.

Some previous studies o f the impact o f oil price changes on households have usedmodels based on input-
output (IO) tables in order to estimate price changes for commodities caused by a shock inthe unit cost o f
oil. These studies have then relied on household expenditures information from household surveys to derive
consumption shares o f different commodities by expenditure percentiles. Combining these two pieces o f
information, for example, yields data on changes inexpenditure o f various household categories that can be
used to assess impacts on poverty. The methodology used here i s based instead on a SAM-multiplier
model, which can be used as a price formation model. We use a S A M framework for two main reasons: (i)
to filly exploit the interaction between sectors, factors, and institutions contained in the SAM; and (ii)  to
track and quantify the intensity of the most important paths through which the effect o f a price change on
household expenditure unfolds. Based on a 2001 Mali S A M constructed with support from the Belgian
Poverty Reduction Partnership program, we simulated the effects on sectoral prices and the cost o f living o f
households o f a 34 percent increase in the price o f petroleum inMali. The results are presented inTables
A13.1 andA13.2.

Table A13.1 shows the impact o f the oil shock on other production prices inthe economy inthe absence o f
policy response and adjustment in the economy. A 34 percent price increase in the petroleum sector leads
to a 15 percent increase in the price o f Utilities, an 11.5 percent increase in the price o f Agncultural
services, and 10 percent in the producer price o f Other manufactures. The price effect o f the shock on
agriculture, except agro-services @e., Food crops, Export crops, Livestock, Forestry, and Fishery) ranges
from 2.3 to 2.8 percent. This is not surprising since petroleum accounts for 0.0 percent to 12.8 percent o f
agriculture's intermediate inputs compared to 54 percent for Agncultural services. Meanwhile, the
secondary (industry) experiences a price response ranging from 2.2-15 percent. Finally, the price effect o n
the tertiary (services) goes from 2.7 percent inTrade to 6.6 percent for Transport and communication. The
so-called direct effects in Table A13.1 reflect the shares o f petroleum as an intermediate input in various
 sectors. Besides Utilities, Agricultural services, and Other manufacturing, Transport and Communications,
andEducation exhibit a high direct effect as a proportion o f the price change. A similar pattern is conveyed
through the petroleum intensity o f sectors. Infact, in general, sectors with heavy reliance on petroleum are
mostly affected. Change in producer prices (weighted average o f price responses, with shares o f aggregate
 GDP as weights) is estimated at 3.48 percent which should be considered an upper bound given the fixed
 consumption shares assumption inherent in S A M modeling. Around 25 percent o f the price change is
 explained by direct effects, the rest beingdue to other interactions between sectors.

Table A13.2 gives the price changes faced by households. The two household categories that are most
affected are households whose head works in Public services in Bamako (4.92 percent increase in cost of
living), and those in Urban - Other activities (3.93 percent). These households are also characterized by
highest average per capita consumption levels and exhibit highshares o f petroleum intotal consumption (as
i s reflected in the higher direct effects). The impact on the rural (poorer) households is smaller and around
2.0 percent partly explained by lower shares o f petroleum in final consumption. The total change in
households' cost o f living index (inflation) is 2.99 percent with roughly 25 percent explained by direct
effects.

Two main conclusions can be learned from the analysis. Inpart thanks to policy measures such as reduced
taxation, Mali has not suffered from higher inflation due to the increase in oil shocks, as would have been
predicted on the basis of the S A M analysis. On the other hand, because those households who would have
beenmost affected by the increase in oil prices tend to be better off, it can also be argued that the reduction
in taxes o f oil-related products have benefited disproportionately a segment o f the population that was
already better off. To the extent that the reduction intax revenues may have at the margin an impact o n the
ability of the authorities to deliver inother areas, includingthe social sectors, this poses a difficult dilemma
between protecting the population from price increases, but in so doing transferring a larger share of the
reduction in taxes to groups of households who may not be poor. Other better targeted measures could
potentially have beenconsidered inorder to ensure a more pro-poor distribution o f the protection measures
implemented.
