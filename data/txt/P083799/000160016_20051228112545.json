policy and Public Finance\n            Management Credit Project contributes to implementing the\n            first, second and fourth pillars of Mali's Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Framework (PRSF). Specifically, the\n            project aims to: (1) promote growth and poverty reduction\n            through (a) strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal\n            management and (b) implementing key actions underpinning\n            Mali's long-term growth and competitiveness; and, (2)\n            improve efficiency, accountability and transparency in\n            public finance management through strengthening (a) public\n            expenditure management at central and decentralized levels\n            and (b) the public procurement system. Macroeconomic\n            management would be strengthened through prudent expenditure\n            management; and greater linkage between the macroeconomic\n            framework, the budget and the implementation of the PRSF.\n            The growth support agenda would be strengthened through\n            continued implementation of financial sector development\n            actions to strengthen the health of the sector and enhance\n            access to finance particularly longer term funds;\n            implementation of key transport sector actions to improve\n            quality and lower cost of transportation services; and\n            implementation of trade facilitation measures to reduce\n            processing/transactions costs of trade. Public expenditure\n            management (PEM), drawing from the Government's\n            Consolidated Action Plan for the Modernization and\n            Improvement of Public finance management, would be\n            strengthened through continuing the automation of\n            information flows between key MEF de-concentrated\n            departments (notably, treasury, budget and financial\n            control) to increase information quality and transparency,\n            improving the quality of published material on the financial\n            and expenditure situation of the Government to increase\n            transparency; and continued improvements in PEM processes,\n            particularly internal and external budget control\n            mechanisms. Public procurement would be strengthened through\n            adoption of a coherent action plan and commencing its\n            implementation, comprising updating of the\n            legislative/regulatory framework, strengthening the linkages\n            between public procurement and public finance management\n            processes, and strengthening the private sector's\n            access to public procurement opportunities."}, "docdt": "2005-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
