Economic Policy and\n            Public Finance Management Credit (EPPFMC) Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: for a country\n            such as Mali with weak institutional and administrative\n            capacities, it is important to be realistic on what can be\n            achieved, and be selective on the issues to be undertaken\n            within a short timeframe; the operation demonstrated the\n            merits of including in Mali's policy-based lending\n            operations, policy and institutional reforms measures\n            complementary to and supportive of ongoing sector\n            operations; it is important to develop a complete\n            M&E/Results framework to enable clear assessment of\n            program outcomes; and finally, policy measures should be\n            better matched to the objectives sought."}, "docdt": "2007-08-06T00:00:00Z"}
