IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
1.    This Report covers the implementation of the Fourth Telecommunications Project in
Nepal, supported by Credit 1588-NEP. The Credit for SDR 20.7 million to the Nepal
Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) was signed on April 10, 1986, became effective on
December 17, 1986 and was closed on June 30, 1994, one year later than the original closing
date. Final disbursement took place on November 28, 1994, at which time a balance of SDR
1,239,515 was canceled. Cofinancing for the project was provided by DANIDA, FINNIDA and
JICA.
2.    This report has been prepared by Alberto Cruzat (Task Manager), Peter Wright, Raja
Basu and David Delgado from IENTI for the South Asia Region and reviewed by Robert Panfil,
Chief SA2IN, Marie Garcia-Zamor, Chief SAIIN, Kazuko Uchimura, Project Advisor, and
David Groves, Project Advisor. The borrower provided comments that are included as Appendix
I to the ICR.
3.    Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion mission,
July 3-17, 1994. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower contributed to the ICR
by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and commenting on the draft ICR.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT 1588-NEP
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.    Public  telecommunications  services  in  Nepal are  provided  by  the  Nepal
Telecommunications Corporation (NTC), a fully Government owned corporation under the
overall guidance of the Ministry of Information and Communications (MOIC) of His Majesty's
Government (HMG).
2.    IDA's involvement in Nepal's telecommunications sector began in 1969 with a credit of
US$1.7 million (Credit 166-NEP) approved in November 1969. Since then IDA has financed
four more operations : Credit 397-NEP for US$5.5 million approved in June 1973; Credit 799-
NEP for US$14.5 million approved in August 1978, Credit 1588-NEP for US$22 million
approved in April 1986 (closed in June 1994) and Credit 2364-NEP for US$55 million approved
in April 1992. The December 1977 PPAR report for Credit 166-NEP and April 1989 report for
Credits 397-NEP and 799-NEP rated these projects as successful overall, contributing
significantly to the development of infrastructure, improving the quality of telecommunications
services and supporting NTC's institutional development.
Proiect Obiectives and Project Description
3.    The Project was designed to strengthen NTC as an institution, expand local telephone
facilities in Kathmandu and other urban areas, provide telephone services for the first time to
about 90 rural communities, expand facilities to cater to resultant additional domestic long
distance and international traffic, expand existing telex facilities and extend service to towns
other than Kathmandu.
4.    The Project included: (a) funding of management consultants, technical assistance and
fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff; (b) installation of (i) about 35,000 lines of local
automatic switching equipment with associated cable distribution network and subscriber plant to
connect about 31,000 new subscriber lines, and replace 1,370 lines of all remaining manual
exchanges, (ii) about 2,500 additional terminals in national/international trunk exchanges, (iii)
about 75 transmission systems in the long distance network, (iv) equipment for expansion of the
existing earth station and the telex exchange, and (v) about 550 local and long distance public
call offices in urban areas and about 200 long distance connections and public call offices in
about 90 rural areas; (c) provision of air conditioning and power equipment for
telecommunications buildings, vehicles, computer equipment, teleprinters, office aids and
training equipment, and (d) civil works for laying of cable ducts, and construction of cable
networks and buildings for telecommunications equipment and offices.



iv
Proiect Results
5.     With the use of the additional funding derived from exchange rate fluctuation, the
achievements of the Project exceeded the initial estimates. Approximately 43,000 lines were
added to the network compared to the Project estimate of 35,000. Twenty Multi-Access Radio
Telephone Systems (MARTS) were installed (with 12 already commissioned) connecting 3,500
rural subscriber lines. Due to the physical extension of the Project the closing date was extended
by one year.
6.     NTC's financial position was satisfactory throughout the Project and it met the financial
covenants set under the project. There were some delays in submission of audited financial
statements but these were not significant. The internal economic and financial rate of return,
calculated over a life cycle of 15 years, were 14.5% and 16.8% respectively, compared with the
Appraisal estimates of 17.3% and 16.1% respectively over a life cycle of 22 years. Additionally,
the economic rate of return is larger than the Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC) of 10%.
However, collections, especially from HMG, have been a persisting problem during the Project.
Nevertheless, with IDA's assistance, NTC reached a satisfactory agreement with HMG which
settled the total amount of Government arrears as of April 1994. Also, with the assistance of
FINNIDA, there has been considerable progress in the area of billing. A countrywide automated
billing system was commissioned in 1993 to process more than 95% of the bills issued. As a
follow-up, a computerized ledger and billing system will be installed under the Credit 2364-NEP.
Proiect Sustainability
7.     Under the Project, the NTC has established a sizable telecommunications network in 73
of Nepal's 75 districts to support Nepal's developing economy. This company is sustainable in
terms of cost recovery and general financial situation. Through the establishment of a MIS
system, automated billing facilities, and institutional studies, the Project has paved the way for
later projects to complete the transition to a private sector, commercially run organization. The
Project has also strengthened the procurement and implementation capabilities in NTC. The
overall management of the organization has been modernized but more work needs to be done in
this respect. This is being done under Telecommunications V which is focusing on sector wide
restructuring to introduce competition in existing and new services.
Conclusion
8.     After initial teething problems with the co-financing arrangement, and the contracting of
management consultants, the Project was smoothly implemented. The objectives of the Project
relating to (a) physical expansion and (b) institutional objectives were substantially fulfilled.
The Association's main contribution were three-fold: (i) establishing the co-financing
arrangement and grant facilities; (ii) for the first time connecting the rural areas to the
telecommunications network; and (iii) establish the groundwork for future sectoral reform in line
with the trend in other countries. The main lessons from this Project are: (a) that close Project
implementation supervision is critical to avoiding major problems; (b) that it is advisable to have
advanced preparation of procurement documents; and (c) that the size of the T/A included in the
Project has to be tailored to the absorbing capacity of the entity. These lessons were applied in
the Fifth Project preparation.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT 1588-NEP
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Statement of Obiectives
1.    The Fourth Telecommunications Project was a major component of Nepal's FY86-90
telecommunications development program which had a total investment of about US$115 million.
Investment on the IDA funded Project represented about 57% of this total (US$ 65.3 million). The IDA
credit of SDR 20.7 million (US$ 22 million equivalent at the time of effectiveness) was provided to His
Majesty's Government (HMG) to be onlent to Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) at an
annual interest rate of 12% repayable over 10 years after 5 years of grace, with NTC assuming all foreign
exchange risks. In addition to IDA, DANIDA (US$7.5 million), FINNIDA (US$5.3 million) and JICA
(US$ 30 million) contributed as donors to the Fourth Project (see Table 8B). NTC, a fully Government
owned corporation under the overall guidance of the Ministry of Information and Communications
(MOIC) of HMG is responsible for the provision of public telecommunications services in Nepal.
2.    IDA's involvement in Nepal's telecommunications sector began in 1969 with a credit of US$1.7
million (Credit 166-NEP approved in November 1969). Since then IDA has financed four more
operations: Credit 397-NEP for US$5.5 million, approved in June 1973; Credit 799-NEP for US$14.5
million, approved in August 1978, Credit 1588-NEP for US$22 million approved in April 1986, closed in
June 1994; and Credit 2364-NEP for US$55 million, approved in April 1992. The December 1977 PPAR
report on Credit 166-NEP and the April 1989 report on Credits 397-NEP and 799-NEP rated these
projects as successful overall, contributing significantly to the development of infrastructure, improving
the quality of telecommunications services, and supporting NTC's institutional development.
3.    The Fourth Project was approved by IDA on April 30, 1985 but was not signed until April 10,
1986, due to HMG's delays in undertaking a 20% increase in tariffs which was required as a condition of
effectiveness. The Project was designed to strengthen NTC as an institution, expand local telephone
facilities in Kathmandu and other urban areas, provide telephone services for the first time to about 90
rural communities, expand facilities to cater to resultant additional domestic long distance and
international traffic, expand existing telex facilities and extend service to towns other than Kathmandu.
4.    The main components of the Project were as follows:
a) enhancement of NTC's management and operational capabilities through management
consultants, and fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff;
b) development of long term planning capability within NTC for long term development of the
sector through sector experts;
c) provision and installation of about 35,000 lines of digital switching equipment (including
1,370 lines for replacement of all existing manual equipment), about 159,000 pair-kilometers
of telephone cables, about 390 km of cable ducts, jointing materials and other accessories for
the net expansion of local network capacity by about 33,630 lines;



2
d) provision and installation of subscriber facilities to connect about 31,000 new subscriber
lines;
e) provision and installation of about 2,500 additional circuit terminals in the existing
national/international trunk exchange;
f) provision and installation of about 500 local and 50 long distance coin boxes for public call
offices in urban areas to serve non-subscribing public;
g) provision and installation of three high capacity digital microwave radio systems on main
routes and twelve small capacity digital microwave radio systems on spur routes;
h) provision and installation of about 60 VHF/UHF radio systems to connect about 200 long
distance telephone connections and public call offices in about 90 rural communities;
i) provision and installation of equipment for expansion of the earth station for international
satellite communication;
j) provision and installation of equipment for expansion of the existing telex exchange by 250
terminations, 4 VFT systems and provision of about 150 electronic teleprinters;
k) provision and installation of air conditioning and power equipment in telecommunication
buildings;
I) provision of vehicles for project implementation, computer equipment, office aids and
training equipment; and
m) civil works associated with laying of cable ducts, and construction of cable networks and
buildings for telecommunications equipment and offices.
5.    The experience gained under the first three IDA projects played a major role in designing the
Fourth Project, the thrust of which was directed towards continued expansion of the network and
institutional improvement in NTC of planning, project implementation and strengthening of NTC's
financial position. The technical assistance program therefore included carrying out an institutional
review, tariff studies, network planning, establishment of a MIS and automated billing facility,
revaluation of fixed assets, and development and implementation of technical and financial training
programs. To emphasize the importance of the technical assistance, the appointment of management
consultants was a condition of credit effectiveness
6.    The Project was initially appraised in September 1983, with Negotiations in April 1984, which
ended without agreement on the issues and without agreed Minutes of the discussions. IDA required
HMG to present the cofinancing agreements to cover the balance of costs of the Project as a condition of
Board presentation. This condition was not acceptable to HMG. Subsequently, HMG negotiated with
other Governments cofinancing for the Project which affected both the project scope and IDA financing.
Consequently it became necessary to reappraise the Project in February 1985. Final negotiations took
place in the field between February and March 1985, and the Credit was presented to the Board in April
30, 1985.



3
7.     At the time of Board presentation the cost of the Project to be financed by IDA was set at SDR
20.7 million (US$22.0 million equivalent), but in the course of Project implementation the Project scope
was expanded to utilize exchange rate gains which have increased the dollar equivalent of the SDR 20.7
million credit to US$30.0 million. Out of this amount, NTC utilized US$ 28.2 million, and the remaining
US$ 1.8 million were canceled.
Proiect Implementation
8.     Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up. To ensure timely implementation of the Project,
conditions of effectiveness included : (a) issuance of bid invitations for transmission equipment for rural
areas, subscriber facilities and expansion equipment for the earth station; (b) the continued operation of
the project implementation unit established for the first three projects; (c) appointment of management
consultants for institutional and sectoral development; (d) signing of the subsidiary Loan Agreement
between NTC and MOIC; (e) signing of all co-financing agreements for the proposed financing of the
project; (f) increasing NTC's tariffs in effect on January 1, 1986 by at least 20%; and (g) payment by
HMG of NRs 3,500,000 as part settlement of overdue bills. The original date of effectiveness, October
6, 1986, was extended to January 5, 1987 because of delays in appointment of the management
consultants, in HMG signing the subsidiary Loan Agreement, in signing the Belgian grant, in payment of
the first installment of NRs. 3,500,000 by HMG of the overdue bills to NTC, and issuance of bids for the
earth station. The credit became effective on December 17, 1986.
9.     Prior to effectiveness, NTC raised a number of concerns as to the magnitude of the proposed
management consultancy, more so, given the shortage of skilled staff and NTC's weak institutional
capacity questions were raised as to NTC's ability to absorb the degree of change anticipated. It was
therefore agreed to modify the assignment and revise the TOR. As a result of the revision of the TOR,
the appointment of the management consultants was changed from a condition of effectiveness to a dated
covenant. All other condition being fulfilled, the Project became effective on December 17, 1986.
10.    Project Implementation. With the delays in Project effectiveness (see para. 3 above), the start-up
period took longer than the appraisal estimates. However, by the end of FY88 the project pace had
picked up, NTC had procured about 36% (by value) of the IDA funded equipment and the project was
about 42% complete, only six months behind schedule. After initial problems with the Earth Station
procurement, it was installed with little delay.  Delays in the construction of civil works were
considerable--about six to eight months behind schedule. About 86% (except rural) of the Project was
completed by November 1989. The outstanding problem was with the Multi-Access Radio Telephone
System (MARTS). Due to re-planning, it had to be rebid, which in turn led to a two-year delay in
implementation. As a result, all procurement associated with the MARTS was similarly delayed. In
addition, there were several implementation problems, specifically: (a) geographical coordination; (b) a
severe lack of experienced staff; (c) a lack of AC power; (d) the delay in scheduling of priority of
installation; and (e) inadequate arrangements for engaging the private sector to operate PCOs at MARTS
locations. Other logistical problems included a lack of vehicles and gasoline (in particular during the
Transit and Trade Embargo imposed by India) and some technical problems faced with the performance
of the large MART system purchased from NEC.
11.   In October 1, 1992 IDA  approved amendments to the Development Credit Agreement,
reallocating funds within the categories of Schedule I to accommodate changes in the Project Description
and to utilize savings of about US$8 million arising from exchange rate differences between the US
Dollar and SDR. The changes included: (a) an increase of local automatic exchange lines by 10,000; (b)



4
an installation of facilities to accommodate a further 7,100 lines; and (c) an increase in installation to 18
MART systems and associated solar power equipment, and about 215 UHF/VHF radio systems.
12.   On Project closure most of the work has been completed. Only eight of the MART systems
remain to be installed. All other physical components have been installed and are functioning. Key
indicators of project implementation are provided in Table 5.
Technical Assistance
13.   Management Consultancy. Under the TA component, Bell Canada International (BCI) was
appointed to assist NTC upgrade its institutional capacity. BCI's final report submitted in April 1989,
proposed inter alia: (a) establishment of an appropriate Management Information System (MIS); (b)
appointment of new personnel to organizational positions created according to the consultants
recommendations; (c) a job planning and review system for day-to-day management; (d) new exchange
maintenance procedures; and (e) inventory/stores control procedures including standardization of
material, creation of stock items, and operation of inventory control. The MIS was installed in 1989 and
is functioning satisfactorily (this is being expanded under Telecommunications V). The inventory
system has been operational at the Kathmandu store since 1989.
14.   A fixed assets evaluation was carried out by management consultants in 1990, and NTC's
records were amended accordingly. Subsequently, NTC has revalued its assets annually to reflect
changes in the NRs value of the foreign currency denominated debts. This type of inflationary
accounting is appropriate to the inflation level of Nepal, which does not require a more advanced system
which includes adjustments to the Income Statement.
15.   With the assistance of FINNIDA, and financing from IDA, an automated billing system was
installed and is handling about 95% of the total lines. Under Telecommunications V, a more advanced
billing system is being installed as part of the new Corporate Data Base project, jointly financed by
FINNIDA and IDA. With DANIDA's, support, experts assisted NTC in designing the outside cabling
and transmission network.
Project Costs
16.   The original estimated Project cost at credit signing was US$65.3 million equivalent. The IDA
financing was SDR 20.7 million (equivalent to US$ 22 million). However, with the devaluation of the
US dollar against the SDR, the original SDR amount became equivalent to around US$ 30.0 million,
resulting in a favorable exchange rate gain of about US$8.0 million. Given the good progress of Project
implementation and compliance with all covenants, the scope of the Project was expanded and the
savings used to finance this additional expansion. At Closing Date, the total IDA financed components
of the Project are estimated at US$28.2 million equivalent; the remaining US$ 1.8 million were canceled.
With this the total Project cost increased to about US$74 million according to current estimates. A
summary of estimated and actual Project costs is shown in Table 8A for the IDA funded part of the
Project, and in Table 8B for the whole Project.
Disbursements
17.   Although there was a lag in Project start-up, disbursements during the first three years after
effectiveness were in line with Appraisal estimates. After 1990, disbursements fell short of expectations



5
primarily because of the increase in project scope and the delays in the procurement of the MARTS. The
schedule of estimated and actual disbursements is provided in Table 4.
ODerational Performance
18.   NTC's technical and financial performance throughout the Project has been satisfactory. NTC
met most of the operational and financial targets, and exceeded some of them. This is commendable
considering the shortage of skilled staff in the organization.
19.    Technical Performance. The Project exceeded most of its operational objectives (Table 6).
Subscriber connections were planned to reach 68,500 by the end of the project but 77,000 lines were
installed; 73 out of the 75 districts have been connected by the MART systems with about 3,450 lines
under this Project (to be completed in 1994/95).
20.    Financial Performance. NTC has met the financial conditions set under the Project and its
accounts have been audited by qualified external auditors. Although there were some delays in
presenting the audit reports, NTC has now met the due dates as required by the Project Agreement.
Institutional Performance
21.    Under the Project, Bell Canada International was employed as management consultants to assess
the institutional deficiencies of NTC and make recommendations to improve its operational efficiency.
The original TORs for management consultancy, which were quite comprehensive, were subsequently
modified  to relate to NTC's implementation  capacity.   Implementation  of the consultants'
recommendations was initiated under the Project and continues under the Credit 2364-NEP.
22.    The management of NTC has been sound, and the successful implementation of the Project bears
witness to this. The institutional capacity of NTC was considerably strengthened throughout Project
period. During Project implementation there was a limited amount of reorganization, primarily to
facilitate delegation of authority in key operational and financial areas. Through the various technical
assistance programs, NTC staff has been re-enforced with training and management capabilities to
improve the efficiency of the organization. The Project Implementation Unit's performance has been
commendable in terms of the procurement activities and implementation of all physical components.
Manpower and Training
23.    One of the objectives of the Project was to increase the efficiency of staff. The ratio of staff to
subscribers lines improved from 124 per 1,000 lines in 1985 to about 60 per 1,000 in 1993. This was
primarily due to the high rate of expansion of installations compared to the small increase in staffing.
Under the Project, through the grant facilities and the training component, a number of fellowships were
offered to staff primarily for improving operational and technical skills. In addition, visiting experts
provided a number of training courses locally. These will be continued under Telecommunications V
(Credit 2364-NEP). However, the limited number of skilled personnel still remains a binding constraint
to the economic development of the country in general and the sector in particular. This scarcity of
telecommunications managers is of major significance with the opening to a more competitive market.



6
Project Sustainabilitv
24.    The Project has established a sizable telecommunications network in 73 of Nepal's 75 districts to
support Nepal's developing economy. NTC is sustainable in terms of cost recovery and general financial
situation. Through the establishment of a MIS system, automated billing facilities, and institutional
studies, the Project has paved the way for later projects to complete the transition to a private sector,
commercially run, organization. The Project has also strengthened the procurement and implementation
capabilities in the organization. The overall management of the organization has been modernized but
more work needs to be done in this respect. Telecommunications V is focusing on sector wide
restructuring to introduce competition in existing and new services.
Bank Performance
25.   IDA's performance under the Project was satisfactory. Basic institutional weaknesses, especially
in the areas of skilled managerial and technical expertise, were identified and appropriate TORs prepared
for assistance to NTC through management consultancy and training. Under the umbrella of this Project,
IDA assisted NTC in obtaining grants and financing from Belgium, France, Finland and Denmark. It also
helped in coordinating with JICA for the development of the rural network.
26.   IDA made an effort to process bid documentation expeditiously and assisted NTC and its Board
in resolving procurement difficulties. Some minor delays were experienced at the beginning in the
clearance of bidding documents but this was quickly resolved. IDA supervised the Project twice a year
and 17 missions were carried out during the project (10 of the missions were shared with the 5th
Telecommunications Project preparation, appraisal and supervision). The details of the missions are
provided in Table 13. The two main delays occurred during Project preparation, a 12 months delay
between Negotiations and Board presentation (see para. 5 above) and a 20 months gap between Board
and Effectiveness (see para. 3 above). The Bank made use of the lessons coming from these cases and
preparation of the Fifth Project did not suffered these delays.
Borrower Performance
27.    NTC made a serious effort to implement the Fourth Project efficiently and the major problems of
coordination still remaining are being solved during implementation of the ongoing Fifth
Telecommunications Project. NTC managed changes in its top management and a major reduction of
staff without impairing project implementation.
Assessment of Outcome
28.    The Project met its objectives both in institutional and physical terms. At the end of the Project
NTC was prepared, technically and managerially, to operate the substantive increase in lines to be carried
out under the Fifth Telecommunications Project. Additionally, HMG reached an understanding of the
alternatives for telecommunications sector organization.
Future Operation
29.    On May 12, 1992, IDA's Board approved the Fifth Telecommunications Project (Credit 2364-
NEP) for SDR  40.1 million (US$55.0 million equivalent).  This Project is under successful
implementation. The understandings on sector reform have been greatly expanded through several
workshops and consultancies undertaken under the Fifth Telecommunications Project. IDA present and

future involvement in the sector will center on sector reform, principally, the establishment of a
Regulatory  Agency,  open  entry  and  competition  in  the  provision  of  services,  and
commercialization/privatization of NTC. The Japanese PHRD Fund has recently approved HMG's
request to finance further initiatives in Nepal's telecommunications sector organization, in particular,
training and consultancies required in the process of establishment and organization of an adequate
Regulatory Agency. IDA has also received a request to finance frequency management and monitoring
equipment for the Regulatory Agency.
Key Lessons Learnt
30.   Under the Project the cofinanciers, DANIDA, FINNIDA and IDA learnt that close project
implementation supervision is critical to avoiding major problems, and to detect any problems in
sufficient time for appropriate corrective action. Thus, under the Project, it was decided to engage an
engineering consulting firm as permanent Project Supervisor representing the three donors. This solution
has proved its value during implementation of the Fifth Telecommunications Project, where difficult
procurement situations have been brought into attention on-time for appropriate action.
31.   IDA also learnt the value of advanced preparation of procurement documents by the time the
Project is taken to IDA's Board for approval, and the size of the T/A to be included in a Project should
be tailored to the absorbing capacity of the entity. These lessons have been applied in the Fifth Project,
where all major procurement processing documentation was prepared in advanced of credit effectiveness,
and where the proposed T/A fitted the absorbing capacity of NTC.

Table 9 A: Economic Costs and Benefits
CALCULATION OF THE FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN
For all projects, this table identifies the major costs and/or benefits that enter into the calculation of a re-estimated net present value (or economic
rate of return) or, where the net present value (or economic rate of return) was not estimated, of cost-effectiveness in achieving project objectives.
These calculations understate the overall benefits to be derived from the investment program in as much as they did not take into account
consumer surplus and external benefits to non users of the telecommunications services provided by NTC.
The internal financial rate of return of the program was estimated in the SAR to be 16.1 %, and the projected intemal economic rate of
return was estimated in the SAR to be 17.3%.

FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT 1588-NEP (ICR)
Borrower's Evaluation Summary
Assessment of the Proiect obiectives. desian, implementation and operation
experience:
a) The project objectives were clear and appropriate;
b) The project was designed appropriately to meet the project objectives;
c) The planned implementation schedule was suitable in general, however, the
implementation schedule did not take into consideration certain problems.
Evaluation of the Borrower's own performance
1.    NTC tried its best to execute the project as efficiently as possible in spite of
certain difficulties. The major difficulties faced by the NTC were as follows:
a) Changes in telephone exchange sites due to nonavailability of electric power;
b) Change to the type of exchange due to unreliable power;
c) Some procurement delays.
2.    Some problems could have been avoided by conducting a detailed site survey
before finalization of the exchange sites.
3.    Experience with this project offered the following lessons:
a) Prior detailed survey is essential and has to be completed before finalization of
the project.
b) Problems in the procurement process have to be considered in planning the
implementation schedule.

Evaluation of the Bank
4.    IDA's overall performance in designing and implementing the Fourth Project was
quite satisfactory. IDA has supported the development of telecommunications sector in
Nepal between the period 1986-1992. It provided adequate guidance to NTC for the
successful and timely implementation of the Fourth Project, inspite of many unforeseen
difficulties. IDA was also instrumental in shaping the organization of NTC to enable it to
handle the development activities in an efficient manner. It was IDA's suggestion that
NTC appoint Management Consultants for the strengthening of its organization and
institutional development for carrying out the development activities. Implementation of
the consultant's recommendations gave a new impetus to NTC. NTC took a new attitude
in this phase toward the management of operation and maintenance activities, planning
activities and development activities.
5.    Even though the appointment of Management Consultants resulted in a set of well
defined recommendations, NTC was only able to implement these recommendations in a
phased manner. There are still many recommendations which are yet to be implemented.
Besides the seven areas covered by the consultants as per the terms of reference, there are
still other important areas which need to be strengthened. NTC reviewed these areas on
its own along the same line as the consultants formulated. IDA might have more closely
monitored the implementation of the consultants recommendations and guided NTC in
institutional development.
6.    IDA has to be commended for their guidance regarding tariffs. IDA suggested a
tariff study to be carried out by a consulting firm. As result of the tariff study, NTC was
able to apply a tariff which was closer to a cost base tariff. IDA has also to be
commended for their effort in ensuring that NTC collect government arrears.
7.    NTC expected IDA to take the leading role in coordinating the activities of the
various donor agencies. IDA fulfilled this expectation by maintaining close contact and
liaisoning with the various donor agencies and closely monitoring the status of the
various subprojects. NTC expected IDA to assist NTC in recovering government arrears
and in institution development. IDA's efforts in these respects were commendable.
8.   IDA's supervision effort during the Fourth Project was adequate and satisfactory.
NTC was able to maintain a good working relation with IDA throughout the project.
