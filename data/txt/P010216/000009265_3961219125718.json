Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, close project\n            implementation supervision is critical to avoid major\n            problems. Second, it is advisable to have advanced\n            preparation of procurement documents. Finally, the size of\n            the T/A included in the project has to be tailored to the\n            absorbing capacity of the entity."}, "docdt": "1995-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
