FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower        : Kingdom of Nepal.
Beneficiary    : Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC).
Amount          :  Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 20.7 million
(US$22.0 million equivalent).
Terms           :  Standard.
Relending Terms:  The Government of Nepal will relend the IDA
credit to NTC at an annual rate of 12% to be
repaid over 10 years after five years of grace,
with NTC assuming foreign exchange risk.
Project            The proposed project is designed to strengthen
Objectives and    the Beneficiary as an institution and, through a
Description    : balanced package of high priority works, expand
local telephone facilities in Kathmandu and
other urban areas, provide telephone service for
the first time to about 90 rural communities,
expand facilities to cater to resultant
additional domestic long distance and
international telephone traffic, and expand
existing telex facilities and extend service to
towns other than Kathmanduz The project
includes: (a) provision of management
consultants, technical assistance and
fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff;
(b) installation of (i) about 35,000 lines of
local automatic switching equipment with
associated cable distribution network and
subscriber plant to connect about 31,000 new
subscribers' lines, and replace 1,370 lines of
all remaining manual exchanges, (ii) about 2,500
additional terminations in
national/international trunk exchange, (iii)
about 75 transmission systems in the long
distance network, (iv) equipment for expansion
of existing earth station and telex exchange,
and (v) about 550 local and long distance public
call offices in urban areas and about 200 long

Risks               The project faces no significant risks.  Since
it comprises a number of partly independent
activities, delay in completion of one componient
would not generally prevent use of other
completed components.  Costs and benefits in
telecommunaications projects tend to be delayed
roughly in the same degree; hence, delay in any
one component would not have significant impact
on the return on investment. Because of large
unsatisfied demand, there is no risk of
underutilization of assets.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) has requested an IDA
credit of SDR 20.7 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) to help finance a
fourth telecommunications project. The three previous IDA credits to the
sector, totalling US$21.7 million, were approved in 1969, 1973 and 1978.
The first project was completed in July 1977, four years behind schedule.
The PCR and PPAR were issued in December 1977. A pertinent comment in the
PPAR was that the forecast demand for telephones at end of the project was
underestimated at appraisal but this was qualified by the statement that
"greater accuracy could not have been reasonably expected under prevailing
conditions and available forecasting techniques at the time." The second
credit was closed in December 1982. There were substantial delays at the
procurement stage of the second project which is currently under concurrent
implementation with the third project. Due to delays in supply of
switching equipment for rural exchanges by the contractor and deficiencies
in the software of the main digital exchanges so far installed, the second
project is expected to be completed in April 1986, about seven years behind
schedule and the third project in September 1986, about two and a half
years behind schedule.
1.02      The proposed fourth telecommunications project is a major
component of Nepal's FY86-90 telecommunications development program with
total investment of about US$115.2 million, including a foreign exchange
component of US$100.0 million. The project covers about 57% of the
investment program. The balance of the program comprises the ongoing IDA
projects (3%), a rural project financed by the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency (26%) and preinvestment on works after FY90 (14%). The
project will be implemented by the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation
(NTC) and aims at enhancing the institutional capability of NTC, upgrading
the quality of existing telecommunications services, meeting partly the
forecast demand for telephones in areas already served and extending
service to rural areas currently without access. The institutional
component of the project provides for management consultants, technical
experts and fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff. The physical
component of the project is a self-contained, balanced and integrated
package of high priority works for expansion of telecommunications
facilities. The number of telephone lines in Nepal will increase during
the project period by about 200%. Even then, the unmet expressed demand at
the end of the project will be higher than at its commencement. Further,
in spite of provision of access to telephone service for the first time to
about 90 rural communities of administrative and commercial importance,
about 88% of the country's population will still be without access to
telephone service at the end of the project. A larger project is
constrained by funds to finance the foreign costs and by NTC's
implementation capacity.
1.03      The project is estimated to cost US$65.3 million including
foreign costs of US$55.8 million (including indirect foreign costs
estimated at about US$3.4 million on construction of cable distribution
networks and technical buildings). The balance local costs would be



-2-
financed from internally generated funds for which tariffs will have to be
increased by about 20% not later than September 30, 1985. The proposed IDA
credit of SDR 20.7 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) would finance about
39% of the foreign costs; the balance would be financed by grants-in-aid
from the Governments of Denmark (US$7.5 million equivalent) and Finland
(US$5.3 million equivalent) and aid packages of grants-in-aid and soft
loans from the Governments of Belgium and France and commercial bank loans
from Belgian and French banks (US$10.9 million equivalent total from
Belgium and US$10.1 million equivalent from France).
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A.  Background and Organization
2.01      Authority for the telecommunications sector in Nepal is vested in
the Ministry of Communications. Under the Ministry, NTC is responsible for
all public telecommunications services in Nepal. NTC was established as a
wholly government-owned statutory corporation in June 1975 under the
Communications Corporation Act of 1972, and is administered by a
seven-member Board of Directors under the chairmanship of the Secretary,,
Ministry of Communications. NTC's General Manager and the Financial
Controller are members of the Board. The remaining four members are
appointed by the Government from other government agencies and state
enterprises. NTC's annual budget and telecommunications tariffs are
approved by the Planning Commission and the Ministries of Communications
and Finance. Persorinel policies, staff recruitment, emoluments, benefits
and promnotions are regulated by the Public Service Commission.
B~ Access to Service
2.02      In mid 1984, Nepal had on average only about 0.12 telephones per
100 inhabitants. This density was one of the lowest in the world. About
57% of existing main telephone lines were concentrated in Kathmandu, which
had 2.7% of the country's population. The telephone density in Kathmandu
was 2.06 telephones per 100 inhabitants. Of the 28 other areas with a
total population of about 0.7 million inhabitants designated as urban,l/
18 had telephone exchange service, with an average density of 0.05
telephones per 100 inhabitants (Annex 1). The remaining 10 urban areas
were served by public call offices (PCOs) for long-distance calls. In
urban areas with telephone exchanges, the non-subscribing general public
had very little access to telephone service. There were about 25 local
PCOs in Kathmandu (averaging one PCO for about 15,000 people) and another
21 local PCOs in other towns. For the rural population, there were 15 long
1/ Areas having Nagar Panchayats or City Courncils are designated as
"Urban."



- 3 -
distance PCOs (that is, about one per million inhabitants). Of Nepal's 75
administrative headquarters towns, 49 had no telephone service. Overall,
about 94% of the country's population had no telephone service and, hence,
had no available means of communications, especially in the winter season
when surface and air transportaton are unreliable. Telegraph service was
available in 82 towns and villages (out of total 4,025) and telex service
only in Kathmandu. International telecommunications services to other
countries were provided via a satellite earth station commissioned in
October 1982.
C. Usage of Service
2.03      In mid 1984, about 69% of all telephone lines in Nepal were
connected to business (including professionals, and business units
registered under personal rather than company names) and government
subscribers, and the balance 31% to residential subscribers. Most of the
non-residential lines were in the communication intensive tertiary sectors
of the economy, especially commerce (34%) and government (27%) (Annex 2).
These figures understate the extent to which telecommunications are used in
connection with economic production and distribution. A survey in 1980
indicated that, on average, about 4,000 calls per year originated from each
telephone line but there was considerable variation among subscribers with
different economic activities. Intensive telephone users were those in
tourism (12,500 calls per year per line), banking (8,300) and government
(7,900), whereas residences and small economic units with telephones listed
under personal names averaged about 2,400 calls per year. The residential
telephones are also used significantly for work related purposes.  It is
estimated that, in 1984, over 80% of telephone calls and revenues were
generated in connection with business and government activities.
D. Existing Facilities and Service Qualit
2.04      The public telecommunications facilities in Nepal have grown
slowly and failed to keep up with the demand. The facilities existing in
July 1984 are listed in Annex 3. Automatic local telephone service was
available in only three towns with about 16,000 lines and manual
(operator-assisted) local service in 16 towns with 4,500 lines. In
general, local service is congested, unreliable and inadequate. Because of
acute shortage of telephones vis-a-vis the demand, telephones are kept busy
for long periods and unavailable for incoming calls. This leads to repeat
call attempts which add to the traffic congestion. On average, only about
75% of the daily local call attempts are successful; during the peak
business hours, the proportion of successful calls is much lower. Proper
equipment maintenance procedures and service standards are not prescribed
and clearance of faults is unsatisfactory. On average, there are about
25-30 faults per 100 telephones per month which is high. The faults are
mostly in the local cable distribution network. The average time for fault
clearance is also high, varying from about one day in respect of subscribr
plant faults to five days or more for faults in the cable distribution
networks.

2.05      The operator-assisted long distance telephone service is severely
impaired by shortage of circuits and operating positions. Provincial long
distance traffic, of which 60% is directed to Kathmandu, normally suffers
heavy delays. Service delays of 4-5 hours are normal. This leads to
cancellation of over 30% of booked calls. With gradual introduction of
fully automatic subscriber trunk dialling (STD) starting mid-1985, many of
the long distance service problems will be eliminated. Telegrams are
accepted in 82 centers but only five centers are equipped with
teleprinters. The remaining 77 centers transmit messages by morse or
as phonograms. Telex facility is available only in Kathmandu and hence
used only for international calls.
2.06      When completed, the two ongoing IDA projects will make a
significant contribution towards alleviating the current service problems
and upgrading the quality of the domestic telephone services. The
availability and the quality of international services have improved
significantly since the commissioning of the earth station and the
international telex exchange in October 1982 with a substantial increase in
the number of international calls and revenues--400% for telephone calls
and 71% for telex calls between November 1982 and March 1983--indicating
the potential for traffic growth once adequate facilities are provided.
E. Demand for Service
2.07      Given the current embryonic status of telecommunications
facilities in Nepal, lack of access to service in large areas of the
country, and the very poor quality of both local and long distance
services, which inhibits expression of demand, it is difficult to forecast
accurately the future requirements for telecommunications services in
different parts of the country. Available data on demand is limited to the
number of applications registered for new telephone connections. This does
not reflect the real demand because, in urban areas, many potential
subscribers are discouraged from applying by the current heavy delays in
obtaining connections and, in rural areas where the telephones are mainly
used for long distance calls, by the poor quality of long distance
service. Also, telephone demand is not registered in areas where currently
there is no service, and demand from government and its agencies is not
registered on the waiting list as such connections are given on a priority
basis. Hence, the historic demand figures reflect a supply constraint
rather than the real demand and, therefore, tend to underestimate the rate
at which demand will grow.
2.08      Annex 4 gives details of the expressed demand (working lines plus
registered applications for new lines) and the telephone network growth
between 1977 and 1990 (actuals for 1977-1984 and forecasts for 1985-1990).
In mid 1984, the unmet demand in Kathmandu was 19,379 against 9,121 working
lines and in other areas of the country currently serviced, the unmet
demand was 13,757 against 6,843 working lines. NTC has projected the
future demand at average growth rates of 15% per annum for Kathmandu and
20% per annum for the rest of the country. These are considered



- 5 -
reasonable, although subject to uncertainty. However, as a very
substantial unmet demand of about 68,600 (against 58,600 working lines) is
forecast at the end of the proposed project in FY90, there is no risk of
overprovisioning of facilities or idle assets.
F. Sector Constraints
2.09      Modern telecommunications facilities in Nepal were introduced as
late as 1964. Considering the difficulties of Nepal's geography and
climate, expansion of telecommunications facilities has been rapid since
then. Constraints on the sector partly reflect the fact that the sector is
essentially only 20 years old.   Currently, the two main constraints on the
continued rapid development of the telecommunications services in Nepal
are: (a) the availability of foreign funds on acceptable terms to finance
the foreign costs of equipment; and (b) NTC's capacity to undertake a large
development program and to manage the expanded facilities. In the absence
of any existing or foreseeable domestic telecommunications equipment
manufacturing facilities, Nepal will depend on imports for expansion of its
telecommunications facilities for a long time. Consequently, an important
constraint on the rate of future development of the telecommunications
services is the availability of foreign funds which, in view of the
country's limited ability to service foreign debt, need to be mainly in the
forms of grants-in-aid or loans/credits on concessionary terms. IDA has
assisted HMG and NTC in attracting foreign funds for the sector. The
proposed level of the FY86-90 investment program has been possible because
of the grants-in-aid by the Governments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France and Japan as also aid packages of soft loans and commercial bank
loans from Belgium and France. All these aids tied to the usual
conditionalities of procurement of equipment from the donor countries.
2.10      The other constraint is NTC's implementation capacity.  NTC's
technical staff have proved capable of operating and managing modern
sophisticated equipment as demonstrated with the satellite earth station
and computerized digital telex exchange commissioned in 1982. However, for
undertaking a large development program, and operating and managing
efficiently the expanded facilities, NTC's management needs to be
strengthened and staff at higher technical levels augmented. Institutional
improvements through management consultants, technical assistance and
fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff are proposed under the
project to improve NTC's planning, operational and management capabilities.
G. Sector Goals
2.11      HMG attaches considerable importance to the development of
telecommunications facilities. However, the limited foreign exchange
available for the sector has made it difficult to establish an adequate
long term sector development strategy. In the medium term, the sixth
national development plan listed the following partial objectives to be
attained during FY81-85: (a) establish reliable communication within and
among towns, district headquarters and commercial/service centers in rural



areas; (b) strengthen NTC's management and organization; and (c) develop
NTC's financial base to sustain sector growth. These objectives are
reflected in NTC's FY86-90 development program approved by 1MG.  The
following elements are highlighted:
(a)  major increase in the rate of development.  The annual
investments under the FY86-90 program will average about
US$23 million per year,2/ compared with US$4 million per
year in FY80-82 and US$1 million per year in FY75-79;
(b)  priority in expanding and improving services to subscribers
and public call offices in the provincial urban and rural
areas while continuing to develop services in the capital
to reduce communication bottlenecks at the center. About
67% of the FY86-90 investments will be for facilities in
and between provincial urban and rural centers, and between
these centers and Kathmandu;
(c)  emphasis on improving service quality and NTC's efficiency
through increased network automation, use of modern
technologies, improvement of organization and management,
and increased staff training; and
(d)  ensure adequate resource mobilization by NTC to sustain
rapid development of the sector and increased fiscal
benefits for Government.
H. Role of the Bank Group
2.12      IDA has been associated with the telecommunications sector since
1969 through three projects--Credit 166-NEP for US$1.7 million in November
1969, Credit 397-NEP for US$5.5 million in June 1973 and Credit 799-NEP for
US$14.5 million in August 1978. Through these projects, IDA has played a
significant role in the physical, technical and institutional development
of the sector. In physical terms, under the three IDA projects, the local
telephone facilities will have been expanded 30 times, the domestic long
distance service upgraded to a fully automatic subscriber trunk dialling
(STD) service and telephone service provided for the first time in many
rural areas. Technically, IDA contributed significantly to in NTC's
progressive moves from manual exchanges through electromechanical automatic
exchanges to electronic digi.al exchanges, from fault-prone open-wire lines
and inefficient HF radio circuits to microwave radio systems and satellite
communication. However, the sector will continue to need substantial
external assistance for some years to further expand the facilities to meet
2/ Average annual investments on different program components in US$
million are: ongoing works - 0.8; IDA financed project - 13.1; JICA
project - 6.0; and preinvestment for future program - 3.2.



- 7 -
the forecast demand for all services, upgrade the level of service in areas
currently served and provide access to service to rural areas of economic
significance currently without service.
2.13      IDA has also played a major role in the institutional development
of the sector. In 1969, before the first telecommunications project, the
only sector specific organization was the Telecommunications Department of
Nepal (TDN) within the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications,
mainly concerned with engineering and operational functions of the sector
and without commercial accountability or tools for efficient management or
training. As a requirement of the first IDA credit, the semi-autonomous
Nepal Telecommunications Board (NTB) was created in October 1969 and its
internal organization and accounting system studied by consultants and
their recommendations implemented. In 1972, with IDA's support, the
legislation creating the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC) was
passed providing the sector with increased operational, administrative and
financial autonomy. The PPAR on the first project issued in December 1977
commented favorably on the "establishment of an institutional framework for
the sector to provide and operate telecommunications facilities on a
commercial basis with proper tools for effective management." After
initial difficulties, NTC has managed the current relatively limited assets
of the sector reasonably well. However, the expansion of the sector under
the second and third projects to be completed by about mid 1986 (para 3.02)
and implementation of the FY86-90 investment program (para 3.01) will
radically increase the scale of NTC's operations. Further institution
building is, therefore, needed to enhance NTC's managerial capability.
2.14      Because of its long involvement in the sector, IDA is
well-equipped to provide the necessary assistance to NTC in the
institutional, technical and financial disciplines as follows: (a)
institutionally, through a wide spectrum of organizational, managerial,
operational and financial improvements in NTC, introduction of modern tools
including computer facilities, improving and expanding local training
facilities, and fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff; (b)
technically, through assistance to NTC in developing internal strategic
planning capability for balanced long-term development of the sector
responsive to spatial, sectoral and economic priorities of national
development while keeping in view the macro-economic constraints, in
designing fully integrated switching and transmission networks for local
and long distance services to derive maximum technical and economic
benefits from the new digital technology, and in procuring the latest
proven equipment at least cost in a field where the rate of technical
obsolescence is high; and (c) financially by funding part of the foreign
cost of a much needed development program and acting as a catalyst for
attracting cofinancing on adequate terms from other sources.

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. The Program
3.01      NTC's FY86-90 investment program comprises the following:
(a)  ongoing works under the second and third
telecommunications projects (credits 397-NEP and
799-NEP);
(b)  the rural telecommunications project to be financed by
the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
hereinafter called the JICA project;
(c)  the proposed fourth telecommunications project to be
partly financed by an IDA credit; and
(d)  preinvestment for civil works and equipment related to
the FY91-95 investment program.
The program is based on the sector objectives outlined in para 2.11.
The total investments under the program are estimated at NRs 2,131.2
million (US$115.2 million) with a foreign component of NRs 1,850.0 million
(US$100.0 million). Planned investments for the different components of
the program and the sources of financing are given in Annex 5 and annual
investments in Annex 6. The financing plan for the program is discussed in
paras 5.09 to 5.13.
3.02      Ongoing Works:  These are works now being implemented under the
delayed second and third telecommunications projects. The second project
had suffered substantial delays at the procurement stage. Because of this,
the switching and transmission equipment procurement for that project was
combined with similar equipment for the follow-up third project. Both
projects are being implemented concurrently. Due to delays by the supplier
of switching equipment for some small exchanges as also software
deficiencies in the main exchanges so far supplied, the second and third
projects are expected to be completed in April and September 1986
respectively. However, credit 397-NEP was closed on December 31, 1982 and
credit 799-NEP will be closed on June 30, 1985. Investments on the ongoing
works during FY86-87 are estimated about NRs 72.2 million (US$3.9 million)
with a foreign component of about NRs 70.4 million (US$3.8 million) which
will be financed by NTC through a commercial bank loan.
3.03      JICA Project:  The Japanese International Cooperation Agency
(JICA) has offered a grant-in-aid of about US$40 million equivalent to HMG
to finance a rural telecommunications project designed to provide access to
telephone service to 63 rural communities mainly in the Trans Himalayan and
Middle regions of Nepal between FY86 and FY92. Details of the JICA project
are given in Annex 7. For the components to be implemented between FY86
and FY90, the costs are assessed at US$28.4 million equivalent foreign and



- 9 -
US$1.6 million equivalent local. The remaining components of the project
costing US$10 million equivalent will be implemented after FY90. As is
often the case with purely rural telecommunications projects, the JICA
project is not likely to be financially viable but HMG decided to undertake
the project on political, social and economic considerations.
Cross-subsidization of NTC's rural operations may, therefore, be necessary
(para 6.10).
3.04      Preinvestment:  Preinvestment for the FY91-95 investment program
is projected at NRs 296.0 million (US$16.0 million) with a foreign
component of NRs 222.0 million (US$12.0 million). These projections are
tentative as NTC is still to formulate plans for the future program. Local
costs would be financed internally by NTC; sources for financing of the
foreign costs are not determined.
B. The Project
3.05      The 5-year (FY86-90) Fourth Telecommunications Project proposed
to be partly financed by IDA is a self-contained, balanced and integrated
package of high priority works. A major thrust of the project will be on
the institutional development of the NTC in all disciplines aimed at
enhancing its capabilities to manage and operate the expanded facilities.
The physical component of the project provides for: (a) expansion of local
telephone facilities in Kathmandu and other urban areas to ease current
traffic congestion and partly meet the anticipated demand; (b) replacement
of manual local exchanges to fully automate local telephone service; (c)
provision of telephone service for the first time to about 90 rural
communities of administrative and commercial importance in addition to 63
communities covered by the JICA project; (d) expansion of domestic long
distance and international telephone facilities to cater to the additional
traffic generated by the local network expansions and provision of service
to new areas; and (e) expansion of telex facilities and their extension to
towns other than Kathmandu.
C. Project Description
3.06      The main components of the project are as follows:
(a) enhancement of NTC's management and operational
capabilities through management consultants, and
fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff;
(b) development of strategic planning capability within NTC
for long-term development of the sector through
technical experts;
(c) provision and installation of about 35,000 lines of
digital switching equipment (including 1,370 lines for
replacement of all existing manual exchange equipment),
about 159,000 pair-kilometers of telephone cables, about



- 10 -
390 kilometers of cable ducts, jointing materials and
other accessories for net expansion of local network
capacity by about 33,630 lines (Kathmandu Valley:
21,000; rest of Nepal: 12,630);
(d)  provision and installation of subscriber facilities to
connect about 31,000 new subscribers' lines (Kathmandu
Valley: 20,000); rest of Nepal: 11,000);
(e)  provision and installation of about 2,500 additional
circuit terminations in the existing national/
international trunk exchange;
(f)  provision and installation of about 500 local and 50
long distance coinboxes for public call offices in urban
areas to serve non-subscribing public;
(g)  provision and installation of three high capacity
digital microwave radio systems on main routes and
twelve small capacity digital microwave radio systems on
spur routes;
(h)  provision and installation of about 60 VHF/UHF radio
systems to connect about 200 long distance telephone
connections and public call offices in about 90 rural
communities;
(i)  provision and installation of equipment for expansion of
the earth station for international satellite
communication;
(j)  provision and installation of equipment for expansion of
the existing telex exchange by about 250 terminations
and four VFT systems and provision of about 150
electronic teleprinters;
(k)  provision and installation of air conditioning and power
equipment in telecommunications buildings;
(1)  provision of vehicles for project implementation,
computer equipment, office aids and training equipment;
and
(m)  civil works associated with laying of cable ducts, and
construction of cable networks and buildings for
telecommunications equipment and offices.
3.07      The main equipment installations under the project are listed in
Annex 8, details of local exchanges and transmission facilities in Annexes
9 and 10 respectively, and the administrative districts and the rural

communities to be provided with long distance connections and public call
offices in each district in Annex 11 respectively. The map (IBRD 17643 R)
shows planned telecommunications development in Nepal under the FY86-90
program.
D. Project Costs
3.08      The total costs of the project are estimated at NRs 1,208.0
million (US$65.3 million) with foreign costs of NRs 1,032.2 million
(US$55.8 million) that is, 85.5% of the total costs. Costs of the
individual components are as follows:

the suppliers in those countries. Costs of other equipment items and
consultants to be financed under IDA credit are based on NTC's contracts
for ongoing works and experience in other countries with adjustments up to
end 1984 levels and are reasonable. The local costs include NRs 1.0

in servicing rural areas.
E. Contingencies
3.10      The provisions for equipment and civil works are based for th,e
most part on detailed designs and engineering. Hence, no significant
changes are expected in the proposed quantities during the project period.
Also, the continuous and dispersed nature of telecommunications development
allows adequate flexibility for adjustments and experience has shown that
increases at some points are compensated by decreases at others. However,
to cover minor unforeseen requirements over the five-year project period, a
physical contingency provisions of 10% of the annual base local costs and
5% of the annual base foreign costs have been included and are considered
adequate. The local price contingencies are based on the following
increases each year: 1985: 8%; 1986: 7%; and 1987 to 1990: 6%. The
foreign price increases on the equipment to be financed under the IDA
credit are based on the following annual increases; 1985: 5%; 1986: 7.5%;
and 1987 to 1990: 8%. Since telecommunications equipment contracts are
normally fixed price contracts, the foreign cost increases are applied up
to the anticipated contract dates. For the equipment and cable items to be
procured under cofinancing, no foreign price contingencies have been
included as the unit prices of these items are fixed. Based on these



- 13 -
assumptions, the local and foreign price contingencies amount to 18.8% and
6.7% respectively-of the base costs plus physical contingencies. For items
to be financed by the IDA credit, the foreign price contingency provision
is 18.9%.
F. Project Financing
3.11      The local costs of the project amounting to NRs 175.8 million
(US$9.5 million) will be financed from NTC's internal cash generation.
These costs exclude about NRs 62.9 million (US$3.4 million) of indirect
foreign costs (assessed at 50% of the total costs) of civil works
associated with construction of cable distribution networks and buildings
for telecommunications equipment and offices which will be financed by IDA
credit. Tariffs will need to be increased to generate the necessary funds
(para 5.07). An IDA credit of SDR 20.7 million (equivalent to US$22.0
million) is proposed to finance about 39% of the foreign costs of the
project; the balance 61% (US$33.8 million) is expected to be cofinanced by
financial assistance packages from Belgium, Denmark, Finland and France.
HMG has received the following cofinancing offers from the respective
governments:

France           Switching                      10.1
The above figures are based on the amounts in country's currency contained
in the initial cofinancing offers to HMG.  These offers are currently under
negotiations by HMG and NTC with the respective aid agencies and the
suppliers in those countries in respect of quantities of equipment and
their unit costs. Hence, the amounts quoted above are subject to changes
which are expected to be minor.  Acceptance of the cofinancing offers would
complete the funding of the foreign costs of the project (para 3.14).

NOTE: Figures in parentheses are respective amounts financed by the
proposed IDA credit. Costs include proportionate contingency
provisions.
3.13      As there is no domestic manufacture of telecommunications
equipment in Nepal, all equipment contracts under IDA credit are expected
to be awarded to foreign suppliers. Technical specifications for all
telecommunications equipment items will prescribe international standards
laid down by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and for other
items internationally accepted standards, except where special conditions
are necessary to meet local environmental conditions. Cofinanced equipment
will be subject to the usual conditionality of procurement of such
equipment being restricted to suppliers from fund source countries. For
reasons of compatibility, standardization, and economies in maintenance,



- 15 -
staff training and spare parts, IDA-financed equipment costing a total of
US$1.1 million for expansion of the existing satellite earth station
(US$400,000), telex exchange (US$200,000) and microwave systems
(US$500,000) will be procured after negotiations with the original
suppliers, subject to prices being satisfactory to IDA. (The earth station
and telex exchange were procured from UK suppliers under cofinancing by UK
under the third project and microwave systems were financed by IDA under
the second and third projects.) All other equipment items to be financed by
the IDA credit will be procured following Bank guidelines. Contracts for
civil works related to buildings for telecommunications equipment and
offices, laying of cable ducts and construction of the cable network which
are estimated to cost less than US$500,000 equivalent each will be awarded
after local competitive bidding following NTC's normal procurement
procedures which are satisfactory and acceptable to IDA. Management
consultants and technical experts shall be selected in accordance with IDA
guidelines. The training disciplines and country assignments in respect of
fellowships for foreign training of NTC staff shall be selected by NTC in
consultation with IDA. All IDA-financed equipment contracts over
US$200,000 and civil works contracts over US$300,000 will be subject to
IDA's prior review which will cover about 90% of the total value of such
contracts for telecommunications equipment and civil works; other contracts
in contract packages of less than US$200,000 for equipment and US$300,000
for civil works will be subject to selective post-award IDA review.
Hi. Project Implementation
3.14      NTC staff will prepare all engineering designs, technical
specifications and bid invitation documents, evaluate bids, prepare
contracts and, except for switching equipment and transmission equipment on
main routes which will be installed by suppliers, carry out all
installations. NTC has acquired adequate capabilities under previous IDA
projects to undertake these tasks. To ensure coordination of all project
items and implementation of the project on schedule, NTC has established
a Project Implementation Unit under a Project Manager with adequate staff
and administrative and financial powers. The Project Manager shall be
responsible for implementation of all developmental works in NTC except for
the JICA project which will be implemented on a turn-key basis. During
negotiations, NTC agreed to maintain the Project Implementation Unit
throughout the implementation period of the project. Furthermore, HMG and
NTC agreed that issue of bid invitations for supply of subscriber
facilities, transmission equipment for rural areas and expansion equipment
for the earth station to be financed under IDA credit shall be a condition
of credit effectiveness. Annex 12 indicates the implementation schedule
for major project components. The project is expected to be completed by
June 30, 1990.
I. Disbursements
3.15      Disbursement of the credit against full documentation would
cover: (a) 100% of foreign (CIF) expenditure on imported goods; (b) 100%



- 16 -
of foreign expenditure on services of equipment suppliers in respect of
installation, supervision, training and maintenance; (c) 100% of ex-factory
costs (excluding taxes) of locally manufactured items; (d) 75% of costs of
items procured locally off-the-shelf; (e) 100% of the foreign costs of
consultants, technical experts and fellowships for NTC staff; and (f) 50%
of costs of civil works on construction of cable networks and buildings for
telecmmunications equipment and offices.  Based on the disbursement profile
for the telecommunications sector in the countries in the South Asia region
but keeping in view that the invitation of bids for major IDA-financed
items shall be a condition of effectiveness of the credit (para 3.14), the
proposed credit is expected to be fully disbursed (including retention
payments) by June 30, 1992. The estimated schedule of disbursements is at
Annex 13.
J. Performance Indicators
3.16      Performance indicators to monitor NTCs implementation,
operational and financial performance are given in Annex 14. NTC will
include these indicators in its quarterly project progress reports, except
for the financial indicators which will be reported in annual financial
statements. During negotiations, details of items that NTC will include in
its quarterly progress reports were discussed and agreed by NTC.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
A.  Organization and Management
4.01      NTC was established as an autonomous state enterprise in June
1975 under the Communications Corporation Act of 1972 (para 2.01). Its
organization structure (Annex 15) is generally similar to that of
telecommunications entities in many developing countries. It comprises
three main headquarters departments (engineering, business and
administration, and finance and accounts), three regional offices
(Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Birganj), an international unit to maintain and
operate all international services, a project implementation unit
established in mid-1983 to implement the remaining installations under the
second and third projects and the proposed fourth project, legal and
internal audit units, and a Telecommunications Training Center.
4.02      NTC has coped adequately so far with the past slow rate of
development of the telecommunications facilities and the needs of
management and operation of its relatively limited assets. Individually,
the senior and middle level technical and managerial staff are well
qualified, experienced and competent. However, there are several apparent
institutional deficiencies which need to be corrected. The responsibility
of each department and regional office is not clearly defined, job
descriptions are not laid down, norms for staff productivity and sanctions
not prescribed, and maintenance procedures and service standards are



- 17 -
inadequate. A comprehensive review is needed of NTC's organization
structure, administrative and financial procedures, management control of
administration and finance vis-a-vis the Board of Directors, delegation of
power, etc. The functions of planning and implementation of development
works need to be separated from maintenance and operation at all levels,
maintenance procedures and service standards prescribed, job descriptions,
manpower plans, and recruitment and training programs prepared, refresher
in-service training of existing staff in new technologies, business
administration and management introduced, regional training centers for
technicians, craftsmen and operators established, and billing and
collection of revenue computerized. The training in accounting is
adequate3/ but needs to be further expanded. The Communications
Corporation Act of 1972, which governs all NTC's upstream activities and
dealings with other government ministries and agencies and powers of the
Board also needs to be reviewed and amended to reflect NTC's enhanced
future responsibilities.
B. Consultants
4.03      To overcome current institutional deficiencies and develop NTC
into an organization capable of effective and efficient management,
development and operation of the expanding facilities on a commercial
basis, management consultants will be appointed under the project to
undertake a comprehensive review of NTC's organization and management in
the administrative, technical and financial disciplines, identify
weaknesses, recommend corrective measures and assist in their
implementation. Specifically, the consultants would review, recommend and
assist NTC in implementation of accepted recommendations on the following:
(a) the Communications Corporation Act of 1972; (b) NTC's relationship with
the government and its agencies; (c) composition of NTC's Board of
Directors, its administrative and financial powers and their delegation to
NTC management; (d) NTC's organization structure and management procedures
(including introduction of an adequate management information system); (e)
delegation of administrative and financial powers to lower levels in NTC's
management; (f) job descriptions, norms for staff sanctions and
productivity, long-term manpower plans, recruitment and training programs;
(g) within the purview of government directives for state enterprises,
staff emoluments and benefits; (h) maintenance procedures, service quality
norms and procedures for monitoring service quality; (i) administrative,
business and technical procedures involved from the stage of registration
of new applications to connection of new lines (including use of private
contractors, where appropriate); and (j) the use of computers for billing,
control of revenue collection and accounting.
3/ Training in commercial accounting has been arranged with good results
in the past for financial staff with the help of Price Waterhouse &
Co., India.



- 18 -
4.04      The consultants' services are estimated at about 85 manmonths
over a period of about two years. The management consultants will be
selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. In order that the consultants
commence work early in the project, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that (a) NTC will appoint the consultants by December 31,
1985; and (b) NTC will send to IDA the consultants' reports as and when
issued with details of the accepted recommendations and a schedule for
their implementation.
4.05      Currently, long-term planning in NTC is inadequate and
development plans are basically determined on an ad hoc basis. To
introduce proper long-term planning in NTC, a telecommunciations planning
expert will be appointed for 12 months to establish a Fundamental Planning
Unit (FPU) in NTC based on the guidelines at Annex 16. The FPU expert will
prepare the detailed terms of reference, assess the number of staff
(engineers, financial analysts and economists) and other resources
required, prepare job descriptions and assist NTC in establishing an
embryonic FPU unit. Three other experts will be appointed as follows: (a)
a demand forecasting expert for six months to establish principles of
demand forecasting and upgrade NTC's current practices (para 6.06); (b) a
telecommunications tariff expert for six months to review the structure and
level of telecommunications tariffs in Nepal and lay down principles on
which NTC could base its future pricing policy (para 6.11); and (c) a
telecommunications economics expert for 12 months to develop guidelines for
telecommunications development in Nepal (para 6.06). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that NTC will (a) select the four experts by
December 31, 1985 under terms of reference and conditions of employment
satisfactory to IDA, (b) appoint four counterpart officials to work with
the experts and subsequently head their respective units; and (c) send to
IDA the report of each expert as and when issued with details of the
accepted recommendations and a schedule for their implementation.
C. UNDP/ITU Experts
4.06      The management consultants and the four experts (paras 4.03 to
4.05) would complement the work of technical experts provided by the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which is currently executing a
two year (FY84-85) project financed by a grant of US$1.0 million by UNDP
towards the foreign costs of services of six experts for a total of 65
manmonths, 75 manmonths of training fellowships to NTC's technical staff
and equipment for the Telecommunications Training Center (TTC). The ITU
experts will cover six specific fields namely, maintenance organization and
procedures, supply organization, outside line plant planning, technical
staff management specifically related to maintenance and operation, digital
techniques and instrument repair and calibration. These are complementary
to those to be covered by the consultants and experts under the project.
D. Staff
4.07      In July 1984, NTC had about 2,663 employees on its payroll
equivalent to about 126 staff per 1,000 telephones. This is high but



- 19 -
results largely from the staff needs for manual operation of the local
telephone service in many areas and long distance telephone and telegraph
services all over the country, and maintenance of substantial local and
long distance networks of open wire lines. With gradual automation of the
domestic telephone services, full digitalization of switching equipment,
replacement of open-wire lines by cables and radio systems, computerization
of billing and accounting and improvements in manpower quality and
productivity through training, NTC anticipates a change in its staff
pattern. In future, the ratio of technicians and clerical staff to lines
in service will decline while the ratio in respect of staff with higher
qualifications (engineers, programmers, etc.) will increase. Consequently,
the rate of overall staff growth in the next few years is expected to be
substantially lower than the rate of growth in telephone connections and
the ratio of employees per 1,000 telephones is expected to drop from
current 126 to about 54 by 1990 (Annex 17). However, NTC's assessment of
future staff requirements is not based on a detailed or systematic manpower
plan and must be considered tentative. With the implementation of
management consultants' recommendations on the subject during the course of
the project, NTC's assessment of staff is expected to undergo substantial
changes.
4.08      NTC does not have difficulty in recruiting staff except in
respect of higher level technical positions for which there is a lack of
candidates trained specifically in telecommunications. NTC recruits
candidates trained in radio and electrical engineering who are then given
specialized training in telecommunications in TTC. NTC does have some
problem in retaining trained and experienced staff and in stationing
qualified staff outside the Kathmandu valley. While NTC's salary levels
are linked by government regulations to those in other para-statals,
service conditions in NTC are more stringent and fringe benefits, which are
independently fixed by each para-statal unit, are in some cases lower in
NTC compared to other units. Management consultants will review staff
emoluments and benefits in NTC and recommend changes within the overall
government guidelines. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that,
within four months after consultants have submitted their recommendation on
these items, NTC will send to IDA the consultants' recommendations and
thereafter, taking into account IDA's comments, agree with IDA on an action
plan for implementation of such recommendations as are acceptable to HMG,
NTC and IDA.
E. Training
4.09      TTC, established with the technical assistance of ITU and
UNDP-funds in the late 1970s, is located in Kathmandu. It is generally
well equipped and its equipment is regularly augmented. However, TTC has a
problem in finding suitable instructors among NTC staff because, on being
posted to TTC, staff lose the financial and other incentives of field
offices. The loss of benefits is compounded by the housing shortage and
higher cost of living in Kathmandu. TTC has facilities for about 3,000
student weeks of training, While NTC has no difficulty in recruiting



- 20 -
trainees from Kathmandu Valley, recruitment from other areas of the country
is inhibited by the poor monthly stipend paid to the trainees which is
insufficient to cover living expenses of trainees from outside Kathmandu
Valley for the duration of training in Kathmandu. Opening of subsidiary
training centers at regional headquarters for training craftsmen and
operators, and payment of higher monthly stipends to trainees would improve
and diversify recruitment. As part of their manpower planning assignment,
the management consultants (para 4.03) would review payment of special
allowances to instructors for the TTC to attract better quality staff,
establishment of regional training centers, and the level of stipends paid
to trainees. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, within
four months after consultants have submitted their recommendations on these
items, NTC will send to IDA the consultant's recommendations and
thereafter, taking into account IDA's comments, will agree with IDA on an
action plan for implementation of such recommendations as are acceptable to
HMG, NTC and IDA.
4.10      To complement the training in TTC, US$280,000 is provided under
the credit to finance the costs of about 90 manmonths of fellowships for
foreign training of NTC staff (including training instructors, staff for
the FPU and demand forecasting and tariff and economic study units) in
technical, business management, economic and financial disciplines. During
negotiations, NTC agreed to select the training disciplines and foreign
administrations for the fellowships in consultation with IDA.
F. Accounting
4.11      In 1979, under the previous projects, NTC introduced a commercial
accounting system and has since then trained its financial staff to operate
this system adequately. NTC's expanded operations call for further staff
training. The timeliness of NTC's accounting also needs to be improved and
steps have been initiated in this regard, e.g., instructions have been
issued to the technical departments to promptly inform the accounts office
about the status of capital works and usage of stores.  Increased use of
computer for subscriber billing (para 4.16) and other accounting routines
will also facilitate the timely completion of NTC's financial statements.
G. Audit
4.12      Under the third project, NTC was required to furnish to IDA
copies of its audited financial statements within six mnths of the end of
its fiscal year. NTC has so far not been able to comply with this covenant
and, despite some recent improvement, NTC's audited financial statements
are still four to six months late. Delays are due, first, to deficient
internal procedures and lack of mechanization of accounting routines (para
4.11) and, second, to the late appointment of the external auditors, who
are appointed by HMG for each year (the auditors for FY83 were appointed
only at the end of that fiscal year.) Furthermore, NTC's Board has to
approve draft accounts before these are sent for audit and Government has
to approve the audit report before it is sent to the Bank. During



- 21 -
negotiations, NTC's internal accounting procedures and the need for timely
appointment of the external auditors were discussed and assurances were
obtained that: NTC's unaudited accounts will be made available to IDA
within six months of the end of its fiscal year, and corresponding audit
report will be submitted to IDA two months thereafter.
H. Billing and Collection
4.13      Private subscribers generally pay promptly to avoid their service
being cut off; hence, the bulk of bills outstanding for three months or
more belongs to the government. Outstanding bills for NTC's services to
government are currently estimated to equal over seven months of billing to
government agencies. Nevertheless, NTC is required to pay over 57.5%
income tax on revenues not yet collected. This is a significant drain on
NTC's resources, especially in a situation where NTC will need all
available cash to carry out its investment program. A breakdown of
subscriber accounts receivable according to age for FY81-84 is given below:
Table 4.1: Accounts Receivables from NTC Subscribers

Of which government                   10.1    11.1    13.4    15.2
4.14      Some of NTC's accounts receivables are not adequately documented
and, according to the FY82 audit report, may not be collectable.  NTC
should therefore make adequate provisions for and/or write off bad debts
for past services and take steps to accelerate the collection of overdue
bills. This issue was discussed during negotiations and assurances were
obtained from HMG that the amount billed by NTC for telecommunications
services rendered to the government departments, agencies and entities up
to May 31, 1985 will be paid by HMG in three installments as follows: 25%,
by October 15, 1985; 25% by February 15, 1986; and 50% by October 15,
1986. Furthermore, assurances were obtained that, not later than
October 15, 1985, HMG shall submit to IDA for review procedures to ensure
that the government departments, agencies and entities shall pay to NTC,
within two months of their receipt, the bills for telecommunications
services rendered to them as of June 1, 1985, and thereafter taking into
account IDA's comments adopt and implement such procedures.



- 22 -
4.15      Until recently, except for telex service, NTC's bills were
prepared manually. The first new digital telephone exchanges were put into
service by mid 1984 and the billing information in respect of the automatic
long-distance calls is now recorded on magnetic tapes. This requires
computerization of the telephone billing, initially for reading the tapes
and classifying and tabulating the billing information, and later for
printing of complete bills.
4.16      On IDA's recommendation, NTC sent two of its staff to study
computerized telephone billing in Burma and Malaysia, requested test tapes
from BTM (the switching equipment contractor), and formed a task force to
study NTC's computer needs. A contract was signed with the National
Computer Center (NCC) in Kathmandu to handle NTC's computerized billing.
Negotiations to expand NTC's use of NCC services are under way. NTC's task
force on its computer needs has recently completed its report. The
management consultants to be appointed under the project (para 4.03) will
review the task force recommendations, prepare a detailed feasibility
study, undertake system analysis, assist in programming and/or adaptation
of existing standard programs and make recommendations on the
hardware--either in the form of a separate NTC computer center or in the
form of terminal equipment connected to the NCC computer.
4.17      The present system of NTC requiring subscribers to pay bills at
individual exchanges and manual verification of collection is not
satisfactory and unsuited for a rapidly expanding network. Management
consultants would be required to review these procedures, make
recommendations and assist NTC in implementing changes agreed on.
T. Insurance
4.18      Apart from insurance during transport and installation, generally
NTC does not insure its fixed assets. The cost of such insurance is high
and NTC considers that the geographical spread of its assets provides a
good dispersion of risk as the damage would be limited in any single
incident. This is reasonable and in line with the approach adopted by
other telecommunications entities.
V. FINANCES
A. Past Financial Performance
5.01      NTC's past financial performance has been satisfactory, with a
rate of return well above the 10% level covenanted under the ongoing
credits. NTC's income statements for FY81-84 are given in Annex 18. A
summary for FY79-84 is given below:

a/ Based on provisional, unaudited accounts.
b/ Based on fixed assets at historic costs.
5.02      NTC's declining financial performance in FY83 as measured by the
operating ratio and rate of return was mainly due to: (a) an extraordinary
salary increase of about 20% for NTC staff effective in FY83 in accordance
with the general salary increase for HMG staff, which increased NTC's
operating costs; and (b) in respect of the satellite earth station
financed by of UK and commissioned in October 1982, a full year's
depreciation was charged against FY83 results, while increased revenues
from the asset accrued for only about eight months of that fiscal year.

5.04      NTC's current assets include NRs 27.0 million in accounts
receivable, of which over half are for services rendered to the government
(para 4.13). NTC's external auditors for FY82, Messrs. Price Waterhouse
(India), have expressed doubts about the recoverability of all outstanding
accounts, as some of these have been outstanding for several years and, for
many, adequate supporting documentation is not available. Hence, NTC's
current assets may be overstated. However, an eventual write-off of some
accounts receivables would affect NTC's FY84 position only in a minor way
and current ratio and debt/equity ratio would still be satisfactory.
C. Valuation of Assets
5.05      Under the third project, NTC was required to revalue its fixed
assets in operation, in a manner satisfactory to IDA, for the purpose of
rate of return calculations. However, due to initial small scale
purchases, use of expatriate labor for installation, and high cost of
transportation due to lack of roads, the actual unit cost of old equipment
as booked by NTC is high compared to its current replacement cost. The
cost of the satellite earth station, a major asset added in FY83, appears
high as compared with its likely replacement cost today. Considering that
the total book value of NTC's assets in operation reflected reasonably well
their replacement cost under international competitive bidding, IDA did not
require NTC to revalue its fixed assets. The recent devaluations of the
Nepalese Rupees against the US Dollar has increased the replacement cost of
the imported equipment. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
NTC shall assess annually the replacement cost of its fixed assets in a
manner satisfactory to IDA and revalue these assets, if necessary, to avoid
distortions of its rate of return calculations. For projection purposes,
NTC's assets as of FY85 have been revalued by 35% and an annual revluation
of 5% has been applied from FY86 (Annex 20).
D. Projected Financial Performance
5.06      NTC's projected income statements and balance sheets for FY85-92
are given in Annexes 18 and 19 and notes and assumptions on these
statements are given in Annex 21. A summary of major projected financial

5.07      The financial projections assume a tariff increase averaging 20%
in FY86 and that grant funds provided to HMG by JICA for the rural project
(para 3.03) will be passed on to NTC in the form of a government equity
contribution. The financial projections indicate that tariffs may need to
be further increased as from FY90. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that (a) HMG will transfer funds recived from JICA to NTC as
government equity contribution; (b) the level of telecommunications tariffs
in effect on January 1, 1985 will be increased by at least 20% not later
than September 30, 1985; and (c) HMG, NTC and IDA will review the need for
further tariff adjustments in FY89 when the results of the proposed tariff
study (para 4.05) are expected to be available and the revenue earning
potential of the fully automatic long distance traffic is known.
5.08      Projections indicate a satisfactory future financial performance,
except for a marginally low debt service coverage for certain years. To
ensure satisfactory financial performance, including adequate cash
generation to carry out the proposed project, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that NTC will produce a rate of return of at least
12%4/ for each of the years of the project period (up to FY90). Once the
cash generation requirements for subsequent development programs are known,
IDA may agree to change the required rate of return as from FY91.
E. Financing Plan
5.09      NTC's projected funds flow statements for FY85-92 are given in
Annex 22. A summary of the fund requirements for the FY86-90 period and
the sources from which they would be met is presented below:

5.10      According to above projections, NTC will (after covering
operating costs, debt service, and payment of income tax), contribute 23%
of FY86-90 capital expenditures and required increase in working capital
from internal sources (net internal generation plus subscriber deposits),
which is satisfactory. The remaining 77% of the requirements will be
financed through the remaining part of the third IDA credit and the
proposed IDA credit (13%), other borrowings (42%), and government equity
contribution for the FY86-90 foreign exchange component of the JICA project
(22%). During negotiations, assurances were obtained from HMG that
adequate funds will be made available to NTC to carry out the project.

5.11      During negotiations, the status of co-financing arrangements for
the components of the project not financed by proposed IDA credit were
reviewed and it was agreed that evidence, satisfactory to IDA, in respect
of the following shall be conditions of effectiveness of the IDA credit:
(a) that the required cofinancing for the project had been secured on
adequate terms and conditions; and (b) that all conditions of effectiveness
of the agreements with cofinancing agencies, other than the effectiveness
of IDA credit, have been met.
5.12      The financial projections assume that HMG will onlend the
proposed IDA credit and cofinancing funds for the project to NTC at an
annual interest rate of 12%, to be repaid over 10 years after 5 years of
grace, with NTC assuming the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations,
it was agreed that a relending agreement for the proposed IDA credit
satisfactory to IDA between HMG and NTC shall be a condition of credit
effectiveness.
5.13      NTC's FY86-90 investment program (para 3.01) is large compared to
its past achievements; hence, any major addition to the program could
impose a serious strain on NTC's financial and institutional resources.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that NTC will consult with
IDA before undertaking works outside the appraised investment program if
such works would require investment of NRs 50 million or more in any one
year. Furthermore, assurances were obtained that NTC will not incur any
debt over NRs 30 million annually during the project period other than for
purposes of carrying out the FY86-90 investment program, and as from FY91
onwards, NTC shall maintain ratio between its net revenues and debt service
of at least 1.5 times during any fiscal year.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Telecommunications and the Economy
6.01      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of Nepal's
economy. Due to the rigorous climate and mountainous terrain of Nepal,
surface and air links are often severed during the winter season, leaving
many localities totally without means of communications for emergency,
administrative, business and other purposes. Partly for these reasons,
most government, business and other activities are located in Kathmandu,
thus increasing the need for other regions to communicate with Kathmandu.
Compared with alternative means of communication, telecommunications are
more efficient in terms of capital, energy consumption and user time. With
adequate telecommunications facilities, the level and variety of productive
activities can be increased considerably in areas where this would
otherwise not be feasible. In terms of the specific constraints on Nepal's
economic development, telecommunications can play a significant role,
especially in connection with:



- 28 -
(a) increasing the efficiency and reliability of transport and
helping to alleviate domestic and international
transport-related bottlenecks, especially in the delivery
of inputs to agriculture and of produce to markets;
through better use of available transport, this would also
result in energy savings and/or permit greater efficiency
of productive interactions for a given level of energy
consumption;
(b) improving the working of the market mechanism by
expediting and extending access to information, especially
in relation to developing more efficient marketing of
agricultural products and supporting export trade;
(c) providing essential domestic and international
communications from and to hotels, tour operators,
transport and other services, as required for efficient
utilization of existing hotels and other tourist related
services; the 20% annual increase in tourist arrivals
recorded in the past would not have been possible without
improved telecommunications facilities;5/
(d) facilitating communication between Kathmandu and
provincial centers, as required for effective
decentralization of development management and monitoring;
(e) facilitating extension of health, family planning, public
works, education, government administration and other
services to provincial and rural areas, including
extension of the reach of scarce expertise for advice,
support and supervision; and
(f) increasing domestic savings obtained by transfering part
of the incremental net income from telecommunications
operations to government.
B. Distribution of Benefits
6.02      In urban centers, it is expected that new telephone subscribers
will follow the pattern of existing subscribers (para 2.03), with about 70%
of new lines being connected to businesses and government offices, who use
the telephone mainly in connection with economic production and
distribution activities. Furthermore, residential telephones which would
5/  In the period 1968-77, both subscriber connections to the tourist
sector and numbers of tourists arriving in Nepal increased by about 20%
annually. Total subscriber connections rose just under 16% per annum.
(Source: Economics of Telecommunications in Nepal, August 1980, a
study undertaken for NTC by Integrated Development Systems, Kathmandu).



- 29 -
account for about 30% of new lines, are likely to be utilized significantly
for work or business related purposes.  Experience in other countries
suggests that new rural telephones will be used predominantly for economic
purposes, and to some extent for social purposes, all contributing to an
improved quality of life.
6.03      The benefits of the FY86-90 program will accrue to users in
Kathmandu, in provincial towns and in rural areas. On project completion,
basic telephone service will be available in 72 out of 75 administrative
districts and in 169 out of 4,021 rural centers, leaving 3,852 rural
centers still without service. Table 6.1 below summarizes the improvement
in access to telephone service under the program:

6.04      In addition to serving the needs of economic production and
distribution activities in both urban and rural areas, the FY86-90 program
will also result in a substantial net cash flow from NTC to government for
use in other sectors less capable of mobilizing domestic resources (para
6.08).
C. Program Size and Composition
6.05      NTC's FY86-90 investment program is large relative to past
achievements. In particular, it aims at increasing the number of connected
telephone lines at about 32% per year, adding on average 8,800 lines per
year. This compares with 11% and 1,300 lines per year averaged in



- 30 -
FY79-83. Even so, at the end of the program, the unmet expressed demand is
forecast to be about 68,600, twice that at the beginning of the program
(Annex 4) and, as shown in Table 6.1, only a small fraction of the
population will have access to telephone service at the end of the
program.  Nonetheless, a larger progam is constrained by NTC's limited
financial resources and implementation capacity (paras 2.09 and 2.10).
6.06      In general, the program comprises a reasonable mix of investment
addressed to improve the quality of existing services and expand service
across the country in response to forecast demand and broad regional
priorities. However, for more sound investment planning, better economic
inputs are necessary in the future. First, demand forecasts are based on
incomplete data. The risk of overinvestment under the proposed project is
negligible,6/ but for larger subsequent investment programs, better
supported demand and traffic forecasts will be needed.
Technical assistance will be provided under the proposed project to
establish proper demand forecasting procedures and methodology in NTC to
provide basis for improved long-term network planning. Second, NTC's
tariff level and structure need to be reviewed to ensure adequate internal
cash generation, domestic resource mobilization, efficient use of existing
facilities and provide signals for efficient allocation of new investments
(para 6.11). Action in this regard will be initiated under the project
with the provision of technical assistance for a telecommunications tariff
study and development of pricing policy guidelines. Third, the project
provides for technical assistance to NTC to establish a Fundamental
Planning Unit to prepare a strategy for future sector development keeping
in view the spatial and sectoral priorities of national development (para
4.05).
D. Least Cost Solution
6.07      The technical means adopted under the project are to a large
extent determined by the characteristic of the existing systems and by
NTC's decision, supported by IDA, to adopt digital technology for all
future development where economically viable and fully automate the
domestic telephone and telex services. The solutions chosen (digital main
exchanges and remote line units, digital microwave systems on main routes,
analog VHF/UlF systems for spur routes, etc.) are likely to result in the
lowest costs regarding both initial investment and recurrent maintenance
and operating costs over the long run.
6/ The overall demand forecasts, though based on incomplete data, are
plausible. Also, since unsatisfied demand is large all over Nepal,
there is very limited risk of oversupply in any one place.



- 31 -
E. Fiscal Impact
6.08      HMG charges NTC property tax-- currently about NRS 3.6 million
(US$200,000) a year--and an income tax of 57.5% of net income before
pension provisions. Further, HMG charges NTC custom duties at 1% for
equipment financed by IDA credit and other concessional funds and onlends
IDA credit and other concessionary funds to NTC on commercial terms. The
proposed investment program is expected to increase substantially the net
flow of funds to the government. The projected fiscal impact of NTC's
operations on HMG (e.g., NTC payments to HMG and HMG outlays for NTC) for
FY86-92 is indicated in Annex 24. The net fiscal surplus that would accrue
to HMG during this five year period is estimated at about NRs 831.3 million
(US$45 million) most of which originates from concessionary funds being
onlent at commercial rates. In sum, the users of telecommunications
services in Nepal will make a major contribution to the nation's fiscal
efforts over the remainder of this decade.
F. Coverage of Foreign Debt Service
6.09      In FY82, NTC's payments to foreign telecommunications
administrations exceeded what it collected from these administrations by
about NRs 0.7 million. However, NTC generated considerable foreign
exchange in terms of expenditures by foreign tourists on domestic and
international calls originated by them within the country. A conservative
estimate indicates that the value of tourist originated calls in FY83
equaled about US$0.5 million. Based on the expected increase in
international traffic, this amount will increase to the equivalent of
US$2.0 million per yer by FY90. Further, a revision of international
revenue sharing agreements and collection rates (para 6.11) could lead to a
net surplus of receipts over payments to foreign administrations equivalent
to about US$0.5 million in FY85 increasing to about US$1.2 million in
FY90. NTC's generation of foreign exchange is, therefore, expected to
cover a substantial portion of future debt service on foreign loans for the
sector. No attempt has been made to establish to what extent
telecommunications contributes to the foreign exchange savings or earnings
by other sectors, e.g., transport. This contribution is likely to far
exceed the foreign exchange earnings estimated above.
G. Tariffs
6.10      A summary of NTC's present principal telecommunications tariffs
is given in Annex 25. With IDA's support, installation charges and
subscriber deposits were increased in April 1984 and, as from January 1985,
collection rates for international calls were increased by 20%. Other
tariffs have remained unchanged since 1978 while inflation pushed up both
capital and operating costs. Even so, NTC's revenues have been adequate so
far to maintain NTC's financial viability due to a substantial increase in
telecommunications traffic per subscriber since 1978. However, the
financial projections for FY85-90 (para 5.06) indicate that NTC's tariffs
need to be increased by about 20% in FY86 to provide NTC with adequate



- 32 -
funds for the local costs of its FY86-90 investment program and to ensure
its financial viability. The need for tariff increase is mainly due to the
following factors: (a) with few exceptions, NTC's tariffs have decreased
in real terms since 1978; (b) NTC pays an income tax of over 57.5% of net
income; hence, less than 42.5% of the revenues resulting from a tariff
increase can be used for NTC's investment program; and (c) the JICA project
(para 3.03) will require more funds than it will generate; hence a need for
cross-subsidization from the rest of the network. Considering the large
unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services and that tariffs have
been falling in real terms since 1978, a substantial consumer surplus is
likely to remain after the proposed tariff increases.
6.11      A comparison of NTC's telephone tariffs with those of other
developing countries (Annex 26) indicates that they are overall low. This
mainly results from low call charges which more than offset the relatively
high initial charges (Annex 25). Despite heavy call congestion during
prime business hours, there is no peak/off-peak price differenciation for
long distance or local calls; also, local calls are untimed, and currently
there is no provison for higher charges for operator assisted calls once
subscriber trunk dialing becomes available. Hence, it is necessary to
review not only the level of tariffs (para 6.10) but also their structure.
The time is opportune, since by end of 1985, when automatic digital
exchanges will be in service, the technical means to measure and bill
according to usage will be available. The general approach to the tariff
study to be undertaken by NTC with the assistance of an expert (para 4.05)
will be that of marginal cost pricing subject to financial and temporary
supply constraints. It would therefore consider cost structure, demand and
financial aspects, and result in both pricing policy guidelines and
recommendations for initial changes in tariff structure. The study will
include a review of the collection rates for international calls and
current agreements with foreign administrations.7/ During negotiations,
the tariff increase needed for FY86 and a date by which it will be
implemented were discussed and agreed (para 5.07). NTC and IDA will review
the need for further adjustments of tariff levels and structure in FY89
when the results of the proposed tariff study are expected to be available
and the revenue potential of the fully automatic long distance traffic is
known.
H. Return on Investment
6.12      The financial rate of return (FRR) of the proposed project,
defined as the discount rate that produces a zero net present value of
projected incremental cash flows, is 16% (Annex 26). The FRR of NTC's
total FY86-90 investment program is estimated at 10%. The lower return on
7/ In 1983, NTC's agreement with and tariff for calls to India was
revised, resulting in nearly doubling NTC's revenues from the traffic
with India.



- 33 -
the total investment program is due to the very low return of the JICA
project (para 3.03). If transfer payments (property and income taxes and
custom duties on imported goods) are eliminated from the calculation and
the foreign exchange component is shadow priced at 20% over nominal levels,
the resulting economic rate of return (ERR) of the project would be 17%.
6.13      Both the financial and economic rates of return probably
understate the benefits to be derived from the proposed program and the
project. No attempt has been made to estimate the increased consumer
surplus to existing subscribers as the services are expanded and quality
improves, nor of the consumer surplus of new subscribers (likely to be high
even for the marginal subscriber since there will continue to be a large
unmet demand). If NTC's tariffs were maintained at FY86 levels in real
terms and subscribers are willing to pay these tariffs (as they have been
willing to pay even higher tariffs in real terms in the past), the economic
rate of return of the project would be 24%. Further, some parts of
projected equipment installations will, in accordance with good engineering
standards, have spare capacity on completion of the project. This will
enable NTC to earn from such equipment substantial additional revenues in
the future with marginal additional investments in other equipment. Such
future revenues have not been included in the rate of return calculations
though the full capital cost has been included. Hence, the above rates of
return (para 6.12) should be regarded as minimum estimates.
I. Risks
6.14      Due to the large unsatisfied expressed demand for
telecommunications services, the project offers no significant risk of
insufficient demand resulting from a possible reduction in economic
activity. Further, since the project comprises a large number of partly
independent activities, delay in completion of an individual component
would not generally prevent the use of other completed project components.
Costs and benefits of telecommunications projects tend to be delayed in
roughly the same degree, so the impact on the return on investment may not
be significant even though delays would result in a lower net present value
of the project. The creation of a Project Organization Unit (para 3.14)
and early invitation of bids (para 3.15) should reduce the risks of any
substantial delays in project execution. According to a risk analysis, the
probability of the financial rate of return being under 11% is less than
0.03 (Annex 27). A sensitivity analysis on the ERR of the project
indicates that a combination of 20% higher capital expenditures, 20% higher
operating costs and 20% lower revenues, would result in a ERR of 9%.
Further, an analysis of switching values at 10%, the opportunity cost of
capital in Nepal, shows that for the project's net present value to be
zero, either capital cost must increase by 51% or operating costs must
increase by 363% or operating revenue must fall by 31%.
J. Environmental and Health Aspects
6.15      The project is not expected to adversely affect the environmental
or public health in any way. On the other hand, the project would lead to
more efficient utilization of vehicles and fuel, and facilitate delivery of
health services.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from HMG and NTC as
follows:
(a) NTC shall appoint by December 31, 1985 and under terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA management
consultants to undertake a comprehensive review of NTC's
organization and management, recommend corrective
measures and assist NTC in implementation of accepted
recommendations (para 4.03);
(b) NTC shall appoint by December 31, 1985 and under terms
of reference and conditions satisfactory to IDA, four
technical experts for long-term planning, demand
forecasting, and tariff and economic studies, and
appoint counterpart NTC staff to work with the expert by
the same date (para 4.05);
(c) within four months after management consultants have
submitted their recommendations on NTC staff emoluments
and benefits, special allowance for training instructors
and stipends for trainees, NTC and IDA shall agree on an
action plan for implementation of such recommendations
as are acceptable to HMG, NTC and IDA (paras 4.08 and
4.09);
(d) NTC shall make its unaudited financial statements
available to IDA within six months of the end of its
financial year and corresponding audit report within two
months thereafter (para 4.12);
(e)  HMG shall settle bills for services rendered by NTC
up to May 31, 1985 in three installments: 25% by
October 31, 1985; 25% by February 15, 1986; and 50% by
October 15, 1986. Furthermore, by October 15, 1985, HMG
will propose to IDA procedures to ensure that NTC's
bills for services after June 1, 1985 are paid within
two months of their receipt and taking into account
IDA's comments, introduce such procedures (para 4.14);
(f) NTC shall assess annually the replacement cost of its
fixed assets and, if necessary, revalue these assets
(para 5.05);
(g)  HMG shall transfer funds received from JICA to NTC in
the form of a government equity contribution (para
5.07);



- 35 -
(h) by September 30, 1985, NTC's telecommuncations tariffs
in effect on January 1, 1985 shall be raised by at least
20%; (para 5.07);
(i) NTC shall take steps, including tariff increases, to
maintain a rate of return on its fixed assets in
operation of 12% per annum in FY86-90 and, for FY91 and
each year thereafter, such other rate of return as may
be agreed on with IDA (para 5.08);
(j)  HMG will make available to NTC adequate funds to carry
out the project (para 5.10);
(k) NTC will consult with IDA before undertaking any new
works outside the appraised investment program which
would require investment of NRs 50 million or more in
any one year (para 5.13).
(1) NTC shall not incur any debt over NRs 30 annually during
FY86-90 other than for purposes of carrying out the
FY86-90 investment program (para 5.13); and
(m) As from FY91, NTC shall maintain a ratio between its net
revenues and debt service of at least 1.5 times during
any fiscal year (para 5.13).
7.03      The following shall be the conditions of effectiveness of the
credit:
(a) NTC shall have issued bid invitations for subscriber
facilities, transmission equipment for rural areas and
expansion equipment for earth station to be financed
under IDA credit (para 3.14);
(b) HMG shall have furnished evidence satisfactory to IDA
that all cofinancing for the project on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA had been secured and that
all conditions of effectiveness of the agreements with
the cofinancing agencies, other than effectivness of the
IDA credit, shall have been met (para 5.11); and
(c) HMG and NTC shall have signed a relending agreement for
the IDA credit under terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA (para 5.12).
7.05      Subject to the above conditions and assurances, the proposed
project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 20.7 million
(US$22.0 million equivalent) for a term of 50 years including 10 years of
grace.

JICA Project
1.        The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has offered
to finance a rural telecommunications project in Nepal through a
grant-in-aid to the Nepal Government. After preliminary discussions with
NTC in September 1982 and a field survey in January-February 1983, JICA
submitted a draft of a Final Report.
2.        The JICA project is expected to be implemented in four phases
over a six-year period (FY86-92) and provide an extensive digital radio
tranmission network mainly in the Trans-Himalayan and Middle Regions of
Nepal to serve 63 rural communities. Each community would be provided with
(a) five long distance telephone connections--four to important individual
administrative subscribers and one to serve as a long distance public call
office; (b) 27 facsimile sets in 10 important towns (including four in
Kathmandu) for transmission of telegrams; (c) prefabricated transportable
structures at all sites for housing equipment; and (d) solar power at all
sites without public power supply. The equipment contractors, who would be
selected by JICA, would install all equipment in the first three phases: in
the fourth phase, NTC would carry out the installations.
3.        The foreign costs of the six-year project are assessed at
US$36.77 million and local costs at US$3.05 million. The JICA's draft
report dated August 1983 which was available to the Bank's appraisal
mission did not contain full details of the equipment quantities nor did it
indicate the basis of cost calculations. However, the project appeared to
be overengineered for the services to be provided and area served, and the
costs high. A discounted cash flow analysis of the incremental project
costs and revenues as presented in JICA's report assumes a substantially
higher future tariff levels than those currently in force. Further, the
projected costs and revenues have not been deflated to present each year's
cash flow at the purchasing power of the base year. Even so, JICA's own
conclusion of this analysis is that the project is not financially viable.
A discounted cash flow analysis, done according to methods acceptable to
the Bank, could indicate a sharply negative return on this project.
4.        Both HMG and NTC appreciate that the JICA project is not
financially viable and that it will constitute a serious strain on NTC's
finances. However, HMG decided to go ahead with the project on political,
social and economic considerations, especially as the Japanese funds are
given to Nepal as a grant-in-aid. Partly due to the expected poor
financial performance of the JICA project, the HMG and NTC have agreed that
NTC will receive the Japanese funds as a Government equity contribution.

ANNEX 16
Page 1 of 5
NEPAL
NEPAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (NTC)
Fundamental Planning Unit (FPU) in NTC
1.        The following are the proposed guidelines for establishing a
Fundamental Planning Unit (FPU) in NTC to review and assess the long-term
telecommunications needs of Nepal, determine sector policies and
objectives, and lay down long-term plans to attain these goals.
2.  Terms of Reference
2.1       The broad terms of reference of the FPU shall be to:
(a) foster dialogue between the telecommunications entity
and the Government and its agencies, the public and
private enterprises and the public in general on the
future development of telecommunications services in
the country;
(b) identify and quantify the future telecommunications
needs of the country based on the national economic
development plans and other relevant information;
(c) determine long-term policies, objectives, strategies
and priorities of telecommunications to meet these
future needs;
(d) prepare broad long-term plans to attain these goals;
(e) assess the resources--human, material and
financial--needed to achieve the development targets
and prepare plans for their mobilization; and
(f)  guide the entity's management on investment, pricing
and technological decisions.
3. Development Objectives and Basic Policy
3.1       In order that the NTC management has a broad perspective of the
future of the telecommunications sector in Nepal and of NTC's role in it,
the FPU shall:



- 52 -
ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 5
(a)  assess the likely long-term evolution of the
telecommunications sector up to, say, year 2000;
(b)  identify the main development efforts in other sectors
(both productive and social) in which
telecommunications may play a significant role, and
ascertain to what extent the telecommunications needs
of those sectors have been perceived and have
manifested as demand for telecommunications services;
(c)  prepare long-term aggregate forecasts of demand by type
of service at five-year intervals;
(d)  produce rough estimates of telecommunications sector
growth in terms of facilities and investment, and its
likely spatial distribution;
(e)  establish overall objectives in respect of the domestic
and international telecommunications services regarding
the proportions of demands it expects to meet in the
medium and long terms, new areas to be served,
automation, digitalization, improvement of service
quality, introduction of new services and facilities,
etc.; and
(f)  define for the management the criteria for
determination of broad policies on development,
tariffs, and investment in the sector.
4. Resources
4.1       In order that the management has a broad perspective of the
constraints that could impede the above objectives, the FPU shall assess as
follows the material, financial, human and technological resources that are
likely to be available to the entity over the development period:
(a)  assess the scope for mobilizing local and foreign
funds, including the extent to which tariff levels and
structure can be adjusted to internally generate
adequate local funds;
(b)  review the possibility and extent to which domestic
manufacture of some telecommunications equipment items
could reduce the impact of investment in the
telecommunications sector on Nepal's balance of
payments;
(c)  analyze NTC's capability to meet the requirements of
managing, operating and developing a growing system,
and the availability of future manpower, training
resources;



ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 5
(d) conduct a technical and economic assessment of new
technologies now available or which may become
available during the planning period, their likely
impact on network design and system operations, their
likely cost trends relative to those of current
technologies, etc.; and
(e) assess the impact and consumer acceptance of new
services and facilities (e.g., data transmission over the
switched telephone network, mobile radio telephones) and the
timing and costs of their introduction.
5. Development Strategy
5.1       Given the overall objectives and policy (para 3) and expected
resource availability (para 4), the FPU shall formulate a long-term
development strategy for NTC. The strategy should be flexible and capable
of accommodating, to a reasonable degree, the uncertainty in the future
evolution of technology, costs, demand, traffic and available resources,
but should prescribe, at a minimum, the following:
(a) the level of future investments on the basis of
five-year periods up to year 2000, the sources of local
and foreign financing, and specific actions necessary
for their mobilization;
(b) broad technical definitions of the telephone, telex and
data networks to be developed and the types of
equipment to be utilized; these must be based on
estimates of telephone, telex and data connections and
forecast domestic and international traffic
requirements at five-year intervals up to year 2000,
with sufficient details for comparative analysis of
alternative systems, configurations and techniques to
determine the least cost solutions for meeting each of
these requirements;
(c)  the nature and timing of major changes required in
NTC's organization and management structure. In
particular, consider the extent to which the
management, operation, and detailed planning should be
decentralized. Assess the manpower requirements at
different levels for operation and management, and
prepare manpower and training plans to ensure timely
availability of staff adequate in number,
qualifications and training. Further, keeping in view
factors such as introduction of advanced technology and
organizational and management practices which could
reduce staff requirements, indicate necessary changes
in the recruitment policies and procedures, job
descriptions, qualifications of new recruits for
different jobs, and training programs; and



- 54 -
ANNEX 16
Page 4 of 5
(d)  future land requirements for telecommunications
buildings in urban and rural areas particularly in
areas currently unserved, and measures to be taken to
ensure adequate provisions in the plans prepared by
local government or municipal authorities responsible
for land development and usage.
6. Fundamental Network Plan
6.1       To ensure technical integration among all parts of the domestic
network on the one hand and its technical interface with international
networks following internationally agreed standards on the other, the FPU
shall establish fundamental transmission, switching and routing,
signalling, numbering and charging plans.
7. Short-term Development Programs
7.1       The FPU shall periodically review the government's national
development objectives, strategy and specific programs in other sectors,
and interpret them in terms of the likely pattern of telecommunications
development in the foreseeable future, including priorities of investments
for improvement of services to current users, expansion in areas already
served, extending service to new rural and backward areas, introduction of
new services, and appropriate tariff policies. Considering these
conditions and the anticipated constraints in one or more of the material,
financial or human resources at different periods of time, the FPU shall
produce a series of five-year development programs, each of which
translates the broad, overall development objectives, policies and strategy
into a prescription of specific actions over five-year periods. The
development programs would become the basis for NTC's rolling investment
program, tariff strategy, and institutional strengthening effort. They
would also become the focus of NTC's relationships with Government and with
domestic, bilateral and multilateral sources of financing.
7.2       Each five-year development program prepared by the PPU shall
comprise the following:
(a) regional development targets, distribution of new
investment among the regions, and guidelines for the
distribution of investment within the regions.
Detailed planning could be carried out at regional and
local levels, but plans for the development of the
higher levels of the long distance network should be
prepared centrally at headquarters;
(b) cost estimates and a broad schedule of implementation;
jobs, and training programs; and



- 55 -
ANNEX 16
Page 5 of 5
(c)  clear economic and technical justifications of the
program for each region and the country as a whole,
together with a complementary strategy for setting
tariffs which will facilitate access and usage in
priority areas and by priority target groups; and
(d)  financial and institutional requirements of the
program, and steps necessary to mobilize resources
(e.g., tariff increases, staff recruitment and
training) including those required to prepare for
subsequent development programs.
8. Special Functions
8.1       The FPU may also:
(a)  undertake other studies, such as special aspects of the
economics of telecommunications, domestic manufacture,
and research and development;
(b) consider the feasibility of establishing domestic
manufacture of telecommunications equipment, look
carefully into the scope, economic justification and
viability of manufacturing different items of
telecommunications equipment and establishing related
domestic R&D facilities;
(c)  corsider establishing a permanent technical research
and development capability within the entity to assess
systematically the potential value for domestic
application of new telecommunications services,
facilities and technologies being developed in other
countries, and to advise the management on the adoption
and adaptation of such innovations.
9. Staffing of the FPU
9.1       The type of work required of the FPU necessarily implies that the
FPU shall be a multidisciplinary unit, comprising specialists from
engineering, finance and economics and perhaps from time-to-time from
social science fields. The FPU unit should be built up gradually, drawing
primarily on the assistance and expertise of other units in the entity,
and, where necessary, on other outside entities. Using available expertise
from the entity would ensure that the FPU's output reflects the knowledge
and experience within the entity.

a/  Up to FY85, NTC's fixed assets and corresponding accumulated depreciation have been revalued by 35%.  This
percentage is based on the devaluation of the NRs against the US$ since the year of acquisition of the
respective asset. As from FY86, fixed assets have been revalued by 5% p.a., which on average is expected
to reflect the increase in replacement cost.
b/  Assumes depreciation on revalued assets fully deductahle for tax purposes.

Notes and Assumptions On Financial Statements
Income Statements
1.        Tariffs are expected to be increased on average by 20% as from
September 30, 1985.
2.        Local Telephone Revenues.  An installation fee of NRs 2,000 has
been assumed as from mid FY85. Other local charges and traffic per
subscriber are expected to equal those of 1984.
3.        Long distance telephone revenues are expected to increase 15% per
annum; additionally, introduction of STD (80% of long distance traffic -in
FY86 and practically all remaining long-distance traffic in FY88) is
expected to double the traffic volume; finally, giving access to long
distance service to new places is expected to increase total traffic by a
further 10% by FY88.
4,        International telephone revenue are expected to increase 25% per
annum. This assumption is backed by recent traffic statistics.
5.        Telegraph revenues are expected to increase slightly over FY84
levels and remain at that level as telex and telephone services are
expanded.
6.        Telex revenues are expected to increase at the same rate as
average number of telex subscribers.
7.        Miscellaneous revenues (mainly leased circuits) are expected to
increase by 20% per year.
8.        Above revenue increases are expected to occur due to increased
traffic and connection of new subscribers. Additionally, tariff increases
averaging 20% from FY86 are projected to ensure NTC's financial viability
and ability to generate sufficient cash to cover the local cost component
of its investment program.
9.        Wages, etc., are expected to increase by 10% per annum as from
1985.
10.       Maintenance costs (excluding wages), expressed as a percentage of
plant in operation, is expected to decline from 4% in FY83 to 2.5% in FY88
as the new equipment will need less maintenance.

11.       Depreciation has been calculated at an average rate of about 5.8%
per annum of gross fixed assets in operation based on NTC's recent
averages.
12.       Miscellaneous expenses are expected to increase by 10% per annum.
13.       Interest is taken from the debt statement (see Annex 23).
14.       Income tax is calculated at a rate of 57.5% of net income before
tax and before deduction of pension provisions (about 8% of total wages).
Balance Sheet
15.       Plant in operation and plant under construction.  Capital
investment for a year are expected to be put into operation by the end of
subsequent year.
16.       Cash and banks has been used as the "balancing" item.
17.       Accounts receivable are assumed to be brought down to the
equivalent of three months of billing by the end of FY86 and to the
equivalent of two months of billing as from the end of FY87.
18.       Inventories, mainly spares, are expected to equal about one year
of consumption. Equipment for capital works are expected to be booked
under "plant under construction."
19.       Other current assets, mainly prepayments and suspense accounts,
are expected to go down as the second and third projects are completed.
They may build up again at the start of NTC's subsequent investment
program.
20.       As from FY86, government's equity in NTC is expected to increase
as the JICA-funds are passed on to NTC in the form of a government equity
contribution.
21.       Long-term debt and current portion, see debt statement, Annex 23.
22.       Accounts payable are expected to increase by about 15% per annum.
23.       Pension fund is expected to increase by about 8% of total wages.
24.       Subscriber's deposits to average NRs 5,000 per new subscriber as
from FY84.

Return On Investment
Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
1.        The benefit period of the project extends from 1988-2007, when on
average the equipment provided under the project is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures for the project are defined as NTC's
investment program for 1986-90, excluding ongoing works for previous
programs, preinvestments for subsequent programs and the JICA-project.
3.        Incremental operating costs and revenues for the project are
based on expected number of subscribers connected and traffic increases
brought about by the project (including the replacement of 1,370 manual
subscribers in FYs88-89). The projected incremental revenues are further
based on increased tariffs of 20% in FY86. Eventual tariff increases as
from FY90 have not been taken into account. Subscriber deposits have been
treated as revenues when collected. Operating costs exclude depreciation
and interest charges. For the calculation of the FRR, paid income tax has
been treated as an operating cost.
4.        All cash expenditures and revenues have been deflated by 7% in
FY86, 6% in FY87 and in FY88 and 5% per year thereafter to reflect FY85
price levels. As from FY92, expenditures and revenues are assumed to
remain constant in real terms.
5.        No rest values of fixed assets or repayment of subscribers'
deposits at the end of the benefit period have been taken into account as
the FY85 real present value of these would be insignificant.
6.        A summary of incremental project expenditures and revenues at
FY84 price levels is given below:
Capital                Operating              Deflator

87             180.7              4.7          19.3           0.93
88             398.9             16.9          71.1           0.88
89             321.0             19.1         126.2           0.83

92              13.3             77.9         256.2           0.72
93-07             -              80.0         260.0           0.68
The internal financial rate of return for above cash streams is
16.1%.

ANNEX 27
Page 2 of 3
7.        The FRR for NTC's total FY86-90 investment program (IDA and JICA
projects), calculated in the same way as above, is 9.6%. The program FRR
is substantially lower than that for the IDA-project, due to the low
profitibility of the JICA-project. This is also confirmed by JICA's own
calculations.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
8.        The calculations of an ERR for the project are based on the same
assumptions as given above for the calculation of the FRR. The cash
streams for the ERR calculations have furthermore been adjusted as follows:
- capital expenditures have been reduced by custom duties;
- operating expenditures exclude income taxes; and
- foreign exchange has been shadow priced 20% over current
official levels.
No attempt has been made to shadow price labor, as only qualified staff of
which there is no surplus in Nepal would be needed under the project.
9.        Under above assumptions, the internal economic rate of return on
the project is 17.3%. The ERR is slightly lower than the FRR due to the
impact of the shadow pricing of foreign exchange.
10.       Above ERR should be considered a minimum estimate of the real
return of the project, however, as:
- no attempt has been made to estimate consumer surplus,
which could be substantial considering the high demand
for service and the improvement in quality of service
brought about by the project; and
- part of project installations have spare capacity, which
will enable NTC to earn substantial revenues in the
future with marginal investments in equipment. Such
future revenues have not been included in above
calculations.
11.       A sensitivity analysis shows the following results:
Rate of Return
20% increase in capital expenditure                         13.8
20% increase in operating cost                              16.9
20% decrease in revenues                                    12.6
Combination of all above                                     9.3
An analysis of switching values at 10%, the opportunity cost of capital in
Nepal, shows that for the project's net present value to be zero, either
(a) capital costs must increase by 51%, or (b) operating costs must
increase by 363% or (c) operating revenues must fall by 31%.

Risk Analysis
12.             A 200 case Monte Carlo simulatioh was done on the financial rate
of return, based on the following simplified assumptions:
-  the probability of capital expenditures being anywhere
from 10% less to 20% higher than projected is constant
(rectangular probability distribution); and
-  operating expenses and benefits differ from projections
with the following discrete probability distribution:
-10%, .05, -5%, .15, .02% .21, +5%, .15, +10%, .12,
+15.2%, .10, +20%, .08, +25%, .06, +30%, .05, +35%, .03.
Above assumptions are based on the fact that, according to recent PCRs,
both capital expenditures and revenues are often underestimated.
13.               The simulation gave the following results:
