the Global\n            Environment Trust Fund (GET) project are:  first, to develop\n            or locally adapt technologies for handling and processing\n            sugar cane residues emphasizing cane tops, leaves and trash;\n            and second, to strengthen the management and coordination of\n            the Bagasse Energy Development Program (BEDP) implementation\n            by fostering collaboration between the public and private\n            sector in the management of program implementation. The\n            Sugar Energy Development Project consists of three main\n            components:  (a) development and adaptation of technologies\n            for biomass energy production; (b) training of technical\n            staff of bagasse-and-coal plants; and (c) support for BEDP\n            management and coordination, including environmental\n            monitoring.  The GET will fund the total cost of the\n            project, involving expenditures for the equipment and\n            vehicles, short term training courses and study visits, and\n            expenditures for an international workshop."}, "docdt": "1992-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
