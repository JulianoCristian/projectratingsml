Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Mauritius Sugar Energy Development\n            Project (SEDP) in Mauritius. The overall outcome of the\n            projects was rated as marginally satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was also rated as\n            marginally satisfactory. The broad objective of SEDP was to\n            help Government of Mauritius (GOM) and the private sector\n            implement the initial time slice of the Bagasse Energy\n            Development Program (BEDP) (1992-95), which focused on\n            establishing a firm power plant at the Union St Aubin Power\n            Mill (UStA), operating on bagasse and coal, as part of the\n            least-cost program for electric power development in\n            Mauritius. The main lesson learned from the SEDP is that the\n            development of bagasse-based electricity generation in\n            Mauritius requires a stronger linkage between the\n            developments in the sugar industry and those in the power\n            sector, a greater emphasis on multi-purpose benefits of\n            baseload bagasse/coal power plants, and new approaches on\n            the part of both the Bank and Borrower in evaluating and\n            supervising cross-sector projects."}, "docdt": "1998-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
