The unsuccessful\n            project results draws many lessons, of which some follows.\n            Specifically reinforced are issues concerning the critical\n            aspects of: Bank responsiveness to the client needs,\n            particularly legal documents related to restructuring\n            amendments requested by the Government; maintaining a\n            constant transparent dialogue with the client, to understand\n            the reasons for certain decisions; clear Project design and\n            objectives; and, personnel changes, that may affect the\n            project in a negative way. Other lessons include the need\n            for more flexible procurement and disbursement procedures,\n            specifically for emergency operations. Conventional\n            procurement and disbursement rules cannot be applied in a\n            country, where agencies have no incentive to submit invoices\n            or to identify eligible investments. Projects that finance\n            small sub-projects should simplify financial management\n            processes, especially those related to the validation of\n            disbursements and expenditures. And, since very few\n            countries are really prepared to engage in disaster risk\n            management, the Bank should pay specific attention to this\n            issue, and ramp up its efforts to train Bank staff, and\n            Borrowers on this issue. Even though mitigation measures\n            bring about major benefits, they have not been incorporated\n            into the planning of sustainable development in countries\n            repeatedly affected by disasters, such as the case in Mexico."}, "docdt": "2005-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
