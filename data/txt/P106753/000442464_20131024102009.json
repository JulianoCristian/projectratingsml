were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: vision and leadership from\n            the highest-level state authority were essential to keep the\n            focus on program execution. Bank background studies, efforts\n            to align the project strategic design to the government\n            program objectives (the \"all for Pernambuco\"), and\n            flexibility during implementation facilitated communication\n            with government officials during preparation,\n            implementation, and evaluation of the DPL. The government\n            core team's participation from the design stage of the\n            project reinforced their ownership of and commitment to the\n            program. Bank support, including technical assistance during\n            the project implementation, was acknowledged as important\n            and was very much appreciated by the client. This was\n            particularly the case with the extended invitations for\n            public officials' participation in training programs,\n            and the technical assistance provided to SecMulher. The\n            simplicity of the matrix of result indicators was essential\n            for a successful implementation. Although some targets were\n            not well defined or realistic, the DPL matrix had the merit\n            of being simple, with an appropriate number of indicators\n            that, for the most part, were under the power of the\n            executive authority to deliver. The ability of the DPL\n            implementing agency to manage coordination was essential for\n            delivery of program policy actions. Secretary of planning\n            and management (SEPLAG) conducted the project implementation\n            successfully, and encouraged a new culture of taking\n            decisions on the basis of priorities, objectives, and\n            targets. SEPLAG also boosted capacity and transparency\n            through the analytical activities of the management institute."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
