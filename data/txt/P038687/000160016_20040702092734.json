The project provides the following key\n            lessons: 1) Vocational and technical education (VTE)\n            projects are impeded by a strong political expansionary\n            dynamic in the country, retarded by an equally strong\n            institutional inertia; an absence of, and/or inability, to\n            recruit professionals having the range of technical,\n            managerial, and leadership skills necessary to facilitate\n            change in a multi-stakeholder environment; and the absence\n            of effective mechanisms to fully engage employers as\n            partners in the human capital  development process. These\n            facts suggest that the Bank should continue to focus on this\n            sector; not make investments without an explicit and\n            coherent policy environment; adopt a reform orientation as\n            opposed to a development orientation, with government\n            required to give specific commitments to implementing reform\n            before it can borrow; investments should be progressive,\n            focusing early on building the knowledge base to guide\n            reforms and develop institutional capacity to implement\n            them; and part of the investment should be channeled to\n            developing employer based institutions so they become\n            effective partners in the reform process. 2) The VTE sector\n            is commonly used to serve a blend of social and economic\n            objectives. In Lebanon, this is seen in objectives expressed\n            by government at the time of project preparation, to expand\n            the number of places in VTE programs. This proposed\n            expansion was clearly unfounded and not based on an\n            identified labor market or economic demand, but primarily\n            based on a need to absorb a growing youth population, and\n            provide them some form of employment linked skills.   3)\n            Interventions in the sector should be founded on identified\n            and prioritized strategic gaps in the system, long term, and\n            progressive as opposed to attempting to \"fix\" the\n            system through the lens of a single project. 4) No VTE\n            project should be initiated without being able to\n            irrevocably demonstrate through the project preparation\n            process, an employer community commitment to partnership. 5)\n            The project design process should include a sector wide\n            assessment of financial sustainability in order to guide the\n            investment. 6) The project design process should place\n            greater emphasis on analyzing the internal characteristics\n            of the implementation environment. This would include\n            specific assessment of the range and depth of technical\n            competencies, the characteristics of the regulatory\n            framework, internal cultural behavior, information and\n            decision-making processes, financial resources, and prior\n            experience in project implementation. The project design\n            should subsequently include components that support\n            institutional change and development from within if\n            sustainability is to be achieved. 7) More rigorous\n            management processes should be adopted by the Bank to\n            guarantee that peer review comments are substantially\n            addressed in project design. 8) The availability of the TTL\n            in the field to provide guidance at the ministerial level,\n            resolve differences at the institutional level, or provide\n            technical advice at the operational level enabled valuable\n            outputs from a troubled project to be captured and sustained."}, "docdt": "2004-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
