The project consists of: (i) the purchase\n            of four crude oil tankers in the 80,000 dwt class for use\n            between the Persian Gulf and Haldia, and (ii) the purchase\n            of two refined oil products tankers in the 20,000 dwt class\n            for the import, export and coastal distribution of refined\n            petroleum products. In addition, shore facilities will be\n            improved and pollution-control equipment installed at\n            Haldia, Cochin and other oil-handling ports. One or more\n            crude oil transfer vessels totalling about 16,000 dwt for\n            use at Haldia will also be provided."}, "docdt": "1972-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
