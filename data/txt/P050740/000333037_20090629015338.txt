Project development objective

To contribute to improvements in efficiency, utilization, equity of access to, and quality of public
sector health services in Sri Lanka, with a particular focus on district and provincial level
services
(This has been revised from the original project's Development Objective, in line with QAG
recommendation - to simplify it and make it more focused)
Project description [one-sentence summary of each component]

Component 1: Support to decentralized service delivery. This component finances provision of
health care services by the Provinces at the district and provincial level.

Component 2: Strengthening the stewardship function of the Ministry of Health Care and
Nutrition. This component finances the development of evidence-base for policy and planning,
as a contribution to the stewardship role played by the Central Ministry of Health care and
Nutrition.

This is a revised set of project components, as part of restructuring. The only change is the
amalgamation of components 2, 3 and 4 of the original project into component 2, which is
significantly scaled down and simplified.
Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any?

Environmental category: B. The original project included a Health Care Waste Management
Plan, which is being implemented satisfactorily. The Additional financing does not propose any
new activities and therefore does not trigger any new Safeguard policies.
Significant, non-standard conditions, if any, for:

Board presentation:
No non-standard conditions.

Loan/credit effectiveness:

No non-standard conditions

Covenants applicable to project implementation:
In addition to standard conditions applicable to IDA credits, all covenants similar to and
harmonized with the original grant agreement. The following obligations are ongoing:

 1. The Finance Commission and the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition will ensure that
throughout the project period, a satisfactory financial management system is maintained, in
respect of the Component 1 and 2 respectively.
 2. The borrower will implement the project in accordance with the Operations Manual.
 3. IDA funds are additional to the regular Government / Provincial financing of the health
sector as measured by the average budget of the previous three years
 4. Each Provincial Council shall make available in a timely manner, to the Districts under its
jurisdiction the Grant proceeds and the associated domestic funds
 5. Each Provincial Council receiving funds under the project shall ensure that throughout the
project period a satisfactory financial management system is maintained.

I.        INTRODUCTION

 1.    This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional Credit in
 the amount of SDR 16.3 million (USD 24 Million equivalent) to the Sri Lanka Health Sector
 Development Project (P050740/P113489; H0950 / IDA 45750-CE)

 2.    The proposed additional credit will help finance the costs associated with originally planned project
 activities, facing a financing gap due to reallocation of USD 19 million of the original IDA Grant amount
 to Tsunami relief efforts and USD 3.5 million to avian influenza prevention. No new activities are
 proposed. However, restructuring is proposed at this time in terms of (a) simplification of the component
 that supports the Central Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition (MOHN), and allocation of proportionally
 more resources to the provincial/district level; (b) revision of the Project Development Objective (PDO)
 making it more specific and realistic and of the results framework linking indicators more directly to the
 project activities; and (c) improvement of project management arrangements.

II.       BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING

 Background information on the original project

 3.    The original IDA grant for the Sri Lanka Health Sector Development Project was SDR 40.2 million.
 It was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on June 15, 2004 and made effective on
 October 20, 2004. The project development objective (PDO) of the original project was: to improve
 efficiency, equity, and quality of health care by strengthening planning, management, and monitoring
 capacity at the district, provincial and central level with specific focus on supporting preventive care
 services at the district and divisional level.     The project covered all nine provinces and twenty-five
 districts in Sri Lanka, as well as central level functions. It had four components as follows.

      Component 1. Support to district level authorities to improve service delivery and outreach (USD
          40 Million)

      Component 2. Support to Central Programs and Hospital (USD 16 million), which included:
          Family Health Program and Nutrition; Immunization; Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) and
          Mental Health; and Hospital Efficiency and Quality.

      Component 3. Support to Policy Making, Budget Formulation and Monitoring and Evaluation
          (USD 8.9 Million), including: Strengthening Public Expenditure Management & Consultation;
          Monitoring & Evaluation for the Health System; and Other Institutional Strengthening.

      Component 4. Project Management (USD 6.3 million)

 4.    In response to the Asian Tsunami and to the threat of Avian Influenza, the project has had two
 amendments affecting its resource base. In February 2005, the following PDO was added through an
 Agreement Amending Selected Legal Agreements (Part Z): A further objective of the Project is to assist
 Sri Lanka in carrying out the first phase of an emergency recovery and reconstruction program in the
 Affected Areas as a consequence of the massive destruction and devastation following the tsunami and
 tidal waves in December 2004 and other similar incidents. As part of this amendment, an amount of SDR
 13 million (USD 19 million equivalent) was reallocated from the HSDP to the Tsunami Emergency
 Recovery Program (TERP) ­ Phase I (P094205). Another amendment was made on August 30, 2007 to
 reallocate USD 3.5 million equivalent to Avian Influenza (AI) prevention (human health).

 5.    The reallocations of the IDA grant to national emergencies left SDR 24.87 million of the grant
 funds for the originally planned activities (SDR 27.2 million including AI prevention). The current
 undisbursed balance is SDR 4.94 million (including the Avian Influenza activities), which is expected to
 be spent by June 2009, a full year before the current closing date.

6.   Tables 2 and 3 show the status of PDO indicators as at June 2008. Three out of five targets have
been achieved or are on track to be achieved. Indicators 3 and 4 are either unrealistic or not directly
relevant to the specific project interventions. Target 2 will need additional effort, but remains achievable
within the project's life. However, as recommended by the mid-term review (MTR), a new results
framework has been developed (see Annex 1)

7.   Overall progress towards PDO was rated "Satisfactory" by the October 2008 supervision mission.
HSDP has been contributing to improvements in quality of health services, health information base, and
service delivery capacity in Sri Lanka. At the central level, achievements have been in hospital quality
improvement, development of the evidence base, i.e., strengthening of the national vital statistics and
execution of the Demographic and Health Survey, and increasing coverage of maternal and child health
services. The decentralized component supporting all 25 districts has put in place a process of evidence-
based planning. Some progress has been made with regard to the technical assistance provided by the
center to the provinces on results-based planning, though more work is needed in this area. Limited
progress has been made so far in strengthening monitoring and evaluation and in addressing curative care,
non-communicable diseases and malnutrition. Furthermore, the health sector continues to face financial
gaps to further improve the provincially-managed curative care sector.

 8.    Project implementation suffered from the complex design of the central component, which caused
 difficulties in coordination, management and monitoring. The coordination between the central and
 provincial components was also poor. Progress was slow with respect to the NCD sub-component.
 Overall, the central component has been slow to absorb funds, while the provincial component has been
 on track.

 9.    The project made significant progress since the completion of the MTR. All project components
 were showing satisfactory progress, except for two minor sub-components with MS progress and one sub-
 component with moderately unsatisfactory rating.         These sub-components are part of the central
 component, which, although important, is not the major component of the project. The project's main
 focus is on the decentralized management of health services through the provincial component, which is
 performing satisfactorily.

 10.   MOHN has made steady progress in improving fixed asset management and internal audit
 arrangements, the two Financial Management (FM) issues which hampered implementation of the central
 component. On this basis the project's FM rating has now been upgraded to Satisfactory. There are no
 outstanding audit reports or unaddressed serious audit observations.

 11.   The additional PDO related to TERP, which was legally added to the IDA grant for HSDP was
 being monitored as part of a separate operation (P094205), closed on September 30, 2008. The final ISR
 ratings for the TERP were MS for both IP and PDO. The draft ICR rates project performance as
 satisfactory.

 Rationale behind the request for additional financing

 12.   The project is facing a financing gap due to reallocations amounting to USD 22.5 million equivalent
 of the original grant for unanticipated national emergencies. Achieving the PDOs will be hampered by
 the shortfall in the planned resources beyond March-June 2009. The provincial component has absorbed
 almost 100% of its allocation and the resource constraints faced by the provinces pose a risk to service
 delivery at the decentralized levels. Most of the additional funds will be allocated to the provincial
 component (USD 23 million out of the proposed USD 24 million), which also enhances the probability of
 their full absorption. The additional funds will also enable the conflict-affected provinces (the Northern
 and the Eastern) meet their special health needs.

III.      PROPOSED CHANGES

 The project is proposed to be restructured in three respects, as recommended by the MTR and the
 Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Panel in 2008:

 13.   The design of the central component to be simplified: At the MTR, the project had eight centrally-
 managed subcomponents under three components, in addition to the Avian Influenza sub-component
 which was added in August 2007. The eight sub-components were in turn managed by 15 different
 departments, three of which were outside MOHN ­ de facto resulting in 15 sub-components. This
 complex design was difficult to implement and monitor; some of the directorates performed better than
 the others and coordination amongst them was a challenge.            The restructured component will be
 significantly trimmed down from the original design, and focus on the development of evidence-base for
 policy-making, and on planning and monitoring. This does not entail any new activities; but it does entail
 paring down of several originally envisaged activities. Such paring down will not have a significant
 impact on the achievement of the project development objectives, most of which will be achieved through
 the component 1.       Component 2 on "strengthening the stewardship functions of the Ministry of
 Healthcare and Nutrition" will have an allocation of USD 1 million from the Additional Financing. The
 currently undisbursed funds under the parent project will be utilized to honor contracts and commitments
 already made and to implement the recently introduced component on Avian Influenza control (subject to
 the realism of the relevant plans). At the end of 2009, a further review will be undertaken to determine
 whether any further reallocations are warranted for the final year of implementation.

14.  Implementation arrangements will be streamlined: This applies particularly to the central
component. A Project Management Secretariat (PMS), external to MOHN, while helpful with the
operational and fiduciary functions, made it difficult to mainstream the project activities in a sustainable
and coordinated way ­ very important in a sector development project. Therefore, a Project Management
Team (PMT) chaired by the Additional Secretary, MOHN was established to strengthen the project
management by providing essential oversight. In addition, the process of absorbing the PMS into the
Ministry is under way. In the Provincial component, efforts are also underway to institutionalize the
stewardship role of the Provincial health office through the Provincial planning units initiated in 2005
with support from HSDP.

15.  Results Framework has been revised: The MTR observed that some of the indicators in the original
Results Framework needed revision to make them more directly relevant to the project-specific
investments. The revised new results framework is attached as Annex 1.

16.  In addition to the above three changes, the project proposes to apply some of the good principles of
program approach - already being adopted in its provincial component - to the central component as well,
with a view to building a platform of such approach for possible future support to the sector. It is to be
emphasized that this does not necessarily entail pooled financing or a sector budget support mechanism; it
does mean that the Bank's support will focus on the national plan, the project will promote greater
country ownership and leadership, and that the Bank will work in enhanced partnership with other
stakeholders in the sector. In this context, the fact that MOHN has embarked on a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for the sector is a significant positive development.

Project development objective and key indicators

17.  The PDO is revised as follows:: To contribute to improvements in efficiency, utilization, equity of
access to, and quality of public sector health services in Sri Lanka, with a particular focus on district and
provincial level services. The Tsunami-related PDO, which was added to the original IDA grant remains
unchanged.

The new key performance indicators are:

 Bed occupancy rate disaggregated by higher level hospitals (general hospitals and above) and lower
   level hospitals (base hospitals and below).
 Proportion of lower level hospitals (base hospitals and below) with emergency treatment units.
 Proportion of women over 35 years screened for cervical cancer.
 Proportion of pregnant women screened for anemia.

The restructured project will have two components:

 a)     Component 1. Support to Decentralized Health Service Delivery at the Provincial and District
        Levels (USD 23 Million). This component will continue to support the activities originally
        included in component 1 of the parent project, with a geographical scope that covers all nine
        provinces and 25 districts. These activities include: strengthening district and provincial capacity
        for planning and implementation, improvements for service delivery, training, provision of
        medical supplies and equipment, renovation of health facilities, preventive services such as
        immunization, and health education. The specific items of support will vary from district to
        district, based on their annual plans which will be discussed and agreed upon with the Bank.
        These plans present the overall needs and available resources for Health for the district in
        question. The Bank's financial support will be led by the district plan and be directed to those
        areas where an investment gap is identified. The allocation for this component includes $12
        million (50% of the total additional credit amount) for the conflict-affected Northern and Eastern
        Provinces, to help address their additional health needs arising from the recent conflict. While
        approving the annual plans for financial support from the project, the Bank team will ensure that



                                                     10

        these plans for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces take account of the special health needs
        consequent to the conflict situation in an appropriate manner, and will take measures to withhold
        the use of IDA resources to finance permanent health facilities in temporary, long term or short
        term welfare centers or camps. The Finance Commission (FC), which channels funds to the
        provinces, will ensure additionality of project funds, and avoid displacement of government
        resources for the recurrent costs. The FC will also intensify field supervision to make sure that
        the project funds are used only for the intended purposes. The provinces will also be encouraged
        to increase their focus on the control and prevention of malnutrition particularly among mothers
        and children. An activity financed by an AusAID Trust Fund has been recently initiated to design
        and develop appropriate community-based interventions to tackle the stubborn problem of
        malnutrition particularly among the estate and rural populations. Funds from HSDP could be
        leveraged to pilot-test these interventions for subsequent scale-up if found effective.

 b)     Component 2. Strengthening the Stewardship Functions of the Central Ministry of Healthcare
        and Nutrition (USD 1 Million). The central component under the additional financing will be
        simplified and trimmed down by limiting its focus to strengthening the stewardship functions of
        MOHN, and moreover, the undisbursed funds from the parent project will be reallocated to cover
        the shortfall in the component 1. However, such reallocation will be done in a manner that
        honors commitments already made, i.e. contracts awarded and procurement that had reached an
        advanced stage by December 2008. Similarly, the recently added component on Avian Influenza
        control will be financed from the current undisbursed amount, subject to the realism of the
        proposed plans, which will be critically reviewed before making reallocations of the parent
        project funds. The additional financing, will focus, within the rubric of stewardship, on the
        development and more effective use of evidence base and information systems for policy,
        planning, monitoring and management. Examples of such activities are: further strengthening
        vital statistics and medical statistics systems, an integrated bio-behavioral surveillance (IBBS)
        system for HIV/AIDS, nutritional surveillance and pilot studies on hospital quality. MOHN is
        encouraged to include special emphasis on the coordination of nutrition activities both amongst
        its various units and with development partners, so that the provincial component can be more
        effective in this regard. The decision on distributing the USD 1 million for this component across
        specific activities will be left to MOHN ­ in consultation with the Bank ­ in the spirit of program
        approach. But it is likely that all activities that do not fall into the category of stewardship
        functions will not be financed under this component from the Additional Financing. Examples of
        original project activities not likely to be financed by the Additional Financing include service
        provision by the centrally managed facilities, construction of buildings, purchase of vehicles or
        equipment or foreign training that does not fit into a comprehensive human resource plan.

18.   No changes are proposed in the project's financial management, disbursement or procurement
arrangements, except a simplification of the disbursement schedule. Procurement will be according to the
Bank guidelines published in May 2004 and revised in October, 2006.                A brief FM capacity
assessment has been done of the restructured unit and staffing arrangements for FM found to be
satisfactory. The three existing special dollar accounts will continue to be used for undisbursed balance
under the current IDA grant. For the additional financing, two new special dollar accounts will be
opened, one for component 1 and another for component 2. The special account for component 1 would
be used for two disbursement categories: one for the Northern and Eastern Provinces (to track more easily
their increased allocation) and the other for the remaining 7 provinces. As there are no additional funds
being allocated for the FC's own expenditures, the third Special Dollar Account, i.e., for FC, will not be
replicated for the Additional Financing. Extending the Closing Date of the existing IDA grant until
December 31, 2010 will enable FC to utilize the unspent balance in that grant towards its requirements
while the Additional Financing supports the rest of the project activities.         Disbursements for the
Component 1 will be report-based and for Component 2 they will be transaction-based. The existing



                                                     11

 Interim Unaudited Financial Report (IUFR) will continue to apply. IUFRs will be submitted quarterly, 45
 days after the end of each quarter.

 Extension of Closing Date

 19.   In view of start-up delays, this request proposes a six-month extension of the closing date to
 December 31, 2010 to complete. As a follow-on project is being planned for 2011, an extension of the
 current project will provide more predictable resources to the sector, especially at the decentralized levels
 which face serious resource constraints. Such predictability of resources is critical to the effectiveness of
 sector development projects and the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals.
 The extension, which would apply to the existing IDA grant and to the new Credit, will also synchronize
 the project closing with the Sri Lankan fiscal year.

IV.       CONSISTENCY WITH COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STATEGY

 20.   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which had been built on three
 pillars: peace, growth and equity. The original project had been designed to contribute to the pillar of
 equity by transferring more resources for health to poorer areas with worse health indicators and to the
 pillar of growth by reducing the direct and indirect costs associated with inefficiencies in the health
 system and increasing productivity especially for the poor through a healthier population. These points
 remain valid in the context of the more recent CAS (2008), which re-framed the Bank's assistance in
 alignment with the "Mahinda Chintana1", wherein the three pillars are: equitable development,
 accelerated growth and strengthening public service delivery. While the first two pillars remain relevant
 as they originally were, the third one makes the case for this request for additional financing even
 stronger.

V.        ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

 21.   As no new activities are being proposed, the original economic analysis holds.

VI.       APPRAISAL OF RESTRUCTURED/SCALED-UP ACTIVITIES

 22.   As no new activities are being proposed and the project performs satisfactorily, the original
 appraisal holds. The proposed restructuring is only in terms of simplification of the central component,
 trimming down activities in it that could not be completed and are no longer considered necessary to
 achieve the development objectives. The other aspects of restructuring are to refine the statement of PDO
 and the results framework.

 23.   The Additional Financing does not trigger any new safeguard policies and hence the original
 Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet is still valid. The original project was under Environment Category B,
 and had accordingly prepared a Health Care Waste Management Plan. Supervision missions have noted
 the satisfactory implementation of this Plan. No other safeguard policies were applicable to the original
 project.

 24.   However, the project will take account of the new political context in Sri Lanka and, in line with
 GOSL policy, increase its support to the conflict-affected areas, i.e., the Eastern and Northern Provinces.
 This enhanced support will be based on a health needs assessment to be carried out specifically for these
 provinces. The assessment will ensure outreach and consultations with the local population and a stock-
 taking of the conditions of the health facilities, and status of health service delivery.                The needs
 assessment will be completed by July 31, 2009.

 25.   Annex 2 shows the Conflict Analysis Framework and Assessment with respect to this Additional
 Financing, identifying the specific risks posed to the project / health sector by the conflict, and the
 mitigation measures proposed to manage these risks. The process of approving Provincial Annual Plans


 1"Mahinda Chintana" refers to the broad policy and strategy direction set out by the current President of Sri Lanka.


                                                        12

 and subsequent performance reviews will be used to ensure that the conflict-related issues are addressed
 appropriately.

VII.     EXPECTED OUTCOMES

 26.   The expected outcomes of the project remain unchanged. They have been stated more precisely in
 the new PDO, and the indicator set made more directly attributable to the project activities, as
 recommended by the MTR and QAG Panel reviews of 2008.

VIII.    BENEFITS AND RISKS

 27.   No significant changes are envisaged in the project's benefits and risks. If anything, the overall
 risks will be reduced, in view of the proposed simplification of the central component. However some of
 the original risks and mitigation measures remain valid. Though ownership of the project within MOHN
 has increased, and MOHN is playing a more active role in providing guidance and capacity-building for
 the provinces, there is still room for improvement in this area. Districts in the conflict-affected areas
 require significant technical support for preparing and implementing their plans; the project provides for a
 greater emphasis on providing such support. In view of the recent developments and additional demand
 for health services, special care will be taken to mitigate the risk of inappropriate use of project funds for
 the establishment of permanent health facilities in temporary, long term or short term welfare centres or
 camps. Such measures include the Bank withholding approval of project funds for such activities as well
 as vigorous field-level supervision by the FC. The conflict-affected areas also run a greater risk as some
 of those areas are not yet open to field visits by the Bank personnel and, in some cases, by MOHN
 personnel.     However, the FM systems under the provincial component have been functioning
 satisfactorily, even in respect of the conflict affected areas and the project is emphasizing the importance
 of paying special attention to the fiduciary risks associated with project activities in these geographic
 areas, to the extent permissible by the security situation.

IX.      FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 28.   While the original project is being financed by an IDA grant, the additional financing will be an
 IDA Credit. The Credit will have a 20 year maturity with a 10 year grace period.
