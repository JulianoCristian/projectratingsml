Some lessons learned\n            included: decentralized health services work best when roles\n            and responsibilities are clear, the central level fulfills\n            its stewardship functions, and the decentralized levels are\n            provided with adequate resources. In order to avoid\n            disbursement delays, where there are many implementing\n            agencies, special account reimbursements should not depend\n            on consolidation of Interim Unaudited Financial Reports\n            (IUFR) from all agencies. Piecemeal and fragmented\n            implementation of civil works could have been avoided by\n            development of a proper procurement master plan for works\n            and a health infrastructure development master plan.
