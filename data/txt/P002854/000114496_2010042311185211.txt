               Amendments to the Development Credit Agreement
Excellency:
     Please refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the
above-mentioned Project between the Republic of Togo (the
Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association) of even date herewith.
     In order to correct two printing errors that have slipped in
sub-paragraphs 4 (b) and (c) of Schedule 5 to the Development
Credit Agreement, we are pleased to amend said Development Credit
Agreement by changing said sub-paragraphs 4 (b) and (c) to read as
follows:
     "(b) a debt-servicing ratio of not less than 1.5 (instead
          of 1:5) and
      (c) a net worth and cash flow equivalent to at least 5%
          (instead of 5:1) of the enterprise's annual turnover."
     Please confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing
the form of confirmation below.
                    Very truly yours,
                    INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
