MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TOGO
FOR A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Togo for SDR 9.0 million (US$11.5 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit, on standard IDA terms, would
finance a private enterprise development project.
2.        Background.  With the support of two Structural Adjustment
Credits (SALs) and successive IMF Stand-Bys, the Government has since 1983
initiated major policy reforms aimed at reducing the dir-.:t involvement of
the State and enhancing the role of the private sector in productive
economic activities. A new Fiscal Code and an Investment Code have been
enacted. A program is underway to rationalize the public enterprise sector
(PE) involving its restructuring, and liquidation or privatization of
parastatals. Further policy reforms would be pursued under the forthcoming
structural adjustment program with IDA assistance, which would include
further liberalization of the trade regime through a tariff reform and
elimination of quantitative restrictions, encouragement of exports, and
removal of price controls. Despite the recent improvements in the
environment for private sector investment, the operation of industrial
enterprises, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular, remains
constrained by: (a) the cumbersome regulations governing their
establishment; (b) the virtual absence of an institutional support
structure for promotional and extension services to entrepreneurs and
enterprises, following the closure in 1982 of the previous ineffective
promotional institution, operated as a public sector agency; and (c) the
weaknesses in the credit delivery system, reflected mainly in the
inadequate level of term lending to productive SMEs. Finally, due to the
slow progress in the parastatal privatization program, a number of
industrial activities have yet to be opened to private investors.
3.        The modern manufacturing sector in Togo is small (7% of GDP and
1% of employment). It is heavily dependent on imported inputs and princi-
pally oriented to import substitution. It comprises slightly over 100
enterprises mostly in agro-industries, textiles, construction materials,
and wood and paper. Involvement of the public sector is very large, and
wholly or partly state-owned enterprises account for 75 percent of the
manufacturing output and 60 percent of sector employment. Public enter-
prises have generally been inefficient, and the Government has often had to
assume their foreign debt service obligations.  This situation is currently
being remedied through the ongoing parastatal privatization program. The
SME sector comprises about 160 enterprises (with less than 20 workers),
predominantly in construction, clothing, electrical works, printing, wood
and garages. In addition, there are some 14,000 artisans, mostly in
tailoring, weaving, shoe- and jewelry-making.
4.        Project Objectives.  The Project would support the policy reforms
initiated under the structural adjustment programs through appropriate
institutional and financial measures to help remove the remaining
constraints and generate a sustained supply response from the private
industrial/SME sector. It would seek additional industrial policy reforms
including a streamlining of enterprise registration and export licensing,



-2-
and selective modifications to the Investment Code with a view to removing
its existing capital-intensity bias and to encouraging vertical integration
and export production. At the institutional level, the Project would
assist in the establishmert and operation of a new private sector-oriented
support structure for promotional and extension services to SMEs and other
enterprises, and strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Industry and
State Enterprises (MISE) for an effective implementation of the program of
privatizatio-.u of parastatals. The line of credit under the Project would
actively involve for the first time Togolese commercial banks in term
lending for SMEs. Finally, through the introduction of a mutual investment
fund, mutual guarantee associations and a micro-enterprise lending scheme,
the Project would aim at broadening and deepening the Togolese financial
sector. A policy statement by the Government on Private Enterprise
Development, embodying those additional policy reforms would provide the
policy basis for the Project.
5.        Project Description.  To support the Government's policy of
fostering a stronger private sector through the introduction of appropriate
policy, regulatory, institutional and financial measures, the proposed IDA
credit of US$11.5 million equivalent would include four components: (a)
technical assistance (US$0.95 million) for establishing and operating a new
private sector investment promotion/extension system built around (i) the
Centre Togolais des Investieseurs (CTI), a referral-and-orientation agency
being set up by the Togolese Bankers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce,
and industry groups, and (ii) the Enterprise Assistance Unit (DIVA) in the
Chamber of Commerce to provide extension services to SMEs; (b) advisory
services to MISE for the privatization of selected public enterprises, and
the establishment of a mutual investment fund to facilitate the
participation of Togolese nationals in the privatization process
(US$0.85 million); (c) a pilot scheme for micro-enterprise lending
(US$0.30 million); and (d) an apex line of credit (US$9 million) in the
Central Bank for financing investments and working capital of private
enterprises through the banking system, supplemented by training in project
economic analysis and technical assistance to support a pilot scheme for
the establishment of mutual guarantee associations (US$0.4 million).
One-third of the apex credit line would be earmarked for SMEs meeting
specific size criteria. The total cost of the Project is estimated at
US$18.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$11.5 million (62 percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. A description of the procurement method and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A time-table of key project
processing events is in Schedule C and the Status of Bank Group operations
in Togo in Schedule D.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6677-TO dated
June 30, 1987, is also attached.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Having been instrumental in
helping lIgo undertake structural adjustment programs involving most
importantly the opening up of its economy to the private sector, both
through trade liberalization and parastatal divestiture, it is appropriate
for IDA now to: (a) assist in making the regulatory environment for the
private sector more hospitable; (b) provide institutional and financial
assistance for private enterprise development; and (c) assist In



accelerating and broadening the ongoing privatization program of
parastatals.
7.        Actions agreed upon.  During negotiations agreements were reached
with the Government on (1) the content of the Statement of Private
Enterprise Development Policy; (2) revision of the Investment Code prior to
December 31, 1988; (3) reforms of enterprise registration and export
licensing; (4) lending arrangements and terms and conditions of the line of
credit; (5) an implementation schedule for the mutual investment fund, with
the establishment of the fund to occur prior to November 1988; (6) an
implementation schedule for the mutual guarantee scheme, with the
establishment of the first association to occur prior to April 1988; and
(7) the principle of an action program for the implementation of the
microenterprise scheme, satisfactory to IDA, to be prepared prior to
December 31, 1987. Conditions of Credit effectiveness are (1) the opening
of CTI for business; (2) the establishment and initial funding of the
Studies Fund; (3) signature of an agreement between the Government and the
Chamber of Commerce on DIVA; (4) the recruitment of the resident adviser to
MISE; and (5) signature of a protocol between the Government and BCEAO on
the administration of the line of credit and issuance of a circular on the
onlending terms and conditions. The signing of an onlending agreement
between the Central Bank and each participating primary bank on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA will be a condition of disbursement of funds
under the line of credit.
8.        Justification.  The Government is endeavoring to foster a
stronger private sector, focussing principally on SMEs and reducing
gradually its participation in industrial parastatals. The proposed
Project would support this endeavor with an integrated package of policy,
regulatory, institutional and financial measures. It would represent the
first comprehensive program in Togo for the promotion of and assistance to
private enterprise. Its emphasis on labor-intensive SMEs would support the
Government's current efforts to alleviate unemployment.
9.        Risks.  A possible risk relates to the usual difficulty to
operate and to sustain in a cost-effective manner an SME
promotion/extension services system. The Project seeks to minimize this
risk by entrusting the private sector with the responsibility for managing
this new system and by providing safeguards for businesslike operations.
Besides, by providing appropriate technical assistance to MISE for
strengthening its implementation capacity, the Project would alleviate the
risk, inherent in the privatization program of any country, of not being
carried out under optimal terms and conditions.
10.       Recommen-1ation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Ar.icles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

Schedule B
Procurement
Essentially, procurement of equipment and goods under the credit
component wov-d not be suitable for international competitive bidding,
given that credit proceeds are expected to predominantly finance either
SMEs or restructuring operations involving partial replacement or upgrading
of equipment and spare parts.  The size of the subloan under the apex line
of credit is limited to a maxiumum of US$1.0 million equivalent.
Procurement for both new investments and restructuring would therefore be
in accordance with commercial practices.  Participating banks would be
required to ensure that the goods and services to be financed under a
subloan are obtained on most competitive reasonable prices, and therefore
will require the final borrower to obtain price quotations from at least
three suppliers. Compliance with this requirement by the participating
banks will be monitored by the Central Bank and selectively reviewed during
supervision missions by IDA. Procurement of services for the technical
assistance, consultancies and studies would be in accordance with IDA
guidelines for use of consultants.
