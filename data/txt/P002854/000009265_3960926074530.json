Consisting of four\n            components, the project seeks to establish a new\n            institutional support system to provide promotional and\n            extension services to private enterprises, to be built\n            around: (a) the newly created Centre Togolais des\n            Investisseurs (CTI) and (b) a separate unit within the\n            Chamber of Commerce (DIVA) to be restructured in order to\n            provide a range of extension services to private\n            enterprises. Secondly, the project includes support for the\n            Government's on-going program of privatization of\n            parastatals through (a) a resident technical advisor to the\n            Ministry of State Enterprises and ad hoc consultancy\n            services and (b) advisory services to support the\n            establishment of a mutual investment fund to facilitate the\n            financial participation of Togolese investors in the\n            privatization process. Thirdly, the project entails a pilot\n            scheme for microenterprise lending, in collaboration with\n            NGOs/PVOs and, lastly, (4) a line of credit to finance fixed\n            investments and working capital of existing enterprises as\n            well as new projects."}, "docdt": "1987-07-20T00:00:00Z"}
