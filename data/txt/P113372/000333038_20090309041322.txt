Main Policy     The proposed Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (PRESO)
Areas:          supports:

                    Regaining and maintaining macroeconomic stability through increased tax
                    revenue mobilization, adjustment of fuel prices and power tariffs, improved
                    efficiency o fpublic spending, and strengthened government debt management;

                 0  Enhancing competitiveness through reduced barriers to business entry and exit,
                    and strengthened financial sector; and

                    Protecting the poor and vulnerable through improved targeting o f safety nets
                    and cash transfer programs, and strengthened statistical systems.

Key Outcome     Overall outcome indicators and targets:
Indicators:           Fiscal deficit (excl. grants) reduced from 7.4 percent o f GDP in 2007108 to or
                      below 4.3 percent o f GDP in2008/09.
                      Current account deficit reduced from 8.4 percent o f GDP in 2007108 to or
                      below 5.9 percent o f GDP in 2008109.
                      Improved Doing Businessindicators.
                      Improved access to social safety nets for the poorest 25 percent o f the
                      population.

Program         PRESO aims to support the implementation o f Pakistan's recently adopted Second
Development     Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-11).        In particular, it will support the
Objectives and  structural reforms o f PRSP-I1 to regain and maintain economic stability and to bring
Contributionto  the economy back to a higher growth path over time through measures enhancing
CAS:            Pakistan's competitiveness, while protecting the poor and vulnerable.

                The reform program supported by PRESO is consistent with the CAS priorities of:
                (i)sustaining growthandimprovingcompetitiveness; and(ii)improvinglivesand
                protecting the vulnerable.        The operation is complemented by investment
                operations, such as the Electricity Distribution and Transmission Improvement

                Project and the proposed technical assistance operation to support social safety nets.

Risks:          Several risks attend the proposed PRESO:

                   Political risks: Attaining a sharp reduction in the fiscal and current account
                    deficits will require commitment from the political leadership. The scale and
                    speed o f the required economic policy response to the macroeconomic
                    imbalances could intensify social tensions in part o f the population, but no
                    adjustment would ultimately impose even greater economic and social costs.
                    The sustainability o f the program could also be undermined by disagreement
                    among Pakistan's main political parties on other issues, including judicial
                    reform and the war on terror.        The authorities' draft medium-term policy
                    framework attached to this package mitigates this risk and the risk o f policy
                    reversals by signaling the authorities' upfront commitment to a medium-term
                    adjustment path.

                   Economic risks: On the external side, a renewed rise in international energy
                    and commodity prices, a reduction in foreign remittances especially from the
                    countries o f the Middle East, and a further deterioration in the world economy
                    and international financial markets could weaken the export sector, reduce
                    household transfers, lower capital inflows, limit economic growth and reduce
                    flexibility for policy reforms. Owing to these reasons, the external imbalances
                    may continue to widen despite the short-term measures taken. On the internal
                    side, the inability o f Government to restore fiscal and external balance as agreed
                    could reduce business and consumer confidence.              This could cause a
                    fundamental shift in market expectations and a loss o f confidence at home and
                    abroad, leading to a sudden reversal o f financial assets held in Pakistan stock
                    and bond markets. This could generate a vicious cycle between weakening
                    financial markets, stalling economic activity, and a worsening fiscal position.
                    The IMF Stand-By Arrangement will mitigate these risks by committing the
                    authorities to fiscal and current account deficit targets.

                   Implementation risks: Stringent implementation o f the reforms will be critical
                    for success. The implementation o f reforms may be slower than planned
                   because o f significant institutional capacity constraints.     Other projects and
                    initiatives supported by the Bank and development partners have supported the
                    strengthening o f a number o f institutions which mitigates the risk, including the
                    State Bank o f Pakistan, the Auditor General of Pakistan, the Controller General
                    o f Accounts, and the Pakistan Public Procurement Authority.           The Federal
                   Board o f Revenues reform initiatives are supported through the Bank's Tax
                   Administration Reform Project and Tax Policy Program.

                   Security risks: There is a risk o f deterioration in the security and law and order
                   situation, which could shift Government's focus from economic matters. This
                   risk cannot be directly mitigated. PRESO would rely on the Government's
                   commitment to improved security, as confirmed by the renewed efforts to end
                   militancy in tribal areas.

      INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRAMDOCUMENT FOR

    A PROPOSEDPOVERTY REDUCTIONAND ECONOMIC SUPPORT OPERATION TO

                               THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN


                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This Program Document presents the proposed Poverty Reduction and Economic Support
Operation (PRESO) in the amount o f US$SOO million to the Islamic Republic o f Pakistan. The aim o f the
proposed PRESO would be to support the implementation o f Pakistan's Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP-11). Specifically, it will support the structural reforms o f PRSP-I1 to regain and
maintain economic stability and to bring the economy back to a higher growth path over time through
measures promoting competitiveness, while protecting the poor and vulnerable. The reform program
proposed to be supported by PRESO i s consistent with PRSP-I1 and owned by the Pakistan authorities.

2.     Pakistan faced both external and internal shocks in the past year. On the external side, international
oil and food commodity prices sharply rose in 2007/08, and inflated Pakistan's import bill. Subsequently,
the slowdown in the global economy dampened the external demand for Pakistan's exports, and the
deterioration in international credit markets affected the supply o f funds. On the internal side, Pakistan's
political turmoil and uncertainties affected investor confidence and, together with the rapid rise on
macroeconomic imbalances, led to capital outflow as well as downgrading o f Pakistan's rating by
international rating agencies.

3.     The political situation-Parliamentary   elections were held in February 2008-made       it difficult for
the authorities to take timely corrective action. The authorities did not pass on any o f the international
price increases to consumers until after the Parliamentary elections, but financed them through the
government budget by increasing subsidies. As a result, the fiscal and balance o f payment imbalances
widened substantially, inflation rose sharply, growth slowed, and Government's macroeconomic program
went off track.

4.     InMarch 2008, the authorities started to take some steps to stabilize the economy. These included
passing on some o f the international fuel price increases to consumers, restricting the size o f the fiscal
deficit in 2007108 and the 2008109 budget, increasing the policy discount rate, and allowing greater
flexibility in the exchange rate. However, these actions soon proved to be inadequate and coming too
late.

5.     Faced with the risk o f a full-blown balance o f payments crisis, the authorities in the fall o f 2008
decided to put in place adjustment measures that facilitate the resumption o f inclusive growth with low
inflation over the medium term. InNovember 2008, the authorities entered into a Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) with the IMF to stabilize the economy. In this context, they also requested assistance from the
Bank to support the structural reform process.

6.     The Bank is proposing to proceed with stand-alone operation which supports the authorities' short-
term policy measures to promote economic recovery, along with the needed stabilization. The recently
adopted PRSP-I1 provides the framework for this policy agenda, and an opportunity to proceed with
PRESO to support its implementation.         PRESO would support the PRSP-I1 objectives related to
macroeconomic stabilization, enhancement o f competitiveness and growth recovery, and poverty
mitigation. However, given the magnitude o f macroeconomic imbalances, regaining the macroeconomic
stability and putting the economy back to a path o f high sustainable growth will require continued
decisive policy adjustment in 2009110 and 2010111. For this reason, the proposed package also includes a

draft medium-term policy framework o f Government and State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP) that lays out the
envisaged road map for adjustment. The latter years o f that framework could be supported through a
separate programmatic operation.

7.    The financing provided through the proposed PRESO would help to finance Government's
budgetary needs, and thereby support the authorities' commitment to eliminate central bank financing o f
Government. While the IMF-supported SBA i s providing Pakistan much needed balance o f payments
support, budgetary support i s also urgently required. The projected financing through PRESO is part o f
Government's financing plan. Government's 2008109 financing plan embedded in SBA assumes World
Bank disbursements of US$1.4 billion. Of this amount, US$800 million is projected to be disbursed as
budget support, which includes US$500 million o f PRESO.'            The proposed PRESO is critical for
Government's stabilization, economic recovery and social mitigation agenda. Thereby it will also lay the
ground for the Bank's other budget support operations.

                11.     RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

                                  A.      Recent PoliticalDevelopments

8.    Pakistan has undergone rapid political changes in the past year and a half. On November 3, 2007,
President Pervez Musharraf, acting as the Chief o f Army, imposed the state o f emergency and suspended
the Constitution. At the end o f November 2007, Mr. Musharraf relinquished the Army Chief post and
took oath as a civilian President for another five-year term. Soon thereafter the emergency was lifted, and
Parliamentary elections announced. However, the elections had to be postponed, as the former Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated at the end o f December 2007.

9.    The Parliamentary elections heldin February 2008 were widely considered to be free and fair. The
main opposition parties won the elections by a wide margin, and a new coalition government comprising
the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan's People's Party (PPP), led by Mr.Asif Zardari, and
the Pakistan MuslimLeague, led by the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (PML-N), was formed, with
Mr.Yousaf Raza Gillani as the Prime Minister. On August 25, 2008, the coalition government between
PPP and P M L - N split, owing to disagreement on the reinstatement o f deposed Supreme Court judges.

10.   In August 2008, Mr. Musharraf resigned as the President o f Pakistan.          In September 2008, Mr.
Zardari was elected President.

11.   Pakistan is a frontline state in the war on terror, which has adversely impacted its economic and
security environment. The security situation in the country has continued to deteriorate, with frequent
bomb explosions.      In September 2008, there was a suicide bomb attack on the Marriott hotel in
Islamabad. The Mumbai terrorist attacks in November 2008 have strained the relations between Pakistan
and India.

                            B.      Economic Developmentsthrough 2006/07

12.   Pakistan's development record was strong for part of this decade. The economy grew at 7.3
percent on average per year during 2003104 through 2006107, driven by solid performances in the services
and industrial sectors (see Figure 1). The manufacturing sector grew fast during the earlier part o f the
period, but slowed down considerably later in the period due to capacity and infrastructural constraints.
At the same time, the services sector, catering primarily to the domestic demand, grew steadily
throughout the period. The factors that contributed to growth included a benign external environment

availability o f external financing, political and macroeconomic stability.                  Key measures include
renegotiation o f external debt with Paris Club creditors, pre-payment o f extensive debt, greater reliance
on concessional borrowing for new loans, and liberalization o f the financial sector. They, together with
an expansion in the economy, led to a decline inpublic debt as well as a reduction in debt servicing cost.
Growth translated into rising household incomes, with per capita income growing to US$878 in 2006/07,
an 18.3 percent increase from US$742 two years earlier.

contributed      to       the
acceleration o f inflation from 3.5 percent in 2001/02 to 7.8 percent in 2006/07.                 Pakistan's savers
continued to receive l o w returns, below the rate o f inflation. L o w returns o n bank deposits discouraged
private savings and fuelled asset-price bubbles as households sought higher returns by buying shares and
property.

15.   With domestic demand outpacing domestic output, the current account deficit reversed from
a surplus o f 4.8 percent in 2002/03 to a deficit of 4.9 percent o f GDP in 2006/07, financed through
ample capital inflows. The reliance on external financing left the economy vulnerable to external shocks

and, despite the clear signs o f overheating, Pakistan concluded 2006107 with no visible signs o f
adjustment.

                                 C.        Economic Developments in 2007/08

16.    In 2007/08, the sharp rise in international oil and food (specifically wheat) prices, in
combination with policy inaction and internal political turmoil, led to rapidly expanding
macroeconomic imbalances in Pakistan.                 Both fiscal and current account balances widened
significantly.  In the absence of adequate remedial policy measures to address the imbalances-in
particular   not   passing     on    the
international   price   increases     to            Table 1: Consolidated Federal and Provincial Fiscal

resulted in overruns o f 1.4 percent o f GDP in the petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) subsidy, and o f 0.6
percent o f GDP in the electricity subsidy. Furthermore, the rise in international wheat and fertilizer prices
led to an overrun o f 0.5 percent o f GDP in expenditure on wheat and fertilizer subsidy.

19.   Beyond the rise in government subsidies, an overrun in interest payments by 0.9 percent of
GDP due to an underestimation of interest liabilitiesin the budget contributed to the increasein the
budget deficit. The rise in the budget deficit would have been even higher without the 1.2 percent o f

25.    In   response to       the
wideningimbalancesand supply side shocks, real GDP growth declined from 6.8 percent in 2006/07
to 5.8 percent in 2007/08. In agriculture, floods and pest attacks depressed rice and cotton production,
while industrial production and services were constrained by acute power and gas shortages.

26.    Pakistan's risk rating worsened as the economic situation deteriorated. Both Standard &
Poor's and Moody's downgraded Pakistan's sovereign debt ratings in M a y 2008 (from B+ to B and from
B 1 to B2, respectively) owing to the sharp erosion in the fiscal position and the inadequate policy
response to the worsening macroeconomic situation.

                                     D.          Towards Stabilization

27.    Recognizing the need to correct the macroeconomic imbalances, Government embarked on a
concerted effort to stabilize the economy starting with the 2008/09 budget. The budget, among other
things, envisaged sizeable fiscal consolidation through power and fuel subsidy cuts and increased revenue
effort. However, by November 2008 it was apparent that the budget measures were inadequate to contain
the economic slide, aggravated by the global financial crisis, and to restore the investor confidence. The
foreign exchange reserves o f SBP had dropped to US$3.3 billion (about three weeks o f imports) by mid-
October 2008, the nominal exchange rate had depreciated to Rs/US$84, Government had borrowed
additional Rs. 356 billion from SBP during July-November 2008, the average CPI had risen to about 25
percent and core inflation to 18.9 percent at end November 2008, and the EMBI Global Bond spread of
Pakistani sovereign bonds had climbed above 2,000 bp. Inresponse to these developments, Moody's had
further downgraded its ratings outlook for Pakistan sovereign bonds from stable to negative in September
2008 and the rating from B2 to B3 in October 2008. Similarly, Standard & Poor's had downgraded
Pakistan's rating further from B to CCC+ in early October 2008 and to CCC in early November 2008.

28.    To avoid a balance of payments crisis and default on foreign debt payments, the authorities
developed a home-grown stabilization program, which was supported by the IMF through a 23-
month SBA in November 2008. The program includes a medium-term macroeconomic framework,
which envisages fiscal and monetary tightening to bring down inflation and reduce the external current
account deficit to sustainable levels. The 2008/09 program framework supported by SBA builds on the
2008109 budget, modified to account for higher inflation projections and greater exchange rate adjustment
than envisaged at the time o f the budget. The framework was revised during the first program review in
February 2009 to take into account the impact o f significantly deteriorated global economy, resulting
lower exports, foreign inflows and growth prospects in the short and medium term, as well as the change
in the terms o f trade through lower international oil and food prices. Table 3 summarizes the revised
framework, and compares it with the initial November 2008109 program framework for 2008109.

29.    The revised framework is built aroundthe followingeconomic parametersfor 2008/09:
              Real GDP growth of 2.5 percent: the target was lowered from 3.4 percent owing to sharper
              than anticipated economic slowdown;

        e     The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) of 4.3 percent of GDP: the initial fiscal deficit target
              remained unchanged in nominal Rupee terms, but owing to the moderated GDP growth
              projection, the target as a share o f GDP increased from 4.2 to 4.3 percent;
              The current account deficit of 5.9percent of GDP: the initial target o f 6.5 percent o f GDP was
              revised downwards due to a larger than anticipated decline in imports; and

             Annual average consumer price inflation at 20 percent: the annual inflation target was
              adjusted downwards from 23 percent, as a result o f falling food and energy prices and lower
              economic activity.

30.    The fiscal deficit reduction is to be achieved by a combination of expenditure cuts and
revenue increases, with the burden of adjustment falling primarily on expenditures. Overall
revenues (excluding grants) are to be increased from 14.3 percent o f GDP in 2007108 to 15.2 percent o f
GDP in 2008109 through a rise in tax revenues. Further, the reduction in the fiscal deficit relies on a
consolidation o f overall expenditures by about 2.5 percent o f GDP to 19.3 percent o f GDP. About half o f
the reduction is to come from current spending-primarily         from cuts in fuel and power subsidies-and
the other half from rationalization in development spending.          The proposed operation i s supporting
orderly reductions in both areas, ensuring productive social and infrastructure spending is protected.

31.    On the external side, the 2008/09 revised program framework projects a rapid decline in
import growth (14.5 percent contraction) due to decreases in international commodity and oil
prices and the slowdown in economic activity. The decline in imports is expected to outweigh the
projected 5.5 percent contraction in exports, leading to a strong improvement in the trade balance. Both
gross national savings and gross capital formation are predicted to further decline, with capital formation
decreasing with the economic downturn.

32.    The 2008/09 program assumes that Government's net borrowing from SBP will be zero on a
quarterly basis from November 1, 2008 onwards, and Government will rely increasinglyon non-
bank borrowing and external financing. This, in addition to a sharp decline in aggregate demand
during the second half o f 2008109 is expected to bring down average annual inflation to the program
target.

33.    At the first quarterly reviewof SBA in February 2009, the stabilizationprogram remainedon
track. The rapid decline in international commodity and oil prices since August 2008 has reduced the
risks, facilitated improvement in the external position and the achievement o f targets. Table 4 highlights
the developments in select recent economic indicators by month during 2008109.

34.          Fiscal consolidation was on track at end December 2008 (see Table 5). The estimated half a
year fiscal deficit (excluding grants) was 1.9 percent o f GDP against the target o f 2.0 percent o f GDP set
in November 2008. Savings on non-essential development spending and a reduction in power and fuel
subsidies, facilitated by rapidly declining international oil prices, helped the fiscal deficit stay within the
target, despite o f weak revenue performance.

35.          During July-December 2008, recurrent and development expenditures were below their
targets by 5 and 18 percent, respectively. On the recurrent side, the bulk of savings accrued from
federal subsidies. Expenditure on federal subsidies (at 0.9 percent o f GDP) was only 36 percent o f the
budgeted amount, as expenditure on fuel and food subsidaies fell substantially short o f the (pro-rated)
budget targets. The authorities started passing on the international fuel price increases to consumers in
March 2008, with the aim to eliminate fuel subsidies by end December 2008.                                                                   The parity with
international fuel prices was reached already in mid-October 2008, helped by rapidly declining
international oil prices. The authorities are also committed to eliminate the power sector subsidies by end
June 2009. To achieve that, they increased electricity tariffs on average by 9 percent in February 2008
and 18 percent in November 2008. In parallel, stringent expenditure controls measures adopted by the
federal government and the impact o f political transition in the provinces contributed to smaller than
targeted development spending.

36.          However, inter-corporate debt in the energy sector increased sharply from Rs. 51 billion in
mid-October 2008 to about Rs. 147 billion at end January 2009. While there are several reasons for
the debt, including delayed payments to energy companies, this highlights the continued need for fiscal
adjustment.

37    During July-December 2008, national revenue collection reached Rs. 834 billion, which was
0.3 percent of GDP below the initial program target of 6.5 percent of GDP. The relatively weak
performance was due to lower tax collection o f the Federal Board o f Revenue (FBR), as the sharp
economic slowdown reduced the buoyancy o f Pakistan's two main tax bases o f manufacturing and
imports. From July 2008 to January 2009, FBR tax revenues reached Rs. 628 billion, an increase o f only
22 percent year-on-year compared to the initial program target o f 35 percent.             In response to these
developments, the authorities decided to step up the tax audit efforts to cover part o f the revenue shortfall,
and the FBR revenue target was revised downwards from Rs. 1,360 billion to Rs 1,300 billion during the
February 2009 program review. In addition, Government intends to compensate the shortfall in FBR
revenues through higher petroleum development levy (PDL) collection. PDL collection reached already
Rs. 29 billion duringthe first half o f 2008/09, exceeding by over 100 percent the fiscal year target o f Rs.
14 billion.    Instead o f passing on the international price decreases to consumers, Government has
maintained a premium above the import parity levels to cover part o f the tax revenue shortfall.

38.   The external imbalances narrowed towards the end December 2008 on the back of a lower oil
import bill (see Table 4).        The monthly current account deficit dropped sharply from the peak o f 1.3
percent o f GDP in October 2008 to 0.3 percent o f GDP in January 2009, bringing the July-January 2009
current account deficit to about 4.8 percent o f GDP (US$7.8 billion). Imports are projected to decline
further as Pakistan reaps the benefits from lower international oil prices (see B o x 1).

             Box 1: The Impact of InternationalOil Price Changes on the Current Account Deficit

Changes in the international oil price have had significant impact on the external current account deficit and
economic performance of Pakistan. As mentionedearlier, the current account deficit increasedfrom 4.8 percent of
GDP in 2006107 to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2007108. Over 50 percent of this increase (1.9 percent of GDP) was on
account of a38 percent increase inthe import price o fpetroleum.

During the first half o f 2008109, Pakistan did not benefit from the reductionin internationaloil pricesbecause of its
long-term contracts for oil imports, which were based on higher oil prices. As a result, in the case of Pakistan, the
import price per barrel of petroleumincreasedby another 19 percent during July-December 2008 comparedto the
average import price in2007108. This additionalprice increaseaccountedfor 13 percent(0.6 percent of GDP) of the
currentaccount deficit of 4.6 percentof GDP during July-December 2008.

However, the import value o f petroleum is expected to come down sharply during the second half of 2008109. The
average price of crude petroleumimports during July to December 2008 was US$103/barrelfor Pakistan, while the
internaiional price of Dubai crude oil was only US$37/barrel in December 2008 (see Table 4). Assuming the
average price of petroleumimports will be halvedfrom over US$lOO/barrelto US$SO/barrelduring January to June
2009, and import volumes remainconstant, this would reduce the half-yearly petroleumimport bill from 3.7 percent
of GDP during July-December 2008 to at most 1.8 percent of GDP during January-June 2009.

Figure    7).     However,     core                               Figure 7: Inflation

43.    Despite favorable trends
in the agricultural sector, domestic production and sales declined during the first half of 2008/09
compared to the previous year, due to power shortages, increased input costs, lower domestic
demand, decreased private sector credit growth, and worsened prospects for exports. In particular,
the growth o f the large-scale manufacturing sector turned negative 4.7 percent. Owing to these trends, the
real GDP growth target for 2008/09 has been reduced to 2.5 percent.

                                      E.       Medium-TermOutlook

44.    Given global economic crisis, the medium-term outlook presents significant downside risks.
The external environment is expected to deteriorate further, with global growth turning negative and a
gradual recovery starting only 2010.

45.    Pakistan's real GDP growth is projected to remain low in 2008/09 and 2009/10, and increase
gradually from 2.5 percent in 2008/09 to 6.5 percent by 2012/13, although longer-term projections
are particularly uncertain in view of the volatile global economic environment. Aided by increasing
public investment-among       other things in infrastructure, power, and transport-gross       capital formation
will rise and contribute to growth recovery and facilitate private sector activity. In parallel, gradually
increasing private sector credit growth will help economic activity. Agriculture is showing good growth
prospects, while manufacturing and services are expected to recover only gradually as the domestic
aggregate demand picks up and the availability o f power improves as a result o f investments in power
generation. With the global recovery, exports are also projected gradually improve and reduce Pakistan's
external vulnerability over time.

46.    Over the medium term, Government's revised macroeconomic framework targets projects a
decline in the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) from 4.3percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 2.3 percent of
GDP in 2012/13. The cornerstone o f this outlook is a significant increase inFBRtax revenues which are
projected to rise by 3.1 percentage points o f GDP to 12.7 percent o f GDP by 2012113. Excluding grants,
overall revenues are to rise from 14.3 percent o f GDP in 2007108 to 17.3 percent o f GDP in 2012113.

47.   To meet the ambitious revenue targets, the authorities plan to implement bold and
comprehensive tax policy and administration reforms.                  This will include quick and decisive
implementation o f value-added taxation (VAT) o f goods and services, elimination o f tax exemptions and

                                                    12

zero-ratings, and revamping o f the tax administration. The work on the new VAT law has started, with
the aim to get it ready for implementation in the 2010/11 budget. This will be the key measure to expand
the tax base and revenues, since currently services, which account for about 60 percent o f GDP, currently
remain outside the tax net. In the meantime, as part o f the 2009/10 budget, Government expects to adopt
significant legal changes to the current General Sales Tax (GST), moving it closer to VAT by minimizing
exemptions and zero-ratings, and thereby broadening tax base and revenues. The proposed operation
supports these efforts. Significant untapped revenue potential remains also at the provincial level, which
would warrant attention.

48.    Owing to this sizeable revenue effort, total expenditures are projected to slowly climb back to
about 20 percent of GDP in 2012/13. In line with current projections of low oil and commodity prices,
and following the elimination o f power and fuel subsidies and maturing o f the remainder o f high interest-
yielding Defense Savings Certificates, current expenditures will decline as a share o f GDP and make
space for a steady increase in development spending from 3.2 percent o f GDP in 2008/09 to 5.6 percent o f
GDP in 2012/13.

49.    Lowering inflation remains a challenge. Headline inflation is projected to decrease from 20
percent in 2008/09 to 5.5 percent in 2012/13. The economic downturn is, however, likely to put stress on
banks' financial positions and close monitoring will be warranted.         The proposed operation supports
tightening o f prudential regulations to strengthen the financial sector.

50.    The external current account deficit is projected to decline to about 4.2 percent of GDP by
2012/13. Foreign exchange reserves are expected to build-up from US$9.1 billion by end-June 2009 to
about US$11.9 billion by end-June 2012/13.          The sharp decline in international commodity prices,
reduced private sector credit growth, and the economic recession are expected to curtail import growth in
2008109 and 2009/10.       Exports are projected to start recovering from 2009110 onwards with gradual
global recovery and imports from 2010/11 onwards, but the growth o f both remains moderate during the
medium term. Remittances are projected to grow over the medium term. FDI, after a drop in 2008109, i s
projected to start gradually recovering in 2009110 with the re-launch o f the privatization process, and
portfolio flows are predicted to turn positive only from 2010/11 onwards.

5 1.   In the medium term, increased productivity and export competitiveness are necessary to
generate growth and reduce external vulnerability. To this aim, structural reforms to strengthen the
investment climate and competitive environment are required. These will include measures to ease firm
entry and exit, reduce barriers to competition and trade, and enhance the labor market flexibility. In
addition, efforts to improve the financial sustainability and efficiency o f the power sector will be essential
to attract investment in new power generation. The proposed operation supports reforms in these areas.

52.    Protectingthe poor and vulnerable is essential during the stabilization process. Recognizing
this, the federal Government and the Punjab province increased spending on social safety nets by total o f
0.5 percent o f GDP in 2008109.       Further spending increases are projected in 2009/10.        The federal
Government launched the Benazir Income Support Program inthe fall 2008, with the objective to provide
cash grants to the poorest families in Pakistan. In parallel, the province o f Punjab established its own
income support program to protect the poor and vulnerable o f Punjab. The proposed operation helps the
federal Government to strengthen the new national social safety net.

53.    In conclusion, despite a highly uncertain external environment, Pakistan is now in a better
position to attain the projected medium-term recovery path. Over the last few months, the
stabilization efforts together with a decline in international commodity prices have succeeded in reducing
external imbalances, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, narrowing fiscal overruns and lowering
inflation. However, the sharp deterioration in the global economic and financial outlook poses significant
risks to exports, remittances and external financing, notwithstanding the fiscal stimuluspackages prepared

                                                    13

in a number o f countries. Even though projections in these areas as well as forecasts about the speed of
real economy recovery were significantly moderated during the first program review in February 2009,
they may still turn out to be optimistic.       This highlights the need for a rigorous implementation o f
reforms, while protecting core development spending, inparticular social spending, to ease the adjustment
for the poor and vulnerable people. There is a risk that the sharper than anticipated economic downturn
will lead to social tension as business activity slows down and firms shed labor. Also, the risks to the
domestic financial sector may increase. To mitigate this latter risk, SBP has adopted a problem bank
management and contingency plan for dealing with problem banks, and measures to improve banking
resolution and banking supervision are being implemented.

54.    The medium-term revenue projections are ambitious and there is a risk that they will not be
met. However, the authorities want to retain the stretch targets in order to maintain the pressure for
reform. Recognizing the need to substantially raise the tax to GDP ratio, they are keen to seize the
opportunity for bold tax reforms, and are committed to take compensatory action in case revenues fall
short o f targets. This will include cutting of expenditures.

55.    Stringent implementation o f the economic program will be critical t o success, and timely
responses of fiscal and monetary authorities to emerging risks will be essential to ensure it remains
o n track. In the current economic environment, any medium-term projections are uncertain and regular
adjustments are necessary in response to changed circumstances. The quarterly monitoring o f the IMF
and the Bank's proposed programmatic operation will mitigate these risks through continued policy
dialogue with the authorities on a proper adjustment path.

                                             F.      Governance

56.    Pakistan exhibits problems in many dimensions of governance. The delivery o f public services
i s adversely affected by leakages, difficulties with bureaucratic structure and quality, and opaque
decision-making. However, Government recognizes that corruption constitutes a threat to Pakistan's
development agenda, undermining revenue collection and service delivery, and eroding Government's
credibility and state legitimacy. Public pressure to tackle corruption under the democratic government is
increasing.

57.    The authorities have made progress in public sector accounting and auditing reforms, and in
improving regulatory structure for public procurement. The accounting and audit functions have
been separated and the Office o f the Controller General o f Accounts established. Government has made
significant progress in transitioning to the international public sector accounting standards using a
computerized integrated financial management information system. The timeliness and reliability o f
financial reports o f Government have improved. A new Chart o f Accounts for budgeting, accounting, and
financial reporting, which i s consistent with international standards, has been rolled out across federal,
provincial, and district governments.       The overall quality and reliability o f Government financial
statements has also improved, and unidentifiedexpenditures reduced. There i s a significant reduction in
the"pay-bill" processing time as computerization has minimized manual processing and human discretion,
and financial reports are disclosed.      Expenditure irregularity has been reduced with monthly budget
execution reports generated electronically and made available to spending agencies for budget monitoring
and with pre-audit activities. Internal management practices, while still weak and a source o f corruption,
are being strengthened. Some progress has also been made in public procurement. In 2003, the Public
Procurement Regulatory Authority was set up to provide efficiency and transparency in public
procurement.      In 2004, public procurement rules consistent with good practice were prepared and
notified. However, several challenges remain to be addressed, including an effective appeals process and
monitoring and evaluation system (see paragraphs 124 and 167-174). Since enhancing accountability,
transparency, and reducing opportunities for corruption are core elements o f improved governance, these
and other related actions will need to be strengthened and deepened as part o f ongoing reforms.

                                                    14

58.      Government has strengthened key regulatory institutions, deregulated, and proceeded with
privatization to reduce opportunities for corruption. In 2007, an Anti-Money Laundering bill was
promulgated that allows the authorities to seize property derived from or invested in money-laundering
and impose penalties, and a National Commission for Government Reform presented in 2008 a proposal
for civil service reform and restructuring o f government processes.

                                                          G.        Poverty

59.      The 2005/06 Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM), which is
the latest available household survey, suggests that Pakistan witnessed from the early to mid-2000s
improvement in key aspects of human development, such as poverty incidence and access to basic
education. Irrespective o f the methodology deployed, poverty dropped significantly between 2001102
and 2005/06. The official poverty estimates suggest that the national poverty rate fell by more than 11
percentage points in four years, which is equivalent to over 17 million people moving out o f poverty.
Even the more conservative estimate suggests that the national poverty rate fell by close to six percentage
pointsS2The results from the 2006/07 PSLM confirm that progress in basic social indicators continued
over the last few years.

60.      Since then a new set of challenges has emerged. First, there are signs suggesting that rapid
poverty reduction can be transitory and reversed by small shocks. For example, the poverty trend has
shown sizeable fluctuation since 1998199, especially in the provinces o f Sindh and Balochistan. Second,
a slow pace o f employment generation is a source o f concern. Third, there is a need to make economic
growth and human development more inclusive and regionally balanced. Fourth, the rise in the cost o f
living over the last year may have reversed at least some o f the earlier progress in poverty reduction.
Section V1.A and Annex 11 o f this document present some initial analysis o f this. The release o f the
2007108 PSLM, which is expected in early 2009 and includes a consumption module, will provide an
opportunity to establish the latest trends. These emerging challenges are being analyzed in the ongoing
work for the 2009 poverty assessment, and need attention if Pakistan's good performance on poverty
reduction is to continue.

                                      H.          Status of IMFActivities in Pakistan

61.      The IMF-supported Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded in December
2004, and the Government o f Pakistan did not request a successor IMF program. Between 2005 and
October 2008 Pakistan was on a standard Article IV surveillance schedule. The Article IV consultations
concluded in December 2007 highlighted the widening current account deficit as the economy's main
vulnerability. The IMF carried out its bi-annual Staff Visit in M a y 2008, and concluded that a major
fiscal adjustment effort accompanied by a substantial tightening o f monetary policy (including the
elimination o f central bank financing o f government) and further exchange rate depreciation would be
needed to contain inflation while reducing the large current account deficit.                           A t the request o f the
Pakistani authorities, an IMF technical mission visited Islamabad during September 2008 to provide
technical input to quantifying the economic stabilization package being developed by the authorities and
preparing an updated medium-term macroeconomic framework.




 The official poverty rates are estimatedbased on poverty lines updatedwith CPI-based inflation rates. According to the official
estimates, the overall poverty declined by more than 12 percentage points, from 34.5 to 22.3 percent between 2001102 and
2005106. Poverty in urban areas declined from 22.7 to 13.1 percent and in rural areas from 39.3 to 27 percent. One issue for
poverty monitoring, however, is that the CPI for Pakistan currently focuses only on urban price data, although there has been
some progress in recent years in expanding ruralprice data collection. With urbanpopulation constituting only about 40 percent
o f nationalpopulation, the inclusion o f rural areas inprice data collection would improve the monitoring of poverty trends.


                                                               15

62.   In light o f the rapidly deteriorating balance o f payments position and substantial financing needs,
the authorities entered into an IMF-supported 23-month SBA in late November 2008. The program
supports the macroeconomic stabilization program in 2008109 and 2009110 to reduce inflation and the
external current account deficit to more sustainable levels. The pace o f adjustment aims to balance the
need to address the macroeconomic imbalances with protecting social stability.                The medium-term
macroeconomic framework presented earlier i s supported by the SBA. The first review o f SBA was
carried out in February 2009, and the program i s on track.

63.   The SBA and PRESO have some mutually reinforcing actions in select areas, where monitoring
from both IFIs is considered vital for success, or where the authorities have requested involvement by
both the Bank and IMF.               These areas are: power tariff adjustment, revenue mobilization, the
establishment o f a treasury single account, and protection o f the poor.

                     111. GOVERNMENT'S POVERTYREDUCTIONSTRATEGY

64.   PRSP-I: A strategy for poverty alleviation and economic development was articulated by the
previous Government in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-I) o f December 2003 entitled
 "Accelerating Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty: the Road Ahead.             "   PRSP-I focused on second
generation reforms to: (i)achieve and sustain a high growth rate with macroeconomic stability, and
translate this high growth into reduced poverty; (ii)improve governance and consolidate devolution, as a
means o f delivering both development results and ensuring social and economic justice; (iii)invest in
human capital, with emphasis on effective delivery o f basic social services; and (iv) target the poor and
vulnerable, and bring the marginalized sections o f the population and backward regions into the
mainstream o f development. The strategy was fully aligned with the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and focused on raising incomes, achieving universal primary enrollment, reducing gender
disparities, lowering child and maternal mortality, combating communicable diseases, and eradicating
poverty. The strategy was implemented and, as mentioned earlier, the economy grew rapidly, poverty
incidence declined, and many human development indicators improved during the PRSP-I period.

65.   PRSP-IZ: The current administration recently finalized the second PRSP (PRSP-11).                  The new
strategy is also fully aligned with MDGs. It focuses on regaining the macroeconomic stability and
structural reforms required to support the recovery o f strong and sustainable growth.                The strategy
envisions an economy with competitive enterprises, productive employment opportunities, transparent
governance and low poverty. PRESO i s fully aligned with the new strategy. Table 6 below highlightsthe
mapping between PRSP-I1 pillars and PRESO reform areas.

             IV. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGYAND THE PROPOSEDPRESO

                                           A.      LinktoCAS

66.    CAS: The Bank Group's Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board
in June 2006 (Report No. 35718-PAK).         The goal o f the CAS, which is aligned with the strategic
priorities o f the former Government's PRSP, i s to support Pakistan's efforts in: (i)sustaining growth and
improving competitiveness; (ii)improving government effectiveness and service delivery; and (iii)
improving lives and protecting the vulnerable.

67.    The Bank is in the proces? o f preparing a new CAS. The new CAS is expected to be presented to
the Board inthe calendar year 2009.

68.    The reform program supported by the proposed PRESO, with its focus on economic stabilization
and regaining o f economic growth while protecting the poor and vulnerable and improving
competitiveness, is consistent with the current CAS priorities.

                               B.      AnalyticalUnderpinnings of PRESO

69.    The proposed PRESO is based on a series o f economic and sector work on Pakistan. This includes
the following analyses:

70.    Taxpolicy: The specific tax policy measures proposed to be supported have been informed by the
ongoing programmatic tax policy work, which consists o f policy papers, country case studies, and
technical assistance for institutional development and capacity building.          This work provides a
comprehensive assessment o f Pakistan's tax system, lessons from other countries, and options for tax
reform at both the federal and provincial level.

71.    Tax administration:       The proposed measures to strengthen tax administration build on the
recommendations o f the Federal Board o f Revenue (FBR) review conducted in September 2008. At the
request of Pakistan fiscal authorities, a team o f international consultants reviewed the state o f tax
administration in FBR. The team prepared an assessment o f various aspects o f tax administration, and
identified where and why FBR i s falling behind and what remedies are available to bring about
improvements.

72.   Public expenditure management: The public expenditure management component and proposed
actions reflect the results o f the ongoing Public Expenditure, Procurement, and Financial Management
(PEPFM) Review, which integrates the three areas and analyzes the effectiveness o f public expenditures
in a holistic manner.     The review explores ways to finance the significant developmental needs, in
particular on power, water, roads and social sectors, while ensuring fiscal sustainability. It highlights the
need to rationalize the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) to reduce the throw-forward and
ensure the spending yields results, strengthen the medium-term budget framework process, improve cash
management, and enhance transparency inpublic procurement.

73.   Financial sector: The financial sector component is based o n the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) carried out jointly by the World Bank and IMF in September 2008. The proposed
PRESO focuses on the most critical short and medium-term policy measures recommended by the
assessment.

74.   Debt management assessment: The above mentioned FSAP 2008, the technical assistance mission
conducted in M a y 2008, and the assessment o f central government debt management and domestic debt
market development from 2004 informed the development o f the debt management component.


                                                  17

75.    Competition policy:     The competition policy component builds on an extensive program o f
technical assistance by the World Bank since 2006, which has provided diagnostic and recommendations
for a new legal and institutional framework. The analytical aspects are documented in the report on
Competition Law and Policy published in 2007.

76.    Business registration: The proposed actions on business registration derive from the work carried
out by the Doing Business project, which has been extended to the sub-national level. Doing Business
indicators were collected for six Pakistan cities and analyzed in a report produced by the World Bank in
2007.

77.    Poverty and social impact assessment: As discussed in Section V1.A and Annex 11, the fuel price
and power tariff adjustments may have distributional impacts. Assessments o f (i)     direct impacts o f fuel
price increases on poverty; (ii)incidence o f power subsidies; and (iii)the impact o f food price increases
on poverty have been carried out.

78.    Poverty assessment: The previous poverty assessment on Pakistan was completed in the fall 2002.
The work i s ongoing on the next one, which, in addition to poverty diagnostic, will analyze employment
and labor market dynamics.

79.    Social safety net: The social safety net component is based on a series o f technical assistance the
Bank has provided to the authorities in the area o f social protection in the past few years. This includes
support provided to the preparation o f the National Social Protection Strategy and to the development o f
an improved targeting mechanism for cash transfer programs. A new targeting instrument (scorecard) has
been developed to support the identification o f the poor.

80.    Country Assistance Evaluation:       In 2005, IEG conducted an evaluation o f Bank assistance to
Pakistan during 1994-2003. The report rated the effectiveness o f Bank's assistance mixed, with the
overall outcomes o f Bank's assistance program rated as moderately unsatisfactory.         Bank support for
macroeconomic management and growth was rated as moderately satisfactory, while the Bank's
assistance was found to be unsatisfactory in poverty reduction, social sector development, governance,
agriculture, natural resource management, fixed infrastructure, revenue mobilization, and expenditure
management.

8 1.   The key recommendations o f the evaluation were: (i)the Bank should continue its strong support o f
analytical work, while translating analysis into implementable actions, taking into account political
economy constraints; (ii)Bank interventions should have a greater focus on building sustainable
institutional capacity; (iii)projects should be more focused and scaled to fit the capacity o f implementing
agencies; and (iv) the Bank should invest additional effort into improving donor relations.

82.    Other prior budget support operations: The other prior budget support operations to Pakistan
provide two lessons relevant for the proposed PRESO. First, the experience highlightsthe importance o f
aligning the reform program with the roles and responsibilities o f the concerned level o f government. For
example, since the delivery o f education and health are primarily provincial responsibilities, reforms in
these areas are best handled through provincial-level operations. Second, the prior experience suggests
the need to address capacity and institutional issues in parallel to ensure that the reforms are followed
through.

83.   The proposed PRESO continues supporting select unfinished critical reforms from the past PRSC
series, which are consistent with the current administration's priorities. These include: power sector
reform, competition policy, statistical reform, revenue mobilization at a significantly expanded scale and
focus, and social safety nets.

 84.    Coordination with IMF: Bank and Fund staff collaboration in Pakistan continues to be effective
 with consultations on macroeconomic issues and technical assistance. The Bank and IMF teams have
 coordinated closely both the SBA and PRESO-supported reform programs.                          The Bank has continued
 participating in the IMF missions as an observer.

 85.    Coordination with other development partners: The Bank i s collaborating with DFID on select
 reforms supported by PRESO. A DFID-financed trust fund has generously supported the analytical work
 and technical assistance that i s underpinning a number o f supported reform measures, in particular in the
 areas of revenue mobilization, competition policy, social protection, and poverty analysis.

       V.      GOVERNMENT'S AND STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN'S PROPOSED REFORM
                                      PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY PRESO

                                            A.         Overview of PRESO

 86.    Objective: The objective o f PRESO will be to support the implementation o f Pakistan's recently
 adopted PRSP-11. Inparticular, PRESO will support the structural reforms needed to regain and maintain
 economic stability and to bring the economy back to a higher growth path over time through measures
 enhancing competitiveness, while protecting the poor and vulnerable.

 87.    Proposed reform areas:         The reform program supported by PRESO is built on three pillars
 focusing on: (i)regaining and maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii)                enhancing competitiveness; and
 (iii)protectingthepoorandvulnerable. Table7laysoutthehome-grown2008/09PolicyFrameworkof
 Government and State Bank o f Pakistan with the pillars, reform areas and actions proposed to be covered
 under each o f them. These areas and actions are consistent with PRSP-11. The specific reforms to be
 supported in each area are detailed in the Government and State Bank o f Pakistan's Letter of Development
 Policy (see Schedule I). PRESO will focus on actions that are critical for economic stabilization and
 promotion o f competitiveness, protection o f the poor and vulnerable, as well as for achievement o f the set
 outcome goals (see below).

 88.    As highlightedin PRSP-11, the immediate task at hand for the authorities will be to re-stabilize the
 economy and narrow macroeconomic imbalances. This will involve prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
 consistent with the IMF-supported SBA. To limit the scale o f public expenditure cuts, there is a need to
 raise tax revenues decisively, substantially and sustainably. Raising domestic tax revenues to a higher
 level would also enable Pakistan finance its significant development needs and thereby facilitate inclusive
 economic growth over time. This will require renewed effort to reform both tax administration and tax
 policies, and hence these areas are covered by the proposed reform program to be supported by PRESO.

policy analysis and formulation.




  89.   The sharp increase in economic imbalances in 2007108 was largely caused by government
 overspending-in        particular on fuel and power subsidies-and                   under-forecasted domestic interest
 payments.      Therefore, in addition to ensuring that energy subsidies remain within the limits o f the
 budgetedamounts, it will be essential to reinstitute automatic price adjustment mechanisms for both fuel
 and power to avoid similar problems in the future. Bringing the power tariff to the cost recovery level
 will also be essential for puttingthe power sector on financially sustainable footing and attracting foreign
 investors to the sector. Thus, the proposed reform program will support these efforts.

 90.    In addition, the proposedprogram will support reforms to improve the efficiency and prioritization
 o f public spending. Government's development program portfolio has expanded to an unmanageable
 level with about 2,000 different schemes, a large annual throw-forward, and little sense o f prioritization of
 activities. Efficient cash management i s also lacking, and public procurement remains relatively non-
 transparent. In the current resource-strapped environment, it i s imperative to raise the efficiency o f public
 spending.

 91.    Further, Government's debt management needs urgent attention. In the past year, Government
 effectively withdrew from market-based funding. This was possible by unlimited recourse to central bank
 financing, the heavy reliance on National Savings Schemes (NSS) retail instruments, and the application
 o f yield cut-offs in wholesale auctions.        At the same time, the significant rise in net government
 borrowing from SBP undermined the central bank's ability to implement a monetary policy consistent
 with macroeconomic stability and low inflation. The macroeconomic re-stabilization would need to be
 underpinned by strengthened public debt management, and hence it is proposed to be supported by the
 reform program.

 92.    Inparallel with stabilization efforts, the authorities will needto take measures to enhance Pakistan's
 competitiveness to achieve the PRSP-I1 goal o f moving the economy back to a higher growth path.
 Remaining barriers to business entry and exit would need to be addressed. Unhindered entry, exit, and
 turnover o f firms are crucial for productivity growth, as competition induces firms to adopt new
 technologies and raise efficiency. Thus, it i s essential that Government's legal and policy framework
 promotes competition. PRESO is proposed to support reforms in all these areas.

 93.    A sound and stable financial sector is also essential for development. The global financial crisis
 and, above all, the needed macroeconomic adjustment can be expected to put strain on the financial
 sector, threatening its soundness and stability. Thus, the proposed reform program will support measures
 to improve the stability o f the system.

 94.    Finally, to mitigate the adverse impact o f domestic price increases and adjustment o n the poor,
 Government's social safety net system would need to be strengthened. Hence, the proposed reform
 program would support the efforts o f the authorities to improve the targeting o f the existing social safety
 net system, and in particular the targeting o f the Benazir Income Support Program. The program is also
 proposed to support statistical reform to enhance the reliability o f economic and social data.

 95.    Proposed PRESO Prior Actions: PRESO i s proposed to have in total ten prior actions.                        In
 addition, the general requirement of a satisfactory medium-term macroeconomic framework for all

Bank's budget support operations applies. PRESO prior actions follow the good practice principles (see
Box 1) and are as follows:


                0        Government approved establishment o f a new integrated tax administration on a

    Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
    The PRESO-supportedreformprogram is in line with Government's priorities as spelled out in PRSP-11. The program reflects
    policy measures which Government has proposedand is committedto do.

    Principle2: Agree upfront with thegovernment and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated accountabilityframework
    The PESO-supported medium-tern policy matrix, which outlines short and medium-tern actions with clear and measurable
    outcome indicatorsand targets, was developedjointly with the Pakistaniauthorities.

    Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
    The reformprogram is basedon the needs of Pakistan. It reflects the significant policy measures on various fronts neededfor
    stabilization of Pakistan's economy and enhancement of competitiveness and economic growth for poverty reduction. Also, the
   program focuses on outcome-oriented actions to achieveprogram objectives.

    Principle4: Chooseonly actionscriticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
   PRESO focuses on actions that are critical for achievingthe set outcome goals. The number of prior actions has been limitedto
   ten.

   Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable andperformance-basedjinancial support
   Progressmade with the implementationof reforms and achievement of outcome goals will be monitored throughpreparationof
   regularmacroeconomicupdates, and a progress matrix, which outlinesthe status of reformsandoutcome indicators.




96.     Link to medium-term policy framework: A full correction o f existing macroeconomic imbalances
i s not feasible in the current fiscal year, and therefore the authorities will continue stabilization and
economic recovery efforts in 2009110 and 2010111.

97.   The draft medium-term policy framework o f Government and SBP, which lays out the envisaged
roadmap for adjustment over time, is attached as Schedule 2. As mentioned earlier, PRESO will support
the implementation o f actions taken in 2008/09 only. The implementation o f the latter two fiscal years o f
the framework is expected to be supported trough another operation.

98.   Expected outcomes of PRESO: The following outcomes are expected as a result o f the proposed
PRESO:

                   Fiscal deficit reduced from 7.4percent o f GDP in2007/08 to or below 4.3 percent o f
                   GDP in 2008109;
                   Current account deficit reduced from 8.4 percent o f GDP in2007/08 to or below 5.9
                   percent o f GDP in 2008/09;
                   Improved Doing Business indicators; and
                   Improved access to social safety nets for the bottom 25 percent poorest population.

99.   Mitigation of poverty and social impacts: Poverty and social impact assessments (see Section
V1.A) were carried out on fuel and power tariff adjustments and on the impact o f food price inflation.
The results indicate that price increases o f food products and, to a lesser degree, o f fuel products, would
be the main concerns from the poverty impact point o f view. Electricity tariff increases are unlikely to
have any direct adverse impact on poor people.              Fortunately, the recent decline in, international
commodity prices makes reductions in domestic food and fuel prices currently more likely than increases,
which allays the earlier mentioned concerns. The proposed PRESO action on fuel i s expected to benefit
all households.

100. The following sections will describe in further detail the actions proposed to be supported by
PRESO.

                 B.       Pillar I:Regainingand Maintaining MacroeconomicStability

                                      IncreasedRevenue Mobilization

101. Outcomegoal: The FBRtax revenue to GDP ratio increased by 0.4 percent of GDP in2008109.

102. Issues: A sustainable improvement in the Government resource envelope has to come through
higher tax revenue mobilization. Yet Pakistan's tax collection has failed to improve since the late 1990s.
The tax-to-GDP ratio recovered to 10.9 percent in 2006107.               In 2007108, the difficult economic
circumstances took a toll on tax collection and the Federal Board o f Revenue (FBR), which collects over
90 percent o f Pakistan's tax revenues, collected less than the initially set target. As a result, the total tax-
to-GDP rgtio decreased to 10.4 percent in 2007108. The outtum o f first six months o f 2008/09 suggests
revenues continue to be stagnant.

103. The stagnation in tax collection is related to administrative limitations. Supported by the Bank's
Tax Administration Reform Project, FBR has made some good progress since 2005 in moving towards
the introduction o f self-assessment for income tax; extensive development o f information technology
systems; the development o f a strong taxpayer facilitation approach; rapid progress in e-filing; and the
establishment o f a modem tax office network, with upgraded infrastructure at many offices. However,
the process is still incomplete: self-assessment i s partial; the organizational structure still reflects separate
taxes; and the full benefits o f a function-based and integrated administration have yet to be realized. At
the provincial level, tax administration reforms have still to be launched.

104. The weaknesses in tax administration are compounded by weaknesses in tax policy. L o w tax
policy capacity has contributed to continuous piecemeal changes in tax legislation that have eroded the
coherence of the tax structure. In particular, the tax code needs to be further simplified for smooth

                                                     23

implementation and compliance. In addition, the revenue is raised in an inefficient way by favoring
certain sectors and economic activities over others. For example, the advantageous treatment o f services
and agriculture compared to industry deters industrial enterprises from doing better, and ultimately gets in
the way o f economic growth.        Furthermore, there are questions to what extent the tax system is
sufficiently equitable. For example, persons relying on income from capital are taxed far more lightly
than persons relying on labor income. One reason for these inefficiencies and inequities is that federal tax
bases are tapped more strongly than provincial tax bases. The federal tax administration i s more efficient
than provincial tax administration, and the bulk o f the fiscal transfers o f the National Finance
Commission to provinces are allocated only on population basis.

105. To ensure adequate public funding for development priorities, Government aims to increase tax
collection by 3.1 percentage points over the next five years, while improving the buoyancy o f the tax
system, broadening the tax bases, reducing distortions and phasing out exemptions. To attain this goal,
major tax administration and tax policy measures will need to be introduced in the short and medium run.
Government is strongly committed to pursuing the required tax reforms across the three areas o f tax
administration, tax policy, and provincial taxation.

106. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: PRESO will support the following Government
actions to improve revenue mobilization in an efficient and equitable manner:

              Establishment of function-based and integrated tax administration: The objective o f tax
              administration reform i s the creation o f an FBR organizational structure based on
               functional rather than tax-type lines. This involved a full integration o f the domestic taxes
              into a single organization. Because there is lack o f accountability in key areas and in some
              cases a duplication o f accountability, re-organization at the top management level has also
              been a necessary early step under PRESO in the process to achieve full integration. Now
              that the organizational structure has been revised, FBR's tax administration will require
              formal business process re-engineering.

              Risk-based compliance management: The recent efforts to facilitate taxpayer compliance
              through automation, education and assistance will be augmented with a strengthened and
              targeted enforcement program to detect and deter non-compliance. Under PRESO, the
              authorities have established task forces to pursue unregistered entities, non-filers, and stop
              filers, as well as launched the preparation o f risk-based compliance strategies. Effective
              risk-based compliance management is vital for ensuring that taxpayers meet their
              obligations to register, keep proper records, file correct returns, and pay taxes on time.

              Alignment of information technology with business needs: The IT system will also need
              to be aligned with the new integrated tax system and focus on its deployment.            Under
              PRESO, FBR has sanctioned the current suite o f systems as the core o f System 2009, and
              ceases development work on any competing systems. Also, the Lahore Large Taxpayer
              Unit has been selected as testing ground for System 2009. Once functionality is ensured,
              FBR intends to deploy System 2009 throughout all Large Taxpayer Unitsand Regional Tax
              Offices. System 2009 will be modified on an ongoing basis in line with the changes in
              business processes and tax policies.

              Reform of tax policies:       Government intends to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio over the
              medium-term in a sustainable, efficient, and equitable manner through reforms o f the three
              main domestic taxes.       The General Sales Tax (GST) is the most conspicuous under-
              performer among Pakistan's taxes.        The federal GST on goods is fragmented through
              multiple exemption and zero-rating provisions.         Pakistan's constitution preserves the
              taxation o f services for the provinces, which make little use o f this tax base. Introducing a
              well-administered GST on both goods and services with minimum exemptions would
              widen the tax base substantially and deliver a sizeable increase in tax collection. Under

                PRESO, Government has endorsed the policy proposal to amend legislation o f domestic
                indirect taxes to ensure comprehensive taxation o f goods and services in the form o f VAT.
                As part o f the 2009110 Finance Act, Government expects to adopt significant legal changes
                that move GST closer to a comprehensive VAT, as well as simplify tax rate schedules,
                rationalize withholding taxes, and broaden the base o f Pakistan's tax system, including for
                income tax. Legal tax reforms are expected to be completed by June 2010.

                                   Adjustment of Fuel Prices and Power Tariffs

107. Outcome goals: (i) subsidies eliminated by end 2008; (ii)
                                 Fuel                                                power sector subsidies eliminated
by end June 2009.

108. Issues:      The proposed fiscal adjustment requires substantial cut in subsidies.                     The proposed
operation focuses on fuel and power subsidies, which are largest in size and which were the main reason
for the ballooning fiscal imbalance in 2007/08.

109. The former system o f fortnightly adjustment in domestic oil prices to establish parity with
international prices was abandoned in February 2007, and Government continued to absorb fully the
international price increases in the budget until March 2008. As a result, fuel subsidies ballooned in
2007/08 and, in the absence o f adjustment in domestic prices, the growth in domestic demand for
petroleum products continued unabated.

110. Government recognized that it cannot continue to provide subsidies on petroleum products, and
took actions to eliminate subsidies on all petroleum products by end December 2008. Specifically, in the
first four months o f 2008109, it did not reduce the domestic prices o f petroleum products while crude and
product prices were falling sharply in international markets.                  Since the delivered cost o f almost all
petroleum products has fallen below the level o f domestic prices-the                 parity between the domestic and
international fuel prices was reached in mid-October 2008-Government                     has now started passing on the
impact o f further reductions in import costs to consumers.

111. The power sector is facing severe physical and financial deficits, which have started to constrain
economic growth and erode investor confidence as frequent power outages have become common
throughout the country. Improvements in the quantity and quality o f power supply will take 3 to 4 years,
owing to inadequate investment in the past and the time required to expand generation capacity and the
transmission and distribution grids.

112. The financial deficit is the result o f inadequate increases in electricity tariffs, which have not been
commensurate with the changes in the cost o f supply (primarily on account o f rising fuel cost^).^ Also,
since February 2007 NEPRA has determined consumer tariffs on the basis o f the cost o f service o f each
distribution company (disco), while Government has notified a uniform consumer tariff across discos.
The difference between the NEPRA determined and Government notified tariffs has been covered by
Government through increasing subsidies. This i s a large drain on the budget, which i s not sustainable.




  Government has adjusted electricity tariffs four times-in February 2007, March 2008, November 2008, and February 2009-
since November 2003. These adjustments involved increases o f about 10, 9, and 18 percent respectively in consumer tariffs.
However, some consumer categories/slabs were exempted from these increases (including the lifeline tariff), while tariffs were
increased more modestly for other consumers.       Consequently, for example, the revenue impact o f the February 2007 tariff
adjustment was estimated to be less than 7 percent. The revenue impact o f the March 2008 tariff adjustment was o f a similar
order of magnitude. In addition, to reduce the power sector subsidies, Government discontinued on July 1,2008 the GST rebate
which was providedto electricity consumers.

                                                            25

 113. In addition, the utilities have accumulated significant arrears and payables/receivables to fuel
suppliers and Government.            This has constrained the utilities' ability to borrow commercially for
investments and to service debts. A financial restructuring program would be needed, including, inter
alia, quantifying the magnitude o f such arrears and options to address these obligations. A combination
o f short and medium-term policies and actions will be essential for ensuring a financially sustainable
electricity sector, which is able to meet the needs o f a growing economy, while protecting the                            To
enhance the efficiency o f power sector public outlays, PEPCO, with financial support from the World
Bank,' has embarked upon a program o f strengthening the capacity o f the distribution and transmission
networks so as to improve reliability and quality o f service.

 114. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goals:                           PRESO will support the reinstatement or
establishment o f systems that make fuel price and power tariff adjustments automatic. For power, one
action-the      introduction o f a monthly tariff fuel price adjustment-is             designed to address the potential
future increases in international prices and prevent further build-up o f subsidy (flow), while another
action i s designed to clear the accumulated difference between the consumer tariff and the cost recovery
level o f tariff (stock). Poverty and social impact assessments have been carried out on the proposed
actions (see Section VI.A), and they indicate that the proposed actions are not expected to adversely affect
the poor:

                  Re-introducing automatic fuel price adjustment: To prevent any future build-up o f oil
                   subsidy, the authorities have under PRESO introduced an automatic monthly adjustment o f
                  consumer fuel prices, but with a minimum level o f P D L specified. This would ensure that
                  over the medium term fuel prices will be adjusted on a regular basis to reflect changes in
                   international prices. Also, the authorities eliminated the fuel subsidies by end-2008.

                  Introducing regular power tariff adjustment: The 2008 Finance Act authorizes NEPRA
                  to make automatic monthly determinations o f fuel adjustment surcharge, and NEPRA
                  started exercising this authority in September 2008.                In addition, new electricity tariffs
                  reflecting the changed fuel cost are being notified within 15 days from determination or re-
                  determination.

                   In parallel, the authorities have prepared and implemented under PRESO a plan for the
                  base power tariff adjustment so as to eliminate the power sector subsidies by end June
                   2009, while also ensuring the 2008/09 power subsidies are consistent with the budget. A
                  power tariff increase, consistent with the plan, has been implemented, with the first tariff
                   adjustment notified in February 2009.

                                      ImprovedEfficiencyof Public Spending

115. Outcome goals: (i)           Throw-fonvard reduced from 6.1 to 4.9 years in 2008/09; (ii)                 medium-term
budget planning established; (iii)efficient cash balance management in place; (iv) social and poverty-
related spending at least 4.5 percent o f GDP.

116. Issues: To create additional fiscal space for priority development initiatives and to achieve results,
there i s a need to rationalize the development portfolio to a more manageable level and focus it on current
development priorities. Over the last six years, development expenditure has increased six fold. Given
the development needs o f the country, this was a positive development. Nonetheless, this increase was
not accompanied by the required institutional and procedural improvement to ensure the maximum
impact of these expenditures. In addition, there was a sizeable increase in the number o f schemes in the

increases.
 Electricity Distribution and Transmission Improvement Project.

                                                            26

development portfolio, which over the last five years increased to about 1,9 17-almost                     three times the
number o f schemes included in the 2002/03 Federal Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). This
has imposed considerable strain on public sector institutions responsible for implementation and
monitoring and evaluation o f PSDP. Another unwarranted outcome o f the substantial PSDP expansion
has been a rapid increase in the PSDP throw-forward, which has had an adverse impact on the efficiency
o f public spending.6 A large part o f potential development resources for at least next six years are
committed to the present portfolio, leaving little space for new development initiatives and programs. In
 order to ensure timely completion o f development schemes, government intends to reduce the throw-
 forward o f the development portfolio to a manageable level over the medium term by cutting
unproductive schemes and focusing the portfolio schemes achieving result^.^

 117. One reason for accumulation o f a large throw-forward is that development programs and projects
are approved without any consideration o f the fiscal space available to their financing. Similarly, no
fiscal impact assessment i s undertaken for any government policy initiative. As such, ad hoc fiscal
adjustments are required to accommodate these projects and initiatives into the budget. To remove this
major deficiency from the budget-making process, it would be important to make the fiscal impact
assessment o f all major projects and policy initiatives mandatory.

 118. The efficiency and effectiveness o f other public expenditure are also low. A large portion o f such
expenditure is undertaken by sub-national governments, which have uneven track record on public
expenditure reforms.          The World Bank is supporting a number o f projects at a sub-national level,
including on health and education, which cover reforms and policy actions related to improving the
development outcomes and efficiency o f public spending.

 119. Although the Government has decided to move away from single-year budgeting to a Medium
Term Budget Framework (MTBF), the process has remained slow and continued to have a number o f
weaknesses inherited from pre-MTBF period. The budget preparation i s still dominated by a bottom-up
aggregation o f line ministries budget and therefore lacks the strategic content and a clear link between
budgetary allocations and outputs-the              two critical elements o f MTBF. Line ministries' budgets are
prepared without any form o f prior indication of the resources likely to be available (such as indicative
ceilings), making them either unrealistic or largely incremental in approach.

 120. Efficient cash management is lacking. Cash flow forecasts are prepared only on a quarterly basis as
opposed to a higher granularity, such as weekly. This gives rise to a high degree o f unpredictability o f
daily government cash flows, which complicates SBP's management o f systemic liquidity. Cash balance
management is passive and reactive, relying on recourse to central bank funding to accommodate
differences between expected and actual outturns. A comprehensive cash management framework, with a
treasury single account (TSA), sweeping and netting o f subsidiary accounts, and an overall target balance,
i s absent. One consequence has been the accumulation o f idle cash by public-sector entities in advance o f
their immediate need for it, which is costly and hinders the ability to adjust expenditure choices in light o f
changing budgetary priorities. The authorities have begun taking measures to prevent this accumulation
o f idle cash as a first step toward developing a TSA.




  The throw-forward is an indicator of the claim of the present development portfolio on future development resources. The
throw-forward (Le. the amount of funds required to complete all the ongoing projects in the development portfolio, provided no
new project is included in theportfolio) of the developmentprogramof federal ministries and corporations(including WADPA's
non-budgetary program) has doubled during the last three years (from Rs 1.25 trillion in FY06 to Rs 2.5 trillion for 2008/09).
Increased throw-forward adds to the rigidities in budgetary decision-makingand imposes pressures to increase the size of the
development budget to levels inconsistent with the macroeconomicframework.
7 In general, development projects should be completed within 4 to 5 years. This implies that the throw-fonvard should be no
more than 4 to 5 times the size of the development budget. However, in the present PSDP there are 61 projectswhich at present
level of allocationswill take over 100years to complete. There are 201 projects which may take 10to 100years to complete.

                                                           27

121. Adverse fiscal situation and tight financial market conditions have caused cash flow difficulties for
a number o f state-owned enterprises (SOEs).          This has led to withholding o f payments by these
corporations to other SOEs. Over time, this inter-corporate (or circular) debt has increased to a sizeable
level. Although the amounts o f payables and receivables are being disputed among SOEs, cash flow
difficulties associated with this debt are already affecting the operations o f these enterprises.

122. In addition, public procurement reforms have proceeded slowly.                 The Public Procurement
Regulatory Authority (PPRA) would need to be strengthened. No real progress with reforms has been
made on key issues in the past couple o f years. A strong country procurement system would enable
Pakistan's external partners rely on Pakistan's own systems, rather than prescribe their own procurement
rules and procedures for use under programs they finance.

123. The preparation apd notification o f the Public Procurement Rules 2004 was a significant first step
in the direction o f a transparent and efficient public procurement system. While the rules themselves are
consistent with international best practice, an effective appeals process and consultancy rules are still
missing. At present, biddershave no recourse to protest a procurement decision, except an administrative
appeal within the same procuring department they have a grievance against.

124. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goals: PRESO will support the following actions, which
have been informed by the ongoing Public Expenditure, Procurement, and Financial Management
(PEPFM) Review, to improve efficiency o f public spending:

              Rationalizing the PSDP portfolio: Under PRESO, Government has rationalized the PSDP
              portfolio through a thorough review and deletion o f schemes that were unproductive and
              misaligned with development priorities. This goal was achieved by: (a) re-evaluating the
              economic and financial viability o f schemes that were significantly delayed; (b) cutting
              projects where the present allocation was less that 10 percent o f the financing needs (that is,
              throw-forward) and eliminating most o f the new schemes where the allocation was less than
               15 percent o f the financing needs; (c) terminating all 2008/09 PSDP projects that were no
              longer viable or inconsistent with Government's development priorities; and (d) reviewing
              all prior projects, at par with new projects, for economic and financial viability, prior to any
              re-inclusion in a future development program, in case that i s contemplated.           Looking
              forward, the PSDP portfolio will be reviewed in 2009110 for further throw-forward
              reduction to ensure expenditures achieve results. Also, a system to monitor the lapse-time at
              each processing stage o f government payments will be established and parallel payments
              done, where feasible.      Finally, fiscal impact assessment o f all new policies and major
              development projects is expected to be made mandatory.

              Strengthening budget planning: Under PRESO, the strategic content o f MTBF has been
              strengthened by: (i)preparation o f a Budget Strategy Paper, which highlights the overall
              strategy o f the government to achieve its budgetary objectives, including the annual PRSP
              targets; (ii)complementing the "bottom-up"          approach o f MTBF with a "top-down''
              component which provides line ministries with an indication o f the resources which they can
              expect to access during the annual and three-year budgeting process; (iii)issuing MTBF
              consistent with the Budget Call Circular along with three-year indicative 2009/10 budget
              ceilings for each line ministry; and (iv) enhancing the effectiveness o f public expenditure
              through better linking o f development and recurrent budgets. The 2009/10 budget i s
              expected to become output-based.

              Implementing effective cash management: Under PRESO, cash management has been
              strengthened by making the use o f assignment accounts by ministries and autonomous
              agencies fully operational for budget expenditure. This was an important first step toward a
              TSA. Looking forward, cash management will be further strengthened by (i)closing all
              other bank accounts o f ministries and autonomous agencies held at commercial banks, and

                                                     28

              the remaining balances will utilized over a period o f time; and (ii)   developing a process for
              aggregating credible and reliable cash flow forecasts for all ministries and autonomous
              agencies, covering both development and recurrent expenditure and revenue. Once these
              measures are fully operational, (i) TSA will cover both development and recurrent spending;
              (ii)theend-of-weekcashbalanceoftheNo.1accountwillbemanagedinaccordancewitha
              target balance, and (iii)cash flow forecasts will be produced on at least a weekly frequency
              with a weekly granularity, with steps taken toward daily forecasts for those entities
              accounting for 90 percent o f overall cash flows.

        0    Enhancing transparency in public procurement:               One key element o f a transparent
              procurement system is dissemination o f information to bidders about the outcome o f a bid
              process. The Public Procurement Rules 2004 require the notification o f procurement notices
              and notices o f award on its website. While procurement notices are advertised on the PPRA
              website, no procuring entity was posting notices o f award. Under PRESO, the authorities
              have started to post notices o f contract awards over Rs 50 million on the PPRA website.
              Going forward, this will be extended to include contracts o f a lower threshold.

              Posting notices o f award on a publicly accessible website can be expected to increase the
              number o f complaints about procurement decisions. For that reason, an independent appeals
              process is expected to be established in 2010/11 to further strengthen the transparency o f
              public procurement.

                               StrengthenedGovernmentDebt Management

125. Outcome goals: (i)Government borrowing consistent with sound monetary and fiscal policy; (ii)
domestic debt-servicing forecast o f NSS instruments differs from actual outturn by less than 5 percent;
and (iii)public guarantees at or below 2 percent o f GDP.

126. Issues: Government debt in Pakistan was divided roughly evenly between domestic (3 1.2 percent
o f GDP) and external (26.2 percent o f GDP) debt in 2007/08. Domestic debt increased in nominal terms
by 25 percent in 2007108. As at end-June 2008, domestic debt totaled Rs. 3,264 billion and consisted o f
market wholesale treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), non-market N S S retail
instruments, and, above all, borrowings from SBP. The maturity profile o f domestic debt has become
skewed to the short end, and the refinancing risk has further increased due to the early-redemption option
embedded in retail instruments.

127. Despite the increase in domestic debt, the government has in effect withdrawn from market-based
funding. This has been made possible by unlimited recourse to central bank financing, the heavy reliance
on NSS retail instruments, and the application o f yield cut-offs inwholesale auctions (thus undermining a
commitment to market-based funding costs). The significant rise in net government borrowing from SBP
has undermined the central bank's ability to implement a monetary policy consistent with macroeconomic
stability and low inflation. Government has committed not to accumulate any new debt with SBP on a
quarterly basis as o f November 1, 2008, and to retire the stock o f this existing debt over time.

128. On the legal side, the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Law (FRDL)provides a framework
for support o f fiscal transparency and reform. FRDL was passed by Parliament in June 2005. Its intent is
to have rules-based policies that establish clear standards o f accountability for fiscal discipline. The rules
require, among other things: (i)bringing debt to GDP ratio below 60 percent by 2013; (ii)annual
reduction of debt by 2.5 percent o f GDP; (iii)issuance o f guarantees be less than 2 percent o f GDP each
year and; (iv) eliminating the revenue deficit (Le. the difference between total current expenditure and
total government revenue) by June 30, 2007, and running a surplus thereafter.                 The law allows
Government to depart from these provisions with the approval o f the National Assembly under
exceptional circumstances, such in the cases o f national security or natural calamity. In the past fiscal


                                                    29

year, Government could not reach the statutory target for the reduction o f public debt by 2.5 percent o f
GDP and the revenue deficit target was also missed. In the current fiscal year, Government is also
expected to miss the revenue deficit target. However, Government is committed to uphold FRDL from
2009/10 onwards.

129. The primary and secondary government securities markets exhibit many shortcomings.                 The
issuance o f wholesale securities i s non-predictable.    While treasury bills are issued fortnightly, an
issuance calendar for PIBs was introduced only in the current fiscal year and was only recently made fully
public. Inboth T-bill and PIB auctions, bid acceptance i s yield-driven, as opposed to volume-driven (that
is, accepting bids sufficient to issue the full announced volume o f the auction). These practices dampen
participation in auctions and market-making, as primary dealers are reluctant to commit to trades when
they may not be able to acquire bonds. In addition, decision-making rights for PIB issuance were until
recently insufficiently defined between the Ministry o f Finance and SBP. The investor base is not well
developed, and the secondary market is thin and illiquid.

130. The retail debt program also suffers from serious shortcomings. Government has limited control
over the amount o f debt raised and redeemed in any given year. The interest rate and refinancing risks o f
the retail debt portfolio are not managed. Consideration i s not given to how the retail and wholesale
programs, as currently implemented, impact on each other.            Notably, there i s reliance on manual
processes for issuing, recording, reporting, and forecasting o f outstandings and interest payments. Under-
forecasting o f debt-servicing costs for the largest scheme, Defense Savings Certificates, a zero-coupon
instrument, contributed to fiscal overruns in 2006107 and 2007/08.       This arose because the authorities
recognize the interest expense on Defense Savings Certificates only when they are encashed by investors,
but they lacked reliable data on the quantum o f certificates due to mature in those years that remained
outstanding or had been encashed early. A project to introduce information technology automation for
issuing,recording, and reporting o fNSS instruments is beingpiloted.

131. In general, debt management in Pakistan i s characterized by institutional weaknesses, and a key
factor impeding sound debt management and an effective government securities market i s the absence o f
a medium-term debt management strategy. The annual Debt Policy Statement currently produced by the
Debt Policy Coordination Office, while outlining a number o f debt portfolio developments, lacks a
comprehensive analysis o f the cost and risk implications o f different funding strategies (domestic versus
external, wholesale versus retail, tenor m i x and so on) and how the funding strategy that i s adopted will
contribute to meeting the government's long-term debt management objectives, as well as the
development o f the government securities market. N e w instruments have been proposed, in an effort to
mobilize funding. Some initiatives may have a destabilizing effect on the banking industry, albeit
perhaps inonly the short term, or may shift demand away from market sources o f funding.

132. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goals:           PRESO will support the following actions to
strengthengovernment debt management:

             Debtpolicy and borrowing aligned with sound monetary andfiscalpolicy: To make room
             for sound monetary policy implementation, it i s essential that government borrowing from
             SBP is curtailed. The Ministry o f Finance has committed to zero net borrowing from SBP
             from November 1, 2008 onwards. Going forward, the authorities expect to develop a sound
             debt management strategy, including a plan to phase out the stock o f government debt owed
             to SBP. This strategy will be implemented and improved in 2009110, and it is expected that
             this will involve adjustments to both wholesale and NSS instruments.            Also, from the
             2009/10 budget onwards, Government expects that budgets adhere again to the FRDL law.

             Government borrowing conducive to development of the government securities market:
             As an immediate first step under PRESO, a credible calendar for PIB auctions for the
             remainder o f 2008109, with quarterly updates, has been made publicly available.           The

                                                   30

                Ministry o f Finance has also amended rules defining roles and decision-making rights for
                PIB issuance. Looking forward, Government expects to reform the primary dealer system so
                as to improve participation and competitive bidding at auctions and development o f the
                secondary market. This is expected to enable the government to move fully to volume-
                based issuance o f PIBs over time, with the use o f cut-off yields discontinued.

               Improving reliability of debt-servicing forecast:                The reliability o f the revised final
                domestic debt servicing estimate for 2007l08 and the budget estimate for 2008109 was
                strengthened on account o f efforts by the authorities to gather accurate data on the Defense
                Savings Certificates maturing in 2007/08 and 2008109. The authorities are now repeating
                this exercise on an annual basis.

                                  C.        Pillar 11: EnhancingCompetitiveness

                                         ReducedBarriersto Competition

 133. Outcome goals: Starting-a-business indicator reduced from 27 days in 2008 to 22 days in 2009.

 134. Issues: Government has supported implicit competition policy through open markets for goods and
investment as a central part o f its policy framework. Building on this policy stance, a new explicit
competition policy framework has been pursued through a new Competition Ordinance, promulgated in
October 2007. The law emphasizes independence, professionalism, and transparency in the conduct o f
the Commission and Government notified an independent CCP in November 2007. Significant progress
has been made during the past year to establish the framework and operationalize CCP. CCP has been
highly active in terms o f launching the agency, enforcing the law and engaging in competition advocacy.
Going forward, CCP is complementing its law enforcement activities with a series o f competition impact
assessments for key sectors o f the economy and is producing its first annual report entitled the "State o f
Competition in Pakistan."         Through these assessments, CCP will be examining the environment for
competition, including those public policies which could be reformed to enhance competition.

 135. The legal provisions relating to corporate insolvency, which are currently found in the Companies
Ordinance, 1984 (the "Ordinance") are considered by the authorities to be inadequate for the fluidity o f
the modem economy.8            Therefore, the Securities and Exchange Commission o f Pakistan (SECP)
established a Corporate Law Review Commission in 2006 to reform companies' law and along with it the
corporate insolvency regime.            At the same time, two initiatives by the Banking Laws Review
Commission, established by SBP relate to a modern insolvency regime. The first is a draft Corporate
Rehabilitation Act prepared in 2004 which speaks to the revival1rehabilitation o f so-called "sick
companies." The second is a new draft Banking Act prepared in 2006 to replace the Banking Companies
Ordinance, 1962, which has extensive provisions relating to liquidatiodwinding up o f banks, including
special provisions for speedy disposal o f winding up proceedings. While all three efforts have been
relatively dormant since 2006, they have been revived recently, given the economic difficulties faced by
many local companies and the recognized need to have in place a modern system for corporate
rehabilitation and liquidation which covers both financial and non-financial corporate.

136. Significant progress was made in the early 2000s in streamlining registration for limited liability
companies which reduced the number o f steps and time required from over 50 to 24 days. Since 2003,
however, the time and cost to register a business has remained the same and reliant on a paper based
system. Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission o f Pakistan (SECP) introduced an effort to
streamline business registration even further through the introduction o f a nationwide electronic platform,



`Under the Ordinance, the solution for a company under financial distress, for all practical purposes, is not rehabilitation but
liquidation. The Ordinance deals mostly with liquidationof companiesbut is limitedwith regardto corporate rehabilitation.

which will enable new businessto submit registration forms electronically. The platform enables not only
nationwide, convenient access and electronic submission o f the company reports required under the law,
but also further streamlining through electronic linkages with FBR, provincial labor departments, and the
Employees Old Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) for obtaining a tax ID and registering for sales tax, SSN,
and EOBI, respectively.

137. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goals: PRESO will support the following actions to reduce
barriers to business entry and exit:

             Strengthening competition policy framework: Based on the competition policy emphasizing
             an independent and professional CCP, under PRESO Government has notified rules which
             provide a secure source o f financing for CCP and provide adequate terms and conditions for
             the appointment o f commissioners.        Going forward, competition impact studies will be
             carried out for at least four sectors, with hearings heldby end 2009 to discuss and explore the
             public policy issues raised by the work.              Following appropriate vetting o f the
             recommendations, key actions for at least four sectors will be taken by end 2010.

              Simplifying business entry: Under PRESO, the Electronic Business registration system was
              rolled out by end-2008. Going forward, linkages would be established with other agencies,
              such as FBR and/or provincial labor departments, to streamline further by end 2009. Based
              on these efforts, a process re-engineering with other agencies, such as provincial social
              security agencies and EOBI would be pursued in order to collapse the number o f steps
              required to register a business and therefore reduce the cost and time requirements with a
              target date o f end 2010.

                                        Strengthened Financial Sector

138. Outcome goal: Lending portfolio o f banks diversified over time.

139. Issues:     The global financial crisis and, above all, the needed macroeconomic adjustment in
Pakistan, can be expected to put strain on the financial sector, threatening its soundness and stability. To
limit the impact, as well as to strengthen the banking sector so that it can withstand future stresses, the
banking sector regulation and supervision would need to be strengthened and made fully compliant with
the Basel Core Principles o f banking supervision.

140. At the moment, a significant amount o f credit risk i s borne by the banks due to their large exposure
to big groups o f companies. Facilities (both funded and non-funded) o f these groups can account up to 50
percent o f the equity o f banks. This i s because SBP had allowed banks to undertake a high credit risk
concentration by keeping the group exposure limit o f banks at 50 percent.               The outside limit
recommended by the Basel Committee i s 25 percent for a total exposure both o n and o f f balance sheet to
a single counterparty or a group o f related counterparties.

141. The practice o f extending large facilities to big groups o f companies also limits the banks from
going after a larger number o f smaller enterprises and SMEs. By limitingthe access o f new and smaller
companies to bank finance, banks create an entry barrier that is not conducive to the expansion o f the
industrial base o f Pakistan. It would, therefore, be advisable for SBP to reduce the group exposure limit
o f banks from the existing 50 percent to 25 percent in a phased manner.

142. The reduction in group exposure limits will not only diversify the portfolio o f banks and reduce
their credit risk exposure, but should also serve to motivate the large groups o f companies to diversify
their source o f borrowing as well. This is expected to induce these groups to issue their own bonds in the
debt market.

                                                    32

 143. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal:            PRESO will support the following action to
strengthen the financial sector:

               Improving banking sector regulation: To reduce the credit risk concentration o f banks,
               SBP has amended under PRESO prudential regulations to introduce a phased reduction in
               the Group exposure limit from 50 percent to 25 percent over time.

                           D.      Pillar 111: Protectingthe Poor and Vulnerable

                                     Better Targeted Social Safety Nets

 144. Outcome goal: Improved targeting and implementation o f cash transfer and safety net programs;
measured by increased coverage o f the poorest 25 percent o f the population by the Benazir Income
Support Program (BISP).

 145. Issues: About a quarter o f Pakistan families are poor, and the poor and non-poor alike remain
vulnerable to risks such as health, disability, and unemployment, and to community-wide shocks such as
natural disasters or sharp increases in the price o f food.     Fifty-six percent o f the population can be
classified as vulnerable (that is, poor or likely to become poor in the shorthedium term), with
vulnerability being higher in rural areas and among the self-employed and those employed in agriculture.

 146. The short-term challenge facing Government i s the protection o f the poor from the loss o f
purchasing power owing to high food price inflation, and from impacts o f the necessary economic
adjustment measures. Even though Pakistan has a myriad o f safety net programs targeted primarily at the
chronic poor, ranging from (unconditional) cash transfers to social care services and microfinance
programs, there is no immediate vehicle available to provide relief quickly for a large number o f families.
The existing programs have little impact on poverty and vulnerability. They are fragmented and often
duplicative, have limited coverage (about five percent o f the total population), and are poorly targeted (25
and 32 percent o f resources distributed by the Food Support Program (FSP) and Zakat, respectively, the
country's largest cash transfer programs, accrue to non-poor households). See Annex 10 for a summary
o f the social safety net system in Pakistan.

147. In addition, administrative arrangements for cash transfers, especially payment systems, are
inadequate, and implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity is low, which negatively
impacts program efficiency and the quality o f service delivery. Among the most common complaints o f
FSP beneficiaries are the costs associated with cashing program benefits, and the irregularity and
lumpiness o f benefit payments. According to data, one in 10 households experiences difficulty accessing
the funds after being approved for assistance.'    FSP beneficiaries on average need to make 1.6 visits to
the payment center to obtain their assistance, and more than one intwenty had to go three times or more.
Furthermore, one out o f every 10 beneficiaries declared to have paid a bribe to obtain their benefit at
some point, with bribes averaging 10 percent o f the transfer. Finally, weak human and technical capacity
at payment centers (that is, post offices) implies that payment reconciliation takes years resulting into
delays in updating the beneficiary lists, enhancing the efficiency o f delivery, and producing the results.

148. To strengthen the safety net systems and increase coverage, Government launched the Benazir
Income Support Program (BISP) in September 2008, with the objective to provide cash grants to the
poorest families in the country. With a budget o f Rs. 34 billion in 2008109, the program intends to cover
3.4 million families and each eligible family is to receive monthly Rs. 1,000. As such, BISP i s by far the
largest social safety net program in Pakistan and could become the core safety net in the country. The



 PakistanSafetyNet Report,World Bank, 2007.

                                                    33

budget committed for the program doubled Federal Government's spending on social safety nets to 0.6
percent o f GDP in 2008/09.'0 Furthermore, Federal Government intends to expand the BISP budget to
Rs. 65 billion in 2009110 and expand the coverage to about 5 million families. In2010/11, they expect to
cover 7 million families which comes close to covering 25 percent o f the population-the                         national
poverty headcount rate according to most recent estimates.

149. BISP would need to be improved in many ways to make it an effective safety net serving the
poorest in the country. Its targeting until recently was a serious concern: beneficiaries o f BISP (female
representatives o f families) were initially identified by Parliamentarians (Members of the National
Assembly and Senators), who then submitted an eligible list to the National Database and Registration
Authority (NADRA) for validation through its database (an ID registry o f the country, which, however,
has limited coverage o f potential beneficiaries and does not include indicators that identify the poor,
which would be essential for validation). The final eligible list o f beneficiaries was then forwarded to the
Pakistan Post for payments through money orders. In addition, there was no monitoring system to track
payments, nor a grievance redressal mechanism to correct targeting errors.

 150. Since the program has barely begun-as               o f February 20, 2009, 1.5 million submissions had been
received from Parliamentarians, and about 1million had beenverified for eligibility and payments-there
i s room to introduce corrective measures to improve targeting with the help o f an objective instrument
and build the necessary institutional capacity to deliver the benefits, and monitor progress and outcomes.
The adoption o f an objective targeting instrument-the            poverty scorecard-has      been the critical first step
to ensure the benefits reach the poor and vulnerable. Once the BISP program is targeted well, it will form
the basis for streamlining and consolidation o f similar cash transfer programs (such as Bait-U1-Maal) and
moving from a universally targeted wheat subsidy to a targeted one.

151. The poverty scorecard is underpinned by the proxy means testing methodology to improve targeting
performance and ensure easy implementation. The scorecard-based targeting will be an improvement
over the previous targeting system by providing an objective method for identifying beneficiaries
ensuring: (i)   a transparent and fair enrolment process open for all; (ii)        transparent criteria for determining
eligibility; (iii)adoption o f verification tools so that exclusion and inclusion errors are minimized and
dealt with in an open and transparent way according to well defined rules.

152. Beyond the use o f the scorecard for targeting, institutional arrangements are being designed for
managing the program which include building capacity at various levels o f Government; laying out the
roles and responsibilities o f various actors to enable accurate information collection and processing;
mechanisms for ensuring redress if there are grievances and complaints; delivering payments to
beneficiaries; and auditing and monitoring. The initial implementation step will be a test phase to build
the necessary safeguards that are necessary to realize program objectives.

153. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal: PRESO will support the following actions to initiate a
systematic and well-grounded effort to improve targeting and implementation o f BISP, which can then be
extended to other cash transfer and social safety net programs:

                Improving targeting of BISP: Under PRESO, the Government has adopted a poverty
                scorecard instrument for targeting and identification of poor families in the context o f BISP
                and notified the plan for its roll-out. This entailed a clear plan for implementation, o f its
                initial roll out as well as modalities for smooth transition out o f the current system to the
                proposed score-card approach. The retargeting o f BISP with the use o f the scorecard was

2008109.

              launched in January 2009. Going forward, the scorecard is expected to be implemented in
              all test districts and roll-out initiated in all remaining districts.

                                  StrengthenedNationalStatisticalSystem

 154. Outcome goal: More reliable and timely economic and social data for policy analysis and
formulation.

 155. Issues: Reliable and timely economic, demographic, and social data are central for any successful
poverty reduction strategy. Moreover, reliable official statistics are cornerstone o f good policy analysis,
effective economic management, and informed public debate about outcome and priorities. The Statistics
Division of the Ministryo f Finance i s the main Federal Government institution responsible for collecting,
disseminating, and quality assurance o f the data. It consists o f three departments: the Federal Bureau o f
Statistics (FBS), the Agriculture Census Organization (ACO), and the Population Census Organization
(PCO).    This structure has its weaknesses as highlighted by statistics users, including government
departments, donors, civil society, and multilateral agencies. These include the perception o f a lack o f
independence and coordination between the three departments, and concerns about integrity and quality
o f some statistics. Addressing them would strengthen the credibility, quality and reliability o f statistics.

 156. Reform strategy to reach the outcome goal:                 PRESO will support the following action to
strengthenthe statistical system:

              Strengthening autonomy of the statistical system: To improve the functioning o f national
              statistical system, the Cabinet has approved the new Statistics L a w under PRESO. The new
              law envisages merging and reorganizing FBS, ACO, PCO, and the Technical Wing into a
              new Pakistan Bureau o f Statistics (PBS). It also establishes the legal framework for PBS,
              specifying governance processes and organizational plan for the senior management. The
              aim o f the law is also to provide for the autonomy o f the new statistical organization.

                                 VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                      A.       Poverty and SocialImpacts

157. PRESO supports sustainable poverty reduction in a number o f ways. First, the proposed measures
address the recent rapid deterioration o f the economic environment which, through lower growth and
higher inflation, has adversely affected the living standards o f the poor. By ensuring a recovery o f growth
with low inflation over the medium term, Government reforms supported by PRESO create the space for
development to resume.         Second, PRESO will support measures that can be expected to enhance
Pakistan's investment climate and competitiveness. This in turn would facilitate employment creation,
economic growth and poverty reduction over time. Third, PRESO supports the development o f a well-
targeted social safety net program that delivers cash transfers to the needy. Fourth, PRESO supports
mitigation measures to ensure that poor people are shielded from major adverse impacts o f price
increases.

158. Three poverty and social impact assessments (PSIA) were carried out during PRESO preparation,
and they indicate that price increases o f food products on net buyers o f food, and, to a lesser degree, o f
fuel products, would be main concerns from the poverty impact point o f view. Electricity tariff increases
are unlikely to have any direct adverse impact on poor people. These analyses are being expanded as part
o f the ongoing work on the Pakistan Poverty Assessment Report and economic sector work on social
protection and wheat subsidy programs. A brief summary o f the PSIAs carried out i s attached as Annex
11.



                                                      35

 159. Fortunately, the recent decline in international commodity prices makes reductions in domestic
food and fuel prices currently more likely than increases, which allays the earlier mentioned concerns.
The proposedPRESO action on fuel is currently expected to benefit all households.

 160. Fuel price adjustment: The rise in domestic fuel prices on the back o f international fuel price
increases would likely reduce the purchasing power o f households and raise poverty. While international
domestic fuel prices have decreased over the past few months, they did increase during 2007108 on the
back o f international oil price increases. Therefore, the PSIA analyzed the impact o f a price increase.
 Simulations based on the 200.5106 Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey suggest that
Pakistan's domestic fuel price increases between 2005106 and July 2008 might have increased the
national poverty headcount by 2.3 to 3.2 percentage points, compared to a situation without any fuel price
increases. The lower poverty increase assumes that real household expenditures rose by 6 percent over
the period, broadly in line with macroeconomic indicators; and the higher poverty increase assumes that
household expenditures remained constant inreal terms over the period.

 161. It i s important to interpret these findings with caution. First, the analysis captures only the direct
impacts o f fuel price increases. The direction o f the indirect effects i s ambiguous. Fuel price increases
imply higher input costs for businesses and hence lower household labor incomes. But they also reduce
internal and external macroeconomic imbalances, and therefore support a return to sustainable economic
growth. In addition, households are likely to substitute away from fuel consumption, which will mitigate
the impact o f fuel price increases on poverty.          Second, a well-targeted and efficiently implemented
welfare program could have eased the poverty impact. The analysis suggests that Government could keep
the living standards o f the poor unchanged        011 average   by spending just one sixth or less o f the fuel
subsidy by adopting a simple proxy means targeting tool. Given this, Government's ongoing efforts to
improve targeting o f social protection programs are encouraging. Third, domestic fuel prices have started
to decline since October 2008 on the back o f falling international prices. Hence, the automatic fuel price
adjustment on fortnightly basis, as supported by PRESO, would lead in the current environment to
reductions in domestic prices o f petroleum products. While the imposition o f the petroleum development
levy (PDL) will keep a wedge between landed costs and retail prices, PDL rates are progressive. There
are highrates on regular gasoline, highoctane gasoline and diesel, which are used by well-off households,
and low rates on kerosene, which is largely used by poor households.

162. Electricity tariff adjustment: Concerns about the adverse impact o f electricity tariff adjustments on
poor people are unwarranted for three reasons. First, poor households are adequately covered by the
provision o f a lifeline tariff. Electricity tariffs are progressive. Tariffs o f the lowest slab, for consumption
between zero to 50 kWh, are very low, and have remained unchanged for at least five years. Average
electricity consumption in the lowest tariff slab is about 19 kWh per month, providing enough power for
four light bulbs and one fan, which is typical for households in the lower consumption quintile. Any
further tariff increases are not expected to change the lifeline tariff. Furthermore, the poorest o f the poor
have no access to electricity at all. According to the 2006107 PSLM, some 13 percent o f Pakistani
households, and 19 percent o f rural Pakistan households, have no access to electricity. Second, the main
beneficiaries o f keeping electricity tariffs below cost recovery levels are non-poor consumers.             They
accrue the bulk o f the power sector subsidy, in part because all households benefit from the l o w rates on
the first tariff slabs, irrespective o f the overall electricity consumption. Finally, in light o f the decline in
international energy prices, the elimination o f power subsides by end June 2009 is likely to require only
moderate, if any at all, electricity tariff increases.

163. Mitigation of wheat price increases: The average family in Pakistan spends about half o f total
household expenditure on food. The domestic price o f wheat, the main staple food crop in Pakistan, rose
73 percent between August 2007 and July 2008, although it remained below the level in neighboring
countries. Government uses the wheat subsidy program to stabilize the domestic market prices o f wheat
flour and to ensure consistent supply o f wheat flour at a lower price to the poor through specific outlets,


                                                       36

such as stores o f the federal utility stores cooperation.     Other interventions in 2007/08 included the
imports o f additional wheat, a complete ban on wheat exports, a ban on intra-provincial wheat movement
to curb smuggling, and an increase inthe procurement price o f wheat to create an incentive for farmers to
sell to the domestic market and to discourage smugglingand hoarding. During the first seven months o f
2008/09, Federal Government had not spent any money on wheat subsidies.

 164. Since the budget share o f wheat is larger than that o f fuel expenditure, the impact o f wheat price
increases on the poor can be expected to be more significant than fuel price increases, even though it
would boost household incomes o f net producers o f wheat, many o f which are living in rural areas.
According the Bank's preliminary estimation based on PSLM 2005106, the wheat price increase between
August 2007 and July 2008 increased the national poverty headcount rate by 3.5 percentage points.
However, the impact varied across different groups o f people.         The loss in purchasing power was
particularly severe among urban residents, landless and marginal landholders, whereas it increased among
medium and large landholders inrural areas. This analysis does not account for the provision o f subsidies
wheat through utility stores, although in any case there are concerns about the effectiveness o f this
intervention in reaching poor households.

 165. A well-targeted social safety net program would be the most cost-effective way to mitigate the
impact o f wheat price increases on the poor.       Wheat reserve fund operations could be limited to a
minimumrequired to achieve the fund's original objective o f smoothening seasonal price differences and
ensuring emergency food security. In the design o f the safety net scheme, i t would be important to take
into account that wheat price inflation affects primarily people who are net buyers o f wheat. Also, the
support provided should be temporary and flexible to reflect the temporary nature o f price shocks.

                                          B.     Fiduciary Aspects

166. Overall Fiduciary Environment: The overall fiduciary risk associated with the proposed operation
i s rated as substantial. Government's commitment to public financial management reforms is, however,
exemplified by actions already taken.            Progress has been made in terms o f the accuracy,
comprehensiveness, reliability, and timeliness o f financial and fiscal reporting; enhanced accountability
and transparency; the use o f financial information for informed decision-making; and oversight o f the use
o f public monies through risk-based audits. However, a number o f weaknesses remain and the key areas
for reform, highlighted also in the Government's PRSP-11, include the modernization o f the legal and
institutional public financial management framework; updating o f the financial and treasury rules;
strengthening o f public accountability practices; and further improving and rolling out o f the public audit
and oversight functions at sub-national levels o f government. In public procurement, several challenges
remain, including the establishment o f an effective appeals process and an effective monitoring and
evaluation system.       Since enhancing accountability, transparency, and reducing opportunities for
corruption are core elements o f improved governance and reduced fiduciary risks, public financial
management and public procurement reforms are supported by a number o f donor-funded initiatives.

167. Public Financial Management System:                 The Pakistan Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) o f December 2003 highlighted improvements in expenditure reporting and
monitoring, and stated that budget support operations disbursed and managed through Government's
financial management systems have satisfactory outcomes. However, it also underscored the need for
buildinginstitutional and human resource capacity to support the transition to full reliance on government
systems, controls, and financial reporting. It revealed weaknesses in data reliability, particularly at the
sub-national level. In accounting and financial reporting, challenges that remain to be addressed are: (i)
the creation o f internal audit units in departments to improve internal controls; and (ii)
                                                                                          finalization o f the
Controller General o f Accounts' (CGA) control over organization, staffing, and training arrangements
with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for staff reporting.

 168. Public Financial Management and Accountability Assessments (PFMAA) for the provinces o f
Balochistan, Punjab, and NWFP were completed in May 2007, and identified deficiencies in internal
audit and controls, and budget credibility.      These assessments were based on the Public Financial
Management Performance Measurement Framework, which was used to rate the existing arrangements
against international best practice.    Reform strategies are being formulated to bridge these gaps. A
federal-level P F M A A is also planned. A federal level P F M A A i s also ongoing.

 169. In addition, a PEPFM review has been recently carried out. The review concluded, inter alia, that
expenditure effectiveness would be fostered by a concerted review and revision o f government business
processes to eliminate redundant procedures in expenditure commitment and payments, particularly for
the development budget.

 170. Government has taken action to enhance accountability and effectiveness o f public expenditures.
For better accounting and financial reporting, the Project for Improvement to Financial Reporting and
Auditing (PIFRA) has supported a new accounting model, which has introduced an IMF GFS-compliant
Chart o f Accounts (CoA). As o f 2007/08 the federal, provincial, and district governments have prepared
their budgets based on the new CoA. An automated budget compilation, accounting, and financialifiscal
reporting system i s being implemented country-wide. The financial management systems o f the federal
government and NWFP and Punjab provinces, including the district accounts and finance offices, have
been fully automated. Sindh and Balochistan are expected to complete the automation during 2008109.
The next step will be to provide system connectivity to all 140 line departments to support the monitoring
o f budget execution on a real time basis.

 171. Government has taken action to enhance accountability and effectiveness o f public expenditures.
For better accounting and financial reporting, the Project for Improvement to Financial Reporting and
Auditing (PIFRA) has supported a new accounting model, which has introduced an IMF GFS-compliant
Chart o f Accounts (CoA) for the general government. As o f 2007/08, the federal, provincial, and district
governments have prepared their budgets based on the new CoA. An automated budget compilation,
accounting, and financial/fiscal reporting system is being implemented country-wide.          The financial
management systems o f the federal government, NWF, Sindh, and Punjab provinces, including the
district accounts and finance offices, have been fully automated.           Implementation in Balochistan is
currently in progress, and completion o f the automation process i s expected during 2009/10. The next
step also being taken is to provide system connectivity to all 140 line departments to support the
monitoring o f budget execution on a real time basis as well as cater for the financial management
requirements for the 133 district headquarter Tehsil Municipal Authorities (TMAs).

172. Timeliness o f end-year financial reporting has improved at the federal level and in all provinces and
districts owing to the introduction o f the automated budget management system. Within 12 to15 days of
the end o f each month, civil accounts are prepared and presented to the Ministry o f Finance.          The
reliability o f these reports has also improved with material reductions in un-reconcilable differences and
the elimination o f suspense accounts. Reconciliation levels, except in Balochistan, which is yet to adopt
computerization, have improved to about 97 and 98 percent for receipts and expenditures, respectively,
and 99 percent for suspense and inter-governmental accounts. Year-end financial statements have been
prepared on the IPSAS basis by the federal government and all provinces. District governments are also
transitioning to this form o f reporting as part o f Government's international financial reporting regime.
Pakistan is moving ahead well in compliance with international standards and the timeliness and readiness
o f annual financial statements for audit has improved to an average o f eight months after the end o f the
fiscal year compared to more than 15 months prior to 2006/07.

173. To enhance effectiveness o f external audit, a risk-based audit methodology compliant with
international standards has been rolled out. It was applied to federal government accounts in 2005/06,
and to the financial statements o f provinces and some districts in 2006/07.         The 2007/08 financial


                                                    38

statements o f provinces are currently under audit and may be certified by the Auditor General and
presented to their respective Governors within 9-10 months o f the end o f the fiscal year, compared to 18-
24 months in prior years. Introduction o f an Audit Management Information System i s also underway to
enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and control o f audit processes.

 174. Legislative oversight across the federal and provincial governments has been mixed, largely due to
absence o f Public Accounts Committees (PACs), weak capacity, and non-functioning o f the Zila
Accounts Committees at the district level. With a large audit backlog o f un-reviewed audit reports and
audited accounts due to recurring interruption o f legislative oversight and the poor quality o f audit
reports, efforts to strengthen the capacities o f PACs and streamline their review process have been
initiated. After elections, strong PACs have emerged at federal level, Punjab, N W F P and Sindh, and are
working to reinforce accountability through regular reviews o f audit reports and audited accounts.
Institutionalization o f the oversight function in district governments, however, remains a key challenge in
the medium term to ensure enhanced accountability at the sub-provincial level.

 175. Procurement: The 2000 Pakistan Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) highlighteda
weak regulatory framework governing public procurement, and called for institutional and procedural
reforms. CPAR revealed that Pakistan does not have a coherent law that establishes standards and an
effective legal system that protects against collusion and corruption inthe award o f government contracts.
CPAR recommended the establishment o f a new and modern procurement rules conforming to
international best practice.

 176. A Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) was created in 2002 with powers to formulate
public procurement legislation applicable to federal government line departments, state-owned
enterprises, and semi-autonomous organizations. N e w public procurement rules were notified in 2004,
and they depart from the old system in two important ways: they require posting o f all bid notices on the
PPRA's website, and prohibit post-bid negotiations. Moving forward, the development o f monitoring and
reporting mechanisms, and the creation o f an effective appeals procedure to handle complaints in a timely
and transparent manner will be critical for effective implementation o f PPRA rules. PPRA rules are
widely recognized as the rules to follow for procurement, and Sindh and Balochistan have adopted the
rules to apply to all procurements o f the provincial and district governments. Punjab is in the process o f
implementing a procurement reform strategy, and technical assistance is being provided to N W F P on
amendment o f its existing procurement law and making it consistent with international best practice.

177. Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank: An IMF Safeguards Assessment o f the State Bank o f
Pakistan was conducted in 2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities, in particular relating to SBP's
financial statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable central bank standards.
However, since 2001 the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have been
mitigated.    SBP is currently producing financial statements consistent with international accounting
standards and formats. An independent review o f SBP's internal audit function has been completed and
the recommendations implemented. SBP has also established a process o f reconciling data reported to the
IMF, and implemented guidelines to prohibit operations that pledge or encumber reserves, or place
restrictions on, or otherwise impair the availability of, foreign exchange reserves outside the authorized
framework.

                                      C.      Disbursement and Audit

178. Borrower and Credit Agreement: The proposed Credit would be made to the Islamic Republic o f
Pakistan, represented by the Federal Ministry o f Finance. The IDA credit proceeds, amounting to the
equivalent o f US$500 million, would be transferred to the Federal Government in accordance with the
terms o f the Financing Agreement (FA).



                                                     39

179. Funds Flow Arrangement:           The Government o f Pakistan will identify a Foreign Exchange
Account with SBP, which forms part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves, into which the
proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed on a single tranche basis upon Credit effectiveness. The Rupees
equivalent o f the funds in the Account will, within two working days, be transferred into the Consolidated
Fundo f the Government o f Pakistan (Account No. 1-Non-Food) held with SBP, which is used to finance
budgetary expenditures.

180. Disbursements: Disbursements from the Consolidated Fund for activities to be financed under the
program by the Government o f Pakistan will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no special
procurement requirement shall be needed. The proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to
finance expenditures in the negative list as defined in Appendix 1 o f the FA. Ifany portion o f the Credit
i s used to finance ineligible expenditures as so defined in the FA, IDA will require the Government to
promptly, upon notice from IDA, refund the amount equal to the amount o f the said payment to the IDA.
Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request will be cancelled from the credit.

181. Accounting and Assurance Requirements for the Credit: SBP, on behalf o f Government, will
continue to maintain an appropriate accounting system in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. For this Credit, since no special fiduciary arrangements are required, no additional assurance
requirements in the form o f a formal audit will apply, in the light o f the fiduciary environment as
established with the management o f foreign exchange reserves by SBP as well as continuing
improvements in the financial management systems in government.             However, within 45 days o f
disbursement o f the credit by IDA, the Finance Secretary, Ministry o f Finance, will provide a written
confirmation to IDA certifying the receipt o f the Rupees equivalent o f the credit into the Consolidated
Fund Account o f the Government o f Pakistan, the date o f the receipt, and the exchange rate applied to
translate the credit currency into Rupees.

                                      D.       EnvironmentalAspects

182. The policies and measures supported by the proposed operation could be potentially associated with
both positive and negative environmental effects. The reduction in fuel subsidies could lower the demand
for petroleum products and thereby improve air quality and subsequently human health. A reduction in
power sector subsidies could create fiscal space to invest in fuel-efficient physical infrastructure with
attendant positive environmental effects. However, poor households could respond to increases in fuel
prices by shifting towards the use o f biomass as fuel, which has a documented causal relation with
respiratory illnesses, particularly among poor children and women.

183. The environmental effects o f tax policy reform are ambiguous and would depend on the treatment
provided by the reformed tax policy to environmentally benign goods and services relative to
environmentally damaging goods and services. It i s not anticipated that the tax reform, which aims at
reducing exemptions, would provide incentives that favor the consumption o f environmental "bads".      On
the other hand, the inclusion o f "green taxes" could be associated with positive environmental effects.
The direction and magnitude o f the tax reform's environmental effects will be better understood once the
details o f the tax reform are more clearly defined.

184. Pakistan's legislative, regulatory, and environmental management frameworks are largely in place
to improve environmental performance.           The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 is the
cornerstone o f the country's environmental legislation, while the National Environmental Policy (NEP)
adopted in 2005 provides the overall framework to promote sustainable development. However, the
enforcement and implementation of existing policies and regulations needs to be strengthened.

185. A Strategic Country Environmental Analysis (SCEA) on Pakistan was prepared by the Bank in
2006. According to it, Pakistan's main environmental challenges are linked to environmental health,


                                                    40

particularly outdoor and indoor air pollution. Since the program's supported policies are expected to be
associated with positive and negative environmental effects, the Bank is undertaking technical assistance
and analytical work aimed at enhancing the institutional capacity o f environmental agencies, particularly
the Ministry o f Environment, the Pakistan EPA, and the provincial environmental protection departments.

                                  E.      Implementationand Monitoring

186. Coordination of Reform Program Implementation: Successful coordination o f the proposed
program will require effective coordination among various ministries, SBP and agencies, and between the
authorities and the Bank.        The Ministry o f Finance will coordinate the PRESO agenda within
Government. The Governor o f SBP will lead the policy agenda applicable to SBP. Further, Secretaries
o f ministries and heads o f agencies involved in PRESO will be responsible for coordinating reforms in
each ministrylagency.

187. Bank's Monitoring Arrangements:            The reform program sets out qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks and targets for 2008/09. The Bank team will monitor and follow up on progress, carry out
regular consultations with the executing federal ministries, and assess implementation o f policy measures.
The follow-up and monitoring will be done in the context o f quarterly macroeconomic assessments, and a
possible separate programmatic operation to support the latter two fiscal years o f the medium-term policy
framework o f the authorities.

                                     F.       Risks and Risk Mitigation

188. The risks to the proposed operation are high. Political, economic, implementation, and security
riskscould results inprolonged economic instability:


      0       Political risks: Attaining a sharp reduction in the fiscal and current account deficits will
              require commitment from the political leadership.       The scale and speed o f the required
              economic policy response to the macroeconomic imbalances could intensify social tensions
              inpart o f the population, but no adjustment would ultimately impose even greater economic
              and social costs.      The sustainability o f the program could also be undermined by
              disagreement among Pakistan's main political parties on other issues, including judicial
              reform and the war on terror.        The authorities' draft medium-term policy framework
              attached to this package mitigates this risk and the risk o f policy reversals by signaling the
              authorities' upfront commitment to a medium-term adjustment path.

              Economic risks:       On the external side, a renewed rise in international energy and
              commodity prices, a reduction in foreign remittances especially from the countries o f the
              Middle East, and a further deterioration in the world economy and international financial
              markets could weaken the export sector, reduce household transfers, lower capital inflows,
              limit economic growth and reduce flexibility for policy reforms. Owing to these reasons, the
              external imbalances may continue to widen despite the short-term measures taken. On the
              internal side, the inability o f Government to restore fiscal and external balance as agreed
              could reduce business and consumer confidence. This could cause a fundamental shift in
              market expectations and a loss o f confidence at home and abroad, leading to a sudden
              reversal o f financial assets held in Pakistan stock and bond markets. This could generate a
              vicious cycle between weakening financial markets, stalling economic activity, and a
              worsening fiscal position. The IMF Stand-By Arrangement will mitigate these risks by
              committing the authorities to fiscal and current account deficit targets.

      0       Implementation risks: Stringent implementation o f the reforms will be critical for success.
              The implementation o f reforms may be slower than planned because o f significant
              institutional capacity constraints. Other projects and initiatives financed by the Bank and


                                                    41

development partners have supported the strengthening o f a number o f institutions which
mitigates the risk, including SBP, the Auditor General o f Pakistan, the Controller General of
Accounts and PPRA.        FBR reform initiatives are supported through the Bank's Tax
Administration Reform Project and Tax Policy Program.

Security risks: There is a risk o f deterioration in the security and law and order situation,
which could shift Government's focus from economic matters. This risk cannot be directly
mitigated. P E S O would rely on the Government's commitment to improved security, as
confirmed by the renewed efforts to end militancy intribal areas.

                                LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


 DearMr.Zoellick,

 1.      Iamwritingtorequest, onbehalfofourGovernmentoftheIslamic RepublicofPakistan
 (Government), the Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (PRESO) of US$SOOmillion to
 support the implementation of Pakistan's Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II). This
 Letter of DevelopmentPolicy sets out our Government's key economic policy actions under PRSP-I1
 over 2008/09 to be supported by PRESO, as well as our planned medium-term reform path through
 201O/'l1.

 2.      The overarching objective of PRSP-I1 is to steer Pakistan back on the path of sustained and
 broad-basedeconomic growth, to createjobs and to reduce poverty. This requires a prolongedperiodof
 macroeconomic stability, financial discipline and consistently transparent policies that place poverty
 reductionat the centre of the country's overall economic policies. These policies are based on a three-
 pronged approach: regainingand maintainingmacroeconomic stability; enhancing competitiveness; and
 protectingthe poor and vulnerable.

 3.      We aim to achieve the following overall outcomes: (i)the fiscal deficit reduced from 7.4 percent
 of GDP in 2007/08 to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09, 3.3 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 3.0 percent in
 2010/11; (ii)the current account deficit reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP in
 2008/09, 5.7 percent of GDP in 2009/10 and 4.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11; (iii)improved doing
 business indicators; and (iv) improved access to social safety nets for the poorest 25 percent of the
 population. Our reformplansto reachthese outcomes are outlinedbriefly inthe following paragraphs.




 RegainingandMaintainingMacroeconomicStability:

 4.      After a consumption lead strong economic performance for about five years, Pakistan
 experienced a significant terms of trade shock in 2007/08 in the form of increased international oil and
 food commodity prices. Owing to inadequate policy response to this shock, the economic situation
 deterioratedrapidly and fiscal and balanceof paymentsimbalanceswidened substantially. Our incoming
 Government recognized the need for strong resolve to correct the macroeconomic imbalances and to
 smooth the adjustment process and to avoid unnecessary cost to the economy and Pakistan's population.
 In response to this severe challenge, we put in place a home-grown stabilization               program
 and accomplished adjustment           actions   including      revisions   in    petroleum prices and
                                                    1

electricity tariffs to reduce burden on the budget; the increase in the standard rate of the General Sales
Tax by one percentagepoint to 16 percent; significant streamliningof public expenditures to curb public
subsidies and wasteful public expenditures; and monetary policy tightening to fight inflation. Our main
priority for PRSP-I1is to continuethe policies requiredfor macroeconomic stability. It is on the basis of
asound macroeconomicframeworkthat assumptions andtargets of all policieswill be set. Regainingand
maintainingmacroeconomic stability entails a focus on these outcomes: increased revenue mobilization,
adjusted fuel prices and electricity tariffs, improved efficiency of public spending, and strengthened
government debt management.

5.        Increased revenue mobilization: A sustainable improvement in our resource envelope has to
come throughhighertax revenue mobilization. Pakistan's tax collection stands only at around 10percent
of GDP, which is below many of Pakistan's peer emerging economies. To ensure adequate public
fundingfor our development priorities, we aim to increaseoveralltax collection by 0.6 percentof GDP in
2008/09, 0.8 percent of GDP in 2009/10, and 0.9 percent of GDP in 2010/11. The rise in tax collection
has to go hand in hand with improvements in the structural properties of the tax system. This includes
making the tax system buoyant, fair and broad-based, with minimum distortions and exemptions.
Achievingthese objectivesrequires reformsof bothtax administrationandtax policy.

6.        Regarding tax administration, our Government has approved the establishment of a new
integratedtax administration on functional basis, and FBR has implementedthe relatedtop management
changes. In addition, FBR has established task forces to pursue unregisteredentities, non-filers and stop
filers, and has launched the preparation of risk-based compliance strategies. Furthermore, FBR has
selected the Large Taxpayer Unit in Lahore as pilot site for the new Integrated Tax Systems based on
System 2009. Going forward, FBR will adopt a comprehensive business process re-engineeringstrategy
and adjust all business processes fully consistent with the new integrated organization. The business
processeswill make effective use of the System 2009, which will be fully deployed in headquarterand all
field offices of FBR, and modified on an ongoingbasis in line with changes in business processesandtax
polices. We will also increase significantly risk-based audit coverage, ensuring rigorous quality
assurance, coupled with application of punitive measures in case of tax evasion. These compliance
measureswill ensure significant increases in businessregistration, reductionin stop filers and reduction in
arrears.

7.        Complementing changes on tax administration, our Government is committed to pursue
substantial reforms on tax policy. The main untapped potential for tax collection lies with the General
Sales Tax (GST). Our Government has approved the policy proposal to amend legislation of domestic
indirecttaxes to ensure a comprehensivetaxationof goods and services in the form of aValue Added Tax
(VAT). To ensure adequate tax collection for the current fiscal year, FBR will start taking measures in
February 2009 to limit revenue leakage. In June 2009, our Government will legislate amendments of
domestic tax laws for 2009/10. They includereductions in exemptions and zero-ratingsof the Sales Tax
Act, and simplifications in the tax rate schedules, rationalizationof withholding taxes, and reductions in
exemptions of the Income Tax Act. Tax definitions and procedures for income tax, sales tax and federal
excises will also beharmonized.

8.        In parallel to this effort, we will draft a new VAT law. In March 2009, we will review the
options to deal with the treatment of services under a new VAT regime. Subsequently, we will present
some of the optionsto the provinces for their evaluation and concurrence. We expect to obtain approval
o f the new, comprehensive VAT law in time for operation for the 2010/11 Budget. We also intend to
consider incentives for the sub-national government to increase their own-source revenue bases. Our

Government also intends to make the revenue division of the Ministry of Finance fully functional to
facilitatesound fiscal policy making.

9.       Adjusfmenf of fuel prices and power far@:       The elimination of public subsidies for fuel and
electricity is a central part o f moving Government's finances onto a sustainable footing. Strengthening
the financial healthof the energy sector through cost-recovery pricing will also help to attract the much
neededprivate investment into the sector. Our Government already eliminatedfully petroleumsubsidies
by December 2008. In January 2009, Government has introducedthe monthly automatic adjustment of
consumer fuel prices to pass through changes in internationalprices, while at the same time safeguarding
the collection o f a minimum level of petroleum development levies to compensate for tax revenue
shortfalls on the back of lower fuel prices. Going forward, our Government will not introduce any fuel
subsidies.

10.      Our Government will also eliminatefully electricity subsidies by end-June2009. To achievethis
objective, we have adopted and started to implementa plan in January 2009 consistent with the 2008/9
budget. Our Government has already introduced the monthly determination of the fuel adjustment
surcharge in electricity tariffs, and will from January 2009 onwards notify the new consumer tariffs
within 15 days of their determination or re-determination, By end March 2009, our Government will
adopt a plan for eliminating the inter-corporatecircular debt. Going forward, no power sector subsidies
will be introduced. Our Government is fully committed to protectingthe poor from negative impacts of
price increases.

1 1.     Improved efficiency of public spending: Strengthening the efficiency of public spending is an
importantaspect of the fiscal reforms. One pillar for sound fiscal policies is the FiscalResponsibilityand
Debt Limitation Law (FRDL). Due to the adverse situation in 2007/08 and 2008/09, Government could
not comply fully with this Law. Going forward, we will comply fully with all provisions o f FRDL,
includingmaintaininga revenue deficit o f zero, and maintainingannual social and poverty-relatedpublic
spendingat no less than 4.5 percent of GDP.

12.      We have already consolidated our public sector development program (PSDP) by 20 percent to
ensure consistency of the development priorities of our new Government, and to reduce the size of the
PSDPthrow-forward in 2008/09 by at least9 months. To facilitatethe timely completionof development
schemes and increase the space for the adoption o f new development priorities, we intend to review the
PSDP portfolio for further consolidation going forward. Our Government also envisages additional
measures to enhance the quality of public expenditures. Any projects that were deferred as part of the
2008/09 PSDP consolidation will only be re-included into the PSDP if projects with similar financial
outlays are dropped.. A system to monitor the lapse-time at each processing stage of government
payments will be established and, where feasible, parallel payment processing implemented. Fiscal
impact assessments of all new policies and development projects will be made mandatoryfrom 2010/11
onwards.

13.      Our Government intends to strengthen public financial management by adopting medium-term
budget planning. Such a Medium-Tern Budget Framework (MTBF) will provide ministries the space
and flexibility they need to formulate, plan, and implement policiesthat focus on public service delivery
or output. After testing the system successfully in selectedministries on a pilot basis, our Government
has expandedthe MTBF to all federal ministries,andprovidedeach line ministries with arevisedBudget
Call Circularalong with three-year indicativeceilings as partof the 2009/10 budget preparation. We also
planto makethe 2009/10 budgetoutput-based.

14.     Another ingredient to sound public financial management is reliable cash flow forecastingand
efficient cash balance management. To achieve this objective, we have made the use of assignment
accounts by ministries and autonomous agencies fully operational for budget expenditures. During
2009/10, our Government envisages to close any other bank accounts and to sweep the remaining
balancesto AccountNo. 1. By 2010/11, the treasury single account is expectedto be fully operationalfor
development and recurrent spending, the end-week cash balance managed in accordance with the target
balance, and daily forecasts initiated for those entities account for 90 percent of overall cash flows. In
addition, our Government intends to clear inter-corporate debt involving state-owned enterprises in
2009/10, andprevent the accumulationof new arrears in 2010/11.

15.      Public procurement is an importantpart ofgood governanceand transparency in the use of public
funds. Our Government has already amendedthe public procurementrules to ensure that contract awards
over Rs. 50 million are postedon the website ofthe Public Procurement RegulatoryAuthority.

16.     Strengthened Government domestic debt management: Prudent debt management policy was
one key factor behind Pakistan's economic recovery early in this decade. And the imprudent large-scale
Government borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was one key factor behind the economic
crisis in 2007/08. Our Government is committedto reducethe stock of government debt to SBP and to
ensure public borrowing is consistent with sound monetary and fiscal policy. We will ensure that the
2009/10 and 2010/11 budgets are consistent with the FRDL. This includes, among other provisions,that
annual public guarantees be at or below 2 percent of GDP, and public debt as percent of GDP is reduced
annually by 2.5 percent from 2009/10 onwards. To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive medium-
term debt strategy will be adopted in 2009/10, and implemented subsequently, including a plan to phase
out debt owed to SBP.

17.     Despite the increase in domestic debt in 2007/08, our Government relied little on market-based
funding, which indicates important shortcomings of the government securities market. In order to
improvethe credibility and predictability of the PakistanInvestment Bond (PIB) market, the Ministry of
Finance amended rules defining roles and decision-makingrights for PIB issuance and issued related
instructionsto SBP. In addition, our Governmentpublishedin early January 2009 a credible calendar for
PIB auctions for January to June 2009. We intendto adhere to this calendar, and provide an update in
April for the last quarter of this fiscal year. Such publishedannual calendars with quarterly updates will
be continued in the next fiscal years. Goingforward, we envisage reforming the primary dealer system to
improveparticipationand competitive bidding at auctions and the development of the secondary market,
with the ultimateobjectiveto moveto market-basedPIB issuance.

18.     Our Government is also conscious of the need to reform the retail debt program. After an
inadvertent under-forecastingof debt-servicing cost by the Central Directorate of National Savings
(CDNS) during 2006/07 and 2007/08, we have now gathered complete data on outstanding and early
encashment of Defense Savings Certificates due to mature in 2008/09 and 2009/10. Similar data will be
                                                     4

collected in the next fiscal years. The reliability of debt-servicing forecasts will also be strengthened
throughthe introductionof informationtechnology.

EnhancingCompetitiveness:

19.      Improvingthe competitivenessof an economy requiresaction on many fronts. The country must
ensure a stable macroeconomicenvironment, upgrade its infrastructure, strengthen its human resources,
make its institutionsresponsiveto changingrequirements, and take other steps to reduce the cost of doing
business. As part of this agenda, our Government's strategy for building a more competitive economy
aims at reducedbarriers to competition, better functioning of labor markets, and a strengthened financial
sector.

20.      Reduced barriers to competition: Government set up in 2007 the Competition Commission of
Pakistan (CCP) in order to monitor the state of competition, weed out practices that interfere with
contestability, and generally ensure that the economy continues to develop in line with market-based
principles. To ensure the adequate functioning of the CCP, the Government notified CCP rules in early
January 2009 providingthe terms and conditionsof CCP members, and an automatic source of financing.
One sign for the risingreputation of CCP as an independent and even-handed agency will be the number
of the investigations conducted and concluded by it. Going forward, our Government will be holding
hearings on sectoral competition assessments by CCP, and implement actions to promote competition in
these sectors basedon the findings ofthe assessments.

21.      Many domestic companies are affectedby today's difficult economic climate. This highlightsthe
needto adopt a modern system for corporaterehabilitationand liquidation. By end 2009, the Government
intends to submit to Parliament the Insolvency Act, which includes rehabilitation. Going forward, we
expect to submitto Parliamentthe CompaniesAct to establisha modemcorporatelaw infrastructure.

22.      Ease of business entry is an important aspect of competitivemarkets. Recently, the Security and
Exchange Commission Pakistan (SECP) rolled out an electronic platform for the business registration
system. Going forward, we intend to link this platform to other agencies, such as FBR, and undertake a
business re-engineering to reduce substantially the number of steps and time required to register a
business.

23.     Better functioning labor markets: A competitive economy requires a well-functioningmarket
for labor. Yet, labor regulation in Pakistanis more pervasivethan the ones in neighboringcountries and
peer emerging economies. As a consequence, Pakistani employers tend to rely more on temporary
workers and few formaljobs are created with economic growth. Our Government intends to pass and
implement the Employment and Service Conditions Act (ESCA) aimed at consolidating a number of
related laws and increasing flexibility in the labor market. We will also notify rules and regulations for
ESCA and the Occupational Safety and Health Act and issue to provinces model regulations for
inspections.

24.     Strengthenedfinancial sector: The global financial turmoil and difficult domestic economic
situationhas increasedthe vulnerabilities to the soundness and stability ofthe bankingsector. Inview of
the need for improved banking sector regulation, SBP has amended prudential regulations to introducea
phasedreduction inthe group credit exposure limit from 50 percent to 25 percent over time, which is the
outside limit recommended by the Basel Committee. The group exposure limit will be reduced to 45
percent by December 2009, and further reduced to 40 percent by December 2010, 35 percent by
                                                     5

December 2011, 30 percent by December 2012 and 25 percent by December 2013. By supportingthe
diversificationo fthe lendingportfolio of banks, this measureis expectedto reducetheir credit risk.

Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable:

25.      About a quarter of Pakistan's households are poor, and they remain vulnerable to the elevated
level in prices of food and other basic consumption items. To mitigatethe adverse impactof high cost of
livingon the poorandvulnerable, our safety nets would needto be strengthenedand expanded.

26.     Better targeted social safety net: Pakistan has a number of safety net programs, ranging from
cash transfers to socialcare services and microfinanceprograms, but these programs have little impact on
poverty and vulnerability. They are fragmentedand often duplicative, have limited coverage (about five
percent of the total population) and are poorly targeted. With the aim to provide relief to the poor and
vulnerable in the face of high pricesof the essential commodities, we have launched in autumn 2008 the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) with an initial allocation of Rs. 34 billion to be disbursed
amongst the target families. The program envisages cash grant of Rs. 1,000 per month (about USD13)to
each qualifying family. BISP is intendedto compensate economically vulnerablefamilies for the erosion
of their purchasing power and to ameliorate their conditions by supplementing their sources of income
through direct cash assistance. To ensure that the public resources allocated for BISP reach the poorest
25 percent of the population, an objective, reliable and simple targeting instrument is critical. Our
Government has adoptedthe scorecard as the new targeting instrument for BISP and notified the roll-out
plan. The roll-out was launched in end January 2009. We envisage that the scorecard will be
implemented in all test districtsand its roll-out initiatedin all remainingdistricts during2009.

27.     Strengthened National Statistics: In order to assess whether our poverty reduction strategy is
successful, and to make appropriate adjustments inthe strategy, we require reliable and timely economic
and social data for policy analysis and formulation. Our Cabinet Division is processing a new Statistics
Law aimed at strengtheningthe autonomy and functioningof the nationalstatisticalsystem.

28.     In conclusion, Iwould like to reiteratethe commitmentof our Government to all these reforms,
and Itrust that this request for World Bank support for their implementationwill receive your favorable
consideration.

                                           March 2,2009

This note provides the IMF staffs assessmentof Pakistan's macroeconomic developments
and prospects as background for the Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation
policy loan beingconsidered by the Executive Board o fthe World Bank on March 26. The
assessment is based on the findings o f the February 2009 IMF missionto Islamabad and
Dubai that conductedthe discussions with the Pakistani authorities on the FirstReview under
the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA)andthe 2009 Article IV Consultation.

RecentDevelopmentsand Performanceunder the SBA Program

Economic developments in Pakistan since the SBA was approved on November 24,2008
have been favorable.


        The exchange rate has beenbroadly stable, with the State Bank o f Pakistan (SBP)
        intervening on the buying side o f the interbank foreign exchange market. As a result,
        the international reserves position has strengthened significantly (gross reserves
        amounted to $6.7 billion on February 23).

        There was a strong positive response from the T-bill market to the 200-basis points
        increase in the central bank discount rate inmid-November, allowing the government
        to retire some o f its debt to the SBP. T-bill auctions through end-February have been
        consistently oversubscribed, with wide participation of banks, and interest rates on
        T-bills came down from 14percent (weightedaverage) inmid-January to
        12.98 percent at the most recent session (February 25).

        There has also been a gradual reflow o f deposits into the banking system.

        Headline inflation declined markedly to 20.5 percent in January, due to lower food
        and energy prices, but year-on-year core inflation remains highat 19percent, despite
        a decline inthe month-on-monthcore inflation rate.

        Inmid-December, the authorities removedthe stock marketprice floor which had
        been inplace for 3% months. Subsequently, stock prices dropped sharply, but the
        decline moderated inearly January. Since then, the market has fluctuated in line with
        economic prospects and developments in international equity markets.

        All the quantitative performance criteria through end-December 2008 were observed.

    Through December, the budget registered a revenue shortfall that was compensated
    by expenditure restraint.


0   Despite the improved confidence, credit and broadmoney growth have been slower
    than expected. Specifically, private sector credit growth, at 13 percent on an annual
    basis, has been lower owing to both lower demand from corporates and an increase in
    lenders' risk aversion.


0   Structural conditionality has generally been observed, although there is scope for
    improvement insome areas.

            A contingency plan for handlingproblem private banks has been prepared.

    0       A committee to review the operational autonomy o fthe SBP has been
            established.


    0       A tax administration reform plan has beenpreparedwhich comprises key
            reforms, such as the integration o f the income tax and sales tax departments
            and the replacement of the current general sales tax with a broad-based VAT.
            The authorities have requested technical assistance from the Fundto help with
            the designofthe VAT law, the revisions inthe income tax legislation, andthe
           possible introduction o f a carbon tax.


    0       Electricity tariffs have beenreviewed (with the World Bank) and it has been
            agreed that a 4 percent increase, to be implementedbetween February and
            June, would suffice to reach the cost recovery level, giventhe recent
            substantial drop inthe price o f furnace oil.

            The SBP has stopped the direct provision o f foreign exchange for furnace oil
            on February 1,2009, as agreed under the program.


0  Progress has also been made toward the end-March 2009 benchmarks under the
   program.


    0      The fiscal program includes additional spending on the social safety net.

           Inlate January, the authorities andthe World Bank agreed on reforming the
           Benazir Income Support Program and introduce a scorecard for the
           identification o f poor households.


    0      The authorities have accelerated the preparation o f aplan to deal with the
           circular debt issue (inter-corporate debt in the energy sector).

Outlook

Since the SBA program was agreed inOctober, the world economic outlook has deteriorated
significantly. This deterioration i s likely to affect Pakistan's economy through several
channels:


        Domestic activity i s likely to be weaker than originally envisaged inthe program.
        Large-scale manufacturingoutput has dropped, and there has been a significant
        decline in exports. Preliminaryprojections for agricultural output in 2008/09 show
        that increases inrice and cotton crops, and the prospects o f a large wheat crop, would
        offset a decline in sugar cane production.

        Lower activity i s having an adverse impact on fiscal revenue.

        Falling food and energy prices and the lower economic activity should continue to
        exert downward pressure on headline inflation. Under conservative assumptions,
        year-on-year headline inflation would decline to 10percent by end-2008/09
        (compared with 20 percent inthe program), and to 6% percent by end-2009110.

        The external current account has also improved, but the outlook is fragile owing to
        the recent decline in exports. The projected outcome for the external current account
        through end-2008109 i s slightly better than envisaged inthe program because a
        marked decline in imports i s expected to outweigh the weaker export performance.
        The financial account surplus is now expectedto be somewhat lower than originally
        projected, due mainly to lower than envisaged inflows of private capital. The overall
        external balance for 2008/09 i s now projected to be better than programmed by about
        $500 million. This outlook, however, is subject to significant downside risks,
        especially ifthe drop in exports continues and remittances decline.

Key Challengesand Policy Issues

As noted above, the downturn inthe world economy poses significant downside risks to
economic activity and the external position. The authorities recognize that, given financing
constraints, the scope for countercyclical policies i s limited and that consolidating economic
and financial stability remains the principal challenge faced by the authorities. The fiscal
program and the monetary policy stance remainthe key policy tools to consolidate stability.


        The fiscal outlook for the remainder o f2008/09 is likely to be affected by shortfalls in
        revenue and foreign budget financing. The authorities remain committed to the
        program target o f a deficit o f Rs. 562 billion, equivalent to 4.3 percent of the revised
        GDP for 2008109. The tax revenueshortfall is expected to be partly offset by higher
        collections from the Petroleum Development Levy, as well as stepped-upauditing,
        and the authorities are committed to restraining expenditures, as needed, to achieve

                                              4


        the budget deficit target. External budget financing in2008/09 is now projectedto be
        lower than expected, mainly reflecting a shortfall in external privatization proceeds.

        Pakistan needs additional external resoirces in order to create fiscal space for higher
        development and social spending.A donor conference, tentatively scheduled for
        MarcWApril2009, will provide an opportunity to seek additional external assistance.

        The cumulative 500-basis points discount rate hike in2008 has resulted intighter
        monetary conditions. As inflation remains elevated, it i s premature at this stage to
        reduce interest rates, but rates may be lowered later inthe year, provided that
        inflation continues to decline and the government avoids SBP financing o f the
        budget.

        The exchange rate should remain flexible, with market interventionlargely aimed at
        meetingthe international reserves targets.

        Pakistan's banks have weathered the crisis well so far, but there are increasing risks
        from the deteriorating economic outlook. Non-performing loans have risen to 9.1
        percent in December 2008, from 7.7 percent in June. Stress tests by the FSAP update
        mission and by the authorities show that the a deterioration in credit quality is the
        main risk.Accordingly, the authorities need to continue to monitor developments in
        the bankingsystem very closely.

Medium-termoutlook

A significant increase inrevenues as a share o f GDP remains the cornerstone o fthe
medium-term framework, but the economic downturn has led to a revision o f the
medium-termpath for fiscal and external adjustment. Growth is projectedto recover
gradually to 4.0 percent next year and 7.0 percent by 2013/14. Headline inflation i s expected
to decline rapidly to 6% percent by 2009/10. The external current account deficit is envisaged
to narrow to 4% percent o f GDP in2009/10 and to decline fbrther to more sustainable levels
by 2013/14. A significant increase inthe revenue-to-GDP ratio will create fiscal space for
higher public investment and sustainable growth. However, the room for increasing the
public investment-to-GDP ratio may be more limitedthan previously assessed, as there i s a
need to ensure that the outlook allows for an adequate increase in outlays on poverty
reduction.

Status of IMFRelations

As noted, a SDR 5.169 billion ($7.6 billion) SBA was approved on November 24,2008. The
staff hasjust completed the discussions on the FirstReview o f the SBA and the 2009
Article IV Consultation, which are scheduled to be considered by the IMF Executive Board
inlate-March2009.

                ANNEX 10. Overviewof SocialProtectioninPakistan


PublicProgramsand Expenditures

Until recently, overall public social protection expenditures remained low and biased
toward social security in Pakistan. Currently, the country spends about 1.4 percent o f
GDP on social protection (comprising safety net and pension/social security spending,
but excluding subsidies such as the wheat subsidy), compared to 4.7 percent o f GDP in
India and 3.1 o f GDP percent in Sri Lanka.          Some 80 percent o f Pakistan's social
protection expenditures are devoted to pensions and social security, which often benefit
the non-poor and those with access to formal jobs, while only 20 percent o f social
protection spending and 0.3 percent o f GDP i s spent on safety nets. This i s much lower
than other countries in the region and other countries with Pakistan's income level spend.
However, with the launch o f the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in September
2008, Government intends to increase social assistance spending significantly. The BISP
budget allocation for 2008/09 i s Rs 34 billion, or about 0.3 percent o f GDP. Government
has also announced its intention to increase the BISP budget by another Rs 34 billion in
the near future. While the spending increase is welcome, there are concerns about the
effectiveness o f the social safety nets inreaching the poor, as will be discussedbelow.

Most social protection programs in Pakistan are administered and financed at the federal
level. Provincial governments contribute only marginally to policy formulation and/or
program administration and monitoring. The main exceptions to this are the Punjab Food
Support Program and civil service pensions.

SafetyNets

Pakistan has a myriad o f safety net programs targeted primarily to the chronic poor and
ranging from (unconditional) cash transfers to social care services and microfinance
programs. There are no workfare programs, although such programs existed in the past,
or other public schemes aimed directly at vulnerable households for mitigating, or
copying with, risks.

Safety net programs are fragmented and often duplicative. In addition to the recently
announced BISP, Bait-ul-Mal (public expenditures at 0.05 percent o f GDP) and Zakat
(expenditures through private donations at 0.1 percent o f GDP) are the other major
federal programs. Both Bait-ul-Mal and Zakat are ineffective in targeting the poor: only
46 percent o f total expenditures o f Bait-ul-Mal, and 43 percent o f Zakat expenditures,
reach the poorest 40 percent o f the population. The only significant provincial program
i s the Punjab Food Support Program, launched in autumn 2008 and endowed with a
budget o f Rs. 22 billion.    To date, no systematic evidence is available to assess its
targeting performance.




                                              1

In this context, the rapid introduction of BISP manifests Government's commitment to
protect the poor and vulnerable from the impact o f the economic crises, although plans
for consolidation o f cash-transfer programs are not formalized at this stage. The current
BISP design has some positive elements. Inparticular, the decision on final eligibility for
benefits i s handled separately from the collection o f relevant data to determine eligibility.
However, Government i s committed to reforming the program so that it conforms to
international best practices.    This includes the need to: (a) ensure a targeting and
beneficiary enrolment process that i s objective, transparent, and minimizes the risk o f
major inclusion and exclusion errors to safeguard its credibility; (b) adopt an objective
and up-to-date targeting tool such as a poverty scorecard that is derived using the Proxy
Means Test methodology in lieu o f the existing targeting scheme that relies on
information collected by Members o f National Assembly together with the data in
National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) which suffers from several
weaknesses: it has incomplete coverage o f poor households, incomplete information on
relevant proxies for poverty, and in part obsolete data; and (c) design and implement
effectively the institutional arrangements for managing the program with adequate
capacities to engage with the different tiers o f Government. When the reform o f BISP i s
completed it will serve as a platform to: (a) consolidate other similar programs like Bait-
ul-Maal and similar provincial program to avoid duplication and improve efficiency; (b)
move universal subsidies such as wheat toward a targeted one pegged to BISP; and (c)
innovate other programs that complement a basic cash transfer programs like BISP to
help the poor to graduate into income generation opportunities.

Social Security

There are several schemes providing insurance against old age, disability, death and/or
survivor benefits. The most important o f these are civil service pensions, followed by
schemes provided by private employers in the formal sector. Social security programs
have low coverage (that is, fewer than one inten workers are covered by any scheme that
protects their households against major life-cycle shocks such as sickness, mortality and
old age) and are focused on the non-poor because o f the strong link between coverage
and access to formal employment; benefits levels are relatively low and their value inreal
terms has declined in recent years due to lack o f indexation. Current administration
systems are highly fragmented, which translates into relatively high administrative costs.
Finally, the main schemes are fiscally unsustainable in their current format. There are
large unfunded liabilities under the civil service pension system, estimated at about 25
percent o f GDP, and recent estimates project important shortfalls for the Employees Old
Age Benefits as it matures over the next few decades.

  ANNEX 11: Summary findings from Povertyand Social Impact Assessments (PSIAs) on
                               FuelPrice Increasesand FoodPrice Inflation
Recent global food and fuel price inflation severely affected the world economy, and how to
mitigate the adverse impact on people's welfare had been among the most important policy
agenda o f governments around the world. Pakistan was no exception. The global food and fuel
price inflation hit the economy, particularly the poor and vulnerable in the country.                                          The
government's interventions like food and fuel subsidies no doubt helped people cushion the
adverse impact, but also further worsened the fiscal position o f the government.

The World Bank conductedtwo PSIAs to see the distributional impact o fthe recent food and fuel
price inflation and assess how the government's interventions, particularly fuel and food
subsidies, performed at the height of the recent inflation. Also, these studies conducted an ex
ante assessment o f whether and under what conditions the new social safety net program, the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), would have worked to mitigate the impact o f economic
shocks o f this magnitude.

Despite recent dramatic downturns in global food and oil prices, both PSIAs focus on the impact
o f the price increases till July 2008 - the peak o f international food and oil price inflation - for
two reasons. First, this was the time when the trade-off between mitigation o f the adverse welfare
impact o f inflation and the resulting fiscal distress was the most evident. Careful studies on this
period provide valuable lessons for the government and other stakeholders to prepare for a
possible resurgence o f either food or fuel price inflation in the future. Second, the experience of
this period drove the government to create a new social safety net program - the BISP. The ex
ante assessment o f possible contributions o f the BISP would benefit the ongoing reform on the
social safety net in Pakistan.

This annex summarizes findings from
the PSIAs. All analyses were conducted               Figure 1: Oil price indices (100 for April 14,2006)
using PSLM 2005-06 data. Since some
key socio-economic parameters have                        84
likely changed since 2005-06, as soon as
PSLM 2007-08 data become available,
it is recommended that all results here
be re-evaluated with the new data.

povertyrate is in general limited, rangingbetween2.3 and 3.2 percentagepoints.

Poverty rates would have risen even more significantly, if the domestic fuel prices had been
raised further to match the international oil price increases as of July 2008. If the household
income had not grown at all, it would have raised the national poverty rate drastically by 5.7
percentage points, implying roughly 7.6 million people would have become poor due to the fuel
price increases. Ifthe household income had grown by 6.0 percent, the poverty rate would have
increased by 5.0 percentage points.
Subsidy Saving vs. SocialSafety Net

Fuel price increases, or cutting fuel subsidies, will certainly reduce the fiscal burden of the
government, while they will worsen the living standards by reducing purchasing power of
consumers and increase the poverty incidence. One way to mitigate the poverty impact of
subsidy cuts is to transfer part of subsidy saving to the poor through a social safety net program
such as BISP. We examine which of these two alternativesis more cost-effective:fuel subsidies
or a social safety net program.

Any targeting program involves a certain level of mistargeting, i.e., exclusion of the poor and
inclusion of the non-poor. According to the World Bank's analysis, even if a reasonably good
targeting mechanism (a proxy means testing approach) is adopted, the targeting errors are not
negligible. To make this evaluation more realistic, some targeting imperfection was also taken
into account.

Despite the imperfection of targeting mechanism, simulations based on PSLM 2005-06 data
indicatethat the government could keep the living standardsofthe poor unchanged on average by
spendingjust one sixth or less of the fuel subsidy by adopting a simple proxy means targeting
tool. This suggests that a social safety net with a good targeting mechanism is a far more
efficient instrument for poverty alleviation than fuel subsidies. However, it is worth noting that
the efficiency hinges on how accurately the program can identify the poor. Experienceof other
countries shows that fuel subsidies outperforma safety net programif its targetingis weak.

11. A PSIA on the food price inflation
This PSIA assesses the poverty impact of wheat price increases. Wheat prices inPakistan rose 73
percent between August 2007 and July 2008 at the national level, despite various measures to
limit the increases. While the sharp decline in internationalwheat prices since and prospects for a
wheat bumper crop suggests that domestic wheat prices might decline sometime in 2009, they
remained elevated inPakistanthroughout 2008.

The impact of the wheat price increase differs from that of fuel price increases in the following
ways. First, wheat price increases have much larger impact on poverty than fuel price increases,
since wheat consumption comprises a far larger budget share among the poor than fuel
consumption. For example, accordingto PSLM2005-06, the budget share of wheat consumption
i s nearly 10 percent at the national level and nearly 15 percent among the poorest 20 percent of
the population.

Second, wheat price increases do not necessarily reduce purchasing power of households,
particularly farmers, who do not only consume but also produce wheat. If a farmer produces

available, since it has not taken into account the economic downturn since late 2007.

much more wheat than he/she consumes, a wheat price increase raises hidher purchasing power,
resultingin a welfare gain.

According to the Bank's preliminary estimation based on PSLM 2005/06, the loss in purchasing
power due to the wheat price increase between August 2007 and July 2008 appears to be almost
nil on average. However, the impact varies largely across different groups inthe population. For
example the loss in purchasing power is particularly severe among (i)urban residents, (ii)
landless and marginal landholders, and (iii)the poor. On the other hand, rural residents (as a
whole), medium and large landholders in rural areas, and the rich increased their purchasing
power as a result o f the wheat price increase. Reflecting the fact that welfare losses concentrate
among the poor and landless/marginal landholders, the poverty impact is significant despite the
lack o f impact on the purchasing power registered on average at the national level. According to
the Bank's projection, the national poverty headcount rate is 3.5 percentage points higher than the
counterfactual, i.e., ifthe inflation did not O C C U ~ . ~

A role of a socialsafety netprogram
Since the poor are among the biggest victims o f the wheat price inflation, a well-targeted social
safety net program for the poor is likely to be cost-effective. And wheat reserve fund operations
can be limited to a minimum required to achieve the fund's original objective o f smoothening
seasonal price differences and ensuring emergency food security. However, the analysis indicates
that the design o f a social safety net program should take into account two aspects. First, unlike
most o f the chronic poor, the victims o f the wheat price inflation concentrate in the urban areas,
although even among rural inhabitants, the net buyers are likely to suffer from the adverse
impact. Second, price shocks can be temporary. A permanent and rigid prograin can outlive
price shocks, and thereby its rationale.




 This analysis did not include the impact of economic growth since 2005-06.
