           Support Operation (PRESO) for Pakistan had a moderately\n            satisfactory Bank performance and a moderately\n            unsatisfactory borrower performance. PRESO supported\n            regaining and mainlining stability through increased tax\n            revenue mobilization, adjustment of fuel prices and poor\n            tariffs, improved efficiency of public spending, and\n            strengthened Government of Pakistan (GoP) debt management.\n            It also supported enhancing competitiveness through reduced\n            barriers to business entry and exit, and strengthened\n            financial statistical systems. And finally, it protected the\n            poor and vulnerable through improved targeting of safety\n            nets and cash transfer programs, and strengthened\n            statistical systems. Some of the lessons that emerged from\n            PRESO were that the PRESO team should have had to help\n            create a broad-based constituency for these reforms through\n            a wider and inclusive stakeholder engagement. Also the need\n            for ensuring ownership at the highest levels of GoP and\n            other stakeholders is necessary, but was not sufficient\n            enough to achieve the development objective of the program.\n            Next prior experience suggests the need to address capacity\n            and institutional issues upfront with continuous technical\n            assistance and capacity building to ensure that reforms are\n            followed through, and are not reversed. Another gained\n            lesson was for the Development Policy Lending to be\n            successful it needs to be underpinned by robust and timely\n            analytical work based on quality and reliable data in each\n            proposed reform area in order to achieve informed policy\n            decisions. Finally, in a high risk environment where reform\n            reversals are common, the Bank should continue with\n            stand-alone operation within a multi-year Government reform program."}, "docdt": "2011-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
