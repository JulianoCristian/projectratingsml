The reform is based on three key elements: entry of\n            world class operators, competition in all segments of the\n            sector, and reorganization of the established public\n            telecommunications service provider. The project has three\n            components. The policy component entails: 1) reviewing and\n            developing as appropriate the telecommunications legal and\n            regulatory environment to ensure effective entry of private\n            investors and operators in the telecommunications sector; 2)\n            strengthening the capability of the Ministry of Tourism,\n            Post and Telecommunications to manage regulatory issues\n            including monitoring and evaluating operators'\n            performance in the emerging multi-operator environment; 3)\n            reviewing the management and allocation of radio frequency\n            spectrum and 4) developing a plan for the provision of rural\n            telephone services on a commercial basis. The investment\n            component includes: 1) installation of local and\n            inter-exchange networks to add one million telephone lines;\n            2) installation of a second fiber optic back-bone system; 3)\n            installation of submarine optical fiber cable transmission\n            systems; and 4) enhancement of information systems. The\n            technical component will support: 1) strengthening the\n            project implementation, marketing, customer services\n            capacities; and 2) improving TELKOM's managerial capabilities."}, "docdt": "1995-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
