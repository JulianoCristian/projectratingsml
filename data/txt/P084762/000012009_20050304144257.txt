  Objective           The government's fiscal and institutional reform agenda i s
                      supported by the Bank through the series of four single-tranche
                      Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loans (FIAL). The
                      objectives of this series of loans are twofold: first, to promote
                      reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessary to attain the
                      substantial fiscal adjustment underlying sustainable
                      macroeconomic stability; and second, to improve the provision
                      of public services and establish the institutional basis for
                      higherefficiency and accountability inpublic expenditure.
                      The specific objectives of the FIALprogram are to: (i)      increase

                      development of a sound fiscal responsibility legal framework;

                      management contracts for agencies; and (x) support a coherent
                      and comprehensive reform implementation process.

                      This third loan of the program will focus primarilyon the
                      following key policy actions: (i)  acceleration of the phase-out

                   of tax exemptions for profits of certain firms; (ii)increased
                   revenues derived from improvements intax administration of
                   at least 0.3% of GDP between 2003 and 2004, while
                   maintaining DUNadministrative costs per peso collected
                   below 0.96%; (iii)  submission of a new budget law to

                   system for the public sector reform process.
                   The key benefits expected from the program are: (i)    structural
                   improvements inthe tax system; (ii)    greater revenues and more
                   flexible expenditures to implement public policy priorities; (iii)

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

1.      For slightly over two years now, the administration of President Alvaro UribeVdez has
been implementing an ambitious government programbased upon the four pillars of the National
Development Plan,' namely: democratic security, sustainable economic growth and employment,
social equity, and increased transparency and efficiency of the State. Inhis latest annual report to
Congress submitted in July of 20042,the President presented the results of the first half of his
constitutionalperiod, which are summarized in the following table:




        Government Program Pillar                                     Selected Results
    Democratic Security                       Reduction of 12.3% in the homicide rate, 39.5% in kidnappings,
                                              75% in attacks to towns, 30.1% in acts of terrorism, and 17% in
                                              displaced families from 2002 to 2003
    SustainableEconomic Growth and            3.95% GDP growth and private investment of 8.9% of GDP in
    Employment                                2003 (both the highest in 5 years); 1% reduction in
                                              unemployment in the last 2 years
    Social Equity                             Increasesof 3% in primary education coverage; 1.8% in higher
                                              education coverage; and 2.8 million additional people with health
                                              coverage through the social security system throughout the last
                                              two years
    IncreasedTransparency and Efficiency      0.1% of GDP in current expenditures and increase of 17.3% in
    of the State                              tax revenue (current); 157 "transparency pacts" signed with local
                                              governments from 2002 to 2003.



2.       Interms of the forth pillar "Increased Transparency andEfficiency of the State", the
backbone of the public sector reform process i s the Programa de Renovacidn de la
Administracidn PdbZica (PUP). The program, which i s founded on PresidentialDirective 10of
October 2002 and spearheaded by the National Planning Department (DNP) i s comprised of both
vertical and horizontal reforms. Whereas so called vertical reforms basically refer to sector- or
entity-specific institutional restructuring actions that seek to reduce excess public sector
employment and enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of public services horizontal reforms
encompass such cross-sector issues of public administration as asset management and
procurement, to name but two. This public sector modernization effort i s complemented by a
comprehensive fiscal management reform program, ledby the Ministryof Finance and Public
Credit (MHCP) which comprises inter alia a substantive tax reform, a major overhaul of tax
administration, budget reform, and the enactment of fiscal responsibility regulations. Together,



 TheNational Development Plan (PlanNacional de Desarrollo) is adocument that describes the priority areas of
action for each incoming administration, and is approved by Law along with its accompanying multi-annual
investment plan.

these measures make up a broad reform package meant to lay the foundations for improved
service delivery and sustained fiscal balance.

3.      Duringthe second semesterof 2002, agreement was reachedbetween the government and
the multilateral banks that the public sector reform process would receive support from both the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB.) Per the agreement, IBRD development policy lending would focus on
overcoming the fiscal rigidities that underminethe efficiency and effectiveness of public policy
implementation. Within this context, IBRDsupport would center on addressing both the revenue
side of the fiscal reformprocess as well as the achievement of efficiency gains inthe "horizontal"
elements of the reform process. The IDB, on the other hand, would focus its investment lending
on supporting key elements of the PRAP, including implementation of selected horizontal and
vertical reforms.

4.      OnMarch 18, 2003, the Boardapproved the first Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment
Loan (FIAL)to support the government's fiscal reform agenda, as well as the horizontal
elements of the public sector modernization process. This first single-tranche structural
adjustment loan, inthe amount of US$300 million, laid out the principles of a programmatic
operation of up to $900 million, spanning into FY 2006. The program has two objectives: first,
to promote reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessaryto attain the substantial fiscal
adjustment underlying sustainable macroeconomic stability; and second, to improve the
provision of public services and establish the institutional basis for higher efficiency and
accountability of public expenditures. The second loan of the program, for an amount of US$lSO
million, was approved by the Board on November 28,2003.

5.      This ProgramDocument presentsthe third loan of the FIALprogram (FIALIU)for an
amount of US$lOO million to be disbursedina single tranche. Each of the loans inthe FIAL
program has a particular thrust within the overall scope of the reform. FIAL Iwas heavily
weighted toward tax policy as the initial and most urgent step toward attaining fiscal
sustainability. FIAL I1focused on initiating key legal and normative public sector reforms
including: (i) procurement; (ii) transfers; (iii) responsibility; (iii)
                                 royalty                fiscal                    the
implementation of management contracts with two government agencies; and (iv) the definition
of a budget reform strategy. The thrust of the third FIAL loan proposed herein i s on: (i)
ongoing adjustments to and results from the tax policy framework; (ii) results of tax
                                                                          actual
administration efforts; (iii)the implementation of reforms in the areas of royalty, asset, and
procurement management; and (iv) the launching of legal reforms to the budgeting system. The
final FIAL IV i s expected to focus on: (i) full implementation of the tax reforms; (ii) enactment
of new budgetary legislation; (iii)the expansion of the management contracts scheme; and (iv)
the overall evaluation of the reform process.

6.      As detailed later inthis document, progress inthe reformprogramhas been satisfactory
and there have been significant accomplishments derived from the first and second FIALloans.
The continuity of the program i s considered a highpriority by the authorities and substantial
resources and efforts are being invested in the reform process.

                                  11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS
7.      The near stagnation of 1998-2002 has given way to economic recovery and continued
strengthening of consumer confidence. Fueledby an increase inreal investment of almost 5
percent, real economic growth more than doubled from 1.6 percent in 2002 to 3.9 percent in
2003. From January to September of 2004 real GDP rose by an estimated 3.6 percent year-on-
year, ledby output gains inretail sales, construction andindustrial production. Higher economic
growth has lowered Colombia's unemployment rate from 17.2 percent in 2002 to 11.7 percent in
November 2004 (which i s the lowest unemployment rate in the last four years.) While the
consolidated fiscal deficit for 2003 was 2.7 percent of GDP (a slippage of 0.2 % from the target
inthe IMFagreement), the latest preliminary figures show aprojected deficit for 2004 of only 2.3
percent, which is below the target inthe stand-by agreement with the IMF. Given these fiscal
improvements, the government now anticipates GDP to grow by 4 percent in 2004. The higher
than expected growth, strength of the peso, and ample liquidity inthe TES (Peso-denominated
Treasury Bonds) market, should help alleviate some of the fiscal pressures, reducing government
reliance on investment cuts and helping to stabilize the public debt dynamics for 2004.

8.      Total investment was 15.5 percent of GDPin 2003, with private investment at about 7
percent. Investment in 2004 i s expected to remain constant at around 15.5 percent of GDP.
Since 2002, construction has increased approximately 20 percent, thereby spearheading the
economic recovery of the past two years. Inaddition, inflation fell from 6.5 percent in2002 to 6
percent in 2003, and decreased further to 5.5 percent in 20043.

9.      Largely as a result of oil sales, Colombia's exports increased 9.9 percent in 2003, while
preliminary figures show an increase of 11.2 percent in 2004. Although the country's
nontraditionalexports (mainly manufactured goods and cut flowers), performed well inrecent
years and now represent over half of all merchandise exports, the appreciation of the peso and the
slow economic recovery inthe United States and other major trading partners tempered export
growth in 2004. Through mid-April 2004, the government and central bank took measuresto
avoid a contraction inexports by slowing the appreciation of the peso. Despite these efforts,
increased domestic demand for imports outstripped export growth and thereby widened the trade
deficit. As a result, while the 2003 current account deficit was estimated at approximately 1.8
percent of GDP, preliminary figures show that it has increased to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2004.

10.     Over the past half-decade, new realities have emerged in Colombia's fiscal accounts,
including significant deficits and large future liabilities. The rapid expansion of public sector
spendingthroughout the past decade, (from 25 percent of GDPin 1990to over a thirdtoday)
combined with growing pension and other liabilities, have ledto significant and persistent
structural deficits. As public spendingrapidly surpassed the Government's revenue-generating
capacity, much of the fiscal deficit was increasingly financed with debt, both domestic and
external. Today, Colombia's total public sector debt represents around 47 percent of GDP.

11.     Despite its commitment to continue the fiscal adjustment efforts introducedby the
previous administration, the government was unable to accelerate fiscal adjustment duringthe
first years of its mandate. As a result, the 2003 fiscal deficit for the combined public sector
would only decline to 2.7 percent of GDPby year's end, thereby falling short of the 2.5 percent
target agreed with the IMF. The government sought and was granted a waiver of this particular
performance criteria.

12.     Nonetheless, the Uribe Administration has made significant improvements on the fiscal
front. InDecember 2002, Law 788 was approved. Passage of this FIAL-supportedLaw: (i)
eliminated some of the exemptions and expanded the tax base for the value-added tax; (ii)
reduced the wage exemption under the personal income tax and established a ceiling on it;4and
(iii) outthecorporateincometaxexemptionforcapitalgainsfromsalesofstock,mutual
     phased
funds, real estate, andprofits from previouslyprivilegedcorporate forms, contracts, funds, or
bonds. Although Tax Reform Law 788 of December 2002 established a framework for tax
reform and introduced significant advances towards reducingprevailing inefficiencies and
distortions in the Colombian tax system, it also comprised a number of distortional measuresthat
were necessary to meet short-term revenue targets. Passageof this legislation has introduced
additional revenues totaling 0.7 percent of GDP in 2003 and approximately 1.1percent of GDP
in2004.

13.     On December 29,2003 Congress passedLaw 863, which made further improvements in
tax policy, but also introducednew distortions to the tax system. This measure was necessary in
part to fill the fiscal gap left by the failure of key measures, inparticular the 2003 referendum,
which included important expenditure containment reforms. This Law included desirable
measures such as the acceleration of the phase-out schedule of certain tax exemptions, but also
added distortions such as an increase inthe financial transactions tax of 0.1percent.

14.     On the expenditure front, public expenditures have been growing rapidly, mainly due to
the structural rigidities of the budget system, highdebt service obligations, and massive and
increasing transfers to the pensions system. The government i s undertaking or promoting
important measures to contain this expansion intwo main fronts: pension reform and
restructuring of the public sector. Colombia's budget i s extremely rigid. Transfers to both
subnational governments and the pensions system have constitutedthe most substantial
expenditure increasesthroughout the last decade.

15.     Pension Reform. Colombia has a Constitutionally-mandated pay-as-you-go pension
system managed through the Znstituto de Seguridad Social (ISS.) Although the system
underwent reforms in 1993 through Law 100, it i s still generating major deficits that need to be
covered through large central government transfers. Law 100addressed issues of low
contributions and overly generous retirement benefits; however, it did not take into consideration
demographic changes (it calculated an average payout lifetime of 15 years, which has now
reached close to 26 years) and did not eliminate a number of very expensive special regimes.
Over the last five years, average contributions to the system have remainedconstant at 1.1%of
GDP, while pay-outs have been increasing from 4.4% in2000 to 5.7% in2004. Inthe absence of




  The ceilingincludes all forms of compensationand thus reducesincentivesfor non-taxedcompensationto
employees.

additional reform, the cash-flow deficit of 4.6% of GDP in 2004 i s projected to continue its
upward trend over the next years, peakingat around 6.3% of GDPin 2018.

16.      Inthe second semesterof 2004, the government presented aproposedconstitutional
amendment to Congress aimed at increasing the overall sustainability of Colombia's pension
system. This proposal requireseight legislative debates and i s scheduled to be passedby June
2005. Among the key elements of this proposal are the following: (i)      introduction of a mandate
of financial sustainability of the pensions system into the Constitution; (ii) elimination of special
regimes; (iii)  ineligibility of negotiating pension issues incollective bargainingagreements; (iv)
elimination of the 14th salary (mesada 14);and (v) cap on individual pension entitlements to the
equivalent of 25 minimumwages. The government estimates that these measureswill reduce the
pensions system imbalances significantly, leading to a reduction of about 30 percent in the net
present value of the accumulated operational deficit. The Congress has passedfour out of the
eight reforms. Congress has postponed the transition periodfrom 2008 to 2010, therefore the
reduction inthe net present value of the accumulated operation deficit has declined to about 23.4
percent of GDP.

17.      Public Sector Restructuring. Colombia is undergoing a major reform of the state. One of
the common problems afflicting public entities i s that liabilities continue to surpass assets.
Throughout the 1990s, the Government began closing a number of public sector entities, and in
the process, ended up with a total liability worth 3.5 percent of GDP-- mostly attributable to
pensions. Hence a major challenge to be tackled by the Uribe administration was to continue the
process of closing and/or modernizing public entities without generating a large liability. B y
August 2004, 142 entities were restructured (including the closure of 30 entities.) This process
has already generated approximately US$150 million ingross savings, anda net savings of
US$34 million (once severance and other costs are deducted.) The net present value of the
liabilities of the entities comprising this modernization program i s estimated to be worth
approximately 2 percent of GDP'.

18.      It is important to highlight that the modernization of public entities has not been limited
to the elimination of posts. One case inpoint was that of ECOPETROL, where the latter's
regulatory function was transferred to the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (Hydrocarbon
National Agency). Another case was that of TELECOM, where upon terminating all of this
agency's workers, the government proceeded to hire new ones. Inthe past, TELECOM
employed approximately 7,000 workers, and was responsible for around 16,000 pensioners,
which created a huge probleminits pension system. Following the restructuring, TELECOM
now generates sufficient profits to fully cover pension liabilities. Other firms like TELECOM
are being modernized and restructured inthe same manner.

19.      Another relevant measure that i s currently under study relates to the restructuring of the
public hospital network. The health sector i s characterized by an excess supply of public
hospitals and a poorly integrated healthcare network. The goal of the reform inthis sector i s to
adjust the supply of public hospitals in such a way that different levels of attention are duly
covered, while generating operational savings at the same time. To this end, Colombia will seek
to close excess public hospitals while restructuring others. This reform i s supported by a US$lOO
million IDB-sponsored loan.

20.      Despite the difficulties in adjusting the big-ticket expenditure items inthe short term, the
government has succeeded inreducing both its deficit and its debt stock. The overall deficit was
reduced from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2002 to a projected 2.3 percent of GDPin 2004. Likewise,
the net debt stock was reduced from 54.2 percent of GDP in2002 to a projected46.6 percent of
GDPin2004. Although Colombia's fiscal stance looks much better than two years ago, it
nonetheless remains vulnerable. Much of the improvement evidenced in 2004 can be attributed
to the favorable external environment -- particularly highoil prices and capital inflows which
together have substantially appreciated the peso. The increase in the operating surplus of the
state petroleumenterprise (ECOPETROL) that resulted from a combination of increased export
revenues and a 20 percent hike indomestic gasoline and diesel fuel prices, played a key role in
shoring up total revenues in 2004. The unlikelihood that current highoil prices will be sustained
poses the risk of reversing gains made by these non-tax revenues; hence the importance of the
success of the pension reform and further efficiency gains in the public sector to maintain a
sustainable fiscal path inthe long term.

21.      Colombia's vulnerability to external shocks has declined since early 2003, but the country
continues to face significant challenges. Although its sovereign debt spreads have narrowed
substantially since the beginningof the year in absolute and relative terms compared to the
emerging market average, Colombia remains susceptible to: (i)                the uncertainty surrounding its

Colombia should be well equippedto deal with moderate shocks as it undertakes the fiscal
adjustment.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
22.     MacroeconomicOutlook. The Government has revisedupwards its projections for
economic growth to 4.0 percent in 2005 (from 3.3 percent), and consumer price inflation to 5.5
percent (from 5 percent). Since prospects for significantly improving the factors supporting
domestic demand (employment, internal peace, investment and credit) are modest, it i s likely that
GDPgrowth will continue to hover at 4.0 percent or below throughout the next three years.
Nevertheless, there are upside and downside risks inthis scenario that will hinge on the success
of fiscal adjustment efforts, the strength of the global economic expansion, and the direction of
global interest rates and oil prices.

23.     Industrial production will continue to be geared towards non-traditional exports, the
prospects of which are marred by uncertainty regarding economic developments inthe U S and in
Venezuela. Imports are expected to grow by 5.4 percent in 2005, and combinedwith lower
exports, are expected to moderately increase the current account deficit to 2.7 percent of GDP in
2005. While the same trend i s expected to continue in 2006, with a moderate appreciation of the
currency contributing to a current account deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP, this figure i s expected to
fall slightly to 2.6 percent of GDPby 2007. FDIflows are expected to increase due to the
expected Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the UnitedStates, but will likely remain modest due
to continued policy uncertainty and a moderate recovery. Also, given the appreciation of the
exchange rate, the positive effects of the free trade agreement may not be fully reflected inthe
forecasted period. Net international reserves are expected to increase slightly from US$lO.1
billion in2004 to US$ll.6 billion in 2007.

24.      Since 2002, when the government initiated the reforms supported by the FIALprogram,
the public debt to GDP ratio has declined from 59.5 to 46.6 percent as a result of both
macroeconomic policies and real exchange rate changes. Colombia i s expected to continue to
make headway on the fiscal front. The non- financial public sector balance i s projected to
decreasefrom 2.3 percent of GDP in 2004 to 1.6 percent o f GDPin2007, while the primary
balance i s expected to improve from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.3 percent of GDP.
Improvement inthe fiscal balance should place total debt on a sustainable path. Total net debt i s
expected to decline from a projected46.6 percent of GDPin 2004 to about 43 percent of GDP in
2006. InJune 2004, the government published its first medium term fiscal framework (MTFF)
which shows that the government expects to cut total public debt to 39 percent of GDP in 2015
under a baseline scenario. The government's MTFF together with the IMFand Bank's debt
sustainability analyses reveal that inorder to guarantee long term fiscal sustainability, the
government needs a primarybalance of 3 percent.

25.      The Government's programcalls for increased external financing in 2005, with net
borrowing of about $1.5 billion. Net disbursements from multilaterals will increase through
2007, with the bulk of the increase coming from the World Bank. Interest rates paid on bonds (in
domestic currency) are expected to rise slightly from 13.1 percent 2004 to 14.7 percent in 2007,
as global interest rates are expected to rise.

26.      Debt Sustainability Analysis. Three different dynamic debt sustainability analyses were
carried out by the Government, the IMF, and the Bank, respectively. The main results of these
analyses follow below.

27.      Government's Debt Sustainability Analysis. The government undertook a dynamic
fiscal sustainability analysis, which was includedin the June 2004 Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework. In this analysis the government use the following equation:




where d,,, -d, represents the change of debt over GDP ratio, which depends on the real interest
rate r, real economic growth g, the GDP deflatorp, and the deficit of the primarybalance dcf.

28.      With equation (l),government showed that the net debt stock wouldbe reduced from
                               the
50.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to about 39 percent of GDP in2015 assuming growth of 4 percent
of GDP, a real interest rate of 5 percent, and the public sector's primary balance of 3 percent of
GDPon average (See Table 3).

29.      The MTFF also presents five different scenarios. Table 3 shows the extreme cases of the
MTFF's analysis. The low case scenario assumes a 30 percent real depreciation for 2005 and
2006, while the high case scenario considers the positive effects of the Free Trade Agreement
with the UnitedStates. In all cases, a primarybalance of 3 percent of GDPwould guarantee that
debt would not have an explosive path.




  The inclusionof the GDP deflator is not part of the standard analysis and makesthe results more pessimistic,
requiring a higher primary surplusfor the same initial conditions.

1. This scenario assumes that growth rate remains at 4 percent of GDP, a real interest rate of 5 percent, and a
constant real exchange rate.
2. This scenario assumes a 30 percent real depreciation in 2005 and 2006.
3. This scenario assumes shock to the debt stock from the Free Trade Agreement with the United States There will
be revenue lossesof around 0.3 percent of GDP due to tariff reductions from 2006 and afterwards. But it i s expected
that the FTA will increase the country's growth rate by 0.5 percent over the next five years.


30.      IMF'sDebtSustainability Analysis. The IMFevaluated scenarios similarto the onesin
the government's MTFF. Table 4 shows two of the stress tests for public debt ratio of the IMF's
analysis. Both scenarios are more pessimistic than the baseline scenario. The first scenario
assumes a one time 30 percent real depreciation in2004; and, the second case scenario considers
a negative real GDP growth shock of two standard deviations below the long-run average of 2.7
percent growth.

31.      Inthe IMFprojections, Colombiawouldneedtomaintainaprimarybalanceof atleast 3
percent of GDP throughout the next three years for the net debt stock of the non financial public
sector to be reduced to 43 percent of GDP by 2010.

32.      World Bank's Debt SustainabilityAnalysis. Inthis debt sustainability analysis
developed inthe Bank's Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the following budget
constraint for a single period was assumed:




where zf = ('       g g
                 +           nr)- ,b,exf      i s external debt as a share of GDP, br i s internal debt as a

GDP, of is seigniorage revenue as a share of GDP,              S i s years average exchange rate,       S  i s the
                                                                                                         f




end of the period exchange rate,       g l i s the real economic growth rate, and       nt  i s the inflation.

33.      With equation (2), the CEM showed the requiredprimary balance so that the net debt
stock would be reduced from 51.5 percent of GDP in 2003 to reach 36 percent of GDP in 2015
should be at least 2.7 percent of GDP to guarantee fiscal sustainability in the base scenario (See
Table 5). The debt sustainability analysis in the C E M assumes the same desiredreduction in
debt as the MTFF, but given that the fiscal outcome for 2004 was better than expected, the target
goal of achieving a debt to GDP ratio of 38.6 percent in 2015, would be achieved a year earlier.




1. This scenario assumes that growth rate remains at 4 percent, seigniorage revenue of 0.9 percent of GDP, and a
devaluation of 10percent of real exchangerate in a three year period (2005-2007).
2. This scenario assumes a 30 percent real depreciation in 2005, growth rate of 2 percent in 2005 then increases to
4.5 percent in 2006 and decreases to 4.2 percent in 2007 and afterwards it remains at 4 percent, and seigniorage
revenue of 0.9 percent of GDP.
3. This scenario assumes a growth rate of 5 percent and a constant real exchange rate.




                                                          12

34.     The different debt sustainability analyses point out that Colombia should have at least a
primary balance of around 2.5 to 3.0 percent of GDP in order to achieve long term debt
sustainability under most scenarios. However, if growth slows substantially in 2005 and one
expects a less benign external environment, a primary balance of about 3.5 percent would be
requiredto achieve debt sustainability.



                            111.    THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

OVERVIEW

35.     TheEstado Comunitario and the Futureof the ColombianPublicSector. The
concept of an Estado Comunitario lies at the heart of this government's public sector reform
program. The Estado Comunitario constitutes a set of basic reform guidelines that were drawn
up andput inpractice by President Uribe during his tenure as the governor of the department of
Antioquia -- perhaps the most developed intermediate-level administration in Colombia.
Elaborated during the campaign, the concept of Estado Comunitario inspired criteria for the
selection of entry points and impact evaluations of public sector reforms under the current
administration. Although still evolving as a guiding concept of public sector reform, the Estado
Comunitario incorporates and adapts a number of widely accepted contemporary principles of
public sector reform to guide the renovation of the Colombian public sector under the current
administration.

36.     The Estado Comunitario constitutes the foundation of the 2002-2006 National
Development Plan. The fundamental principle underlying this concept i s that the State should
exist to serve its citizens and not to benefit special interests. The Estado Comunitario involves
civil society in the attainment of social objectives. It represents a modern State where scarce
resources are invested wisely and efficiently; as well as a decentralized State predicated on
regional autonomy, transparency, political responsibility, and community participation.

37.     The National Development Planproposes that the development of the Estado
Comunitario be founded on four basic pillars:

    a   Democratic Security. The State must provide security and protection to all Colombians,
        without political, ideological, religious, or socioeconomic distinctions.
    a   Sustainable Development and Employment. The State must provide the conditions to
        recover Colombia's path to economic growth.
    a   Social Equity. The State must ensure that the fruits of economic growth are enjoyed by
        all Colombians.
    a   Renovation ofthe State. The State must modernize its administration and reform
        intergovernmental relations. The ultimate goal i s to build a well-managed, participatory,
        and decentralized public sector.


38.     TheEstudo Comunitario andthe FiscalandInstitutionalReformProgram. The
fundamental purpose of the Fiscal and Institutional Reform Program i s to liberate resources
necessary to ensure effective implementation of public policy and to generate efficiency and


                                                   13

transparency gains that will contribute to fiscal sustainability and improved service delivery.
Within this context and as described below, the Fiscal and Institutional ReformProgram is the
sine qua non to attain the goals of the National Development Plan described above. Moreover,
Democratic Security hinges on the availability of untiedfiscal resources, within a framework of
macroeconomic stability, to invest in restoring peace. SustainableDevelopment requires a sound
macroeconomic framework and effective fiscal policy. Social Equity depends on the
Government's ability to deliver improved services to the poor and to increase their ability to
benefit from economic growth. Finally, the Renovation of the State clearly requires well targeted
institutional strengthening actions aimed at promoting the overall quality, efficiency and
transparency of public service delivery while ensuringthat such services are rendered in a fiscally
sustainable manner. The reform programdesigned to implement this vision involves a wide
array of constitutional, legal, and administrative measures that, together, represent the most
significant reform effort since the Constitution of 1991.

39.      Concept and Structure of the Public Sector ReformProgram. The core of the Fiscal
and Institutional Reform Program i s contained in two reform packagesknown as the Tax Reform
and the Renovation of Public Administration. These two packages are framed within and
supplemented by other government reforms in such a way that the magnitude and expected
impact of the former cannot be adequately grasped without reference to the latter. All of these
reforms have significant fiscal implications and should establish the necessary bases for
Colombia's political reconstruction and economic recovery.


FISCALAND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUESAND RESPONSES

40.      Tax Policy. Fiscal revenue in Colombia i s derived from three main sources-oil
royalties, customs duties, and domestic taxes. Although the value of oil revenues depends
largely on world market factors beyond the government's control, there i s scope to reform how
such revenues are allocated and shared among different levels of g~vernment.~Customs
revenues have generally declined over recent years as a result of trade liberalization-- a trend that
will no doubt accelerate as Colombia and other Andean countries join in a free-trade agreement
with the UnitedStates. Consequently the reform of the domestic taxation system will now take
the forefront as a key venue to increase revenues. Appropriately designed domestic tax reforms
also have the potential to reduce economic distortions and administrativecomplexities.




 For the last 15 years the magnitude of oil revenues has also been decreased by guerilla attacks on the pipelines.

41.      Previous rounds of tax reform, especially the major structural reforms enacted in 1974
and 1986, left the country with a fundamentally sound array of taxes at the national level. The
national tax system i s comprised of both a consumption-based tax on value added and an income
tax system applied to high-income individuals and all forms of businesses including
corporations, partnerships and proprietorships. Income tax i s partially integrated by exempting
dividends from taxation as personal income. In addition, prior to 2003, capital gains were not
taxed at the individual level, thus furthering the goal of integration by avoiding double taxation
of retained earnings (consistent with the exemption of distributed earnings at the personal level).
The reform of 2003 introduced the taxation of capital gains at the individual level. Although on
the downside the introduction of this tax itemsubjects some business income to double taxation,
it has in parallel increased the tax base, reduced opportunities for tax evasion through schemes
that convert labor and accrued capital income into capital gains, and has increased overall
revenues.

42.      However, beyond such major reforms, tax laws have also been subject to frequent
changes which have occasionally introduceddistortions and inequities by granting preferential
treatment to special interests. Ingeneral such changes either: (i)                     reduced the pool of available
revenues or, (ii) prompted the Government to raise tax rates on activities already being taxed, to
maintain an adequate revenue base, thereby exacerbating existing distortions.

43.      The administration that assumed office in 2002 came with an electoral mandate to
undertake major policy objectives - the implementation of which requires higher tax revenues.
The challenges have been threefold: (i) implement such policies in a manner deemed feasible
                                             to
by both Congress and the Constitutional Court; (ii)             to improve the efficiency and equity of the
tax system by reducing economic distortions and preferential tax treatment; while (iii)                              reducing
the costs of administering and complying with the tax system.

44.     Key Policy Actions Undertaken. Although Tax ReformLaw 788 of December 2002
established a framework for tax reform and introduced significant advances towards reducing
prevailing inefficiencies and distortions inthe Colombian tax system, it also comprised a number
of distortional measuresthat were necessaryto meet short-term revenue targets. Subsequently
between 2003 and 2004 the government undertook and/or proposed a number of follow-up
measures to continue to balance the objectives of efficiency with the need to raise revenues.
Table 6 lays out the reform measures since 2002 that both improved the efficiency of and
reduced distortions in the tax system. Table 7 lists those measures that raised revenues but also
increased distortions. Overall, measures adopted in 2003 concentrated on raising revenues to
offset unplanned expenditures that resulted due to the failed 2003 referendum. Table 8 shows
additional revenue collected as a result of the approval of both Law 788 of 2002 and 863 of 2003,
distinguishing the effects of structural improvements in the tax system from those of distortional
revenue-generating measures.

45.     Law 788 of 2002 (i)       eliminated some of the exemptions and expanded the tax base for the
value-added tax; (ii)    reduced the wage exemption under the personal income tax while
furthermore establishing a ceiling on it;8and (iii)       phased out the corporate income tax exemption
for capital gains from sales of stock, mutual funds, real estate, and for profits from previously
privileged corporate forms, contracts, funds, or bonds. This law also introduced some sector
specific exemptions such as for hotel services of new and remodeled hotels and seismic services
for the hydrocarbon industry.




  The ceiling includes all forms of compensation and thus reduces incentives for non-taxed compensation to
employees.

                             loopholes for transactionsin the real economy and allows exemptions for some
                             interbank transactions
                             Established a "one-time'' tax on wealth.




46.     Inthe summer of 2003, the ConstitutionalCourt ruledthat the expansion of the VAT at
2% to all goods previously zero-rated, that was scheduled to be effective in 2005, was
unconstitutional. The ruling argued that this base expansion was not consistent with a
progressive tax structure and that the Congressional decision-making process had failed to
specifically consider each of the items to be included (referring instead to all previously untaxed
items). Shortly thereafter, a national referendum with reforms designed to close the deficit by
reducing spending and increasing the tax base, was also rejected, thereby creating a substantial
fiscal gap inthe 2003 and proposed 2004 budgets.

47.      On December 29,2003 Congress approved Law 863 -- a tax package designed to fill part
of the fiscal gap created by the unexpected rejection of the referendum. While this law
introduced further improvements in tax policy, it also introducednew distortions to the tax
system. Law 863 (i)       phased-out some sectoral exemptions under the corporate income tax a year
earlier than planned; (ii)     introduced partial expensing as an investment incentive under the
corporate income tax; (iii)       extended the temporary corporate-income surtax; (iv) tightened
eligibility rules for the special income tax regimes applied to small firms and non-profits, (Article
8); (v) introduced anti-avoidance provisions limiting both the transfer of profits to tax havens
(Article 4) and the ability to hide assets or create false liabilities (Article 6); (vi) slightly
expanded the base of the VAT; (vii) accelerated VAT collections by retaining more at the
source;" and (viii) tightened access to the simplified VAT regime to stop some abuses.

48.      Although most of the reforms enacted in 2003 were desirable, two were not. Over-riding
Law 788 of 2002, which specified that the 10percent surcharge under the corporate income tax
would be reduced to 5 percent in 2005, Law 863 (Article 7) instead extended the 10percent
surcharge for 2005 and 2006. This policy change i s undesirable since the base tax rate of 35% i s
already highby international standards. This discourages capital formation, including foreign
direct investment, and encourages transfer pricing schemes and other manipulations by
multinational firms thereby reducing Colombian tax revenues. A preferable approach would be
to expand the corporate income tax base by eliminating more exemptions. However, if the

surcharge (as well as the partial expensing provision) are dropped after 2006 as scheduled, this
would represent an improvement over Law 788 which left the surtax at 5 percent indefinitely.
Law 863 also raised the tax rate of the financial transactions tax. These two taxes coupled with
the highrates under the payroll taxes and the preferential regimes remaining in the income tax,
represent the main distortions remaining in the Colombian Tax code.

49.    These measures would expand the VAT tax base from about 41 percent of consumption
in2002 to about 59 percent by 2005, a major achievement. As regards corporate income tax, the
phase-out of exemptions would reduce these taxes from 70 percent of potential revenue in 2003
to 0 percent in 2006. Estimates by the authorities indicate that tax collections increasedby 0.72
percent of GDP in 2003 as a result of the 2002 tax package, and preliminary estimates showed
that additional collections would rise to 1.92 percent of GDP in 2004 and to 2.6 percent of GDP
in2005. Table 9 shows the observed increase intax revenues by comparing 2002 with 2004.

50.      Tax Administration. The potential returns of atax reform package, regardless of how
comprehensive it may be, can only be realized iftax administration i s both responsive to policy
changes, and provides the fundamental elements for efficiency and effectiveness. This i s of
particular importance in Colombia, where tax reforms are frequent and include not only
variations in rates, but also either the creation or abolition of new taxes and/or exemptions to
taxes, both of which require major adjustments intheir administration.

51.      The National Directorate of Taxes and Customs (DIAN) is the entity in charge of tax
administration for the central government. Although traditionally a well-staffed organization,
DIANhadnonetheless beenunable to structure itself properly to achieve the desired levels of
performance. Over the years, it has evolved from a department of the Ministry of Finance to a
semi-autonomous agency, and as such has also suffered structural changes in terms of the
unification of the tax and customs areas. In2002, the incoming government brought in a new
vision to the DIAN, founded on the following elements:

0   An institutionaldevelopment strategy basedon: (i) Integraland Integrated Tax
                                                               the
    Administration System (MUISCA); (ii)            organizational restructuring; and (iii)
                                                                                         legal
    restructuring.

0   A production and transition strategy, includingperformance targets, "cleansing" of the
    accounting systems, review of workloads, de-concentration of the operational tasks, and IT
    sustainability;

0   The supervision and control strategy, which includes the entity's auditing plan.

52.      This strategy is beingaggressively implementedwith the support of several agencies and
governments, including the Bank", and the Government of Spain.

53.     Key Policy Actions Undertaken. The implementationof this strategy has so far shown
promising results. Interms of the MUISCA system, DIANhas put together an outstanding team
of professionals, including DIANstaff and external consultants, to design, develop, and deploy
this system. The fundamental principle of the MUISCA is that it will become a seamless,
integrated, platform covering inter alia tax/customs audits, collections, control, and information
technology. This system representsa significant paradigm shift from the traditional model of
isolated systems for each business process. The DIANhas estimated that the deployment of the
MUISCA and its improvedcontrol systems will yield an average annual reduction intax evasion
of up to 0.2% o f GDP over the next few years.

54.     Interms of atransition strategy and control and auditing plans, DIANimplemented
important actions geared toward reducing data reporting thresholds for firms, improving customs
clearance times, cross-referencing taxpayer data with financial institutions, and developing
integrated tax/customs audits, among others. These measures, along with a strong campaign to
control tax evaders, have yielded important results interms of increasing tax revenues through
improved administration.

55.     Duringthe 2002-2003 period, DIANhas shown measurable improvements interms of
effectiveness and efficiency. The percent of tax returns presented in a voluntary and timely
manner increased from about one-half to over 80 percent, while the actual voluntary and timely
payment of taxes increased from 67% to 81%. Efficiency, which i s measured by factoring the
ratio of DIANadministrative costs to total tax collections, dropped in2003 to about 60% of its
2001 level. Part of this gain in efficiency i s attributable to the online submission of tax returns
by upper bracket tax payers12.

56.     InDecember 2003, Congress enacted Law 863, which includedmeasuresto support tax
administration including the creation of a new mechanism to identify, locate and classify tax-
payers and non-tax-payers. This registry systems allows the DIANto increase the number of
taxpayers, as well as to update its database. This "anti-evasion" component of the law i s
expected to yield additional revenues of US$388 million in 2004, and annual average increases
of approximately US$45 million per year between 2005-2010'3.

57.     Remaining Challenges. Indicators show that the performance of tax administration has
improved in recent years. The development plan outlined by the authorities i s comprehensive
and i s being implementedwith substantial external support. The most important challenge ahead
for tax administration i s both to continue with the ongoing modernization program and to
achieve expected improvements in voluntary compliance, collections, and corporate image.
However, real achievements to date can summarily be assessedby the following two key
indicators: increase intax revenues attributable to improvements in tax administration
(effectiveness); and reduction in DIANadministrative costs as a percentage of tax collections
(efficiency).

58.     At present, DIANlacks a specific methodology to measure tax evasion based on national
accounts. Overall revenue as a percent of GDP i s not a good indicator of administrative
improvements since revenues have been dramatically affected by tax policy reforms. However, a


'*Allthe informationon indicatorsis derived from the MAFP I1mid-termreport (August 2004)
l3Source: Marc0 Fiscal de Mediano Plazo (Medium-TermFiscalFramework)

                                                     21

good measure of tax compliance can be obtained by factoring gross tax collections minus the
expected impact o f each tax reform measure. DIAN's department of economic analysis carried
out such a calculation and came to the conclusion that improvements intax administration have
yielded an additional 1% of GDP in revenue over the past four years. From 2003 to 2004, period
over which many of the control and auditing actions were undertaken, the administrative effect
on tax collections is expected to be at least 0.3% of GDP. This represents a major
accomplishment.

59.     Interms ofefficiency, the relationofadministrative coststocollectionsis alsoona
promising trend and should continue decreasing as the deployment of new systems and
organizational restructuring increase revenue while maintaining operational costs in check. The
MUISCA system will revolutionize information management for voluntary compliance, auditing
and control, while the organizational modernization process i s introducing sector-specific
intelligence to auditing that will promote better understanding of particular taxpayer behavior in
specific sectors of the economy. DIAN's overall efficiency has improved over the last few years.
While administrative costs per 1000pesos collected has dropped from 10.3 in 2003, to an
expected 9.6 in 2004, it i s anticipated that costs will decline to 9.0 in 200514. These numbers are
good by international standards.

60.     Fiscal Responsibility. The fiscal situation inColombia reflects the extent of excess
demand on the State, its inability to meet those demands, and the urgency of achieving
sustainable balances. Achievement of a sound fiscal framework, together with social programs
that sustain the State's legitimacy, and the protectionof citizens against the ravages of inflation
are essential to the national security effort. The achievement of a sound fiscal framework will
require, among other things, institutional reform of the formulation of macroeconomic policy,
and close monitoring and control to meet short- and long-term fiscal targets.

61.     Behind the unavoidable fiscal arithmetic by which spending inexcess of revenue has led
to deficits and the accumulation of debt in Colombia, lie budgeting and fiscal management
procedures that have given rise to the unsustainable fiscal tendencies that prevail. Inan effort to
reverse this trend, increasing attention i s being paid to change the rules of the game for fiscal
policy at all levels of government. Untilrecently, the Constitution and legal rules governing the
budgeting and treasury functions did little to restrain Central Government deficits and debt, while
some arguably encouraged them. For example, the existence of vigenciasfuturas                      l5 permits the
Central Government to enter into commitments for future expenditures and the allowance of
arrears basedon ad hoc promises for future payment of current expenditures.

62.     Inthe 1990s, the new Constitution broadened political participation, increased spending
impulses, and weakened the Government's tax base by automatically obliging the latter to share
the tax base with sub-national governments. The sum of these factors succeeded in
compromising overall fiscal prudence. The Acto Legislativo (constitutional reform) of 2001
sought to impose ex ante limits on some of the spendingimpulsesthat originated from transfers
to sub national governments.




l4These efficiency indicators have been adjusted to eliminate the revenue effects of the tax reforms over the period.
l5Vigenciusfuturus are guaranteed allocations in future budgets to continue the implementation of, for example,

63.      Despite these reforms, government authorities believe that all levels of government enjoy
entirely too much discretion affecting fiscal deficits and not enough assurance of fiscal
sustainability. Clear evidence of this lies inthe fact that between 1990 and 2002, Central
Government expenditures increased steadily from 9.4 percent to 20.8 percent of GDP.

64.      Key Policy Actions Undertaken. Colombia's Congress approved a Fiscal Responsibility
Law (FRL) in June 2003 that sets the stage for fiscal sustainability. Prior to its enactment into
law, the associated bill underwent several rounds of Bank consultations and revisions. The bill,
which had been discussed within the government and Congress since the previous
administration, was approved by Congress without any ad hoc amendments or cumbersome
transition clauses. The FRLcontains rules for fiscal stability, transparency and macroeconomic
consistency, fiscal discipline, and sub national debt limits that reinforce and expand the measures
previously undertaken within the context of Law 617. It contains rules underlying (i)            the
establishment o f fiscal targets linkedto debt sustainability and primary balance for the Non-
Financial Public Sector (NFPS); (ii)      the publication of the financial plan; (c) annual reports of
fiscal results to Congress; and (d) the obligation to include the fiscal impact and source of
financing within any new law affecting taxes or expenditures.

65.      InJune 2004, the government presented its first Medium-Term FiscalFramework16to
Congress, as mandated by the FRL. This document was disseminated widely and praised for the
both breadth of information and the quality of its content. It i s used as a reference by civil
society and international organizations alike (including the IMF) to conduct assessments of fiscal
and macroeconomic projections. This report includes the following chapters: (i)              2003
Macroeconomic and Fiscal Balance; (ii) Macroeconomic Framework and Updated
                                               2004
Financial Plan; (iii)   Evaluation of the Main Quasi-Fiscal Activities of the Public Sector; (iv)
Estimation of the Fiscal Cost of Tax Exemptions and Deductions; (v) Cost of the Laws Approved
inthe Previous Legislature; (vi) Value of Contingent Liabilities; (vii) 2005 Financial Plan; (viii)
Multi-Annual Macroeconomic Program; and (ix) Primary Surplus Targets and Sensitivity
Analysis.

66.      Remaining Challenges. The basic framework for fiscal responsibility has already been
put inplace with the FRL, and the 2004 Medium-Term Fiscal Framework has fulfilled
expectations in terms of developing a sound fiscal outlook and providing key information that
was not readily available, such as tax expenditures and contingent liabilities. The challenge
ahead i s to ensure FRL's sustainability via the issuance of specific regulations, where necessary,
by undertaking regular assessments of the overall degree of ~ompliance.'~Furthermore, the new
Organic Budget Code, scheduled for enactment inDecember 2004, must complement the FRLby
both imposing necessary controls on budgetary aggregates and establishing basic elements (such
as a improveddefinition of social expenditures) necessary to ensure the provision of quality
fiscal data.

67.      Asset Management. Public Asset Management i s the institutional framework that allows
the public sector to account for, administer, allocate, maintain, employ, and dispose of

government assets worth 1percent of GDP". Since the start of the program, existing
information on public real estate assets proved deficient, incomplete, and unreliable".
Furthermore, the management of real assets continues to be limitedto risky registration
procedures and poor upkeep of Government-owned properties. In many cases it i s not clear
whether or not assets are upto date in terms of legal contingencies, accounts payable, and so
forth. The highcost associatedwith regularizing assets has caused a significant proportion of
public assets to be tied up in legal complications. The latter of course encourages unnecessary
public expenditures coupled with high opportunity costs. The new framework promotedby the
Government i s creating the rules, regulations and organizational practices-both                   formal and
informal-necessary          for an efficiency-driven asset management policy.

68.       A number of agencies have accumulated a varied array of properties and other assets,
whose unclear legal status and economic value, incomplete registration, and irregular control,
undermine effective asset management. The lack of standardized procedures, centralized control,
or incentives for efficient asset management together with a complex legal framework that
neither recognizes market principles, nor provides adequately for discretionary managerial
actions renders asset management inefficient, and has furthermore fostered a substantial
accumulation of idle assets.

69.       Key Policy Actions Undertaken. A government asset management team was set up by
DNPto: (i)      leadthe reforms in this area; (ii) a National Council of Economic and Social
                                                        prepare
Policy (CONPES) document defining government policy on this matter; and (iii)                      carry out a
short-term asset sale and savings program meant to generate approximately US$70 million in
capital revenue. Important measures have been taken by the Government since the October 2003
approval of CONPES No. 3251, namely:

0    A bill to amend the procurement law (Law 80) was presented to Congress, which includes: (i)
     mechanisms to facilitate the sale of public assets when deemedunnecessary to fulfill public
     functions; (ii)   the norms necessary to valuate assets according to market prices; and (iii)
     mechanisms to facilitate the efficient use of public assets through private law mechanisms.
     This general framework establishes basic conditions for efficient asset management and will
     be complemented by subsidiary regulations.

0    Decree No. 1830, approved on June, 3,2004, created the Inter-Sectoral Commission for
     Asset Management whose main function i s to optimize the efficient use of public assets via:
      (i) allocationofassetstofulfillpublicsectorobjectives; or(ii) transfertopublic
         the                                                                           their
     agencies and projects or to the private sector. The commission i s a very highlevel public
     entity comprised of the Ministerso f Finance and Public Credit, Environment, Housing and
     Land Development, Agriculture, and the Director of the National PlanningDepartment, in
     addition to a delegate appointed by the Executive. The Commission also possesses the
     functions and competences necessaryto set public policies governing asset management
     including the authority to: (i)      design and implement a reliable inventory of assets; (ii)




18Source: DNP
19For example, current figures on public asset inventories reflect the unreliable information systems used. Of the 302
entities at the national level, only 187 report information about their asset inventory to the Contaduriu General de la
Nacidn (CGN). Additionally, most entities report incomplete information.

                                                           24

   establish technical criteria for the use and transfer by public entities of public assets; and (iii)
    develop commercial schemes to facilitate the transfer of public assets.


0   The overall framework for managing assets derived from the sale of government owned
    institutions was included in a bill submittedto Congress on October 1,2004.

70.     The Government reported that between August 2002 and August 2004, approximately
US$34 million was obtained from the incomes and savings generated by the Asset Management
Program-a clear indication of the Government's commitment to this reform program.

71.     Remaining Challenges. The Inter Sectoral Commission for Asset Management i s the
agency in charge of implementing the directives contained inthe CONPES document. This
constitutes an important change in the legal and regulatory frameworks underlyingpublic asset
management in Colombia as prior to the Commission's creation, no agency incharge of asset
management existed within the Central Government. As a result, standard policies and
procedures have beendeveloped from scratch.

72.     Subsequent actions include: (i) development of manuals guiding the associated
                                         the
policies and procedures, as well as the provision of technical assistance and overall guidance to
other participating agencies, and management of a database system; and (ii)      the publication of the
inventory of assets owned by each agency, thereby increasing transparency and accountability.
The new approach will be based on four main pillars:


    0   Contribution to Public Investment in Social Programs: Priority will be given to
        identifying idle public real estate assets that can be transferred to the national social
        housing program. DNP will work together with the Ministry of Housing and Environment
        to design and develop a legal and financial scheme that will speed up process by which
        idle public real estate assets are transformed into social housing projects. This will the
        government to achieve its targets of reducing the existing housing deficit (1.5 million
        units). More specifically, social programs such as land reform (primarily for victims of
        violence), will be addressed.


    0   Urban Renovation: The state has a large amount of non productive assets that could be
        usedby local municipalities and districts for urban renovationprojects.


    0   Real Estate Leasing: Public real estate assets can be leased inthe market.


    0   Sales: Legal reforms submitted to Congress and functions assigned to the Commission
        will facilitate the implementation of commercial strategies to dispose of assets. This
        includes the contribution of idle public property to private real estate projects as a means
        to speedup the sale and generate value in the process. These schemes have proven
        successful in social housing programs at the municipal level (Metroviviendu) and could
        be adaptedto serve the Central Government's objectives.

73.     Protectingthe State against the Extraordinary Growth of Legal Claims. Litigation
against the State has a substantial fiscal impact in Colombia -- well above known impacts for
other countries. Typically, lawsuits against the State arise from conflicts related to extra-
contractual liability, followed by cases associated with human resource management. The

                                                   25

number of cases filed since 1994 has increased, and their outcomes have contributed negatively
to the current fiscal crisis. Inthe last nine years, actual payments made due to formal judicial or
arbitration decisions against the State exceeded $100billion pesos,2oor approximately US$40
million. Although this amount alone i s cause for serious concern, it only reflects the flow of
actual payments made. Estimates show the accumulated stock of contingent liabilities growing
at an alarming pace. An updated estimate shows that the stock of contingent liabilities arising
from litigation against the state i s close to 3.2% of GD?'.

74.     This scenario is further aggravatedby the fact that the State cannot afford to honor all
compensatory payments in a timely manner. An extremely highrate of penalty interest (up to 30
percent per year) i s applied, creating a "snowball effect" in the State's liabilities. This allows
ample margin for unethical practices, as creditors "prefer" to be paid late and benefit from a very
attractive return on their accounts receivable.

75.     Regardless of the complexity of the situation, three distinctive reasons underlie this
problem. First, there seems to be a web of civil servants, contractors, judges, attorneys, and so
forth engaged in coordinated corrupt practices that materialize in such practices as reciprocal
favors of poorly drafted contractual agreements, fake accusations and claims, high compensation
payments, and intentional "erroneous" decisions.22 Second, the Colombian State has a weak
capacity to defend itself in court. The private sector i s better equipped to retain expert legal
advice, and therefore their claims are exerted with much more rigor. Third, the legal framework
encourages the State to act passively with respect to demands and claims from individuals. In
labor and contracting legal issues, the State recognizes certain rights of counterparts, and in so
doing, compromises its own position.

76.     The Ministry of Finance, the PlanningDepartment, and the Ministry of Interior and
Justice are especially concerned with the fiscal threat posed by the State's weak legal andjudicial
performance. Together with the support of sector ministries, the Procuraduria, the Contraloria,
and the Consejo de Estado, these ministries are committed to elevate the State's capacity to
protect itself from legal claims. Moreover, strengthening of the State's institutional capacity in
this areais considered apreconditionfor an effective reform.

77.     With a view to strengthenthe state's legal defense, CONPES document 3250 of 2003
establishes guidelines underlying: (i) design of measures to prevent illegal claims; (ii)
                                         the                                                    the
defense of the interests of the State, bothjudicial and patrimonial; and (iii)   systematic changes in
the institutional structure, human and legal resources, and technological infrastructure. Although
this document was fairly general and did not provide a detailed diagnosis of the magnitude of the
problem, it was a reflection of the lack o f available information that i s being resolved at present.
There has been significant progress in terms of diagnosis of legal defense and the establishment
of strategic guidelines for reform.

78.     Key Policy Actions Undertaken. The Government's immediate objective i s to improve its
legal protection through the institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Interior and Justice's
(MIJ) Directorate of Legal Defense. Within the context of Law 790,which pushedthe public

** This appears to have happened, for example, in the recent decisions against the State for the cases of
Foncolpuertos and Termorrio.

sector modernization agenda and gave the Presidentspecial authority to restructure the Executive
Branch, Congress approved a specific clause to strengthen the MIJ's roles and responsibilities in
legal defense and mandated the implementation of an information system to track and raise alerts
regarding lawsuits. Consequently, the Directorate of Legal Defense i s carrying out a detailed
diagnosis and typology of the issues, causes, and costs associatedwith producing policy
guidelines to be approved officially by the government.

79.      Following the approval of CONPES 3250, the Government has taken important steps
towards its implementation which are creating the basis for adequate management and
organization of the State Legal Defense. Law 819 enacted in2003, requires that all public
agencies present detailed information on legal claims against the State before June 15 of each
year. Presidential Order No. 01-2004, enacted on March 30,2004, approved the form by which
such data i s collected and furthermore mandated that such information be delivered to all Central
Government entities. To date all Central Government entities and over 85% of the decentralized
entities have provided the required information.

80.     The Government has developed an integrated information system called JURISGOV to
manage such information. The system i s based on the one developed and used by the District of
Bogota and will enable both the calculation and adjustment legal claim values. The system also
enables State lawyers to access and update the information on pending legal claims. To date, the
system compiles data on all central government institutions, and nearly 85% of decentralized
institutions within the national government. The system today houses information on 58,200
cases, involving nearly 1200 lawyers who represent State interests.

81.     As proposed in the CONPES document, the Government has also begun implementing a
new management model for State Legal Defense activities. To this end, the Government has
finished compiling information on the current organizational structure of public legal offices and
departments According to this preliminary diagnosis, poor inter-sector coordination inlegal
defense and the lack of integratedjudicial management, work intandem to undermine the
efficiency of the State's legal defense policy. From this perspective, it i s imperative that
adequate decision-making processes be implementedto ensure proper risk assessments.

82.     Following another important recommendation of the CONPES document, the
Government completed an analysis of the main causes underlyingcontractual claims against the
State. The implementationof the study's conclusions i s expected to generate significant savings
and payment reductions. Similar liability and labor claim studies will follow. In accordance
with another important CONPES study recommendation, the Government has collected
information regarding the current levels of knowledge and training in legal defense management.
Such information will be used to design a training program.

83.     Remaining Challenges. Completion of the information system database and personnel
training on the systems' use and updating will constitute important next steps to both consolidate
the system's operations and to guarantee the delivery of reliable information. The
recommendations presented by the studies to tackle the main causes of litigation will need to be
implementedthrough Government rules and regulations aimed at modifying those bureaucratic
procedures that are eliciting Governmental losses. Also pending, i s the need to implement
important recommendations associated with the need to restructure legal offices and departments
and to train legal personnel. The sum of measures already implemented together with those


                                                 27

pending, will allow the Government to obtain more reliable information on the amount and value
of legal claims while adequate training will facilitate the Government's legal defense, thereby
reducing overall costs associatedwith such litigation.

84.      BudgetManagement. Despite two major reforms inthe last thirty years, the latest one
in 1989;the  Colombian budget system has yet to evolve into an effective tool to implement
public policy under a tight budget constraint and to ensure that the expenditures are carried out
effectively and efficiently. The strong legalistic tradition that characterizes Colombian public
administration has permeated the budgeting process and has transformed the Budget law into an
adjective law -essentially a compilation of other laws that generate expenditures - rather than a
substantive law that sets its own policy and stands on its own ground. The many effects of this
basic characteristic include: (i)high level of inflexibility in the budget; (ii) lack of a social
                                   a                                            the
welfare function that can set expenditure priorities within a strict budget constraint; and (iii)
                                                                                               the
executive branch's difficulty (specifically the Ministry of Finance) to manage fiscal aggregates
and control debt stocks.

85.     Constitutionally or legally mandatedtransfers have been increasing over time and
constitute the largest source of expenditure rigidities. The most important of these - revenue-
sharing with sub-national governments and transfers to universities and the social security system
-increasedfrom4.2% ofGDPin1991to 10.6%ofGDPin200223.Furthermore,the
Constitution mandates that transfers to sub-national governments through the Sistemu Nucional
de Participaciones must increase annually by a real 2% between 2002 and 2005, and by 2.5%
between 2006 and 2008. Although revenue-sharing arrangements and other legally-mandated
transfers are not uncommon in other countries, in Colombia their magnitude has surpassed the
public expenditure system's capacity to absorb transfers while ensuring that healthy fiscal
aggregatesare maintained and that sufficient "fiscal space" remains to address other public
policy demands.

86.     Inaddition to transfers, the Colombian budget system must also absorb a number of
earmarked revenues and minimumexpenditure mandates stemming from laws. According to the
latest estimates, there are six laws that earmark revenues for current expenditure items, seven for
capital expenditures, and forty-eight that establish special funds for specific purposes. These
revenue earmarks used up over 21% of total central government revenues in 200424. Once other
elements such as public sector wages (which are Constitutionally protected), debt service,
forward budgetingallocations, and security expenditures are added, it i s not surprisingto find the
government with virtually no fiscal room to maneuver and a rapidly increasing debt stock.

87.     The proliferation of these "expenditure laws" and forward budgeting (vigenciasfuturas)
has been exacerbated by the inexistence of a medium-term expenditure framework that could
both serve as a catalyst to discuss real budget priorities and could transform the annual budget
law into an effective policy implementation tool. As a result, from a structural point of view, the
Colombian public budget process i s a static, law-driven exercise in need of profound reforms to
become a modern instrument for policymakers.

88.       Inaddition, severalkeytechnicalelementsofthebudgetprocessneedtobeadjustedas
part of the reform process. Social expenditure i s highly favored over other types of expenditure.
I t s implementation i s subject to laxer controls thereby encouraging its growth. This situation i s
particularly worrisome in light of the fact that the definition of "social expenditure" that i s found
inthe current legislation is so broad that virtually any type of expenditure can qualify as "social."
Although the Constitution expressly forbids the earmarking of revenue, it gives an exception to
those for social expenditure. As a result most of the current earmarking laws have found a way
to easily fit within this very broad definition.

89.       Another consequenceof the highly legalistic nature of the budgeting process is the
prevalence of the budget law over considerations of fiscal stability. Inmany countries although
the budget law sets limits on spending, actual expenditure ceilings are established duringthe year
to respond to changing dynamics such as for example, revenue shortfalls. Inthe case of
Colombia, the budget i s an automatic authorization for spending agencies to commit up to the
appropriated amount. Even though actual payments are monitored closely by the Treasury and
cannot exceed cash availability, unpaidcommitments accumulate and become debt to be honored
the following fiscal year. A mechanism to control commitment aggregates must be devised and
used when necessary to discourage this practice.

90.       Key Policy Actions Undertaken. The challenges faced by the Government continue to be
formidable. A stepwise approach i s underway to meet such challenges which has includedto
date, both Constitutional reform measures as well as the redrafting of the key rules and
regulations governing the budget process. To date, two attempts at Constitutional reform were
undertaken: (i)  the 2003 Acto Legislativo, which, inter alia, sought to place preparation of the
National Development Plan within budgetary constraints and to empower the annual budget law
to reform permanent earmarks and entitlements; and (ii)      the 2003 Referendum, which sought to,
inter alia, freeze current expenditures, adjust the pension regime and abolish certain government
entities to produce savings. The Acto Legislativo was not passedby the Senate and the voter
turnout for the Referendum was just barely below the threshold necessary to render the results
valid (although all questions received between 83%-97% of "yes" votes). As a result, the
government must now rely exclusively on reforms to the "Organic Budget Code" - a compilation
of rules for budgetary management - to promote structural improvements inthe budget system,
although necessarily within the constraints of the current Constitution.

91.       Inaddition to its attempts at Constitutional reform, the Government carried out two
initiatives of its own during 2003 worth noting. First, it submitted the 2005 budgetbill in a
greatly improved format that included abundant performance statistics and information mandated
by the recently-approved Fiscal Responsibility Law. Such new information included inter alia a
medium-term fiscal outlook, tax expenditures, contingent liabilities, and the joint presentation of
current and capital expenditures within a functional classification.

92.       InOctober 2003 the government approved apolicy document (CONPES Document),
which set out the strategy for budget reform, as a first step toward paving the way for upcoming
reforms to the Organic Budget Code. This document puts forth a thorough diagnosis of what it
calls the what, how, and how much of the challenges being faced. This in itself i s an important
achievement as it demonstrates that consensus has been reached within the Executive Branch on
the overall reform objectives. The difficulty o f this endeavor cannot be overstated considering
both the Ministry of Finance's weak capacity to regulate expenditure aggregates and the fact that

                                                    29

several ministries benefit from budgetary rigidities. The document also presented for the first
time, an inventory of laws that generate rigidities inpublic expenditure.

93.      On December 16,2003, the Government submitted a proposed bill to amend the Organic
BudgetCode (OBC)25to Congress. According to Colombian legislation, this bill mustpass four
debates in Congress before it can be signed into law. To date, the bill has undergone one debate
and it i s expected that the second debate will take place shortly. The government expects the bill
to become law in early 2005. Some of the key elements of the OBC bill as presented to Congress
are as follows:

   Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The Fiscal Responsibility Law, passedin mid-2003,
    mandates preparation of a medium-termfiscal framework that mustcontain the
    macroeconomic program, annual expenditure ceilings, and a debt sustainability analysis. The
    OBC bill mandates the preparation of a Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework, consistent
    with the fiscal framework, which establishes resource envelopes by sector, which then
    become the basis for annual budget preparation.


0   Reduction of budgetary inflexibilities. Legally-mandated permanent entitlements and
    earmarked revenues add considerable inflexibility to public expenditure. The bill that i s
    currently in Congress seeks address such inflexibilities by: (i)        limiting such entitlements and
    earmarked revenues to "social expenditures", a term specifically defined in another chapter of
    the OBC bill; and (ii)    renderingthem temporary, by subjecting them to periodic
    Congressional reviews of their permanence. As regards those in existence, the OBC bill
    mandates that the Government present to Congress, within 6 months of its approval, another
    bill to adjust such entitlements and earmarked revenues to requirements under the law and to
    eliminate those found not compatible with the OBC. The OBC i s expected to reduce
    inflexibilities in the budget by 0.51% of GDP in 2006, accumulating to an overall 0.88% of
    GDPby 200926.

0   Definition of social expenditure and other classijkation standards. Current legislation
    defines social expenditure as that which "contributes to the overall well-being and improved
    quality of life of the population." This loose definition opens the door for most all
    expenditures to qualify as "social," thereby allowing them to indiscriminately benefit from
    the preferential treatment given to social expenditures inthe budgetary process. The OBC
    bill re-defines this concept more precisely and also introduces internationally-accepted
    standardsto the budget classification structure.


0   Control over budgetary aggregates by the Ministry of Finance. The OBC bill seeks to
    strengthenthe Ministry of Finance's control over expenditure aggregates by: (i)                effectively
    limiting the budget to one fiscal year; (ii)      preventingextra-system expenditures, such as those
    from loan operations, to circumvent the control process; (iii)         improving the connection
    between the budget and the annual cash-flow program; and (iv) establishing automatic
    restrictions to continued budget execution at the commitment level inthe event of unforeseen
    reductions in revenue or emergency expenditures.

benchmarks of the IMF Stand-by agreement.

0   Additions to the Budget. The OBC bill proposes that any increase in the budget must be
    reviewed by CONFIS to ensure such an increase i s fully compatible with the medium-term
    fiscal framework and ultimately approved by same.

    Budgetary control over parastatals. To prevent uncontrollableexpansions inthe overall
    public sector expenditure, the OBC bill seeks to mandate the ex-ante definition of
    expenditure ceilings for entities with public sector participation in their capital structure.

94.       ChallengesAhead. The submission of the OBC bill to Congress i s certainly not the end
of the road for budget reform in Colombia. The bill now needs to go through legislative debates
while retaining its substance -- a process in which the Ministry of Finance mustplay a permanent
and active role. This initiative i s as much a reform of the technical concepts of the budgetary
process as a pedagogical effort, to transmit to both Congress and society as a whole the message
that budget constraints must be acknowledged.

95.        The true test of this pedagogical process will be the submission of a second bill, shortly
after the passageof the OBC, that will abolish those revenue earmarks and permanent
expenditure entitlements determined to unnecessaryby the Ministry of Finance. If this bill i s
welcomed in Congress and survives at least a first debate, it will be an indication that the
messagehas been received and that perhaps another attempt at Constitutional reform through an
Acto Legislativo will be successful.

96.       Aside from securing the OBC's approval and submitting the supplemental bill to
eliminate rigidities, the government i s also faced with the challenge of establishing an effective
linkage between performance evaluation and the budget. The national performance evaluation
system (SINERGIA) has advanced substantially and indicators are now available to monitor
public sector performance. However, the current rigidity of the budget makes it difficult to
implement any meaningful linkages with appropriations. As the OBC process goes through
Congress, the government will have a clearer idea of what type of linkages can be achieved inthe
mediumterm.

97.       Development of Incentives for Efficiency Gains. As described in previous FIAL
documents, fiscal decentralization in Colombia instituted since the mid-1980s constitutes one of
the most important sources of budgetary rigidity. The prevailing system has created a supply-
based transfers mechanism devoid of significant requirements that could serve as incentives for
improved efficiency and effectiveness of public services. This situation i s particularly worrisome
inthe education sector, where transfers to decentralized entities represent approximately 12
percent of the total budget.

98.       Inan effort to correct this situation, the Government reformprogram includedthe
passage and implementationof Law 715 (approved inDecember 2001). This law established
new distribution criteria for sub-national fiscal transfers in education, to go into effect in 2004.
The Law was designed to transform the current supply-based transfers mechanism which i s
basedon reimbursements of actual service delivery costs, into a new demand-basedsystem based
on the allocation of transfers according to the number of students effectively attending school.




                                                   31

99.       Along the same line, the Government i s also pursuing the amendment and reallocation
of the National Royalties Fund(FNR) as a second venue to improve the fiscal decentralization
system. The goal here i s to reallocate funds currently spent on improperly planned and often
inappropriate public investment projects to finance education projects with a view to increase
school attendance of children in vulnerable groups.

100.      Key Policy Actions Undertaken. In accordance with a provision underLaw 715, the
2004 Budget sub-national transfers for education were based on the number of students
effectively enrolled in each regional service in the previous year and the unit cost (cost per
student) established by the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, in accordance with
commitments under the FIALprogram, the Government has also undertaken several audits of
sub-national registries to ensure that the number of reported students corresponds to those
attending class. These audits constitute an essential input to prevent fraudulent reporting and to
improve the registration and costing systems.

101.      Audit processeshave already been completed for 12 sub-national entities while 9
additional processes will be completed before end 2004. It i s worth noting that only 5 out of 12
audit reports show significant deviations between attendance and students registries. Hence
transfers to those regions were adjusted in accordance with provisions under Law 715. Notably,
the systems seem to be providing the right incentives to increase public education coverage and
to close the cost-per-student gaps untilnow served as indicators of the system's inefficiency and
inequality.

102.      As regards reform of the FNR, the Government submittedthe proposed reallocation as
part of the Referendum heldin October 2003. Since none of the Government's proposals elicited
the number of ballots in the Referendum necessary for the reform's approval, the FNRreform
has yet to be undertaken. Despite this setback, the Government demonstrated its unyielding
commitment to the reform effort by proceeding to reallocate 14 billion pesos inFNR resources to
sustain funding for the almost 30,000 newly enrolled students in 2003. The allocation was
further increased in 2004 to extend coverage to 12,000 additional students. Both measures were
made possible by Government's decision to restructure the FNR's governance scheme by
eliminating the National Royalties Commission, and transferring control over the allocation
process to DNP.

103.      Remaining Challenges. Given that Law 715 has already proven a powerful instrument
to promote efficiency and provide appropriate incentives for improved service delivery, it i s now
necessary to consolidate its applicationby modernizing sub-national student registries. This will
ensure that the allocation criteria i s properly implemented. To this end, the Ministry of Education
i s committed to provide the necessarytechnical assistance at the sub-national level and to
implement a modern and integrated information system which together will support sub-national
student registries. B y end 2005, it i s expected that all 78 accredited agencies will complete a
reengineering process and will be equipped with the new information system to improve their
students registries.

104.      As per the FNR, it i s clear that further steps mustbe taken to consolidate results
achieved to date and to make them sustainable. To this end, the Government will prepare and
further negotiate the complete restructuringof the FNRincluding: (i) criteria and priority
                                                                          new
areas for Funduse (mainly education) consistent with criteria and institutional responsibilities


                                                   32

established in Law 715; and (ii) introduction of a results-based system to monitor the proper
                                    the
use of these resources. The Government i s currently drafting regulations to complete the reform
of FNR in order to ensure its most effective and sustainable use.

105.      StrengtheningPublic Sector Procurement. Clear and transparent rules for
contracting and procurement are critical to makingefficient choices associated with the purchase
of goods and the selection and contracting of services, averting corruption in the process. In
Colombia, inefficiencies inpublic contracts are to a large extent attributable to a legacy of
traditional State patronage systems, and to a dispersedand highly diversified legal framework.

106.      At present, public procurement is governed by a variety of laws and regulations, replete
with overlaps and omissions, and a proliferation of regimes and exceptions. The current legal
scenario both debilitates monitoring and protects buyers and vendors of goods and services alike
from being accountable to each other -- providing ample opportunity for corruption. Moreover,
no central agency i s in charge of promoting reforms and determining rules that could introduce
greater transparency and efficiency in the procurement process. Overly complex and superfluous
procedures, such as the registry of contractors, still prevail, partly because the use of modern
information technology i s relatively weak while state agencies are ill-well equipped to use it.
Contract management and planning i s poor, and only large and experienced agencies follow good
practices. Procurement methods need to be redefined, standardized, and made more expeditious.
There i s furthermore a need to better distribute contract risk. Strategies for handling and
successfully resolving legal claims also need to be established. Finally, civil society has yet to
play a significant supervisory role, which further undermines accountability and transparency.

107.       Key Actions Undertaken. The government has taken important initial steps to rectify
the above deficiencies. On January 1, 2003, Decree 2170 went into effect, strengthening overall
transparency and objectivity of the public procurement process. The requirement that bidding
opportunities and documents be advertised on the web has been well received by both the private
sector and government officials. Another development welcomed by government agencies and
state companies alike was the introduction of "reverse auctions" for the procurement of standard                ,
goods. Although, it i s still too early to tell, several government institutions have successfully
usedthis tool with meaningful price reductions. On the other hand, some agencies complain that
the shopping procedures introducedunder the Decree have lengthened the procurement process
for standard goods -- a fact considered not necessarily bad, given the considerable discretion
which has hereto governed shopping procedures under Law 80. It i s expected that the new law
amending Law 80 will, on one hand, firm up provisos included inthe Decree, and on the other,
correct shortcomings.

108.      On October 20,2003, the Government approved a CONPES document establishing
guidelines to improve public sector procurement. This document describes the need to: (i)
simplify the system of various parallel procurement regimes; (ii)        introduce efficiency
considerations into the procurement process; and (ii)        establish a government entity responsible
for the oversight of public sector proc~rement~~.Based on the recommendations of the
CONPES, the Government submitted Bill 007/2003 amending Law 80 to Congress. The bill was
drafted with considerable input from both the private and public sectors. It includes a number of

Public Financial Management Project I1(MAFP 11).

                                                     33

positive amendments to Law 80 and establishes an electronic procurement information system.
An important proviso was introduced into the bill which sought to establish a government agency
responsible for the oversight of public procurement. Furtherdown the line, the government will
needto implement the institutional arrangementsdefined inthe revised Law 80, issue subsidiary
regulations, and restructure the national registry of bidders.

109.     Unfortunately, this bill was removed from legislative consideration in early 2004 in part
because it created a body to regulate the procurement function which was misunderstood to
constitute establishment of a new independent, bureaucratic body. The bill was later
reintroduced as Bill 035/2004. This new bill includes most of the original elements of Bill 007,
including the following:

0   Law applies to all sectors. The current legislation has a large number of "special regimes"
    for particular entities or sectors. These are eliminated and covered by the revised Law 80.
0   Enhancement of transparency in contracting. Measures related to contracting with
    cooperatives and national and international cooperation agencies are revised, as well as the
    public adjudication of bids and strengthening citizen oversight committees.
0   Focus on the technical and economic elements of bids during evaluation.
    New toolsfor procurement management. Some of these are: (i)        revision of thresholds, (ii)
    new guidelines for direct contracting, (iii) auctions, and (iv) revision of the system of
    guarantees.
0   Online Procurement. The Integrated System of Electronic Procurement of the State i s
    created, to promote the establishment of an e-procurement platform.

110.    However, the important provision aimed at creating a regulatory body for public sector
procurement was omitted inthis latest version of the bill. Inresponse, the Government explored
ways to create this regulatory body through mechanisms other than an amendment to Law 80,
and came to the conclusion that an Inter-Sectoral Commission could be created by Presidential
Decree, with the support of a technical team insidethe National Planning Department. The
Government expects to issue this decree shortly.

111.    Remaining Challenges. The most substantial challenges ahead are Congressional
approval of Bill 035/2004 and the creation and deployment of the normative body for public
sector procurement. As part of the implementation of the revisedLaw 80, important measures
need to be taken in terms of the unification of biddingand other documents, modification of
evaluation criteria, training, and the implementation of the online procurement platform, among
others. As a result of these actions, it i s expected that the government will achieve higher
transparency through advertising and dissemination of contract information; increased efficiency
through improved planning, standardization of procurement methods and thresholds, and
development of standard documents and manuals; and increased economy through development
of comprehensive bid evaluation and contract award procedures and balancing of contract risks.

 112.   Management Contracts for Government Agencies. The government i s pursuing
results-based public sector management as a means to promote the overall efficiency and
effectiveness of public services. To achieve this objective Management Contracts (MCs) are
being piloted under the FIALprogram to both enhance performance evaluation mechanisms and
to provide incentives for improved service delivery to semi-autonomous or de-centralized public


                                                   34

entities. The purpose of this new instrument i s to overcome the expenditure rigidities that prevail
incertain public agencies responsible for the delivery of services to the citizenry.

113.     The government has selectedtwo major de-centralized social protection agencies, the
Colombian Family Welfare Institute (Instituto Colombiano de Bienestur Familiar - ICBF) and
the Vocational/Technical Training Institute (SenticioNacional deAprendizaje - SENA), with
which it has signed MCs. These MCs attempt to establish specific performance indicators and
targets as well as innovative incentives linked to the budget, to create an adequateenvironment
for public managers to focus on improved service delivery.

114.     While performance indicators and targets were strictly linkedto the provision of social
services and implementation of key institutional projects and programs, incentives were based on
the possibility of increasing budget allocations in responseto a higherthan expected collection of
own revenues. The proposed scheme was designed in a way that additional allocations will not
affect the fiscal balance, as they will only be applied in the next budget cycle and based on
effective increments of revenue collection. Inthe case of the two pilot agencies, they would be
responsible for providing social services and collecting the non-tax revenues they are entitled to.
The use of those proceeds, however, mustbe authorized by the Ministry of Finance according to
limits (espaciofiscal) set inthe National Budget. By entering into the MCs, ICBF and SENA
will be authorized to increase their fiscal yield provided they: (i) the service delivery
                                                                        reach
targets; and (ii) increase revenue collection.

115.     Key Actions Undertaken. SENA i s a decentralized agency responsible for providing
technical education to targeted population groups (youth seeking their first job or elderly
workers) to ensure that they qualify to enter the labor force and/or to enhance prevailing
qualifications. SENA's services are funded via a mandatory contribution from all employees that
i s discounted from private and public entity payrolls. Currently, SENA's budget accounts for
approximately 1% of the total national budget.

116.     An M C was signed in October 2003 between SENA, the Ministry of Social Protection,
the Planning Department (DNP) and the Ministry of Finance. This contract established
commitments for all parties and set indicators and targets to be met by SENA in 2004 for it to
receive an increased budget allocation in 2005. In accordance with the provisions of the MC,
DNPundertook an independent assessmentof SENA's performance duringthis first cycle. Table
10 summarizes results observed under SENA's MC from October 2003 to June 2004.

117.     Although almost            performance targets were either met or surpassed under the MC,
the revenue collection target was not met. As a result, no exceptional budget allocation will be
granted to SENA in 2005 as a result of the MC.

118.     ICBF i s the National Agency that deals with the provision of basic health (nutrition)
services for the most vulnerable child age population and other groups under special risk. This
agency i s funded with non-tax revenues from mandatory contributions paid by private and public
employers, and its budget accounts for an equivalent of 1.8% of the national total budget.

119.     The M C for ICBF was also signedin October 2003 with the participation of the Ministry
of Social Protection, DNP and the Ministry of Finance. Table 11presents results of ICBF's
implementationof its M C as observed by DNP. As illustrated inthe table, while all but one
target were met or surpassed, the remaining target was 75% completed, so implementation was
judgedreasonably satisfactory. With regard to revenue collection, ICBFsurpassedthe target set
by the Ministry of Finance and therefore i s eligible to receive an additional budget allocation for
2005.

120.     Regardless of the specific results, MCs have proven to be applicable and suitable
instrumentsto promoteboth efficiency and afocus on results in semi-autonomous agencies like
SENA and ICBF. Although it i s difficult to pinpoint to what extent the improvementsinthese
agencies' service provision are attributable to the use of MCs, we can safely surmise that the
existence of a formal evaluation system, based on demonstrable results, and with possible
positive consequences, played the role it was intended to during this first year of its
implementation.

121.     Challenges ahead. The overall effectiveness and expansion of MCs can only be
confirmed if the instrumenti s used on sustained basis. It would be difficult to determine whether
the instrumenti s adequate or not if it i s not applied across at least a three-year period.
Effectiveness can only be ensured when commitments under executed Contracts are fully
complied with by all parties and when incentives are solely granted on a merit basis. To further
promote this instrument's effectiveness, broad dissemination and publicity are necessary to

promote stronger engagement from service agency staff members and end-users, as well as to
raise its profile among highlevel officials and Government authorities.

122.      Finally, as lessons are being learned inthe process, this instrument will need to be
evaluated and adjusted accordingly as well as expanded to other agencies in order to promote a
result-based culture within the public sector. To this end, DNP will conduct a more detailed
assessmentof the instrument itself and the manner in which it was applied this year. On the
basis of this analysis, DNP will subsequently propose adjustments and improvements to this
instrument to render it a more effective and relevant instrument.

123.      Management of the Public Sector Reform Process. State reform i s a complex
undertakingthat challenges any government's capacity. This also holds true for Colombia as it
continues its ambitious reform program. Putting inplace adequateinstitutional arrangements,
securing the necessary technical expertise, assembling implementation teams, ensuring political
support during all phases of the reform, and carrying out meaningful and useful evaluations and
assessments of the process have all been challenges for the leaders of the reform.

124.      The DNP oversees the implementation of the Public Administration Reform Program
(PRAP), which is in turn guided by CONPES document 3248 (October 2003) defining the
guidelines for the modernizationeffort29. The PRAP i s a complex program that demands active
participation from all central government entities and firm leadership from the DNP. The
reforms supported by the FIALwhich fall under the scope of the PRAP are Asset Management,
Legal Defense of the State, and Procurement. The components of Management Contracts and
Incentives for Efficiency Gains, although not part of the PRAP, are also led by DNP along with
the ministries responsible for the sectors of the entities under contract, as well as the Ministry of
Finance.

125.      Aside from these components which are under the leadership of DNPeither through the
PRAP or independently, the FIALhas several key components that fall underthe direction of the
Ministry of Finance. These are Tax Policy, Tax Administration, Fiscal Responsibility, and
Budget Reform. Although the Ministry of Finance does not have a formal structure such as the
PRAP to manage these key reform areas, the Technical Vice-Ministry of Finance has taken the
leadership role and has effectively enabled the reforms inthese components.

 126.     Key Actions Taken. The fundamental guidelines for the overall reform process have
been defined in CONPES document 3248 mentioned above, which further develops the reform
guidelines established in Presidential Directive lo3', and formally establishes them as
government policy. Inaddition, key fiscal reforms are being pursued under the leadership of the
Ministry of Finance in the areas of tax policy, tax administration, and fiscal responsibility.

 127.     Inorder to monitor theprogressofthe reformprogram, the government hasempowered
DNP's Public Policy EvaluationDepartment (SINERGIA) to establish a set of indicators to
gauge the effectiveness of the measures being undertaken. To date, the indicators have been

strategy.

defined and a subset of the baselines have been quantified. CONFIS has been given the
responsibility of monitoring the fiscal impact of the reforms3'.

128.      Remaining ChaZZenges. The monitoring exercise begun by SINERGIA still faces many
challenges. The breadth of the reform process requires a broad scope of sectoral expertise to
guide the evaluation process. Although the results to date are encouraging, including the 2003
and 2004 Presidential Messages to Congress prepared by SINERGIA, specific results interms of
the FIALagenda will have to be fully established by the end of the FIALprogram.

              IV.      BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

129.      The government's fiscal and institutional reform agenda i s supported by the Bank
through four single-tranche Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loans (FIAL). The Board
approved the first loan of the program in March 2003 for an amount of US$300 million out of an
estimated total of US$900 million for the entire program. The second FIAL ($150 million) was
approved in October 2003. The overall program has two objectives: first, to promote reforms
addressing fiscal rigidities necessary to attain the substantial fiscal adjustment underlying
sustainable macroeconomic stability; and second, to improve the provision of public services and
establish the institutional basis for higher efficiency and accountability in public expenditure.
The specific objectives of the FIALprogram are to:

        Increase tax revenue and reduce distortions inthe tax system;
        Modernize the tax administration;
        Promote the development of a sound fiscal responsibility legal framework;
        Reduce losses and generate revenues through improved asset management;
        Prevent massive losses to the State fromjudicial claims;
        Improve budget management with modern tools and legal reforms;
        Develop incentives for efficiency gains in sub national entities;
        Strengthen the public sector procurement system;
        Improve performance through management contracts for agencies; and
        Support a coherent and comprehensive reform implementation process.

130.      AchievementsunderFIALI.FIALIsupported a successful package of reform
measures, including: (i)   enactment of a tax reform law; (ii)  implementation of important tax
administration measuressuch as increased withholding at the source and improved information
exchange with banks; (iii)   enactment of a law authorizing a Constitutional referendum that,
among other things, reforms the royalty transfer system; (iv) enactment of Law 790 that
strengthens the Ministry of Interior and Justice's Directorate of Judicial Defense; (v) issuance of
Decree 2170 improving the public procurement system; (vi) creation of a commission for asset
management; and (vii) selection of two pilot agencies for the implementation of a management
contracts scheme.

131.      AchievementsunderFIAL 11. The measures supported by FIALIIyielded important
results, including: (i) issuance of all legislation to regulate the application of the tax reform law;
(ii) improvementsintaxadministration, includingspecificaudittargetsandthe

strategy; (iv) Congressional approval of an improved 2004 Annual Budget Law; (v) presentation
to popular vote of the Constitutional referendum; (vii) issuance of a new policy for legal defense
of the state; (viii) presentation to Congress of reforms to the public procurement law; (ix)
approval of an official asset management policy and the achievement of specific revenue targets;
(x) signature of management contracts with two government agencies; and (xi) enactment of a
Fiscal Responsibility Law.

132.       ExpectedResultsofFIAL111: This proposedthirdloan of the program is focused on
delivering the following policy reforms: (i)                    acceleration of the phase-out of tax exemptions for
profits of certain firms; (ii)             increased revenues derived from improvements in tax administration
of at least 0.3% of GDPbetween 2003 and 2004, while maintainingDIANadministrative costs
per peso collected below 0.96%; (iii)                   submission of a new budget law to Congress to improve the

         1. In2004 the wealth tax ends, therefore revenues decline 0.16 percent of GDP. Also, in that year tariffs collections decline by an
        additional0.1 percent of GDP. Law 863/03 introduces a temporary investment incentive in 2005 and 2006 inthe form of partial
        expensing. Therefore in 2005 income, and wealth tax collections will fall by 0.4 percent,ofGDP (0.2 percent of GDP due to wealth
        tax and 0.2 percent of GDP due to this incentive). In2006, income, wealth and other tax collections will fall 0.55 percent of GDP (0.2
        percent of GDP due to wealth tax and 0.2 percent of GDP due to this incentive).
        2. Annual tax collection increases, on average, by about 2 percent of GDP inthe 2003-2006period as a result of increasedtax

ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRESSAND IMPACT OF THE REFORMS
135.      The Government has shown a highlevel of commitment and resilience inpursuingthe
objectives of the reform, which is largely based on the President's campaign platform and his
initial presidential directives for public sector modernization. Duringthe first two years of the
Uribe Administration, the executive has worked with Congress to enact major reforms in tax
policy, pensions, labor, and fiscal responsibility.

136.       The tax reform supported by FIALhas shown important results and statistics show that
revenue has increased substantially. Nonetheless, the government is still considering further
measures to raise revenue while observing international best practices in tax policy. To


                                                                      40

complement the tax reform and as a preludeto the upcoming budget reform, Congress approved
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which sets out important principles for fiscal sustainability and
transparency.

 137.    Expenditure-side reforms are more complex and some will only show results in the
medium or long term. However, some indicators that show that the reform process i s on track
are the following: (i)  the government has taken the overhaul of its budgeting system very
seriously and has obtained assistancefrom the Bank, the IMF, and other entities indesigningthe
new budget law that was submitted to Congress in December 2003; (ii) 2004 and 2005
                                                                                the
Budget Bills that were submittedto Congress incorporated substantial improvements in terms of
medium-term planning and the provision of useful information for fiscal analysis; (iii) 2004       the
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework was issued for the first time in compliance with the Fiscal
Responsibility Law; (iv) strategies have been defined and institutional arrangements established
to oversee areas such as asset management, legal defense of the state, and public sector
procurement; and (v) an innovative management system i s being piloted to enhance
accountability for results.

 138.    Nevertheless, a number of events have taken place that have affected the government's
ability to regulate fiscal outcomes, and in some instances, reversed achievements interms of
revenue-increasing or expenditure-containing measures. Some of the most important events that
have negatively impacted the reform process are as follows:


0   Failure of the 2003 Referendum. The 2003 Referendum proposed a number of measures
    with substantial fiscal impact, interms of enhancing the effectiveness of and participation in
    the expenditure process and also in terms of controlling expenditure aggregates. These
    included:(i) enhanced citizen participation in the investment budgeting process; (ii)           ceilings
    on pensions benefits; (iii)a mandatory pensions-eligibility age of 55; (iv) a 2-year freeze on
    public sector wages; (v) the elimination of regional Contralorius and assignment of the
    savings to education and health; (vi) a 2-year freeze on current expenditures at the 2002 level;
    and (vii) a revised system of royalty transfers to sub-national entities. As part of the FIALII
    preparation process, the authorities presented an estimate of the fiscal impact of the
    referendum of 0.7 % of GDP in 2003, 1.3% in 2004, and 0.8% in both 2005 and 2006.


 0  Rulings of the Constitutional Court. There have been two key rulings of the Constitutional
    Court that have affected fiscal reforms supported by the program. First of all, the
    Constitutional Court ruled in September 2003 that the 2% VAT created through Law 788 in
    December 2002 was unconstitutional. This 2% rate was to be applied to previously exempt
    or zero-rated goods -- mostly basic foodstuffs and certain services. The Court ruled that this
    measure went against a constitutional principle of progressive taxation. Second, the Court
    ruled in October 2003, that the wage appropriations inthe 2004 budget were insufficient and
    had to be increased, since wages have constitutional p r ~ t e c t i o n ~ ~ .

  139.   The initial vision of the fiscal reform process was the following: Law 788 of 2002
would introduce substantial structural improvements into the tax system, reducing distortions,
enhancing the VAT base, eliminating income tax exemptions and ultimately increasing revenue


~~




32 The Referendum contained a wage-freeze measure, which would have overruled the constitutional protection for
wage increasesduring two years.

                                                     41

ina sustainable way. Inparallel, the Referendum would generatesubstantial reductions in
expenditures and transfers to the social security system and public sector reform measures would
generate additional savings. Together with high expectations for growth, these revenue and
expenditure measures would all but eliminate the fiscal gap by the end of the presidential period.
The failure of the Referendum and the Constitutional Court rulings constituted major setbacks
that forced the government to undertake alternative measures, including additional rounds of tax
reform with questionable income-generating measures (such as an increase inthe financial
transactions tax) to fill the fiscal gap. Expectations for the fiscal balance became more
pessimistic, and the current outlook as agreed with the IMFdiffers significantly from that of mid-
2002.

140.      It should also be noted that the estimates of fiscal impact of the program's institutional
reform measures were overestimated. In the case of asset management, the short-term revenue
generating work plan i s expected to generate the US$70 million originally forecast in the four-
year period; however, the savings and revenue derived from the actual improvement in asset
management practices will likely not be seen during the lifespan of the FIALprogram, as
originally envisioned. With respect to the legal defense of the State component, substantial
savings were originally expected duringthe 2002-2006 period from improved management of
lawsuits against the State. However, now that improved information i s available on the typology
and size of the contingent liabilities derived from litigation, no effect i s expected inthe short-
term expenditure flows becausethe liabilities to bepaid out duringthe next four years
correspond to sentences that took place before the modernization process began. The true fiscal
effect of the improvements in legal defense will be seen interms of the stock of contingent
liabilities in the next 2-3 years, and in terms of expenditure flows, inthe next 8-10 years. Finally,
the delay in the approval of the reforms to Law 80 (Procurement Law) has shifted the first year of
fiscal impact of the modernization of the procurement system to 2005.

141.      Table 13 shows the difference between the fiscal impact of the FIAL-supported
measures to date, with the original expectations at the outset of the program.

142.     On balance, tax revenues have increased more than originally expected, due to both
structural improvements inthe tax system as well as revenue-enhancing measuresthat should be
dismantled in the medium term. However, expenditures have not been kept in check, primarily
because of the failure of budget containment measures such as the Referendumor the proposed
wage freeze for the central government, which when added to debt service and pensions transfer
obligations, prevented the attainment of the original fiscal targets. At this time, however, these
realities have been internalized and the government i s continuing fiscal reform measureswith
renewed commitment. The Medium-Term Fiscal Framework sets a path for debt sustainability,
and measuresfor budgetary control, public sector reform and pensions reform should bring the
country back towards more rapid fiscal recovery. Inthe absence of FIAL-supportedmeasures,
especially on the revenue side, the current fiscal outlook would be much bleaker. Furthermore,
the continuation of expenditure-side reforms supported by the FIAL, when added to other
structural reforms being carried out, will no doubt provide the necessary foundations for
sustainable fiscal balances.

LINKTO CAS
143.      Under its objective of achieving fast and sustainable growth, the CAS approved in
December 2002 indicates that: "The main objective of the I B R D ' s strategy in terms of the
macroeconomic framework would be to support Colombia's continued fiscal adjustment,
including the quality of the adjustment, as key for achieving faster and sustainable growth." To
support this objective, the IBRD, in close collaboration with the IMFand the IDB, i s preparing a
Programmatic series of Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loans (total US$900 million) to
support fiscal adjustment, including reforming the tax system, strengthening the tax
administration, implementing a fiscal responsibility law and reformingthe public sector. These
operations will support measures to reduce tax exemptions and expenditure rigidities while
ensuring better quality and coverage of public services and investment. Tax reform measures
will: (i)simplify and expand the tax base (focusing on reducing exemptions to the VAT and the
individual and corporate income tax); and (ii)             reduce the disparity of tax rates for the VAT. The
program would also include measuresto develop public sector capacity to make better use of
state assets, including liquidation, privatization and maintenance. Furthermore, these operations
will support improvement of tax administration, with emphasis on reporting and intermediation


                                                             43

by the financial system, auditing and collection. A fiscal responsibility law would help reduce
the fiscal gap by putting targets and ceilings that serve as safeguards against excessive
expenditure and add transparency to budget and treasury operations."

144.     All of these CAS objectives remain part of the FIALprogram, and some additional,
important elements were added as part of the government's strategy for fiscal and institutional
reform. Among the elements not envisioned specifically in the CAS as part of this program are:
(i) overhaulofthebudgetsystemthroughanewOrganicBudgetCode;(ii)
   the                                                                            strengthening
public sector procurement and the legal defense of the State; (iii) reform of the royalty
                                                                    the
transfer system; and (iv) the introduction of management contracts with public sector entities to
foster performance monitoring and incentives.

145.      The CAS scheduled the first loan of the program inthe amount of US$300 million for
FY03 followed by two loans of US$l50 million each in FY04 and FY05, and a final US$300
million loan inFY06. Based upon discussions with the government regarding their financing
requirements and the pace of the FIAL-supported reforms, the amount for this third loan was
reduced to US$lOO million.

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
146.     The Bank has collaborated extensively with the IMFinthe preparation of the FIAL
program, including the participation of the Colombia Senior Economist of the IMFinFIALI
identification missions and inkey review committees inside the Bank. The collaborationhas
also extended into technical areas of the Fund, such as the joint review of the proposed Organic
Budget Code with a specialist from the Fiscal Affairs Department. Furthermore, all FIAL
measures are fully consistent with the IMFStand-By Agreement signed with Colombia.

147.     The IDBhas approved an investment operation of US$18.3 million designed to support
the implementationof the overall reform program and specific support to asset management,
legal defense of the State, and information technology. Both task teams are working inclose
coordination since the IDB's components of asset management and legal defense of the state will
support and be consistent with the FIAL's policy matrix.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

148.     The programmatic series of Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loans to support public
sector reform and fiscal adjustment i s the core of the Bank's support to the reform efforts of the
government. The FIALprogram shares some areas of mutual interest with the Programmatic
Labor Reform and Social Sector Adjustment Loan (PLRaSSAL), the first of which was approved
by the Bank during the second quarter of FY2004 and the second in the second quarter of
FY2005. The task teams have worked in coordination, and the two main areas of interaction are
(i)Management Contracts for Government Agencies. Both programs seek to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) and the National
Training Service (SENA). The FIAL approaches this issue through the creation of a new
instrument for improving management that can then be replicatedto other entities and sectors.
PLRaSSAL, on the other hand, i s concerned with the substantive impact of the managerial




                                                  44

reforms on quality and coverage of service delivery;33and (ii)         Incentives for Efficiency Gains.
This FIALcomponent hasthe objective of introducing incentives that promotethe use of results-
based management to improve efficiency and effectiveness of fiscal transfers to the sub national
levels.

149.      In addition, the FIALprogram is highly interrelated with the current Public Financial
Management Project ZZ (MAFPII), aimed at strengthening budgeting, tax administration, public
investment management, procurement, and results management. This Bank-financedTechnical
Assistance Loan (TAL), in implementation since August 2001, i s the most important source of
technical assistance funding for the implementation of the FIALpolicy actions. Although it was
approved before the FIALdiscussions began, its objectives are fully consistent with the FIAL
policy matrix. The components that are within its scope and are receiving assistance are tax
policy, tax administration, budgeting, and procurement. Support for management contracts for
government agencies and the monitoring of the overall reform process also fall within its scope,
and technical assistancewill be made available shortly.

150.      Technical Assistance. Many of the technical assistancerequirements of several key
components-particularly         tax administration, budgeting,and procurement-as          well as the
financial management or evaluation features of other components, will be partially or fully
provided by the MAFPIIproject which i s currently inexecution. In addition, the Government
and the IDB are considering including technical assistance support for other FIALcomponents-
particularly asset management and legal protection of the State-under             an IDB-TAL project
currently under preparation. Moreover, the GOC and the Bank are exploring complimentary
grant financing through Institutional Development Facilities (IDFs) or Policy and Human
Resources Development grants (PHRD) to support the reform process. Table 14 summarizes the
technical assistancearrangements.

with the "substance" of the reforms inICBFand SENA.

LESSONSLEARNED


151.     The FIALprogram i s part of a very complex process of fiscal and institutional reform
that has had both successes and setbacks. From this experience, a number of lessons have been
learned which mostly serve to temper expectations and identify potential risks ahead. Some of
the key lessons learned are as follows:

       Expenditure-side reforms take time and show results in the medium to long term. It i s
       relatively easy to be over-optimistic interms of the short-term impact of expenditure-side
       reforms, especially those that require institutional strengtheningprocesses or legal
       reforms. Even those that are quickly implemented, such as the reduction inpersonnel
       derived from an institutional downsizing process, have positive impact inthe medium
       term only, once the up-front costs (such as severancepayments) are paid out. Inthe case
       of FIAL,the short-term fiscal impact of the asset management, procurement, and legal
       defense components was initially heavily over-estimated. The budget reform process will
       likely show its effect on reduced rigidities inthe short term, but will not affect
       expenditure aggregates for some time.

       Political realities must be taken into consideration and used to develop realistic
       expectations. Countries living under democratic regimes have different levels of checks
       and balances, and the case of Colombia i s particularly complex. The foundations of
       public sector planning are highly participatory and legally bindingin nature; the 1991
       Constitution strengthens decentralization and regulates many aspects of policymaking in
       great detail; Congressional debates are very lively and substantial, and voting i s seldom
       along party lines; and the Constitutional Court i s very involved in analyzing public policy
       decisions and has often overturned laws and decrees. All of these elements add
       legitimacy to the democratic process, but at the same time also add uncertainty to any
       reform agenda. Reform in the Colombian context, therefore, i s often a step-by-step,
       piecemeal exercise, even for a president such as Alvaro Uribe who still maintains an
       exceptionally high level of popular support.

        Technical assistance is indispensable, as is collaboration with other donors. It has
       become clear with time that the implementation of the FIAL-supportedreforms would
       have been extremely difficult inthe absence of sources of technical assistance. All of the
       key fiscal reforms, including tax administration and budgetingreform, as well as
       procurement and overall program monitoring, were carried out with the support of IBRD-
       financed MAFP IItechnical assistance loan. Reforms in asset management and legal
       defense of the State benefit from both an IDB-financedtechnical assistance loan and two
        separateWorld Bank grants. These instruments helped strengthen the analytical
       underpinnings of the program, as well as providing fundingfor consultancy services,
        equipment,and training to actually implement the reforms.

       Instrumentsfor reform may change over time, depending on strategic choices; therefore,
       focus should be on outcomes wherever possible. Inthe area of tax administration, the
        government i s implementing a comprehensive modernization effort based upon a number
        of different elements, including unified taxpayer registries, improved information flows
        with the banks, implementation of modern IT platforms, institutional restructuring, and

                                                 46

       others. The original focus of the FIALconditionality was on the nature and sequencing
       of these instruments, both of which change frequently as part of a complex institutional
       process. As a result, the focus of the conditionality of this component shiftedto results in
       terms of revenue effects of tax administration reforms and increases in efficiency of the
       DIAN.

   progress andfinal goals of the reform process are applied to the reforms achieved to date and are made
   available countrywide.



156.    Triggers for the Fourth Operation. A subset of the policy actions for FIALIV
described in this operation's Policy Matrix has been identified as the key benchmarks that will
demonstrate progress inthe reform program, and will be requiredbefore that loan i s submitted to
Board consideration. These triggers are:

   0   The overall debt to GDPratio of the borrower's public sector shall be below 46% of GDP


   0   The Borrower i s in full compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law 819/2003)
       and i s maintainingrevenue, expenditure, and debt stock numbers in line with the
       borrower's Medium-Term Fiscal Framework


   0   The Borrower's Congress has passed the new Organic Budget Code, and the borrower has
       issued the regulations necessary for its implementation and i s in full compliance with its
       mandates




                                                         49

                          VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

157.     The FIALprogram is beingimplemented by the Ministry of Finance (MHCP) with the
support of the National PlanningDepartment (DNP.) MHCP will ensure the full execution of the
policy measures and "triggers" established in the program. These activities will be carried out in
close coordination with DNP.

158.     Given the size and relative complexity of the program, the General Vice-Minister of
Finance, working closely with the Deputy Director of DNP, will be responsible for strategic
management of the program. These two agencies have the consensus-building capacity and
political, technical, and operational support required to assume this responsibility. Both are part
of CONFIS, participate actively in Congressional debates and Cabinet meetings, and serve as
counterparts to the IMFand other multilateral agencies as representatives of the Finance Minister
and the Director of DNP. In addition, the Vice-Minister of Finance and the Deputy Director of
DNP are responsible for the execution of MAFP-11and its respective institutions. They will be
capable of establishing synergies and synchronizing the parallel development of MAFP-11and
FIAL-II.

159.     Strategic management of the program will involve the following actions: (i)   serving as
the interlocutor of the national government with the Bank; (ii)supporting and managing the
fulfillment of the policy actions of the various program components; (iii) coordinatingthe
development of the planned actions and reforms with those responsible within the various
entities; and (iv) compiling and sendingthe technical, legal, and administrative information
required for the execution of the policy measures of the program.




160.     For the development of the duties required for the strategic management of the program,
the Vice-Minister of Finance has the support of professionals within the Superior Council of
Fiscal Policy (CONFIS) and within the general directorates of Macroeconomic Policy, Taxes and
Customs (DUN), Public Credit, Budget, and the Treasury. For the development of the duties
that correspond to DNP, DNPhas the support of professionals in the directorates of the Public
Administration Reform Program, Infrastructure, Social Development, Justice and Defense,
External Credit, and Results Evaluation.



                                                 50

161.     As part of the planned measuresinFIAL, the government has developed a system to
monitor and evaluate state reform, and has announced monitoring indicators for public sector
reform progress on the DNP website. The follow up and evaluation of FIALIIIresults will be
undertaken by: (i)  the DNP (for components of Asset Management, Legal Defense of the State,
Procurement, Management Contracts, and Management of the Reform Process), through the
Evaluation System for Public Management (SINERGIA); and (ii)         MHCP/CONFIS (for
components of Tax Reform, Tax Administration, Fiscal Responsibility, Budget Reform,
Incentives for Efficiency Gains, and Management of the Reform). The results of FIALIIIwill
comprise part of the findings of the government's National Development Plan for 2002-2006,
and will be reported on in the President's annual report to Congress. The government has the
mandate to follow up in terms of effectiveness, productivity, and efficacy, and the results of the
follow-up and evaluation will be reported to the Bank by means of periodic reports.

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS
162.     The original scope of the public sector reformprocess included the elimination of at
least 40,000 jobs in the central government, of which 30,000 were to come from the elimination
of the posts of employees who reach retirement during the next few years, and the rest from the
elimination of staffed positions. The revised projections to 2006 have been reduced to a total of
24,000 posts, of which 17,000 have already been cut. These cuts stem from the "vertical reform"
element of the agenda, which so far has restructured over 140institutions, including the closure
of 30. All staff deemed redundant are receiving the legally established severance package, and
those who are not legally entitled to removal benefits (such as temporary or directly appointed
staff) will receive at least one year's salary as severance. Inaddition, all those who lose their
employment will be entitled to participate in a retraining and career-counseling program. Finally,
the government has indicated its commitment to the protection of vulnerable groups and will
ensure that single mothers without job alternatives, the handicapped, and those about to reach
retirement age will not be removed.

163.     Inadditionto thereductioninpublic sector employment, there areother measuresinthe
government's reform agendathat have an unquestionably negative effect on the country's lower-
income groups. The most evident i s the introduction of the VAT on all previously exempt goods
and services, including basic foodstuffs, education, health, and transportation, which has a higher
proportional impact on the poor. Although this measure was struck from Law 788 by the
Constitutional Court, it i s still inthe government's agenda for future tax reform efforts. A new
tax reform bill was submitted in September 2004 which includes another attempt at expanding
the VAT to excluded or zero-rated items. It should be notedthat although broadening of the
VAT base is inline with international good practices in tax policy, its impact on the poor should
be mitigated through focused expenditure, at least in the short run; however, uncertainty over the
actual passage of this tax reform makes it possible that this measure will never actually take
place.

164.     Inorder to compensate for the social impact of the fiscal adjustment and the effects of
the armed conflict in depressedareas of the country, the government has bolstered its social
protection network. One of the main programs o f this network i s the Red de Apoyo Social (RAS)
which for 2003-2005 i s expected to disburse over US$500million with the support of the Bank




                                                   51

and the IDB.34The largest component of the RAS is Fumilius en Accidn which provides a cash
subsidy to 350,000 low income families in the form of a monthly US$20 nutrition grant per
family subject to regular visits by children under 7 to health centers and a US$3-$6 subsidy per
child to promote school attendancein both elementary and secondary education. Government
expenditure on this program doubled between 2002 and 2003 and total expenditure on the social
protection network reached0.5 percent of GDP. The government i s committed to sustaining this
level of investment through end-2006.

165.      Although FIALmeasures may have a short-term negative effect on unemployment and
income distribution (albeit mitigated through substantial social expenditure), the long-termeffect
will unquestionably be pro-poor. First, it will help protect the macroeconomic framework of the
country by reducingthe likelihood of widespread government fiscal crises. This i s important
since, as noted, the Bank's analysis shows that negative macro shocks are the most important
cause of poverty increasesin Colombia. Second, FIALwill also ensure that through the fiscal
strengthening program, in particular the tax reforms, more resources will become available to
help ensure the allocation of adequate public resources to social programs and reduce the
insecurity that affects particularly those that lack the resources to protect themselves. This i s
especially pertinent for education and health, facilitating the provision of public services for the
poor. Third, FIALsupports measuresto improve the efficiency and coverage of these services,
benefiting the poor directly. This i s to be achieved through better budgeting, the results
agreements and their evaluation, and more transparent procurement. Together these should
ensure that essential public services are more efficiently available to those who could not
otherwise obtain them on their own.

166.      One issue that was brought up as part of the Bank safeguards assessment duringFIALII
was the elimination of the capital gains (or "occasional gains") tax exemption for individuals
involuntarily selling their property to the State for public works (through eminent domain). It is
believed that through the elimination of this tax exemption, the seller now faces a net patrimonial
loss once the transaction i s completed and taxes are paid35. This discussion has now been taken
to a broader arena as part of an overall review of the country's resettlement policies, in which the
Bank's resettlement team i s working closely with the government, through the Ministry of
Housing and Environment. This effort i s expected to produce a broad strategy to address the
issue of resettlement, including the prevention of net wealth loss to the displaced.

PARTICIPATIONAND CONSULTATION


167.      The basic elements of the reforms supported by the FIALprogram were conceived
before this administration assumed office. Inpreparation for the May 2002 elections, then
candidate Alvaro Uribe and his team prepared a campaign document called "Munifiesto
Demo~ra`tico~~", referred to as the "100 points", which outlined 18 areas where the
                     also
government would focus its efforts if elected. Among these are the candidate's vision on public


34BIRF-7017 (Empleo en Accidn Program, US $100 million), BIW-7050 (Fumilius en Accidn Program, US $ 150
million) and IDB-1280/OC-C0(Red de Apoyo Social Program, US $270 million).


35There is, however, a discussion in progress over whether this constitutes an actual patrimonial loss or if it i s an
anticipated collection on an already accrued liability.

sector modernization and tax reform. After the elections in which Uribe obtained 53% of the
vote, this document became the central element for the design of the government program,
including the FIAL. According to the document itself, the definition of the "100 points" was
carried out in a participatory manner, through 30 workshops, 60 seminars on specialized subjects,
over 600 "conversatorios" (dialogues) during2000 and 1,000 in 2001.

168.      The National Development Plan was subsequently prepared, following the participatory
mechanisms defined in the Constitution. This document was approved in Congress and contains
the central elements of the "Estado Comunitario, described previously in this document. The
                                                     "

four pillars of the strategy, including a modern public sector, have become the centerpieces of the
government's reform program.

 SUPERVISION
169.      Each loan of the FIALprogram i s a single-tranche operation where all conditions
necessary for full disbursement are complied with prior to Board presentation. From this point of
view, there are no supervision requirements once the loan i s approved and disbursed. As part of
the preparation of the subsequentloan, evidence is obtained that no significant slippage has taken
place and that the overall reform program remains on track, particularly through compliance with
the follow-on operation's triggers. An implementationcompletion report (ICR) is prepared for
each operation, and will be prepared for this proposed third loan of the FIALprogram.

COUNTRYFIDUCIARY ENVIRONMENT FORDEVELOPMENT POLICY LENDING

170.     Colombia'sfiduciary environmentfor DPLis consideredadequate. Inrecent years
Colombia has made important progress in its Public Financial Management (PFM) systems and
improvedtransparency in public finance, due to reforms in critical areas supported by the World
Bank and the Inter-American DevelopmentBank (IDB).

 171.    Important initiatives include adoption of Public Administration Renovation Program
(PRAP) that includes anti-corruption and fiscal responsibility measures37.The government that
took office inAugust 2002 has also improved the administration of publicly owned banks,
clarified responsibilities for managing expenditures among different levels of government, and
introduced modern accounting concepts and procedures. These initiatives were supported by the
rollout of new information systems covering the budget and local government finances, as well
as the monitoring of public procurement.

 172.    The Bank, in coordination with the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank (IDB), carried out
a CFAA for Colombia in 2003-2004. The CFAA was coordinated with the IBRD's PER and
2003 Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loans (FIAL), and the International Monetary Fund's
May 2003 Fiscal Transparency Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC), which cover other
aspects of Colombia's fiscal management. Formal dissemination events for the the CFAA
(including the Country action plan and associated programs, which has been endorsed by the
Government) are planned for March 2005.

 173.    This diagnostic review pointedto a series of important advances but also remaining
weaknesses inpublic sector management in Colombia. The country has made progress in


37The government enacted an important FiscalTransparency and ResponsibilityLaw in 2003, and strengthenedthe
disciplinary code for public servants.

                                                   53

modernizing and automating its PFM and information systems, especially with regard to the
Integrated Financial Management System (SIIF) implementation. This progress has been uneven,
however, and the government lacks an integrated vision of an overall PFMsystem. Inorder to
remedy this shortcoming, the Inter-Governmental Policy and Information Management
Committee were created.38 These problems and a lack of accountability for results have limited
the quality and effectiveness of public financial management. Budgetformulation is also
fragmented, which prevents the budget from being used as a strategic governance tool. These
problems have made PFM responsibilities diffuse, and duplication and overlapping agency
responsibilities prevent the government from setting and achievingclear PFM goals.

174.     Planned revisions to the Organic Budget Code should be used to strengthen budget
programming and control by establishing a new mechanism to coordinate expenditures across a
medium-term framework that takes into account financial programming goals and anticipated
resource availabilities. Also, the implementationof the single treasury account and the direct
payment to suppliers would improve the management of cash on hand and inbanks, and increase
the transparency of the system.

175.     The Treasury Directorate's SIIF-which     includes budget,treasury and accounting
modules-registers      and incorporates timely and reliable information on the expenditure process.
The government has also developed a National System for Evaluation of Results of Public Sector
Performance (SINERGIA)to evaluate the results of public expenditures, and begun putting in
place a provinciaUmunicipa1integrated information management system (FOSIT) and programs
to track financial information and purchases.

176.     Inrecent years, the government has made important progress instrengthening its debt
management capacity through technical and institutional strengthening of the Finance Ministry
and implementation of a new public debt information system. The 2003 Fiscal Responsibility and
Transparency Law strengthened regulation of sub-national government indebtedness, although
this still requires attention. Furthermore, the government has put inplace an information system
to register contingent liabilities on national, sub-national, and public works contracts; the system
includes the creation and operation of contractual contingency funds. All operations are in the
public domain, and information on debt i s publishedon a regular basis.

177.     Under the 1991 Constitution, fiscal control i s vested in the external and internal control
systems. The Comptroller General, Colombia's supreme audit institution, and the regional
comptrollers are in charge of external audits, and each public entity has an internal control unit.
The fiscal control system also includes the Auditor General, who i s responsible for supervising
administrative management of the regional comptroller offices. IDB i s supporting a multi-year
project to modernize the Comptroller General's Office and improve its audit capacity through
training and improved information technology systems.

178.     Based on the CFAA conclusions, Colombia's country fiduciary risk rating i s moderate.
The CFAA examined the risks posed by weaknesses inpublic financial management systems, the




38Decree 3816, dated 12/31/03.

                                                  54

way in which public resourcesflow .inthe system, and the strengthand reliability of the control
framework applied to financial transactions3'.

179.     The administration of projects financed with World Bank and Inter-American
Development Bank resources has generally been satisfactory, although government fiscal
adjustments cause problems in providing counterpart resources, and restrictions in expenditure
and cash flow management.

180.     PFMimprovements already under way in Colombia or triggered by the CFAA action plan
recommendations, and the implementationof the IBRD-financed Public Financial Management
Project II(MAFP II),     are all consistent with the Government's long-term focus to improve and
modernize public sector management and are expected to contribute reasonable fiduciary
assurance as IBRD shifts increasingly to development policy lending.

181.     The Bank has reviewed the IMF's latest assessment of the Borrower's Central Bank,
which shows that the control environment of the Banco de la Repziblica i s satisfactory. No
remedial actions are necessary in terms of foreign exchange fiduciary arrangements.

CREDIT ADMINISTRATIONAND FLOW OFFUNDS
182.      The IMFSafeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of Colombia (Banco de la
Republica) concluded that the control environment, procedures and regulations governing the
bank's operations are generally adequate. The Bank will disburse the loan proceeds into foreign
currency account of the Borrowers Central Bank, which will inturn credit an account of the
Borrower's Treasury. From this account, the loan proceeds will enter the Government's budget
process and become appropriately recorded and accounted in the integrated financial information
system (SIIF).

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
183.      There are no specific country policies supported by the proposed operation which are
likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural
resources.

RISKSAND RISK MITIGATION
184.      Although all conditions for disbursement will be complied with prior to Board review of
this proposed loan and full disbursement i s certain to take place, the program is considered high-
riskhigh-return in terms of overall impact. At thisjuncture, and looking ahead at the two last
loans of the program, the following risks are the most relevant:

    0     Uncertainpolitical environment. The country i s now debating a possible constitutional
         amendment to allow the sitting president to runfor re-election. This discussion has been
         absorbing considerable time, energy, and political capital from the government which
         may affect the reforms to be considered by Congress. Discussions with Congress have
         been difficult and the passageof key legislation for the reform process could be delayed.


39The moderate rating is based on a fiduciary risk assessment framework of 10 good practice principles and 20
benchmarksfor assessingadherence to them developed by Britain's Departmentfor International Development
(DFID). The CFAA team assessedhow actual practice in Colombia measures against the benchmarks for each
principle.

                                                         55

 This risk is being mitigatedby the Government primarily throughAcuerdos Politicos --
  agreements with the main Congressional groups, for timely processing of key reforms,
  including some supported by the FIALprogram.


0 Diflculty in containing expenditure levels. So far, the Government has been unable to
  contain expenditure to the levels originally envisioned by the program. As detailed
  earlier, this has been due to several factors, including the failure of the Referendum, the
  constitutional challenge to the freeze in wages, and ballooning expenditures for pension
  payments and debt service. Fiscal sustainability i s being maintained via increases in
  revenues, which are higher than those originally envisioned. Structural expenditure
  measures, however, will have to be taken to keep fiscal balances incheck.

  The government i s pursuingavenues for containing expenditure. One example i s the
  pension reform initiative now in Congress which seeks to eliminate certain privileged
  pension regimes. Inthe medium to long term, it i s expected that the vertical and
  horizontal elements of the public sector reform agenda will help contain expenditure
  levels.


0 Institutional gaps. Intwo important areas of the reform - procurement and asset
  management -there i s a need to create and/or strengthen institutions to assume regulatory
  functions in these areas. However, there i s a strong aversion to creating institutions given
  the current downsizing environment.

  This risk is being mitigated through the creation of two key institutions -the regulatory
  bodies for procurement and asset management - through Presidential Decree in the form
  of inter-sectoral commissions. They have proven to be effective intheir assigned tasks.
  Inthe interest of institutional development, the Government has prepared and submitted
  legislation to solidify their legal framework.


0 Macroeconomic Shocks. The fiscal situation may deteriorate, as a result of either external
  or internal shocks, which wouldjeopardize the macroeconomic situation. However, the
  country i s in a good position in terms of international reserves and its medium-term fiscal
  framework - endorsed by the Bank and the IMF- establishes a path towards sustainable
  public finances. Moreover, the World Bank program and that of the IMFand IDB are
  intended to lessenthe risk further by demonstrating active, visible support of the
  government's proposed fiscal and public sector adjustments.


0 Insecurity and Violence. Colombia has captured headlines for its alarming indices of
  violence, stemming from both the conflict with illegal armed groups and common crime.
  Although the most vulnerable areas of the country lie outside the main metropolitan
  areas, making the FL4Lprogram less likely to be affected as it i s focused mostly on legal
  and administrative reforms, an increase inviolence throughout the country could force the
  government to re-direct its attention and resources away from the reforms sought by the
  program toward an escalated security plan. This could compromise the pace of reforms.

  This risk has been mitigated through the reduction in the key violence and insecurity
  indicators over the last two years (see Table 1). The government has strengthened its
  position in the armed conflict and there i s a widespread feeling that this trend will

                                            56

        continue. Furthermore, negotiations with the paramilitary groups are moving forward and
        there i s a real prospect of a de-militarization of at least some of these groups inthe near
        future.

185.     Because of the high risk nature of the program, it has been essential to maintain a close
working relationship with the client, and to provide ample, ongoing dialogue and assistance
during the implementation period. To this end, the MAFPIITAL, as well as the PHRD and IDF
grants, have been providing an important opportunity for the Bank to closely accompany the
program.

JAMES D.WOLFENSOHN
President
WORLD BANK
Washington, D.C.



Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:



Since the b e p n i n g of President Uribe-VOlez A h s t r a t i o n in August 2002, the expansion of the
World Bank program for Colombia (CAS), and the important Qsbursements of the credlt programs
by the mulalateral development agencies have been one of the most impressive demonstrations of
support for the country. The World Bank and the IDB have perfectly fulfilled the commitments
made with the country and have contributed to the recovery of confidence in the stability of the
Colombian economy and to the reestablishment of access to the markets. Ths expression of
confidence has been fundamental to the implementation of an ambitious program of reforms, many
of w h c h have already been approved by the Congress of the Republic and are in process of
implementation.


W e wish to submit in the enclosed document an update of the policy letter that we presented to the
Bank in January 2003 during the first Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan
(FML-I).Int h s update we demonstrate the recent evolution of the country's economic situation
and, in that context, a synthesis o f the objectives and the content of the policies and reforms that we
have undertaken.


As indlcated at the start of the reforms program at the begmning of last year, there were some risks
that in one way or another could delay compliance of the established policy measures. The lack of
popular support for the economic initiatives included in the referendum generated uncertainty on
how the Government would carry out the reforms established in the third loan of the program.
However, the contingency measures designed to minimize the risks served efficiently in generating
alternatives for the normal performance of the program.




                                                    58

Finally, the Government i s committed to the program presented in this document and is pleased to
acknowledge the b a c h g and the financial support of the World Bank. In view of the measures
taken and implemented, the Government would appreciate the prompt consideration of the thud
programming fiscal and institutional adjustment loan by the Execudve Board of Directors of the
Bank, The Govemment i s ready to receive the technical teams of the Bank to jointly define future
credit programs to the extent that the reforms included in thls program with the Bank are
consolidated.

           I.THECONTEXTANDTHEh?hCROECONOMICANDSECURITYSITUATION


1. Colombia has recovered from the crisis of the 1998-2002 period, acheving sipficant economic
   stabdity: fiscal consolidation has advanced, inflation has been reduced, and the financial system
  i s showing s i g n s of soundness. Along with the foregoing, the democratic security program
   acheved an important improvement in 2003 vis-&-vis2002: the rate of homicides was reduced
  by 12.3%, kidnappings deched by 39.5%, attacks to localities by 75%, acts of terrorism by
   30.1%, and displacement of f a d e s as a result of violence was reduced in tum by 17%.
  Moreover, in the last two years unemployment was reduced by 1%, coverage in primary and
   secondary education increased by 3% and l.8%, respectively, and the number of people covered
   by the social security system increased by 2.8 million.

2. In 2003 the GDP grew by 3,95%, the highest percentage since 1995 and more than twice the
   average of Latin America. Ths growth i s explained by improvement in the expectations of
   companies and households, reflected in the growth of domestic demand, and investments,
  w h c h grew 14%. It i s expected that the GDP wdl grow 4% in 2004, with the expectation that
  investment growth i s kept constant and that private consumption i s robust and contributes
   sipficantly to the growth of the GDP. In2003 the deficit of the consolidated public sector was
   2.7% of GDP, 282 billion pesos below the goal agreed upon with the IMF, and it i s expected
   that in 2004 it wdl be 2.5% o f GDP. Inflation was 6,49% in 2003, and it i s expected to be
   between 5% and 6% in2004.

3. In2003 and up to now in2004, the Government has made important reforms. Inthe first place,
   decrees and regulations have been issued for complete application of the Fiscal Responsibility
   Law, which i s expected to lead to more responsible management of public finances, in
   particular, by the territorial entities. Moreover, and in accordance with the provisions of the
   Fiscal Responsibhty Law, the presentation of the M e l u m - T e r m Fiscal Framework with the
   report of the fiscal results of the previous year and the objectives of the following year was
   established, and a reform to the Social Security Institute was carried out to separate the
   provisionof financing services. With regard to tax a b s t r a t i o n and reform, Law 788 of 2002
   eluninated some exemptions, expanded the tax base of the VAT, and included some specific
   exemptions to certain sectors with the objective of reactivating the economy. L a w 863 of 2003,
   with the objective of defraying the unfeasibhty of the 2% VAT on all previously exempt goods
   and the non-approval of the referendum, established an earlier phase-out of some exemptions,
   introduced an investment incentive for companies, expanded the VAT base, accelerated the
   collection of the portfolio in arrears and redefined the coverage of the simplified system.




                                                  62

4. Tradtional exports, in particular manufactured goods and flowers, have performed well in
   recent years. Nevertheless, the appreciation of the peso and the slow recovery of its principal
   commercial partners such as the United States have affected exports: in 2003 exports grew 9.9%
   m a d y from oil, and it i s expected that in 2004 they grow by 11.2%. The Bank of the Republic
   carried out operations to stop the appreciation of the peso, but the balance of payments was
   affected: in 2003 the current account of the balance of payments had a deficit o f 1.8% of the
   GDP and a sunilar deficit is expected in2004.

   With regard to 2003, Colombia's vulnerability to extemal shocks has deched due to the
   recovery of an enabhg environment for world growth and to the improvement of the political
   and economic situation of Venezuela, among other reasons. However, the country i s still
   affected by the uncertainty represented by the intemal conflict, in spite o f w h c h the spreads of
   the sovereign debt have been substantially reduced, bothinabsolute terms and inrelative terms,
   incomparison with the average ofthe groupofemergingcountries andof someLatinAmerican
   countries. The Colombian Government i s aware of the need to support the sustainabhty of the
   public debt through solid structural reforms, for which the support of the World Bank i s
   fundamental: in 2003 the Debt of the Non-Financial Public Sector as a percentage of the GDP
   represented 51.5%, a percentage that although hghwas 2.7 percentage points below the result in
   2002. At June 2004 t h s debt represents 50.1% of the GDP and it is expected that by December
   it wdl be down to 48.3%. It is important to emphasize that h     s goal i s quite vulnerable due to
   movements inthe exchange rate.

6. As can be observed, Colombia presents a favorable macroeconomic situation and inprocess of
   consolidation, as well as improvements in the domestic security problems. With regard to the
   vulnerabhty to the extemal context, it i s important to emphasize that with a flexible exchange
   rate system, diminishing inflation, a growing economy, an adequate level of intemational
   reserves, and fiscal adjustments in process, the country i s prepared to face external shocks of a
   moderate magmtude.

7. The objective of the Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Program to b e financed with free
   assignment resources from the World Bank i s to continue supporting the Govemment of
   Colombia in the fiscal adjustment process and in the introduction of public management tools
   that allow a more efficient and transparent assignment and management of public resources.

8. In order to meet this objective, the Government has been implementing a set of structural
   measures that wdl allow to: increase fiscal revenues through an effective expansion of the tax
   base and elirmnation of tax exemptions, the progressive flexibility of the expenditure budget, the
   introduction of principles of fiscal responsibllity and integration of the budgetary system,
   strengthening of transparency in contracting mechanisms, and the restructuring of public
   employment. W e wdl refer to the advances ineach of them:


                              B. TAX  REFORMANDADMINISTRA TION

9. With a view to increasing revenues, improving tax equity, and reducing collection costs, the tax
   reform was approved through Law 788 of 2002. Ths L a w ehinates exemptions, expands the
   VAT base, and creates a new classification for wage exemptions, among others. The new
   measures increased the collection by 0.7% of the GDP in 2003, and it i s expected that the
   increase wdl be 1,05% in 2004. To date the regulatory decrees of L a w 788 of 2002 have been
   issued, which began to be applied inthe operations carried out fromJanuary 1,2003.


10. In addltion to the efforts undertaken by the Government with regard to tax reform regulations,
   the FIAL has assisted the DLAN in i t s tax admitllstration efforts. The development of a
   methodology that makes it possible to obtain, process, and utilize the data related to the interest
   paid or received by taxpayers during a given taxable period, should be pointed out. T h i s
   information allows DLAN to develop specific control programs. With the issuance of law 788 of
    2002 the DIAN has been exercising general control over those large taxpayers affected by the
    new taxes. In addition the new Law will allow DIAN to penalize those taxpayers who do not
    comply with their tax obligations.


11. Moreover, the DIAN has also advanced toward the establishment of cost and time indicators
   required by taxpayers for compliance with tax and customs obligations, w h c h wdl be published
   periodlcally and wdl be part of the internal management programs of the institution. Better tax
    admmistration also permitted an addltional collection of 0.3% of the GDP in 2003 and it i s
    expected that this improvement will allow an additional collection of at least 0.1% of the GDP
    in2004. Onthe other hand, DUN'Sadmmstrative costs have maximumcehgs of 9 pesos in
    2004 and 8.9 pesos in2005 per each 1,000 pesos collected.




                                                 64

12. Law 863 of 2003, pursuant to Articles 1and 5, established that revenue not derived fromincome
    or occasional eamings and exempt income begin to fully pay taxes starting intaxable year 2004,
    thus tax benefits have been e h a t e d . This Law also established the rapid collection of the
    portfolio in arrears, contentious reconciliation, and mutually agreed terminations to clear the
   judicial offices and thus achieve greater collections, and the incentive to the use of plastic money
    by individuals through the return of the VAT to avoid evasion through greater control.
    Furthermore, the anti-evasion measures contained in thls Law allowed an additional collection
    o f 0,04% of the GDP.


13. The Single Tax Record, an instrument to identify, locate, and classify all indviduals subject to
    obligations admmstered by the DIAN, was implemented, and mechanisms to improve
   information management by the banks related to these individuals were established.

14. The Govemment has continued with actions toward the modernization and the rationahation
    o f the civil service through the merger of ministries (6), the elimination of 30 unnecessary
    entities and offices, as well as some diplomatic corps and commercial offices, and the
    elimination of 3,050 vacancies with budgetary appropriation as of August 23,2004.


15. Within the framework of the State Reform, 142 entities have been redesigned, of which 30 have
    been liquidated, 38 of them had their staff rosters modified, and 51 underwent modlfications
    both at the staff level and to their administrative structures. In the remaining entities mergers,
    suppressions, assignment creation and changes moved ahead. The fiscal effect of these reforms
    resulted in gross savings of $214 bdhon in 2003 and as of June 2004, the savings amounted to
    '$110bdlion.

    In terms of net savings, through the elimination of vacancies and suppression of posts the
    Reform generated savings of $85.8 billton, product of the difference between gross savings of
    $365.6 bdhon and payment of indemnities for $279.bfion. It i s important to note that despite
    the fact that the savings are lower than the goal foreseen for these years, all indemnity payments
    have practically already been made intheir entirety, because the total planned value amounted to
    S302.3 billton.Thus, it i s expected that by the end of 2006 the savings goal of $656.2 bdlionwill
    be reached.


16. To ensure that the dimension of the public adrrrrmstration work force i s adequate, a goal has
    been established to reduce the operating costs and another one to increase the proportion of
    officials carrymg out mission tasks (70'0). By August 23, 2004, the mission percentage in the
    cost of the staff rosters of the executive branch at the nationallevel has been increased by



                                                   65

    almost 4 percentage points against the percentage that existed at the beginning of t h s
    government, going from 72.6% to 76.6%.


17. In developing the PUP, fiscal impact decisions were made as well as improvements in the
    managerial efficiency of the State, such as:
    .   The liquidation of Telecom and i t s 12 Teleasociadas -because          if the obvious financing
        unfeasibllity of these entities-,   accompanied by the creation of the company Colombia
        Telecommunications, to guarantee the integration o f operations with a view to capturing
         synergies and to ensure the delivery of the service inthe long term;
        The corporate breakup of Ecopetrol businesses into the joint stock company Ecopetrol
         S.A., National Hydrocarbons Agency, and the Energy Promotion Company, thus separating
        the regulatory function from the activities of exploration, exploitation, r e h g and
        marketing of crude and its derivatives;
        The breakup of the Social Security Institute, separating the EPS and IPS businesses from
         the entity and the creation of 7 new ESEs, the reduction of 33 redundant hgh-level
         adrnitllstrative positions at the regional level, and the cancellation of close to 2,300
        unnecessary contracts for its operation;
        The merger of 4 entities of the agriculture sector (Incora,     DRI, Inpa and Inat) to   uni5the
         execution o f the country's livestock and rural development policy into a single institute
         (Incoder),  which i s implementing a progressive but decisive decentralization of functions
        process;
        The hvestiture of IIF with the consequent transfer of its functions to Bancoldex and the
         takeover by the latter of the assets and liabilities of the former, with the objective of carrylng
         out a more effective strategy of financial supportto the Mipymes;
        The hvestiture of Railways and Feeder Roads, with the consequent creation of the National
         Concessions Institute (INCO), a high-profde entity specialized in the structuring, design,
         and management of concessions inthe transportation sector;
        The adaptation of the National Education W s t r y into a capable structure to support the
         "Educational Revolution,"     assuming the inspection, surveillance, and control of hgher
         education functions of the ICFES;
        The restructuring of a new mining entity based in Ingeominas, whlch wdl assume most of
         the functions of the divested entities Carbocol, Mmercol, and IIF Concesibn Salinas. Thus
         starting a process that wdl put an end to institutional dispersion, lack of sectoral
         coordination, duplication of functions, and waste of economic resources.


18. The cross-cuttingtype reforms have had a significant progress as indicated below:

       A public contracting policy has been formulated which will design a new regulatory,
       institutional, and management framework for State procurement. The new institutional
       framework has been providedthroughthe creation of an intersectoral commission for public
       procurement. With respect to the new regulatory framework, at the legal level a draft
       legislation has been sent to Congress whose purpose i s to improve the transparency of the
       process, elkmating the possibility of biases in the selection of contractors and the creation
       of instruments for public contractual management, that w d result ingreater efficiency and

                                                   66

 the reduction of transaction costs for public entities. At the regulatory level decree 2170 o f
 2002 was issued, whose objective was the regulation and strengthening of the principles o f
 transparency and objective selection, the establishment of new rules for l r e c t hiring
 processes, and the introduction o f guidehes for the use of information and communication
 tools in public contracting. Finally, at the management level, the bidding conchions of two
 of the contracts of greater use in the entities have been standardized-supply       and works
 supervision-and      a Manual on GoodPractices for Public Contractual Management has been
 designed. The manual includes the leadmg causes of State responsibility, based on the
 analysis of all the sentences issued against the State in the application of Law 80 of 1993 to
 serve as a tool for public contracting managers, with a view to acheving efficiency in the
 execution of public spendmg.


 The creation of a governmental strategy for the legal management of the Nation, especially
 i t s judicial defense i s fundamental. The Government wdl advance a lagnosis-both       of the
 causes of litigation and of management-to       develop a preventive strategy, and i s finishing
 the design of an information system to fachtate close follow-up of current proceedmgs and
 the State's action within them; it wdl also contract a study on the structure and management
 models of legal offices in order to adapt them to the new strategy; it will propose altemative
 conflict resolution mechanisms and the necessary normative reforms will be identified.


 The implementation of the Intersectoral Commission of Assets Management has established
 the sale as a management priority, w b c h wdl allow the generation of income and/or savings
 consonant with the goals of PROGA.Inaddition, draft legislation has been sent to Congress
 on the entities being liquidated establishmg an efficient management of State immovable
 assets given the powers granted to the trustees that make them competitive in the market
 with optimal mechanisms of valuation and management of real estate. Since the entities
 being liquidated have statutory limits for their termination, this will allow PROGA to reach
 certain important income and savings levels during the quadrennium. The assets of the
 entities being dissolved represent approximately 35% of the assets owned by the
.Govemment as reported by the General Accounting Office of the Nation.


 The implementation of a monitoring and performance evaluation system of the ministries
 and administrative departments based on the policies and programs of the National
 Development Plan, i s promoting a more efficient and transparent management, better
 assignment of resources, greater accountabhty and i s contributing to the improvement o f
 policies and programs.


 The Government issued the conceptual framework to reform and consolidate the
 institutional regulation and control scheme of the business activity, thus establishmg the
 principles that allow rationalizing the State activity with a view to minimizing the transaction
 costs for the State and the regulated, supervised, and controlled businesses. In adhtion it
 issued Decree 2696 of 2004, which defines the minimumrules to guarantee the




                                             67

 dmemination and involvement in the actions of the Regulatory Commissions. Furthermore,
 it plans to establish a single legalsystem for the supervision and control agencies.


 The integration o f the information systems w i b the National Civil Service i s being
 developed through a comprehensive strategy that seeks the d e h t i o n of standards with
 regard to interoperabhty, production, exchange and use of strategc information. The
 institutional framework i s the Intersectoral Commission on Information Policies and
.Management created throughDecree 3816 of December 2003.


 The strengthening o f the electronic Govemment wdl allow the incorporation and use of
 computer technology in the workflow of State entities, bothintheir intemal activities and in
 their relations with other public and private entities, with the citizens and with the
 productive sector. The ultimate objective i s to facllitate the relations of citizens with the
 Admustration,      and to increase efficiency,       transparency,  the territorially balanced
.development of the State, and to guarantee access to the information held by the State.


 The anti-proceedmg strategy seeks to establish a policy framework that makes it possible to
 rationalize the procedures of the civil service, both in i t s intemal operation and in its
 relations with the citizens. Ths strategy defines three components aimed at comprehensively
 solving the rationalization and automation o f the chains of sectoral procedures, thus:
 interinstitutional  coordmation      and   normative    adaptation;  functional    analysis for
 rationalization and technological strengthening. The Government i s advancing actions to
 design and implement procedure rationalization and automation projects for the following
 sectors: Business Development (Foreign Trade), Social Protection, Housing, Environment,
 and Territorial Development, Education and Finance. Also, the Govemment wdl design an
 on h e portal of services for the delivery of services and procedures for businessmen and
.citizens.

 On September 23, the President of the Republic approved Law 909 of 2004, `Whereby
 standards to regulate public employment, adrntnlstrative career, public management and
 other provisions are issued," w h c h proposes standards on staff plans and complements,
 functional tables of jobs, administrative information system and prioritization of the work
 day, introducing the possibhty of part-time jobs. This standardization will be the basis from
 which a model of public employment will be structured that responds to the needs of a
 modem, effective, and efficient civil service. Moreover, the Law contains provisions with
 regard to public management where criteria on merit and management evaluation prevail,
 introducing "management          agreements"   as an evaluation tool of public managers'
 performance, w h c h will defme the commitments of the manager at the beginning of hs/her
 term of office and the results expected, following the postulates of the Ibero-American
 Charter o f the Public Function.

 Furthermore, L a w 909 grants extraordmary powers to the President to issue standards with
 legal force that contain special procedures that should be supplied before and by the
 National Civil Service Commission, the general system of nomenclature and classification of



                                             68

        jobs applicable to the territorial entities, and the functions and requirements system
        applicable to the entities at the national and territorial levels that shall be governed by said
        law, complementary standards that will be of great importance for the application and
        development of the career system.


        Ths law, along with the decree-laws and regulations complementing it, will represent an
        instrument for the State to modernize the Civil Service and develop its human talent, where
        the predominant criterion wdl be the dfficulty in accessing the Public Service and
        permanence based exclusively o n good performance.


19. Efficacy in the achievement of the objectives of each modernization and rationalization
    component of the Civil Service and changes in the efficiency of certain controlled key entities
    are being subject to evaluation. Currently underway i s the basehe information survey that will
    be permanently updated to determine the progress and results o f the adopted measures. This
    fiscal period wdl allow the decision-maktng on public management policy as well as budgetary
    assignment, to be processes that are better informed and consistent with the results obtained by
    the entities. Furthermore it will strengthen the accountablltty of the govemment to the
    citizenshp.

20. Draft legslation No. 194 of 2003 of the House of Representatives, through which the Organic
    Budget Law was reformed, was sent to the Congress of the Republic on last December 16 and
    approved duringthe first debate if IV Commission of the House of Representatives onJune 16,
    2004. Currently, it is ready for presentation to the plenary of the Chamber. Ths draft legslation
    revolves around three objectives: balance between revenues and public spendmg to guarantee
    the sustainabihty of public finances in the me&um term; assignment of resources inaccordance
    with the availabhty and the priorities established by the project; and efficient uthzation of the
    resources in a context of transparency. The reform takes into account the recommendations of
    the Intemational Monetary Fund on the subject, and the different conversations held with the
    WorldBank and the IDB.


21. The Presidential Message attached to the draft budget legislation 2004 included a readmg
    pursuant to the objective pursued by public spendmg, there i s progress inthe compliance of the
    Fiscal Responsibility Law by including information on the medmm-term fiscal sustainability,
    contingent liabilities, the fiscal cost of tax exemptions, a sensitivity analysis of the budget to
    macroeconomic variables and a conversion between the Financial Plan and the budget of the
    Nation. Furthermore, the Presidential Message attached to the draft budget legislation 2005,
    included an economic and functional classification to the budget, which i s expected to give
    greater transparency and communication of the budget. In addition, the annex includes reports
    on the three action plans of governmental policy are.

    the Govemment began to Qstribute the resources of the General Participation System based in
    law 715 of 2001, w h c h establishes the rules of distributionof resources for the education sector
    (capitation-based transfers) among others, and the competences and responsibhties that should
    be in place on t h s subject both at the intemal level of Government and among the latter and
    the territorial entities.


24. In the case of the education sector, the National Development Plan establishes the creation of
    new spaces as a priority for which resources from the National Royalties Fund have been
    guaranteed. However, this assignment has also been subject to a profoundreform process that
    seeks greater efficiency, equity, and quality ineducational spending.


25. Thus, at the b e p n i n g of 2004 the dissolution of the National Royalties Committee took place
    and its functions were taken over by the National Planning Department assisted by an Advisory
    Technical Council whose first decisions were reflected in the earmarktng or resources to sustain
    the new educational spaces created in2003.


26. On the other hand, the Govemment's commitment to improve efficiency through the sigfllng of
    management agreements with different entities should be noted. The first points of agreement
    to this mechanism were carried out through the s i p g of agreements with the National
    Learning Service (SENA) and with the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF'). Under
    this scheme, the central Government committed itself to provide these entities greater budgetary
    resources equivalent to the greater revenues collected in para-fiscal resources, if any, and to the
    compliance o f certain management indicators.


27. Regardless of the results achieved from the commitments and incentives, the Government has
    managed to identify a culture of self-management and self-evaluation in these entities that has
    made it possible to increase efficiency in the entities' financial management with a view to
    setting up a budgetary assignment system based on results in the future.

28. Accordmgly, the Government intends to seek new entities with w h c h to sign this type of
    agreements and that w i t h the Civil Service Reform Program are eligible for reform and at the
    same time have a strategic importance for the country.

                               D.FISCAL     RESPONSIBILITYAND        TMSPARENCY




29. T h e Fiscal Responsibility L a w was approved on July 9, 2003, seeking to include Colombia among the
    group of countries that assume their fiscal problem with responsibility, through the issuance of laws that
    rationahe the fiscal activity and make the public debt sustainable, necessary alternatives for generating
    economic stabhty that would make it possible to lift the country from underdevelopment.


30. The L a w seeks to clean up the budgetary process from practices that have traditionally increased the
    burden for the Nation. This regulation clarifies the budgetary process and makes it consistent with
    sustainable public finances in the short and medium terms. With regard to Future Fiscal Years, their
    authorization should respond to a serious planning process, coherent with annual financial plans and
    thus, the sustainability of public finances. For thls reason, the Law provides CONFIS the power to grant
    the authorizations to commit future exercises and includes certain restrictions to rationalize its use. In the
    f x s t place, it establishes that it cannot authorize ordinary future exercises that exceed the period of the
    Government. Still, it keeps the option of authorizing exceptional future exercises for those projects that
    CONPES declares are o f strategic importance to the country. Secondly, it establishes the need to have
    minimum appropriations in the fiscal exercise inwhich such authorization is requested, ifit concerns an
    authorization to commit ordinary future exercises.


31. In h e with the objective that the multi-annual analysis guide the expendtture and public debt
    decisions, the abhty to pay o f the territorial entities w d be analyzed for the entire period of
    effectiveness of the credit and not only for the current year. In adhtion, treasury credtts are
    regulated inorder to preserve the margin for fiscal maneuver of the territorial admhstrations.


32. In addttion, this Law seeks the stability of the public debt, to organize the budgetary planning
    process in order to make it consistent with the financial and macroeconomic medium-term
    programming, to allow public scrutiny of the fiscal situation, and to expand the debate o n fiscal
    policy through the Congress. In order to meet these objectives, the law establishes that the
    National Government must present before June 15 of each fiscal year, a Medium-Term Fiscal
    Framework to the Economic Commissions of the Honorable Congress of the Republic after
    being studted and dtscussed during the first debate of the Annual Budget Law. This Framework
    will contain, at the very least, the Financial Plan, a multi-annual macroeconomic program, the
    primary surplus goals, a report of macroeconomic and fiscal results of the previous fiscal year, an
    evaluation of the main quasi-fiscal activities carried out by the public sector, an estimation of the
    fiscal cost of existing tax exemptions, a list of contingent liabilities that could affect the financial
    situation of the Nation, as well as the fiscal cost of the laws approved inthe previous fiscal year.
    Thts applies equally to the central govemment and the territorial entities.




                                                          71

33. InJune of the present year, and in compliance with the mandate of the Fiscal Responsibhty
    Law, the NationalGovemmentpresented for the first time the Medium-TermFiscal Framework
    to the economic commissions of the Congress of the Republic.


34. The commitment of the Govemment to guarantee the sustainabhty of public finances is
    reflected in the reforms that it has sent to Congress for approval. In view of the fact that the
    principal expendture problem facing the Nation in2005 is the payment of pensions, which has
    gone from of 3.8% of the GDP to 4.5% of the GDP between 2004 and 2005, the government
    submitted to Congress the LegislativeAct on Pensions.Throughths, a reduction of the pension
    liabihty at present values of approximately 30% of the GDP would be obtained. In addition, in
    order to finance part of the annual flow associated to the payment of pensions, the Govemment
    proposed a tax reform, through whch the goal is to obtain annual resources amounting to
    O,66% of the GDP.


35. The Government continues to be committed with the fiscal adjustment program agreed upon
    with the International Monetary Fund. In 2003 the deficit goal was exceeded, acheving a level
    of 2.7% of the GDP, 0.1% of the GDP below the goal. In the course of 2004 a favorable
    performance of the fiscal figures continues to be observed. Tax collection has been sipficantly
    above projections; to date the level of over-compliance is 0.4% of the GDP. This follows
    essentially from greater business activity both in 2003 and in the current year, w l c h translates
    into greater collections of both income tax and VAT. The foregoing translates into better fiscal
    results for the Government of Colombia, where a deficit of 2.5% of the GDP was acheved in
    the fxst semester of 2004; 0.4% of the GDP below the results of 2003. As a result, the fiscal
    deficit goal of the consolidated public sector was amply met in the first semester of 2004,
    achieving a deficit of $62 bfion pesos (0,02% of the GDP). Ths result i s $1,588 bdlionbelow
    the agreed goal with the IMF ($1,650 bfion, 0.7% of the GDP). The foregoing leads us to
    presume that the deficit goal of 2.5% of the GDP w d b e met t h s year. Moreover, given the
    continuity and seriousness of the fiscal adjustment policy, we expect to continue the downward
    trend of the fiscal deficit, achieving a level of 2.4% of the GDP in2005.

                                 Colombia: FundRelationsNote


On June 30, 2004 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the
thirdreview of Colombia's performance under a two-year, SDR 1.5 billion (about US$2.3
billion) Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on January 15,2003 (see Press ReleaseNo.
03/04). The completion of this review enables the release of SDR 193.5 million (about US$284
million) to Colombia, bringingthe total amount available underthe arrangement to SDR 1.16
billion (about US$1.70billion). The authorities are treating the arrangement as precautionary and
they have not made any drawings.

ExecutiveBoardAssessment at the Completionof the Third Review
Colombia's strong policy track record i s bolstering confidence and contributing to the economic
recovery. In 2004, the macroeconomic framework i s based on a strong increase inreal GDP
growth, further decline in inflation, and strong external sector performance. Colombia i s well
placed to adjust to a gradual rise in interest rates in the United States, provided that economic
policies continue to be strong. The main policy challenge for 2004 i s to take advantage of the
cyclical upturn in activity to press ahead with reforms that are crucial to sustain the economic
recovery.

Demandpolicies are set to remain prudent. The authorities are strongly committed to keeping
fiscal policy on a path to reduce public debt over the medium term. The combined public sector
deficit i s targeted to decline in 2004, with some room to accommodate additional investment
financed by nondebt-creating flows. The government intends to submit to Congress a budgetfor
2005 that provides for a combined public sector deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP. Monetary policy
will remain directed at reducing inflation further, in the context of the inflation-targeting
framework and a flexible exchange rate policy, while efforts will continue to strengthen the
financial system, and improve supervision.

Structural reforms are also set to advance further. The government intends to secure
congressional approval of the revised budget code during 2004. Tax administration i s to be
strengthened further, and a constitutional amendment on pension reform i s to be submitted to
Congress inJuly 2004. By September 2004, the economic policy cabinet will develop a plan to
strengthen the current system of fiscal decentralization. Colombia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, and the authorities plan to phase out the few remaining exchange restrictions in the
next few years.

These reforms, together with prudentmacroeconomic policies, should lay a solid foundation for
sustained growth and financial stability over the medium term, while also reducing poverty and
improving social indicators.

Recent Developments

Real GDP rose by an estimated 3.8 percent in 2004 while 12 month inflation declined to 5.5
percent in December, as envisaged under the current Stand-by arrangement. Stronger than
expected tax revenues, higher oil prices and moderate expenditure by regional and local
governments contributed to a substantial improvement on the consolidated fiscal accounts. The
fiscal deficit for 2004 i s estimated to be below 2.0 percent of GDP. Net International Reserves
rose to US$13.2 billion (about 125 percent of short term debt on a remaining maturity basis).
Higher capital inflows and a strong external demand played an important role inthe appreciation
of the Colombian peso. Key initiatives to improve the sustainability of the fiscal accounts such as
the Pension and Tax reforms and the new Budget Code are currently before Congress.



Safeguards Assessments
Under the safeguards policy, Colombia was subject to a safeguards assessment with respect to its
current Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. Staff concluded a safeguards assessment mission
on April 10,2003 and the final report were approved by management on May 14,2003. The
assessment noted no significant vulnerabilities. The Banco de la Repdblica already has a strong
financial control environment and complies with most of the InternationalAccounting Standards
(US). The BRC intends to fully adopt I A S to the extent that these do not conflict with
established accounting regulations and the law. The Banco de la Repdblica adopted as a
permanent feature the requirement that annual external audits be conducted by external audit
firms with international experience and exposure.

Justificacion
En el    marco    de la donacion japonesa       TF No.    053133 y del Acuerdo
Interadministrativo Subsidiario de Donation, celebrado entre la Agencia Colombiana
de Cooperaci6n (ACCI), el Departamento Nacional de Planeacion (DNP) y el
Ministerio de Hacienda y Credit0 Pljblico (MHCP), se coordinara la preparacion del
programa Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan 111y IV- FIAL, con recursos de
donacion del Gobierno de Jap6n (PHRD) y con la asistencia tecnica del Banco
Mundial.

Esta iniciativa hace parte de las politicas actuales del Gobierno en el Programa de
Renovaci6n de la Administracibn Pljblica plasmadas en el Plan Nacional de
DesarroIIo 2002 - 2006 Hacia un Estado Comunitario.

La ejecucion de 10s recursos de la donacion se efectuara para adelantar 10s estudios
e insumos necesarios para el disefio de dicha operation de credito. Estos estudios
responderan especificamente a 10s siguientes componentes: (i) Gesti6n del proceso
de reforma del sector pljblico (disefio de unos sistemas de indicadores para medir el
desempefio del proceso de reforma en el DNP y el desempeAo fiscal del proceso de
reforma en el MHCP), y (ii) defensa legal del estado (analisis del sistema actual y
propuesta de reforma).



Antecedentes
Las acciones de corto plazo emprendidas por el Programa de Renovaci6n de la
Administracion Pljblica (PRAP) han sido de caracter organizacional, buscando crear
una administracion mas eficiente y gerencial. A pesar que cambios importantes han
sido ejecutados a lo largo del primer afio y medio de gobierno, su vocacion es de
permanencia en lo relacionado con el mejoramiento continuo en materia
institucional.

La informacion desactualizada, incompleta o en ciertos casos          inexistente ha
constituido un constante obstaculo para la toma de decisiones dentro de este
proceso. Las medidas organizacionales emprendidas por el PRAP tendran resultados
en terminos fiscales y en terminos de eficiencia. La medicion de 10s primeros se
adelanta a partir de informacion presupuestal y de nomina. La de la segunda por su
parte, carece de una. linea base y de un sistema de medicion, evaluation e
informacibn para poder confrontar 10s cambios y efectos en eficiencia ocurridos a
partir de las reformas.

El Programa de Reformas a la Administracibn Pljblica - PRAP, se subdivide en una
serie de reformas transversales (reformas           que afectan el general de la
administracion pljblica) y reformas verticales (reformas enfocadas hacia entidades
especificas) que lo componen en su totalidad. Enfocandonos solo en el primer tip0
de reformas, encontramos que entre estas se incluyen algunas como:


   0   Reforma Tributaria
       Reforma a la Administracion Tributaria
       Reforma al Manejo Presupuestal


                                           88

      Responsabilidad Fiscal
      Incentivos para el incremento de la eficiencia
   0  Reforma a la Gestion Juridica de la Naci6n
      Fortalecimiento a la Contratacion Pljblica
   0  Reforma a la Gestion de Activos por parte de la Naci6n
      Convenios de gestion con entidades del gobierno

Dentro de una de las condicionalidades establecidas por el FIAL, tanto en su tramo
tres como cuatro, se establece como indispensable la necesidad de establecer
indicadores claros de medicion y evaluacion, que permitan identificar con claridad
dichos progresos.

En la actualidad, la Direccion de Evaluacibn de Politica Pljblicas, bajo el auspicio del
mencionado prestamo, realiza la interventoria de las consultorias que se desarrollan
para tal fin, la definicion de las lineas de base de medicion y evaluacion del progreso
de las reformas dentro del Programa de Renovacion de la Administracion Pljblica
(PRAP). Sin embargo, el presente documento ilustra una linea tentativa, que sera
complementada en un proximo futuro con 10s documentos en proceso de definicion.

Justification

Within the framework of the Japanese grant TF No. 053133 and the subsidiary
grant agreement signed between the Colombian Cooperation Agency (ACCI), the
National Planning Department (DNP) and the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
(MHCP), will coordinate the preparation of the Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment
Loan 111and IV with the resources of the grant and the technical assistance of the
World Bank,

This initiative is part of the current policies of the Government's Public
Administration Renovation Program, established in the National Development Plan
2002-2006, Towards a Community-based State.

The resources of the grant will be used to carry out studies and provide necessary
inputs to the preparation of these loan operations. These studies will be specifically
focused on the following components: (i) Management of the reform process
(design of a system of indicators to measure the performance of the reform process
in DNP and the fiscal performance of the reform process in MHCP), and (ii) legal
defense of the State (analysis of the current system and proposals for reform).


Backaround

The short-term efforts launched by the Public Administration Renovation Program
(PRAP) have been organizational in nature, seeking to create a more managerial
and efficient administration. Despite the important changes carried out during the
first year and a half of the administration, its intention is to remain permanently in
the continuous improvement of public sector institutions.

The lack of current and complete information, or in some cases the complete lack of
any kind of information, have been constant obstacles to the decision-making
process. The organizational measures undertaken by the PRAP will generate fiscal
impact and efficiency gains. The measurement of the first is undertaken with
budgetary and payroll information. The second lacks of a baseline and
measurement, evaluation and information system to contrast the changes and
efficiency effects derived from the reforms.

The PRAP is subdivided in a series of horizontal reforms (those that affect the
overall public administration), and vertical reforms (those that are focused on
specific entities). The horizontal reforms include:

       Tax Reform
       Reform of the Tax Administration
       Budgetary Reform
       Fiscal Responsibility
       Incentives for Efficiency Gains
       Reform to the Legal Defense of the State
       Strengthening Public Sector Procurement
       Asset management reform
       Management Contracts with Government entities

Within the conditionality of the FIAL program, both for FIAL I11and IV, is the need
to establish clear monitoring and evaluation indicators to identify these processes
clearly.

At present, the Directorate for Evaluation of Public Policies, with the support of said
loan, carries out the supervision of consultancies to define baseline indicators for
the monitoring and evaluation of the reforms within the PRAP. However, this
document presents a preliminary version of the baseline indicators, which will be
adjusted accordingly once the consultancy reports are available.
