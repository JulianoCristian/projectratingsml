1   IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                     I
    About this Report
           The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
    first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
    expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
    disseminationof lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
    the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
    that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations;those for
    which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
    important lessons.
           To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
    documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
    and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
    in local offices as appropriate.
            Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
    internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
    relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
    the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. Afler an assessment report has been sent to
    the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

    About the IEGWB Rating System
         IEGWBs use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
    lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
    arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
    (additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
         Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
    be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
    relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
    objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
    sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
    Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
    the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
    were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
    extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
    operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
    expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
    Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
         Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
    operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
    transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities afler loanlcredit closing, toward the
    achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
    Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
    agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
    agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
    performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
    Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
    Unsatisfactory.

Preface

       This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for four structural
adjustment lending operations to Colombia from 2001 to 2005:

        The Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (P073572, TF-26673; FSLT-70920)
was approved December 18,2001 for $US400 million equivalent. The first tranche
amounting to $US160 million was released December 20,2001 and the second tranche o f
$US180 million equivalent was released October 18,2002, almost seven months from the
planned March 3 1,2002 release date. The third tranche o f $US60 million equivalent was
finally released on February 11, 2003 and the project closed on February 2 1,2003 with a
delay o f two months.

      The First Programmatic Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loan (PO8083 1;
L/C 7163-CO) was approved on March 18,2003 and released on March 20,2003 in the
amount o f $US300 million. The loan was closed on April 30,2003.

        The Second Programmatic Fiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loan
(P083905; L/C 72010) in the amount o f $US150 million was approved on November 20,
2003 and became effective on November 24,2003. The loan closed on the original date
o f February 25,2004 and was fully disbursed.

       The Third ProgrammaticFiscal and InstitutionalAdjustment Loan
(P084762; TF-53133; FSLT-72800) was approved March 22,2005 and became effective
on April 26,2005. The loan was fblly disbursed amounting to $US 100 million and
closed based on the original date o f June 30,2005.

        This PPAR i s based on relevant Bank and Fund documents and on interviews
with Bank staff. An Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) mission visited Colombia in
October 2006 to discuss performance with officials who implementedthe projects,
representative donors, and staff o f the Bank resident mission. Their cooperation and
assistance in preparing the report i s gratefully acknowledged.

        Comments from the Bank’s Regional Management have been incorporated in the
report. The draft PPAR was sent to the Government o f Colombia for comments
following standard IEG procedures but no comments were received.

       This report was prepared by Mr. Manuel Hinds (consultant), under the
supervision o f Ms. Helena Tang (Task Manager). Mr. Roderick de Asis provided
administrative support.

Summary
1 .      Attached i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) on four loans to the
Republic o f Colombia: the Structural Fiscal Loan (SFAL) for US$400 and a programmatic
series o f three loans pertaining to the Fiscal Adjustment Loan (FIAL) Program, which was
intended to add up to US$900 million in four loans but eventually added up to US$550
million in three loans. The four operations were part o f the Bank effort to help the Republic
o f Colombia to attain fiscal sustainability inthe long term. It i s for this reason that they are
reviewed in the same report.

2.      The Colombian fiscal situation deteriorated sharply during the mid-1990s after
having been managed reasonably well for several decades. As the fiscal deficit increased to
levels o f over 3 percent o f GDP, the total gross stock o f public debt reached 50 percent o f
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2000, almost double the level in the early 1990s. A
financial sector crisis then forced the government to issue more debt to re-capitalize the ailing
financial institutions. Inthose years, it seemed that the country was on an unsustainable
fiscal path.

3.      In 1999, the then incoming Pastrana administration formulated a three-year
stabilization program, supported by the IMF, and requested that the Bank take the lead in
identifying and supporting the implementation o f key structural reforms to help bring
Colombia’s fiscal accounts onto a sustainable path in the medium- and long-term. The Bank
responded with the Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (SFAL).

4.       The fiscal situation did not improve during the implementation o f the SFAL. When
the Uribe Administration took power in 2002, it devised a new program to deal with the
fiscal problems and requested help from the Bank. This led to the design o f the FIAL
programmatic series. According to the program document presented to the Board o f
Directors in February 2003, “the series would support short- and medium-termreforms with
twofold objectives: first, to help attain the substantial fiscal adjustment required to ensure
macroeconomic stability and ease the significant fiscal rigidities that make the
implementation o f public policy extremely difficult; and second, to improve the provision o f
public services and establish the institutional basis for higher efficiency and accountability in
public expenditures”. The series was planned as four single-tranche loans, amounting to
about US$900 million in total. Decisions about whether and when the subsequent loans
would go forward depended on the progress o f the reform program. The Government
cancelled the fourth FIAL before it was designed.

5.       The performance o f the Colombian economy improved drastically almost as soon as
the first FIAL was approved, largely because the country experienced a significantly positive
turn in the terms o f trade (mainly through the increase in oil prices). The improved overall
economic performance o f the country had a favorable impact on the fiscal situation through
several channels-including the increase in the royalties received by the government from i t s
oil exploitation facilities; the buoyancy o f the tax system, which tended to collect more with
the same effort in good times than in bad times; and the reduction o f the burden o f the dollar-
denominated debt that resulted from the appreciation o f the peso which accompanied the
improvement in the terms o f trade.

6.    The crucial question when evaluatingthe performance o f the fiscal operations in
Colombia is whether (and to what extent) the fiscal condition o f the country improved
                                                  xii
independently o f the improved overall economic performance o f the country. Stated in
another way, the question i s whether a reversal o f the exogenous conditions since the early
2000s would not have resulted in a fiscal crisis similar to the one which prompted the design
o f the fiscal operations. These questions cannot be answered in a definitive way. Yet, it is
possible to look at the different aspects o f fiscal performance to ascertain whether they are
likely to be sustainable if the exogenous variables that influence the Colombian economy so
deeply were to deteriorate.
7.       The first objective o f the operation which was to help the borrower improve the
underlying fiscal situation-was not accomplished. Although the deficit o f the combined
public sector went down fiom 3.2 percent in 2001 to 1.5 percent in 2006, most, if not all, o f
this improvement can be traced directly to the improved terms o f trade condition, particularly
to the increased income that the government received from the state-owned oil company
(Ecopetrol). The underlying fiscal deficit situation did not improve since the beginning o f the
Bank-Support operations. The reduction o f expenditure rigidities that negatively affect the
fiscal system was not accomplished, either. In fact, the rigidity in the expenditure structure
worsened during the implementation o f the loans-in part as a result o f measures that were
taken under the loans.
8.       The second objective o f the operation was to help the borrower improve the provision
o f public services and establishing the institutional basis for higher efficiency and
accountability inpublic expenditures. Some satisfactory results were achieved, but the
overall outcomes were mixed.
9.      The ratings presented in the report are lower than those in the I C R Review for earlier
outcomes, and Bank and borrower performance. The ICRs rated the three areas o f all the
operations satisfactory. This PPAR considers that it would not be appropriate to rate as
satisfactory a series o f operations that failed to meet its main objectives and, in some cases,
established conditions that contradicted the achievement o f objectives. For the SFAL and the
FIAL series, this PPAR rates all the three dimensions moderately unsatisfactory.
10.     The main lessons learned from this review are:
       First, as noted in IEG’s I C R Review o f FIAL 1    11, project design needs to be clearly
       aligned with its development objectives i   norder to attain the latter. Even if the
       structural deficit o f the central administration i s “highly sensitive and political” as the
       I C R states, the magnitudes o f these structural rigidities were such that they must be
       addressed if progress is to be made in achieving the substantialfiscal adjustment that
       i s required for sustained macroeconomic stability.
       Second, loans with large numbers o f objectives and conditions, and involving too
       many institutions relative to the management capacity o f the Government and the
       Bank itself, overtax the implementation capacity o f both the Bank and the borrower
       and result in poor execution.
       Third, the inclusion o f objectives o f widely different levels o f priority and weak
       connection with the ultimate goals o f the operations tends to obscure the degree o f
       attainment o f the latter.
       Fourth, success depends on the borrower’s ownership o f the objectives o f the loan.

Introduction

1 1.    This i s the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) o f four loans
extended t o Colombia t o help the government improve i t s fiscal performance and i t s
institutional efficiency: the Structural Fiscal Adjustment Program (SFAL), and a series o f
three loans called the Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loans, I     to I11
(FIALS). Although the SFAL was an independent operation, it served as a stepping-
stone for the design o f the more ambitious program that framed the FIAL series. For this
reason, this report evaluates the outcomes o f three processes: the SFAL, the F I A L s and
the fiscal operations as a whole.

12.     Both the SFAL and the FIAL program loans were extremely complex operations,
with multiple and quite disparate objectives. These objectives differed in terms o f their
subject matter, the institutions involved, and their relative importance. Moreover, the
conditions o f these loans spread to several administratively unconnected institutions, and
were drafted in many cases in a highly legalistic fashion that created chains o f events
passing from one loan to the next. For example, sequential operations included
conditions that entailed, variously, the preparation, the presentation to Congress, the
approval by Congress, and the regulation o f different laws. In some instances, these
chains were interrupted by the failure o f Congress t o do what the program intended it t o
do, which prompted the re-definition o f conditions in several areas for the FIAL
operating at the time and those following it. Eventually, the government decided that the
problem o f defining and redefining these multiple objectives, and the burden o f tracking
them through scores o f institutions, was too taxing for the expected benefits and
cancelled the fourth FIAL before it was designed.

13.       The complexity o f the loans poses a problem for their evaluation, too. This may
become too mechanical and disjointed if it focuses too closely o n the disperse conditions
o f the loans, to the point o f becoming almost unreadable in the discussion o f the laws
(identified with numbers) that should have been drafted, proposed, approved or regulated
in each o f the versions o f the FIALs. T o address this problem, this PPAR takes a more
general view: (a) looking at the F I A L s as one single operation; and (b) focusing o n the
general objectives o f the operations and evaluating the degree to which they were
attained and the extent o f the Bank’s contribution t o such attainment. Since each o f the
FIALs contained two components, 10 sub-components and 4 to 5 activities per sub-
component, tracking them would entail reviewing 30 sub-components and 150 activities
for these loans. O f course, the discussion cannot obviate the details o f the operations, but
the emphasis i s on the forest, not the trees; o n the overall path, not o n each o f its stations.
A detailed description o f the operations and a chronicle o f the evolution o f each o f their
components, sub-components and conditions i s contained in the loans’ ICRs. The IEG
mission found this description satisfactory.

14.     All the issues directly related with the attainment o f the ultimate objective o f the
operations-improving fiscal performance-are discussed in one chapter (chapter 4).
These issues are the outcomes o f public debt management in the SFAL as well as the
overall fiscal commitment in the FIAL loans, and the macroeconomic framework in both
the SFAL and the FIAL loans.
                                              2


15.    Accordingly, the report contains five chapters and one statistical annex. Chapter
1 summarizes the economic background o f the fiscal operations, from the approval o f the
SFAL to late 2006, one year after the closure o f the FIAL series. Chapters 2 and 3
discuss the SFAL and the FIAL series in detail. Chapter 4 deals with the fundamental
objective o f the fiscal operations as a whole: improving fiscal performance. Chapter 5
discusses the lessons that can be extracted from these operations.

16.     Note on ratings. This report rates highly unsatisfactory those components or
activities that had outcomes that directly contradicted the objectives o f the rated loans, by
outcome or by design. For example, it rates highly unsatisfactory the outcome o f a
component o f the SFAL which aimed at reducing current and general expenditures by 4
and 19 percent, respectively, in real terms, but resulted instead in an increase in those
expenditures by 4 and 16 percent, respectively, also in real terms. Also, the report rates
highly unsatisfactory the components that aimed at attaining goals that contradicted the
objectives o f the loans. These included two components, one in the SFAL and one in the
FIALs, which increased the rigidity o f the fiscal system by design, although reducing
such rigidity was one o f the main objectives o f the loans. Another example is the
structural reform o f taxes, which actually increased the distortions that the loans had
aimed at ameliorating. The report rates unsatisfactory those components that did not
meet their objectives but did not contradict the objectives o f the loan in their design or
their outcomes.
1. The Economic Background o f the Fiscal Operations

A.     The Economic Environment
1.1      The Colombian fiscal situation deteriorated sharply during the mid-1990s after
having been managed reasonably well for several decades. During the 1990s, central
government expenditures grew from 9.3 to 20.1 percent o f Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) while revenues increased much less, from 11.0 to 13.3 percent o f GDP,
notwithstanding at least eight tax reforms that the government enacted during the period.
As a result, total gross stock o f public debt reached 50 percent o f GDP by 2000, almost
double the level in the early 1990s. The situation worsened with the recession that
unfolded in 1998-99, which resulted in the first contraction o f real GDP in over seventy
years (real GDP f e l l by 3.7 percent in 1999 and remained below i t s 1998 level until
2001). A financial sector crisis exploded at that time which, though mainly affecting the
state-owned banks, forced the government to issue more debt to re-capitalize the ailing
institutions. In those years, it seemed that the country was on an unsustainable fiscal
path.

1.2      In 1999, the then incoming Pastrana administration formulated a three-year
stabilization program and requested support from the Bank to deal with the financial
crisis (the program was also supported by an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The
Bank responded with the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EUR 482 million) approved
in November 1999. In 2000, the government requested that the Bank take the lead in
identifying and supporting the implementation o f key structural reforms to: (a)
complement the stabilization effort under the IMF program; and (b) help bring
Colombia’s fiscal accounts onto a sustainable path in the medium- and long-term. The
Bank responded with the Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (SFAL).

1.3     The downturn had revealed critical structural weaknesses in the government
accounts-notably, the encroachment o f entitlements in favor o f politically powerful
sectors, unbridled sub-national spending, the deterioration in quantity and quality o f
social services, and the substitution o f current for capital expenditures. The SFAL
focused its objectives and conditionality on these issues.

 1.4    As discussed in more detail in chapter 2, the fiscal situation did not improve
during the implementation o f the SFAL. The fiscal deficit actually increased
substantially, from 3.5 percent to 4.2 percent o f GDP. Also, the substitution o f current
for capital expenditures continued unabated4urrent expenditures expanded by one
percent o f GDP while capital expenditures declined by 0.6 percent o f GDP. Moreover,
the transfers to local governments remained a crucial problem, the pension liabilities
remained a heavy burden on the government, and the efficiency o f social security did not
improve.

1.5      As the fiscal situation deteriorated during the implementation o f the SFAL, fiscal
issues became more central to the government’s and the Bank’s programs. The 2002
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) included macro-fiscal adjustment as one o f the
activities that needed to be carried out to meet one o f the main CAS objectives-
                                              4


achieving fast and sustainable growth. The CAS listed actions o n three fronts as a means
t o attain this objective: a major reduction in the size o f the state, a “growth-friendly” tax
reform, and better debt management. I t was in this context that the opportunity t o design
and implement a programmatic series o f loans presented itself.

1.6      The Uribe Administration, which took power in 2002, devised a new program to
deal with the fiscal problems and requested help from the Bank. This led t o the design o f
the FIAL programmatic series o f loans. According to the program document presented t o
the Board o f Directors in February 2003, “the series would support short- and medium-
term reforms with two-fold objectives: first, to help attain the substantial fiscal
adjustment required to ensure macroeconomic stability and ease the significant fiscal
rigidities that make the implementation o f public policy extremely difficult; and second,
to improve the provision o f public services and establish the institutional basis for higher
efficiency and accountability in public expenditure. The program would consist o f four
single-tranche loans, adding to a notional amount o f US$900 m i l l i o n in total. Decisions
about whether and when the subsequent loans would go forward will depend o n the
progress o f the reform program.”

1.7     The performance o f the Colombian economy improved drastically almost as soon
as the F I A L s were approved, mainly because several o f the exogenous factors that had
deteriorated during the crisis turned around and improved remarkably after 2002. These
exogenous factors were the following.

        The international prices o f commodities, which had declined rapidly in the late
        1990s and early 2000s, improved rapidly after 2002, leading to a rapid increase in
        exports, particularly o f oil.
        The international crisis o f 1997-98 eventually faded away, reversing the dramatic
        fall in capital inflows that had taken place in the previous years.
        A s the current account improved and capital inflows returned to positive values,
        the peso appreciated in real and nominal terms, reducing the burden o f the
        external debt denominated in dollars.

1.8     Figure 1 shows the behavior o f the balance o f payments before, during, and after
the crisis. As i s clear in the figure, the country was forced to adjust from 1996 to 1999 to
a dramatic fall in capital inflows which was equivalent to about 8 percent o f GDP. The
adjustment had to be done through a compression o f the current account o f almost the
same magnitude. This, however, was not sufficient, so that in 1998 and 1999 Colombia
experienced overall balance o f payments deficits, which led to losses in international
reserves. This situation improved in the most recent years, as the prices o f commodities
(including oil) went up, and as capital inflows resumed, allowing Colombia to widen its
current account deficits again. The combination o f the current account deficits and the
capital inflows has been such that it has allowed Colombia to run balance o f payments
surpluses, which in turn led to a rapid increase in international reserves.
                                                                         5

1.9     Figure 2 shows how the economy reacted to these external events. After having
declined in 1999, real GDP grew rapidly inthe subsequent years, although by 2005 its level
relative to 1997 still lagged behind that o f the average in Latin America and well behind
comparable leading countries such as Mexico and Chile.

1.10 Figure 3 shows how the improvement in the balance o f payments also led to a
rapid appreciation o f the currency that started in mid-2003. This in turn opened the space
for domestic interest rates to fall, and reduced the burden o f the external debt.

1.11 The improved overall economic performance o f the country had a favorable impact
on the fiscal situation through several channels-including the buoyancy o f the tax system,
which tends to collect more with the same effort in good times than in bad times; the
reduction o f the burden o f the debt; and lower domestic and international interest rates, which
further reduced the debt service.

B.                  Relations with the IMF

1.12 As noted before (see pp.1.2) the IMF supported the initial Pastrana 1999-2002 plan
with an EFF inthe amount o f SDRl.957 billion (approximately US$2.7 billion). A Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) in the amount o f SDR 1.55 billion followed this operation for a period
o f 24 months from December 2002. Then, the IMF approved a new precautionary SBA (not
intended to be disbursed) in the amount o f SDR405 million. The country exited from formal
Fund support at the end o f this arrangement.

1.13 Colombia experienced difficulties in meeting IMF conditions under the EFF as the
fiscal situation kept on deteriorating up to the end o f 2002 (while the SFAL was in effect).
Then, as the external economic conditions o f the country rapidly improved, Colombia was
able to meet practically all the fiscal conditions o f the two SBAs that went from the end of
2002 to the end o f 2006. Figure 4 shows how the fiscal performance o f the broadest
definition o f government (the combinedpublic sector) consistently equaled or exceeded I R F
targets from 2003 onwards. T h i s was fully satisfactory from the point o f view o f the IMF.
The figure, however, also shows that most o f the improvement was due to: (a) increased
contributions o f Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company, which experienced a boom inthose
years as a result o f the high oil prices; and (b) limited implementation capacity o f the local
and regional governments, which produced surpluses in these years. Without Ecopetrol, the
2006 deficit would have been 5.2 percent o f GDP, just a little lower than the 2001 deficit that
motivated the operations; if the surpluses o f the local governments were excluded, the 2006
fiscal deficit was worse than that o f 200 1.

C.       The Main Issues
1.14 Notwithstanding IMF satisfaction with the fiscal outcomes from end-2002 t o end-
2006 (which is in line with the short-term nature o f IMF activities), the high reliance o f
the fiscal outcomes on the profits o f Ecopetrol and the circumstantial surpluses produced
by the local governments poses serious issues from the Bank’s long-term point o f view,
as the purpose o f the reviewed operations was precisely t o improve the fiscal situation
structurally. Without these two circumstantial events, the country would have had a
deficit larger than that o f 2001.

1.15 The high contribution o f Ecopetrol’s profits to the reduction o f the combined
public sector deficit raises particular concerns because they are likely to go down as the
reserves o f the company will be depleted in the near future unless the company invests
heavily in further exploration. The resources for such investment would have to come
from those that have been going to reduce the fiscal deficit. Alternatively, as analyzed in
a recent paper by the IMF, the country could classify the company as commercially run
and remove it from the country’s financial indicators, targets and accounts. This, o f
course, would increase the measurement o f the combined public sector deficit
instantaneously.

1.16 These concerns are even more important because other exogenous factors also
contributed to the improvement in the fiscal balance. As is very common for countries
that depend o n commodities, all macroeconomic variables improve when their prices
increase. For instance, fiscal collections go up as a result o f the economic boom

 See The Fiscal Risk o f Public Enterprises: Analysis o f Isagen and Ecopetrol, in Colombia Selected Issues,
November 2006, IMF Country Report No. 06/40 1.
                                              8


generated by the high commodity prices, and the currency appreciates which reduces
domestic interest rates and the burden o f the external debt. By the same token, a reversal
in the behavior o f these exogenous variables would lead to increased difficulty in
collecting taxes; to an increase in the burden o f the debt; and to higher interest rates,
which would raise debt servicing needs.

1.17  Thus, the crucial question when evaluating the performance o f fiscal operations in
Colombia i s whether (and to what extent) the fiscal condition o f the country has
improved independently o f the improved overall economic performance o f the country
and o f the windfall o i l price boom-as was clearly the overall objective o f the evaluated
operations. In other words, the question is whether a reversal o f the exogenous
conditions that have improved since the early 2000s would not result in a fiscal crisis
similar to the one that prompted the design o f the fiscal operations.

1.18 These questions cannot be answered in a definitive way. Yet, it is possible t o
look at the different aspects o f fiscal perfonnance to ascertain whether they are likely to
be sustainable if the exogenous variables that influence the Colombian economy so
deeply were to deteriorate. The next three chapters deal with this issue: chapters 2 and 3
review the implementation o f the fiscal loans, while chapter 4 examines the main changes
in the fiscal situation o f the country that took place from 2001 t o 2005.

2. The Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan

2.1         The 1999 Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CAS-PR) noted that the
performance o f the Colombian economy had deteriorated sharply during the two years
since the presentation o f the last full CAS, particularly in terms o f economic growth and
fiscal stability. Controlling the fiscal deficit was very difficult because o f the substantial
rigidities that existed in the fiscal system. Worst among them was the rigidity o f the
transfers to local and regional governments, which were fixed as a percent o f fiscal
revenues, reducing the government’s ability to save part o f those revenues. The sharp
increase in the fiscal deficit that was taking place in those years was largely attributed to
t h i s rigidity. The fiscal situation negatively affected the CAS objectives in two crucial
dimensions. First, the fiscal deficits generated substantial instability, which in turn
affected the economy’s ability to grow and allocate its resources efficiently. Second, the
composition o f public expenditure was shifting, with current expenditures increasing
while public sector investment was declining fast. As a result, restoring the fiscal balance
was deemed crucial for the success o f Colombia’s efforts to recover growth and reduce
poverty. This set the policy framework for the SFAL, which would help the Colombian
government to reduce the fiscal deficit by reducing the rigidity o f the transfers to the
local and regional governments, as well as by improving the financial management of
some educational and social security institutions.

A.      TheLoan

2.2     The SFAL was a US$400 million fixed-spread loan, with a maturity o f 13.5 years.
The loan was programmed for disbursements in three tranches over a 14-month period,
with the disbursement o f each tranche being tied to the implementation o f the fiscal
reform program. It was approved o n November 16,2001. The following subsections
discuss the attainment o f each o f i t s components.

B.      Objectives

2.3     According to the Report and Recommendation o f the President, the SFAL “was
the Bank’s response to the government’s demonstrated commitment to reaching an
inflection point in Colombia’s fiscal accounts path, an essential first step toward
achieving full fiscal sustainability, economic growth, and poverty reduction.” The
program supported by the SFAL aimed at improving the country’s fiscal outlook by
focusing on a core set o f policies. This policy package involved:

        Macroeconomic framework. Improve the country’s macroeconomic situation
        and particularly the fiscal situation.
        Containment o f expenditures. Help the fiscal adjustment by reducing current
        and general expenditures in real terms.
        Transfers to local governments. Rationalize the system o f transfers t o local
        governments, and impose more market- driven and more binding budget
        constraints o n their finances;
        Public health efficiency. Establish mechanisms to arrest the exploding cost o f
        inefficiency in the provision o f public health services;
                                                          10


         Pension liabilities. Halt the accumulation o f pension-related contingent
         liabilities;
         I S S Reform. Advance the reorganization o f the Social Security Institution to
         make it financially viable; and
         Public Debt. Set up a better system for managing public debt.
         Education. Carry out some institutional improvements in the provision o f
         education at the local and regional levels.

C.       Components
2.4    The loan had seven components to meet these objectives. The following
subsections review them briefly.

Macroeconomic Framework
2.5      As shown in Table 1, the fiscal situation deteriorated during the implementation
o f the SFAL: (a) the fiscal deficit increased from 3.5 percent to 4.2 percent o f GDP; and
(b) current expenditures continued to increase while capital expenditures continued to
fall, both as a percent o f GDP.

2.6       The fiscal balance was substantially worse than in 2001, when the loan was
approved to improve it, and much worse than the targets established in the Bank and the
IMF programs. While the Bank did not establish an explicit fiscal deficit target in the
conditionality o f the loan, paragraph 53 referred to a set o f projections contained in Table
 1 o f the President’s Report as the expected outcomes o f the program that the loan was to
support. In that table, the target fiscal deficit was 3.1 percent o f GDP. The target under
the then existing IMF’s EFF was 2.8 percent. This means that the fiscal deficit in 2002
was 1.1 percent o f GDP worse than the expected outcome contained in the Bank’s
President’s Report, 1.4 percent o f GDP worse than the IMF’s target, and 0.7 percent o f
GDP worse than in 2001.

2.7     The I C R rated this component as satisfactory, justifying this rating with the
following arguments: “During the program period Colombia encountered several
economic challenges. It faced issues o f contagion resulting from economic problems in
Venezuela, the largest market for Colombia’s nontraditional exports; the worsening o f
market sentiment toward Latin America; and slow economic recovery in the United
States, Colombia’s main trading partner. Internally it faced increasing security costs at
the same time as it was undergoinga political transition. In light o f these issues and i t s
efforts to maintain a stable economy, despite a significant deterioration in its fiscal deficit
in 2002, the macroeconomic framework is evaluated as having been consistent with the
objectives o f the program.”

2.8     IEG’s I C R review concurred with the I C R in rating this aspect o f the loan
“satisfactory”, noting that the rate o f growth o f the economy had improved, that inflation
had declined and that “the fiscal deficit grew in 2002, contrary to the program’s
objectives, but then it fell in 2003.”

2.9      There were indeed improvements (albeit rather modest ones) in the rate o f growth
o f the economy (which rose from 1.5 to 1.9 percent) and inflation (which f e l l from 7.9 to
6.4 percent) between 2001 and 2002. Despite these improvements, tax collection fell by
0.1 percent o f GDP while current expenditures increased by one percent o f GDP,
worsening the fiscal deficit, which was a problem that the loan had aimed at ameliorating.
Moreover, while the deficit improved one year later, in 2003, this happened under the
FIAL program, reviewed in the next chapter and, as noted there, it did so mainly because
the country’s external conditions improved.

2.10 This report rates the achievement o f the objective o f this component negligible, as
the government did not only fail to advance in the attainment o f i t s objectives but in fact
experienced a setback. Setbacks can be understandable but cannot be considered
satisfactory. In terms o f achievement o f objectives, the report rates the component
negligible.

Public Sector Reform (Expenditure Control)
2.1 1 This component was aimed at addressing the lack o f control over government
expenditures (rather than public sector reform in general), which was one o f the main
causes o f the fiscal deterioration that prevailed at the time o f the SFAL design. Under the
loan, the government undertook commitments to reduce and rationalize such spending in
two main categories: current and general expenditures.

2.12 Current expenditures. The government committed itself to reduce these
expenditures by more than 4 percent in real terms from 2001 to 2002 in the approved
budget for central government current expenditure. The approved budget complied with
this restriction (as did spending levels at the time o f the second tranche release in 2002).
However, final spending by year-end was a 4 percent increase over FY2001 spending
levels in real terms. Thus, the difference between the commitment and the outcome was
8 percent in real terms.

2.13 General expenditures. The commitment was to reduce these expenditures by 19
percent in real terms. As with current expenditures, the government reduced the
                                             12


budgetary appropriations by the agreed amount. However, also as in the case o f current
expenditures, these expenditures actually increased during the implementation o f the
budget, by 16 percent in real terms, making for a difference between goal and
achievement o f 35 percent in real terms.

2.14 The ICR rated this component as moderately satisfactory and the IEG’s ICR
Review unsatisfactory. This report rates the outcome o f this component as highly
unsatisfactory because, rather than reducing the current and the general expenditures in
real terms, the government increased them by the amounts it was supposed to reduce
them. In terms o f achievement o f objectives, the report rates the component as
negligible.

Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations
2.15 Intergovernmental fiscal relations became a serious problem during the 1990s.
According to the 1991 Constitution, the central administration should transfer some o f i t s
revenues to territorial governments to support spending, especially on health and
education. The constitution stated that the transfers should rise in line with the growth in
current revenues, worsening a fiscal rigidity problem that was already substantial in
Colombia. The problem, however, went beyond rigidity. The local and regional
governments overspent and asked for complementary funds, which were routinely
granted even if they were substantial.

2.16    The loan objectives in this respect were the following.
    e   Intergovernmental transfers. Fix in real terms the rate o f growth o f fiscal
        transfers to the regional and local governments for 2002 and thereafter.
    e   Local taxation. Reform the tax system o f territorial entities (Estatuto de Ingresos
        Territoriales) to increase sub-national tax revenues by more than 20 percent in i t s
        first year o f application.
    e   Local and regional borrowing. Issue and implement a decree to regulate debt
        and borrowing o f territorial entities that would contribute to halting unsustainable
        borrowing, limiting bailouts, and eliminating discretion in the treatment o f debt.

2.17    Intergovernmental transfers. This objective was attained. A constitutional
reform created what was called a “transition period” fiom 2002 to 2008. During that
period, transfers in real terms would grow at 2 percent per year fiom 2002 to 2005, and at
2.5 percent per year from 2006 to 2008. According to the amendment, transfers would
increase in line with the central administration’s current revenue again from 2009 on.

2.18 The reform, however, worsened the rigidity o f the fiscal budget. Prior to the
reform, these transfers increased and decreased with revenues. With the new provision,
they would always grow at a fixed rate during the period o f effectiveness o f the
Constitutional reform. Thus, rigidity would remain a crucial problem. Only one year
later, the FIAL documents would call rigidity “the key constraint to effective public
                                                                                              13


policy”.2 In fact, fiscal flexibility was sacrificed in exchange for: (a) predictability (the
real rate o f growth o f transfers was both a floor and a ceiling); and (b) a potential long-
term gain that would be obtained by fixing the rate o f growth o f transfers at a rate lower
than the average rate o f growth o f fiscal revenues or GDP.

2.19 Over the last 30 years, the rate o f growth o f GDP did tend to be higher than 2.5
percent-it averaged 3.5 percent (Figure 5). If this average rate were to be maintained in
the future, the r u l e would result in a reduction in the share o f GDP being transferred to
the territorial authorities. Yet, there are three problems with this reasoning. First, the
rigidity could cause serious fiscal problems in the years when GDP grows by less than
2.5 percent. There were 10 such years since 1975 and, in one o f them (1999), the
difference in the rates o f growth was almost 7 percent. Being forced to increase transfers
in a year o f GDP decline would worsen the problems o f fiscal adjustment, particularly in
a country where fiscal rigidity i s already a serious problem and where, by 2005, transfers
had reached 4.9 percent o f GDP, and about 40 percent o f public expenditure was carried
out at the decentralized level. Second, while over the last 30 years the economy’s rate o f
growth was higher than 2.5 percent, in the last 10 years it was only 2.2 percent, and if this
average growth rate were to prevail in the future, the share o f GDP transferred to
territorial authorities would increase. In any case, establishing a fixed rate o f growth for
the transfers to the local and territorial entities clearly increased the rigidity o f the system
and created a problem that the Bank i s now urging the government to remove. The 2005
Country Economic Memorandum identifies the growth o f these transfers in real terms as
one o f the main fiscal problems and recommends keeping them constant to facilitate

2.20    In actuality, the rates o f growth o f GDP and fiscal revenues had exceeded
2.5 percent in real terms since 2003, which had resulted in a decline in the ratio o f local
and regional transfers t o GDP and to fiscal revenues since that year. The government i s
planning to propose t o the National Assembly t o turn the 2001 Constitutional reform
permanent when its life ends in 2009.

2.21 In sum, the Constitutional reform that the FIAL supported helped t o introduce
order in the process o f transfers, as fixing their rate o f growth in real terms in practice
eliminated the budget adjustments that were at the root o f the still faster growth o f these
expenditures in the years prior to the reform. The problem i s that the reform actually
increased the system’s rigidity: under the current Constitutional provision the government
would not be able to stop or even reduce the real rate o f growth o f transfers if the country
gets into a slump. If the situation that prevailed from 1998 t o 2002 were to prevail again,
the transfers to the local and regional governments would increase by 10.4 percent in real
terms while GDP would have increased by only 2.0 percent over the 4 years. Given that
one o f the objectives o f the loan was t o reduce the rigidities o f the Colombian fiscal
system, and particularly their effect o n the country’s ability to adjust in critical
circumstances, this was a highly unsatisfactory outcome. In terms o f achievement o f the
objectives, the report rates the component negligible.

2.22 Local taxation and debt. The two other objectives o f the intergovernmental
fiscal relations component were attained: sub-national tax revenues increased by more
than 20 percent, and debt management o f territorial authorities has improved. In fact, as
discussed later, the territorial authorities are in fiscal surplus nowadays, although to a
large extent this is due to the lack o f implementation capacity.

2.23 Although the government attained its stated objective, the reform increased the
country’s fiscal rigidity, an already severe problem, the solution o f which became the
main objective o f the FIAL program. This report therefore rates t h i s component as
highly unsatisfactory. The achievement o f objectives was negligible.

Health
2.24 The government’s main commitments with respect to health services were to: (a)
reduce inefficient supply-side subsidies; and (b) limit the fiscal costs to the national
government while improving service. According to the matrix o f policy actions o f the
loan, the Ministry o f Health, the Department o f National Planning, and the Ministry o f
Finance would define and approve a national public hospital restructuring policy and an
implementation program for the next five years, and would begin the implementation o f
the first phase, including the selection o f at least 10 departments. Additionally, the
government would sign contracts with at least three sub-national governments to finance
the restructuring o f public hospitals.

2.25 Under the SFAL, the government implemented the National Hospital
Restructuring Policy. The pilot phase o f the program in 2002 covered more than 10
departments and 15 percent o f the total hospital budget. The program included specific
targets for cost reduction and productivity increases, which, according to the ICR,
generated more than 5 percent in fiscal savings per month.
                                            15


2.26   This report confirms the I C R rating o f satisfactory for this component. The
achievement o f objectives was substantial.

Institute of Social Security (ISS) Reform
2.27   At the time o f approval o f the SFAL, the ISS was not financially viable. The
government had initiated a restructuring plan for the health aspects o f ISS, including
negotiating with ISS unions about labor costs and benefits, and had implemented the first
phase, including renegotiation o f 50 percent or more o f ISS's total outstanding debt to
health service providers, and reduction o f at least 30 percent o f the waiting list for
elective surgeries (as o f June 30,2001). The government and the ISS had reached an
agreement to generate annual savings in ISS's total costs over a 10-year period which
would, in the opinion o f the Bank, make ISS financially and economically viable. The
plan, however, did not work and the ISS remains as unviable as it was in 2001.

2.28 The I C R rated this component as unsatisfactory. This report confirms this rating.
It rates the achievement o f objectives negligible.

Pensions
2.29 The condition o f Colombia's pension system constituted a major risk to fiscal
sustainability over the medium and long term at the time o f loan design. The pension
system was technically insolvent and the annual imbalances in the public sector worker
regimes were increasing. The estimated net present value o f pension system liabilities
amounted to about 200 percent o f GDP in 2000-up from an estimated 150 percent o f
GDP in 1997. Moreover, the Treasury's transfers to finance the deficits for public sector
worker regimes increased from about 0.8 percent o f GDP in 1991 to 1.3 percent o f GDP
in 1995 and to 2.3 percent o f GDP in 2000. The causes o f the current pension system
insolvency and liquidity problems included too-generous benefits, benefit guarantees,
perverse incentives for reserve management, and a Constitutional Court ruling expanding
pension benefits.

2.30    This component had three objectives:

    0   Improving social security system control through the creation o f a new social
        security department; this i s estimated to generate fiscal savings o f around $100
        million in 200 1.
    0   Concentrating transfers o f the public sector pension regimes into a single agency
        which i s estimated to generate savings o f around $10 million per month on
        average.
    0   Enacting a series o f parametric reforms that would make the pension system more
        equitable and sustainable.

2.3 1 Regarding the first two objectives, the government created the Social Security
Economic Regulation Agency (Direcci6n de Regulaci6n Econ6mica de l a Seguridad
Social, DRESS) to serve as a counterpart and advisor to the Ministry o f Social Protection
(Ministerio de Protecci6n Social, MPS) in managing and tracking pension and social
security expenditures. The activities o f DRESS include the tracking, validation, and the
calculation o f actuarial pension benefits, and the pension payments o f the National Public
                                              16


Pension Fund (Fondo de Pensiones Publicas del Nivel Nacional, FOPEP). Ongoing
controls and enhanced administration generated significant fiscal savings in the areas o f
pensions, health, and workers compensation (estimated at US$300 million in 200 1).

2.32 Regarding the third objective, the Congress also passed a pension reform law in
December 2002. With these reforms in place, new entrants into the system will not
generate increases in the actuarial deficit, although this deficit s t i l l exists and further
reform or financing i s required to overcome this. The government enacted further
reforms after the closing o f the loan. These reforms, enacted from 2002 to 2005, together
with demographic trends, are expected to reduce payments o f pension benefits by 1
percentage point o f GDP by 2015.

2.33 This report concurs with the ICR in rating this component satisfactory. It rates
the achievement o f objectives substantial.

Public Debt
2.34 As noted in the Introduction to this report, the analysis o f the overall fiscal
commitment and public debt sustainability i s contained in chapter 4 for the SFAL and the
FIAL operations. Regarding the specific objectives o f SFAL in this respect, the
government would develop new portfolio and funding strategies, integrating fiscal
projections with portfolio analysis, with the ultimate aim o f reducing the central
government’s debt exposure. The government carried out these activities to the
satisfaction o f the Bank.

2.35 This report concurs with the ICR in rating this component satisfactory. It rates
the achievement o f objectives modest.

Education
2.36     With the passing o f Law 715 o f 2001,the government created a framework to
certify the adequacy o f management in the provision o f education services at the local
and regional levels. The law allowed all municipalities that are capitals o f departments or
have a population o f more than 100,000 inhabitants to receive certification. These
represented more than 40 percent o f the country’s school enrollment. Performance
monitoring mechanisms were also established with these municipalities to monitor
quality o f service provision.

2.37 This report confirms the ICR rating, satisfactory. It rates the achievement o f
objectives modest.

D.       Assessment o f the Operation

2.39 Quality at entry. The quality at entry was deficient because the design o f the
loan introduced a budgetary rigidity (the rates o f growth o f the intergovernmental
transfers in real terms) among the most important activities that it supported. Just one
year later the Bank was branding budgetary rigidities as the worst obstacle t o public
policy making.

2.40    Relevance. The overall objectives o f the operation were relevant to the problems
o f Colombia and fully consistent with the CAS, although the design o f the operation, as
noted above, served to worsen a key weakness o f the fiscal system.

2.41 Outcomes. According to the ICR, “the S F A L assisted the government in two
important ways. First, it helped the government to begin a process o f slowing the growth
o f fiscal imbalances. The proceeds from the loan helped to reduce the cost o f borrowing
and t o lengthen the debt maturity by providing a confidence-building signal t o
international markets, all o f which gave the government fiscal space for protecting social
sector expenditures and implementing difficult structural measures. Second, the SFAL
promoted reforms in the provision o f public services that improved incentive structures
and provided substantial efficiency gains. As a result, the fiscal rigidities facing the
Colombian government were reduced and the fiscal situation i s gradually stabilizing-
important first steps in putting Colombia o n a sustainable path.”
                                              18


2.42 This report does not take such a sanguine view o f the operation. Certainly,
several components o f varying importance had satisfactory results. However, the
government failed in two o f the fundamental ones. First, it established a rule for
intergovernmental transfers that increased fiscal rigidity, which only months later was
identified by the FIAL program as one o f the worst fiscal problems o f the country.
Second, it failed in the key stabilizing condition: reducing current expenditures by 4
percent and general expenditures by 15 percent (both in real terms). Rather than falling
by the promised results, these expenditures increased by almost the same magnitudes in
real terms. Moreover, the government was unable to reverse the trend in the composition
o f expenditures, which was increasing current expenditures at the expense o f capital
ones; in fact, current expenditures increased while the capital ones declined. A s a result
o f all these factors, the outcomes contradicted the objectives o f the loan and the overall
fiscal situation worsened instead o f improving.

2.43      Institutional development was substantial in pension reform but negligible in the
rest o f the operation. While pension reform was a crucial component o f fiscal reform, i t s
institutional development f e l l short o f what was needed in the other areas o f the loan to
meet the loan objectives-to help the government take an essential first step toward
achieving full fiscal sustainability, economic growth, and poverty reduction.

2.44 The ratings by component show that four o f the eight had a satisfactory outcome.
Yet, the components that had a more direct bearing o n the ultimate objectives o f the loan
were rated highly unsatisfactory: (a) improving the fiscal balance by (b) reducing current
and general expenditures in real terms and by (c) reducing the rigidity o f the fiscal
system. Since (a) the fiscal balance deteriorated while (b) current and general
expenditures increased substantially in real terms and (c) fiscal rigidity increased, the
rating o f the operation o n the basis o f its most important objectives would be highly
unsatisfactory. Given that the project included other components and that four o f them
were completed satisfactorily, this report rates the SFAL moderately unsatisfactory.

2.45 Risk to development outcome. The loan did not meet i t s objectives during i t s
lifetime. It i s not likely t o meet them afterwards because i t s risk to development outcome
i s substantial in four dimensions. First, given that the deficit worsened rather than
improved, the fiscal measures supported by the loan lacked viability in the long term.
Second, the fiscal deterioration that took place during the l i f e o f the loan showed a l o w
level o f ownership and commitment by the government to the objectives o f the loan.
Third, the institutional setting did not improve in terms o f i t s ability to support the loan
objectives during and after loan implementation. Fourth, as discussed in Chapter 4, the
capacity o f the country to respond effectively to a worsening o f economic conditions,
such as those that originated the loan, did not improve as a result o f the loan. For these
reasons this report rates the risk to development high.

2.46 Bank performance. The supervision o f the loan was satisfactory in the sense
that the staff did its best to help the borrower to meet the objectives o f the loan. This did
not fully compensate for the fact that the design o f the loan, which included as part o f the
conditionality a reform that worsened one o f the main fiscal problems o f the country. For
this reason the Bank performance i s rated moderately unsatisfactory.

2.47    Borrower performance. Given the poor performance o n reducing expenditures,
a central objective in improving the fiscal outlook, the borrower performance i s rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

3. The Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional
   Adjustment Loan Program

A.     T h e Program and its Objectives
3.1     The Board o f Directors approved the FIAL program on February 2003 to support
the program o f reforms proposed by the new Uribe administration. The program would
support a series o f up to four loans, with a notional envelope o f up to US$900 million in
total. The loans were h l l y consistent with the 2003 CAS. In reality, the program
supported only three loans, for a total o f US$550 million (US$300 million equivalent for
FIAL I  ,approved on March 18,2003; US$150 million equivalent for FIAL 1         1, approved
on November 24,2003; and US$lOO million equivalent for FIAL 1          11, approved on April
23,2005). The first loan was released on March 20,2003; the second o n November 24,
2003 and the third on April 25,2005. The last loan was closed on June 30,2005.

3.2     The Letter o f Development Policy described the overall objectives o f the program
as twofold: “first, to promote reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessary to attain the
substantial fiscal adjustment underlying sustainable macroeconomic stability; and second,
to improve the provision o f public services and establish the institutional basis for higher
efficiency and accountability in public expenditure. The emphasis o f the reform program
would gradually shift, f i o m tax and fiscal responsibility at the beginning, to expenditure
and public sector reform towards the second and third years o f the program.”

3.3        Regarding the first objective, the same letter stated that: “The fundamental issue
that constrains the implementation o f financial policy in Colombia i s the inability o f the
government to access the necessary budgetary resources to attend policy priorities. Fiscal
rigidities, in the broad sense, incorporate a number o f concepts that cover areas such as
tax policy and administration, budget management, civil service, judicial decisions, and
administrative processes such as public procurement and contracting and asset
management. The common thread that connects these diverse areas is that they all
generate an entrenched expenditure that i s difficult to reduce, produce excessive costs
derived from fundamental inefficiencies, and/or prevent a revenue source from reaching
i t s full potential.”

3.4    Among the most important types o f fiscal rigidities, the letter mentions the legal
and financial expenditures that create permanent rigidities in public spending.

3.5    The program would attain these objectives through a multiplicity o f sub-
components. The following sections review the specific objectives o f these and their
outcomes. At the end o f the chapter there are two rating sections: the first rates the entire
FIAL series as a whole and the second each o f the FIAL loans. The macroeconomic
framework and the overall fiscal commitment o f the FIAL series are rated in chapter 4
Section E.
                                                   22


B.      Revenue Rigidities and Tax Reform

3.6     O n the tax side, the objectives o f the program were: (a) increasing collection; and
(b) doing so while eliminating the main rigidities that introduced inefficiencies in
taxation, which included prominently innumerable exemptions t o income tax and Value
Added Tax (VAT) as well as the multiple VAT rates applied t o different activities. At
the time o f the FIAL design, the government had added a new distortion t o the tax
system: the tax on financial transactions, which is a classic example o f a distorting tax (it
is easy to evade by distorting behavior in an inefficient way, as people can avoid paying
it by avoiding the use o f the financial system, which reduces financial intermediation,
which in turn reduces the overall efficiency o f the economy).

3.7     The tax component o f the FIAL aimed at reducing these rigidities and
inefficiencies with three sub-components, which are briefly reviewed in the following
subsections.

Rut (Registro Unico Fiscal, Or Tax Registryl
3.8     The FIAL program supported the establishment o f the RUT. The RUT would
identify each taxpayer with a unique number, which then would become an instrument o f
tax compliance control because it would be used in all transactions carried out in the
country. A number similar to the RUT already existed in Colombia; the program
supported its substitution with the more flexible RUT, which had more digits and could
convey more information. This condition was met. The PPAR rates the achievement o f
the objective o f this sub-component substantial, and the outcome satisfactory.

New Laws and Regulations
3.9     This sub-component relied o n the enactment o f two laws (Laws 788 and 863),
which were duly enacted, formally complying with the conditions in this respect. Yet,
their enactment did not produce the expected results, in such a way that the formal
compliance did not mean compliance in substance.

3.10    L a w 788. The most important objective o f the enactment o f Tax Reform L a w 788
in December 2002 was the elimination o f exemptions and the expansion o f the tax base
for the Value Added Tax (VAT).4 Certainly, some o f these exemptions were eliminated
and the variety o f VAT rates was reduced. Yet, four years later, the IMF Stand-By
document for 2006 states the following:

3.1 1 “The authorities will submit legislation by August 2006 to reform the tax system,
which i s highly complex and distortionary with 9 VAT rates and the highest top income
tax rate in the region at 38.5 percent (structural benchmark). K e y elements o f the
authorities’ proposals would include reducing the number o f VAT rates, and broadening
the base; lowering the top income tax rate and curtailing exemptions and deductions, and



  Other objectives included: (i)
                               establishing a new ceiling on the wage exemption for personal income tax,
and reducing incentives for non-taxed compensation to employees; and (ii)   phasing out the corporate
income tax exemption for capital gains from sales o f stock, mutual funds and real estate and for profits
from previously privileged corporate forms, contracts, funds or bonds.
                                                   23


possibly reducing the minimum threshold o f income subject to tax; and diminishing the
distorting effects o f the financial transactions tax (FTT) by lowering the rate (currently
0.4 percent) or by making FTT payments deductible from the income tax. They are also
considering a proposal to retain the tax on wealth (which was set to expire), with the
revenues to be earmarked for additional military spending. The staff urged the authorities
to also trim the so-called para-fiscal taxes (small payroll taxes earmarked to fund various
social programs), which raise non-wage labor costs and deter formal sector employment.
The authorities were sympathetic to this view but saw little political support for progress
in this area.”

3.12 The problems mentioned in this paragraph are very similar to those that the FIALs
had supposedly resolved.’

3.13 L a w 863. O n December 29,2003, Congress passed L a w 863, which made further
improvements in tax policy, but also introduced new distortions to the tax system.
Regarding this Law, the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum says the following:

3.14 “Although most o f the reforms enacted in 2003 were desirable, two were not.
Overriding L a w 788 o f 2002, which specified that the 10 percent surcharge under the
corporate income tax would be reduced to 5 percent in 2005, L a w 863 (Article 7) instead
extended the 10 percent surcharge for 2005 and 2006. This policy change i s undesirable
since the base tax rate o f 35 percent i s already high by international standards. This
discourages capital formation, including foreign direct investment, and encourages
transfer pricing schemes and other manipulations by multinational f i r m s thereby reducing
Colombian tax revenues. A preferable approach would be to expand the corporate
income tax base by eliminating more exemptions. Law 863 also raised the tax rate o f the
financial transactions tax from 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent o f the transactions.”6

3.15 In sum, the government complied with the formal conditions by enacting the two
laws mentioned in the sub-component. Yet, one o f the laws l e f t in place most o f the
distortions present in the tax legislation and the other actually worsened the deficiencies
o f the system by increasing the tax on financial transactions. That is, removing
distortions was the ultimate objective o f this component but instead they became worse.
The PPAR rates the achievement o f the objective o f this sub-component negligible, and
the outcome highly unsatisfactory.

Improving Tax Administration
3.16 The actions contained in the original policy matrix in this dimension were taken
from the modernization plan o f the National Tax and Customs Office at the Ministry o f
Finance (DIAN, i t s acronym in Spanish), which was supported through the Bank-funded
Second Public Financial Management Technical Assistance Loan (PFMP 1        1 , or M A F P I1
in Spanish). These plans included the design and installation o f a model o f income



5
 In spite o f the intentions expressed by the IMF report, the government requested and obtained in 2006 an
extension o f the l i f e o f the financial transactions tax.

control called MUISCA in Spanish as well as many other activities aimed at improving
DIAN’s ability to track i t s customers. The plan was implemented successfully.

3.17 One o f the measures that the tax authorities mentioned as most effective in
improving the collection o f the VAT and the income tax, however, raises an important
issue o f fiscal equity. Such measure i s the devolution o f 2 points o f the VAT when the
purchases that originate the tax are made with credit or debit cards. Having the payments
made with such cards greatly increases the tax administration’s ability to compare income
tax and expenditures information to guide tax inspections. Yet, the measure
discriminates against the people who do not have access to credit or debit cards, which
tend to be the poor and the people living faraway from the banking system. In a country
with 27 percent o f the population living in rural areas, 18 percent living under $2 per day,
only 2 percent paying income tax, and a ratio o f total deposits to GDP o f 26 percent, the
number o f people paying 2 points o f VAT more than the rest o f the population just
because they do not have access to credit or debit cards would seem to be sub~tantial.~
This is a major distortion that was introduced with the 2003 reforms, which biases the
VAT against the poor and those without banking services.

3.18 This report considers that the equity issue in the collection o f taxes negatively
affects the otherwise satisfactory structural improvement o f tax administration. For this
reason, this report rates the outcome o f the Tax Administration sub-component
moderately satisfactory, while it rates the achievement o f objectives substantial.

        f Revenue Rigidities and Tax Reform
Summary o
3.19 There are three aspects to taxation performance. First, there are the structural
problems that the FIAL addressed, mainly related to the large number o f tax rates and
exemptions that characterize the Colombian system. These structural problems s t i l l exist
and, according to the IMF and the Bank’s Country Economic Memorandum, they are s t i l l
substantial-they are, in fact, the main problems in today’s tax legislation and
administration. Some o f these problems actually became worse as a result o f laws
enacted under the FIAL program. Second, there were substantial advances in tax
administration, which were attained with the support o f PFMP 1  1.

3.20    The third aspect i s revenue performance since the beginning o f the FIALs. The
central government made a serious effort to increase tax revenues since the early 199Os,
with very good results: tax revenues rose from 10.3 to 14.9 percent o f GDP in the last t e n
years (Figure 6).




’There are only 1.4 million registered income tax payers in a country with 50 million inhabitants. Only 70
percent o f the registered people make some payment. Sources o f data: poverty and rural population from
World Development Indicators (World Bank); ratio o f deposits to GDP from International Financial
Statistics (IMF); income tax payers from DIAN.

3.2 1 This improvement could be attributed to several factors-including improvements
in the tax structure, in tax administration, and in overall economic performance.* The
I C R presents a decomposition o f the growth o f tax revenues into the effects o f each o f the
four tax laws that were modified during the period, in such a way that nothing i s left to
allow for the improvement in tax administration. There i s no way, however, t o prove that
this decomposition corresponds to reality. In the opinion o f the IEG mission, based o n
several indicators provided by the DIAN, i t seems that the increase in the tax collection
as a percent o f GDP i s due mainly to improvements in tax administration. This cannot be
proved, either. Thus, this component was evaluated based o n the following facts:

               Tax collection increased very rapidly which, discarding an effect o f tax buoyancy,
               may have been caused by improvements in tax administration, or in the structure
               o f the taxes.
               Regarding these two possibilities, there was a very rapid improvement in tax
               administration and a highly unsatisfactory progress in the structural reform o f the
               taxes themselves.

3.22 Based on these facts, and considering that one o f the main objectives o f the
program was the reduction or elimination o f tax rigidities, this report rates the outcome o f
the revenue rigidities sub-component unsatisfactory, and the achievement o f the objective
o f this sub-component modest. The I C R rated this component satisfactory. IEG's I C R
Review o f FIAL 1  11, the only review that rates the components o f the FIALs, rates the

  It i s well known that there i s buoyancy in tax systems, which results in increases in collection as a percent
o f GDP when GDP or income per capita increases. In the case o f Colombia, for example, this can be seen
in the behavior o f income taxes paid by Ecopetrol, the profits o f which increased from 2.3 to 3.6 percent o f
GDP from 2002 to 2005. At a maximum rate o f 35 percent, the income taxes paid by this corporation
would have increased fiom 0.8 to 1.2 percent o f GDP, making for a difference o f 0.4 percent o f GDP.

achievement o f the objective for tax administration high and in tax structural reforms
modest, mostly for the same reasons cited in this report.

C.      Public Administration

3.23 The backbone o f the public sector reform process was the Programa de
R e n o v a c i h de l a Administracih Phblica (PRAP), led by the National Planning
Department (DNP), and based upon Presidential Directive 10 o f October 2002. This
program had so-called “vertical” reforms, which were basically sector or entity-specific
institutional restructuring actions seeking to reduce excess public sector employment and
enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness o f public services; and “horizontal” reforms,
which encompassed cross-sector issues o f public administration, such as asset
management, procurement, and others. During the second semester o f 2002, the
government agreed with the multilateral banks that the public sector reform process
would be supported by structural adjustment loans from both the Bank and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB). The Bank focused o n the achievement o f efficiency
gains in the “horizontal” elements o f the reform process.’ T h e IDB, o n the other hand,
focused its adjustment lending o n the “vertical” elements o f reform, and some horizontal
elements not covered by the Bank. The following subsections summarize the sub-
components o f the Public Administration component.

Improving the Budget
3.24 The Colombian budgeting system was plagued by numerous structural problems
at the time o f the FIAL design. The program documents identified as the worst o f these
the rigidities created by earmarked revenues, which eliminated the fiscal space needed to
accommodate revenue shocks or changes in expenditure priorities. Budgetary allocations
actually authorized spending agencies to commit resources.1o This led to large
accumulations o f arrears in years when revenues fell below expected levels (which
occurred quite often). In terms o f the composition o f expenditure, budget rigidity derived
from high levels o f both “structural” expenditures (such as pensions, debt service, and
transfers) and law-based permanent earmarks basically l e f t fiscal authorities with no
room to maneuver. Since eliminating these rigidities was the main component o f the
loan, this was the main sub-component o f the program.

3.25 T o address this problem, the FIAL aimed at persuading Congress to enact: (a) a
constitutional reform giving the Executive Branch the necessary powers to manage the



  Program document for a proposed second programmatic fiscal and institutional adjustment loan to the
Republic o f Colombia, Report No. 27068-C0, October 23,2003, paragraph 21.
lo The FIAL documents identified other problems in this sub-component. They included: (i)       a budget
structure that i s incompatible with economic, functional, or performance analyses; (ii) a Ministry o f
Finance with limited authority to regulate public expenditure aggregates; (iii) complex institutional
arrangements that in effect divide the budget process into separate current expenditure and investment
processes; (iv) budgeting definitions that do not fall under internationally accepted standards; (v) a lack o f
instruments to develop a medium-term vision o f fiscal policy; and (vi) a lack o f substantial evaluation o f
public expenditure results, among others. See program document for a proposed second programmatic
fiscal and institutional adjustment loan to the Republic o f Colombia, Report No. 27068-C0, October 23,
2003, paragraphs 2-3.

budget within fiscal targets; and (b) amendments to the organic budget law, which would
turn these powers effective.

3.26 Congress passed neither the constitutional reform nor the amendments to the
organic budget law. The component then focused on a series o f less ambitious actions,
which resulted in some improvements in the budgeting methodology." Yet, the main
problems leading to budget inflexibility are still there. As noted by the third FIAL ICR,
the lack o f structural progress in the budget system was one o f the reasons why the FIAL
program did not progress into i t s fourth and final 10an.l~

3.27 Moreover, as discussed in a subsequent subsection, the program contained a sub-
component that aimed at earmarking the royalty revenues received by the government,
contradicting the overall objective o f eliminating the rigidities affecting the budget. This
report rates the outcome o f this component highly unsatisfactory, noting that it was
fundamental to the success o f the program.

Fiscal Responsibility
3.28 The key expected results o f this sub-component were: (i)       enactment o f measures
by the Government for signaling and disclosing fiscal targets; and (ii)   collection and
publication o f reliable fiscal sustainability data by the Central Government for the 50
largest sub-national governments. The Government enacted L a w 8 19 in 2003. Among
the key principles o f this new law were the establishment o f a medium-term fiscal
framework, guidelines for ensuring debt sustainability, definition o f macroeconomic
targets, and transparency measures such as the publication o f tax expenditures and
improved fiscal reports to Congress.

3.29 This report rates the outcome o f this component satisfactory and the achievement
o f objectives substantial.

Public Sector Assets Management
3.30 The government was unable to track or even identify the totality o f its assets at
the time o f the design o f the FIAL program. The reforms carried out under the FIAL
program were aimed at resolving this problem. The sub-component included the
following activities:

        Institutional setting. The Technical Secretariat became responsible for the
        enactment o f policies, under the supervision o f a multi-sector commission created
        for the purpose. This setting i s in place since 2004.
        Legislation. The government introduced flexibility in the procedures needed to
        dispose o f the assets. This reform is s t i l l in process, with some pieces o f
        legislation s t i l l missing.




   Congress enacted an organic statute o f the budget, but this only puts together already existing
regulations.

   0    Asset management. The central government wants to sell or transfer most o f the
        assets to the territorial entities. Up to mid-2006, it had sold assets for $103
        million, receiving 85 percent o f this amount in cash. The government estimates
        that the remaining assets have a value o f $2 billion, o f which $700 million can be
        sold. The plan is to sell these in a massive sale with the help o f an investment
        bank.

3.31 This report rates the outcome o f this component satisfactory and the achievement
o f objectives modest.

Public Sector Procurement
3.32 The L a w 80 o f 1993 established the main principles under which public sector
procurement works in Colombia. It opened the possibility o f contracting out to the
private sector the provision o f public services. The government had prepared a series o f
legal reforms that would upgrade the system to international standards. These reforms
were not approved by Congress.

3.33    The FIAL then supported improvements in the following aspects:

        Policy coordination. The government created an Inter-Sector Procurement
        Commission, with no staff, for this purpose. It has been working since 2004.
        Simplification of procedures. The government modified Law 80 to streamline
        the system and outsourced to the Chambers o f Commerce the registry o f
        participants.
        Information. The information about procurement i s now available in the
        Internet. The government i s developing a system to make procurement
        transactions in the Internet.

3.34    This report confirms the I C R rating o f unsatisfactory and the achievement o f
objectives negligible.

Management by Results (Creation of an Evaluation Office)
3.35 This component was aimed at creating mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the
government’s activities and programs, which i s part o f a system o f management by
results. The unit in charge o f these activities was created in the Planning Office. I t has a
very small staff which designs and subcontracts the evaluations. Up to mid-2006, 19
sectors and 170 institutions had participated in three main kinds o f activities:

        Focalized evaluations. The Evaluation Unit has undertaken evaluation o f social
        policies as well as assessments o f proposals to change laws for the public
        administration.

objectives substantial.

Defense of the State
3.37 The public sector neglected for many years its judicial processes, to the extent that
suing the state became a low-risk, profitable activity.

3.38   The FIALs supported the following activities.

       Inventory. The Government was able to determine the number and nature o f the
       legal suits raised against it as well as the amounts o f money at risk.
       Realistic estimation o f the contingent liabilities. The Government created a
       statistical program with data provided from government lawyers which allows for
       a reasonable estimate o f these liabilities.
       Coordination. The system coordinates the management o f all cases involving
       amounts larger than 200,000 minimum salaries (the level o f the minimum salaries
       i s used as an index to compensate for inflation in Colombia). By mid-2006, the
       system was coordinating the management o f 99,000 cases.

3.39    The report rates the outcome o f this activity satisfactory and the achievement o f
objectives modest.

Management Contracts
3.40 The first experience with this component in FIAL I         was badly designed and was a
failure. The program began with two institutions that are under the Ministry o f Social
Protection, I C B F (Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar, Colombian Institute for
Family Welfare), which deals with family issues, and SENA (Servicio Nacional de
Aprendizaje, National Training Service) which deals with workers’ training. The
management contract with these institutions included some technical goals and, mainly,
goals in terms o f collections o f the payroll taxes that workers must contribute to these
institutions. According to the contract, the government would provide a subsidy if the
institutions collected a certain amount. In actuality, even if the institutions failed to
collect the specified amounts, the government would still provide the subsidy because,
legally, it had to. That is, the contract and the incentives contained in i t were irrelevant.
After this experience, the government wanted to eliminate this component in the
subsequent F I A L s but the Bank insisted that i t was essential to have it. The component
was retained and the subsequent experiences were quite negative because, as the
government insisted, the mechanism does not work when the government has to provide
the so-called incentives-budgetary allocations-even when the contracting institutions
did not comply with their promises.

3.41 This report rates the outcome o f this activity unsatisfactory and the achievement
o f objectives negligible.

Development of Incentivesfor Efficiency Gains (Earmarking Royalties)
3.42 Notwithstanding its name, this component in actuality created a new dimension o f
budget rigidity: earmarking to certain activities the royalties received by the government.
Doing that required obtaining popular approval in the 2003 Referendum, which contained
a question proposing their explicit distribution for education (56 percent), sanitation (36
percent), a sub-national pension find (7 percent), and the conservation o f the Cauca
                                              30


River (1 percent). The failure o f the Referendum prevented this rule t o be hard-wired
into the Constitution.

3.43 According to the arguments presented in the Bank’s FIAL program documents,
this measure was meant to counteract what was widely perceived as corrupt and
inefficient use o f royalties, often in poorly planned or otherwise inappropriate investment
projects. Existing laws (especially L a w 715) had established standards for efficiency and
accountability for decentralized services; by ear-marking funds for these services, the
expectation was improving the value-for-money.

3.44 However, earmarking resources clearly contradicts the declared objectives o f the
program, which i s eliminating rigidities. Moreover, it i s not clear that earmarked
resources would be better managed or would lead to lower corruption than non-
earmarked resources.

3.45    In fact, revenue earmarking is undesirable for several reasons.

    e   First, it generates a system o f entitlements, which eliminates the incentives for
        efficiency because the beneficiaries o f the entitlement know that they will receive
        their funds independently o f their performance.
    e   Second, the system o f entitlements establishes incentives to never achieve the
        expected results because, once these are achieved, the entitlements would
        disappear.
    e   Third, it introduces rigidity, which in turn i s bad for two reasons:
    e   It makes it very difficult to shift budgetary allocations to meet changed priorities,
        and,
    e   I t makes it very difficult to adjust the overall magnitudes o f the budget t o
        accommodate macroeconomic developments. This problem becomes a very
        difficult problem when there are fiscal or economic setbacks that require
        immediate fiscal adjustments, such as those that prevailed when the fiscal
        operations started in Colombia.

3.46 In other words, in addition to introducing rigidities, earmarking resources tends to
lower, rather than increase, accountability and efficiency since such re-sources f l o w
regardless o f the efficiency o f their spending. Finally, in any case, reducing earmarking
was one o f the main objectives o f the operation.

3.47 This report rates the outcome o f this sub-component highly unsatisfactory, not
because the government lost the referendum, but because i t was, from the beginning, at
odds with the objectives o f the loan. The report rates the achievement o f objectives
negligible.

        f Public Administration
Summary o
3.48 In s m a r y , the Public Administration component had 8 sub-components, o f
which the outcomes o f 4 were satisfactory, 2 were unsatisfactory, and 2 were highly
unsatisfactory. The highly unsatisfactory ratings are given to those components that were
especially important for the attainment o f the program’s main objectives o f reduction o f
budget rigidity and overall improvement o f efficiency. Averaging these ratings, this
                                                               31


report rates the outcome o f the Public Administration component moderately
unsatisfactory.

Summary of Components
3.49 Based on the previous analysis, Table 4 summarizes this PPAR’s ratings for all
the components o f the FIAL program and compares them with the ratings provided by the
ICR’s and IEG’s ICR reviews. The last column summarizes the reasons for the
disagreement between this PPAR’s ratings and those o f the other documents. The rating
o f the Overall Fiscal Commitment i s based on the analysis o f Chapter 4, Section E.

those contained in the ICRs and IEG’s FIAL I11Review (which in fact rated the entire
FIAL series). The ICRs rated the individual loans, but they gave the same ratings to all
the operations, as we are doing in this report.

3.51   Quality at entry. The quality at entry was unsatisfactory for several reasons.

       First, the program was overly complex and disjointed in i t s institutional
       implementation, to the point that it obscured the ultimate objectives o f the loans,
       taxed the government’s implementation capacity and discouraged the completion
       o f the series o f loans.
       Second, within this complexity, many o f the components aimed at attaining
       objectives that had little impact on the attainment o f the ultimate objective o f
       improving fiscal performance in a sustainable way. This was the case, for
       example, o f all the efforts invested in improving budget planning instruments,
       creating management contracts, creating an evaluation office and streamlining
       procurement procedures. All these activities were commendable. Yet, the
       borrower could meet all o f them and still-as it happened-fail t o improve the
       fiscal performance o f the country in a sustainable way.
       Third, the program contained a glaring contradiction: it supported the earmarking
       o f royalties while justifying the entire loan o n the argument that earmarking and
       other rigidities should be eliminated.

3.52 Relevance. The objectives o f the operations were consistent with the needs o f the
country and with the CAS. However, as noted in the previous paragraph, many o f the
objectives o f the individual loan components did not have a determining effect o n the
attainment o f the ultimate objective o f the loan and, in one case (the earmarking o f
royalties), the activity was in direct contradiction t o such objectives. IEG’s Review o f
FIAL I11rated relevance as modest, noting that the operation did not address the most
important sources o f budgetary rigidity, the earmarked expenditures. This PPAR agrees
with the IEG’s I C R Review comment: “as the FIAL Program advanced, i t s relevance
progressively declined.”

3.53 Outcomes. There is no doubt that the Colombian government obtained some
satisfactory results in several o f the sub-components included in the FIAL program. Yet,
it obtained unsatisfactory results in a few fundamental sub-components, which outweigh
in importance the positive outcomes o f the other activities. This was true in the tax
structure component-the main problems that the loans were supposed t o resolve are still
there-and in the institutional component-the budgetary rigidities are s t i l l there and the
loan worsened them. Regarding the institutional impact, this was substantial in several
public sector components-fiscal responsibility, public sector assets management, the
creation o f an evaluation office, and the defense o f the state. The institutional
development o f the other four public sector activities-budgetary flexibility, management
contracts, earmarking o f royalties, and procurement-was negligible. Tax administration
experienced a substantial institutional development although this was mostly a result o f
the accompanying technical assistance loan (PFMP 11).
                                               33


3.54 Balancing these facts, as well as those stated in the next chapter regarding the
main fiscal indicators, this report rates the FIAL series moderately unsatisfactory. This
confirms the rating o f IEG’s I C R Review o f FIAL 1     11. That report based such rating on
the moderate relevance o f the loan (it did not address the need to remove the country’s
fiscal rigidities), and the fact that the trigger for the envisioned FIAL I V was not
achieved.

3.55 R i s k s to development outcome. The probability that the moderately
unsatisfactory outcome o f the F I A L s will improve in the future is very low. There are
two dimensions to the FIALs’ risks to development outcome.

     e   First, while the combined public sector deficit went down since the beginning o f
         the operations, it did so mainly because o f an improvement in commodity prices
         that could be reversed anytime. As a result, the country is at least as fiscally
         vulnerable to a reversal in i t s terms o f trade as it was when the operations were
         designed, aiming at reducing such vulnerability.
     e    Second, the government did not and s t i l l does not own the fundamental objective
         o f the program: the elimination o f budgetary rigidities.

3.56 The government’s lack o f ownership o f the objective o f eliminating earmarking
can be seen in the IMF Review o f the Stand-By arrangements with the Republic o f
Colombia, issued in June 2006. The report summarizes the 2006 strategy o f the
authorities regarding earmarking with the following words:

3.57 “Their strategy i s to concentrate first on reforms o f the tax code and
intergovernmental transfers. They will continue with reforms o f the public enterprise
sector and revenue earmarking, but see no need for another round o f pension reform at
this stage.. .

3.58   The authorities are committed to implementingthe budget decree issued in
December 2005, which includes provisions to evaluate earmarked revenues in the 2007
budget. Based on this evaluation, the government would develop legislation to phase out
revenue earmarking that has achieved its objective and to limit the introduction o f new
earmarking to a well-specified time peri~d.”’~

3.59 That is, after the FIALs presented as their main objective the reduction o f
budgetary rigidities, which prominently included earmarking, the government has not yet
decided on i t s policy about earmarking, i s not ruling out the possibility o f issuing new
earmarked expenditures, and i s considering the possibility o f eliminating only those that
have achieved their objectives. This undermines the credibility o f the most important
objective o f the FIALs, and shows that the government’s commitment to t h i s objective i s
s t i l l lacking almost 4 years after the program was approved.

3.60 Overall, the institutional development aimed at reducing the fiscal rigidities o f
Colombia was negligible. Since the long-term outcomes o f the FIAL depend crucially
from institutional factors, this report rates the risk o f development outcome as high.

3.61 Bank performance. The FIAL I11IEG’s I C R Review, which dealt with the
entire FIAL series, rated the Bank’s performance unsatisfactory, justifying that rating
with the following words: “Quality at Entry was unsatisfactory, with the project design
inadequate to achieve the stated objectives. Although the objective was t o promote
reforms addressing fiscal rigidities necessary t o attain substantial fiscal adjustment, the
most important sources o f those rigidities were not addressed. And around half the
project components were intended to produce outputs, rather than the outcomes that
would reasonably be expected o f the last operation in a programmatic series. In fact, in
the absence o f much o f the legal framework envisioned at the start o f the FIAL Program,
i t is questionable whether the Bank should have continued with the program and
undertaken FIAL 111.” This report adds that, in addition to the reasons provided by the
IEG’s I C R Review, the quality at entry was unsatisfactory because it contained a
component, earrnarking royalties, which was in direct contradiction t o the objectives o f
the loan. However, it rates the Bank performance moderately unsatisfactory to reflect the
fact that several other components, while less connected to the ultimate objectives o f the
loan than those referred to by the IEG report, were satisfactorily accomplished.

3.62 Borrower performance. The government staff in charge o f implementation
worked seriously o n the program and met most o f the conditions o f the loans. In this
sense, the borrower’s performance was satisfactory. Yet, the main structural objectives
o f the program were not attained and, as discussed in the next chapter, while tax revenues
increased fast as a percent o f GDP , expenditures increased even faster, voiding the
purpose o f the operations. Moreover, as noted by the IEG’s I C R Review o f FIAL 1    11,
“During the period o f the FIAL Program, the balance o f the Central Administration
averaged -5.4 percent o f GDP, which was partially offset by favorable cyclical
developments. A structural deficit o f this magnitude was inimical wit the objective o f the
FIAL Program.” For these reasons, the FIAL I11IEG’s I C R Review rated the operation
unsatisfactory. This report upgrades this rating to moderately unsatisfactory to take into
account the satisfactory completion o f other objectives which, although less connected to
the ultimate objectives o f the operations than those referred to by the IEG’s report, were
satisfactorily accomplished.

E.     FIAL Rating by Loan
3.63 As discussed in the Introduction, it is difficult t o split the evaluation o f the FIAL
series into independent evaluations o f each loan because: (a) the program was conceived
and largely implemented as an integral operation; (b) the components were the same in
all loans, and (c) the reasoning underlying the ratings for the entire program i s valid for
each o f the loans as well. L o w quality at entry and negligible institutional impact
affected all the loans equally because they were imbedded in the project design. As
shown in the next chapter, the third problem-the failure in attaining the ultimate
objective o f improving fiscal performance in a sustainable way-cannot be attributed to
any particular sub-period within the execution o f the FIAL series. Such performance
failed to improve throughout the l i f e o f the program and for the same reasons.
                                                                                                                    35


3.64 The same can be said about the Bank's and the Borrower's performance. For
these reasons, this report rates the FIAL as shown in Table 5.

4. The Combined Outcomes o f the Fiscal Operations
   and their Risk to Development Outcomes

4.1    While the SFAL and the FIAL programs were different operations, actually they
were parts o f one single effort to improve the borrower’s fiscal situation. The question
that emerges after reviewing all the actions taken under both o f them is whether they,
taken as a whole, succeeded in improving the overall fiscal situation o f Colombia in the
main areas o f concern at the time o f approval o f the loans.

4.2    The elimination or the substantial reduction o f the fiscal rigidities, together with
the improvement in the efficiency and accountability in public expenditure, were
expected to produce concrete outcomes. These included the following.

       The fiscal benefits were expected to reach 2 points o f GDP by 2006.
       The primary surplus was expected to be 4 percent o f GDP.
       The NFPS deficit o f 4 percent o f GDP would be virtually eliminated by 2006.
       The ratio o f net public sector debt to GDP would remain at slightly above 50
       percent by 2006.

4.3     This chapter discusses these points in more detail. It i s relevant not just for the
evaluation o f the overall objectives o f the series o f loans, but also for the evaluation o f
several loan components, including the outcomes o f public debt management in the
SFAL as well as the overall fiscal commitment in the FIAL loans and the macroeconomic
framework in both the SFAL and the FIAL loans. It i s also fundamental for the
assessment o f the risk to development outcomes o f both operations.

4.4    In the discussion o f the fiscal outcomes and their risks, it i s important to keep in
mind that the government o f Colombia distinguishes four aggregates o f the fiscal
accounts:

       T h e central administration. This entity comprises all the ministries. This i s the
       measure that in most countries i s called the central government.
       T h e central government. This entity includes the central administration plus the
       social security and the decentralized agencies.
       T h e non-financial public sector. This measure includes the central government
       plus public sector enterprises and the regional and local entities.
       T h e combined public sector. This includes the non-financial public sector plus
       the profits o f the central bank, the profits o f FOGAFIN (Financial System
       Guarantee Fund), and the net cost o f the restructuring o f the financial system (the
       net cost o f the financial crisis).

4.5     The following discussion centers on the most commonly-used aggregates: the
central administration, the non-financial public sector, and the combined public sector.
                                                                    38


A.            Overall Risks

4.6     Figure 7 shows the trends o f the main fiscal aggregates during the l i f e o f the fiscal
operations. Notwithstanding improvements during 2001-2005, both extreme measures o f
the public sector in terms o f their inclusiveness-the combined public sector and the
central administration-were still in deficit at the end o f 2005, as was the primary
balance14o f the latter. For 2006, the government i s projecting an improvement in the
primary balance, which would decline from -1.2 percent in 2005 but would s t i l l be
negative (-0.4 percent o f GDP). The projections do not foresee a change in the overall
balance, which stood at -4.9 percent o f GDP.

4.7     The entity with the worst fiscal performance during the period o f review was the
central administration, which not only had very large overall deficits in the last few years
but also primary deficits. The combined public sector was in a better condition largely
because of: (a) the profits from Ecopetrol, the government-owned o i l producer; and (b)
the fiscal surpluses attained by the local and regional governments, which were due
mainly to their limited implementation capacity.

4.8      The above picture i s not encouraging for the country's fiscal sustainability.
Without Ecopetrol, the non-financial public sector deficit would have been 5.2 percent o f
GDP in 2006, while the deficit o f the combined public sector would have been 6.3
percent o f GDP. These figures are worse than those prevailing in 2001 when the country
was in a fiscal crisis (3.2 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively). Moreover, the primary
balance o f the central administration i s s t i l l negative, meaning that the fundamental
institution o f the public sector is s t i l l borrowing to pay interest. And all this i s happening


l4The primary balance i s equal to the overall balance minus interest payments. Having this balance at zero
or positive i s a fundamental condition for stability.

while the economy i s enjoying very favorable external circumstances. This can be seen
in Figure 8, which shows the terms o f trade adjustment that i s used in the national
accounts to convert exports in real terms into the country’s real capacity t o import. As
can be seen in the figure, the Bank’s fiscal operations started when this magnitude was at
i t s lowest since 1990, and they ended when it was at its highest since that date. The
turnaround was on the order o f 6.5 percent o f GDP.

4.9     Thus, the fiscal situation is at least as risky as it was in 2001 in terms o f the
magnitude o f the fiscal deficits, and the risk o f a negative turn in the external conditions
seems to be much higher than in that year because the deviation o f the terms o f trade
relative to their average i s much larger. Furthermore, it i s almost certain that the profits
o f Ecopetrol are bound to decline as a percent o f GDP. These profits have increased in
the last few years by virtue o f the o i l price boom, which more than compensated for the
simultaneous fall in the company’s production in terms o f barrels. The decline in
production is irreversible if no new reserves are discovered. Thus, the profits o f
Ecopetrol can be maintained only in a world o f continuously increasing oil prices. If
these prices do not increase and in the absence o f new reserves, this source o f public
sector funding is likely to disappear.

4.10 Concerns about the sustainability o f the fiscal position o f the combined and the
non-financial public sectors are not limited to these points. As will be discussed in the
following section, the government has been able to reduce these deficits only at the cost
o f reducing public sector investment.

B.       The R i s k s of the Non-financial Public Sector Balances

4.1 1 As can be seen in Table 6, the overall fiscal balance o f the widest measure o f the
public sector, the combined public sector, improved by 3.2 percent o f GDP fiom 200 1 to
2005. While increased tax collection accounted for a gain o f 1.2 percent o f GDP
(37.1 percent o f the total improvement), most o f the fiscal gain was attained through a
reduction o f capital expenditure, which accounted for 2.3 percent o f GDP (70.5 percent o f the

improvement). As can also be seen in the table, the sustainability o f the second most-
inclusive measure o f the fiscal operations, the non-financial public sector, also depends on
keeping investment at its currently reduced levels. This contradicted one o f the key
conditions o f the SFAL.

4.12     The decline in public sector investment would not necessarily be a negative
development if the private sector were investing in sectors previously managed by the
government; if public sector investment had been unnecessary; or if, being less efficient than
that carried out by the private sector, it had been crowding out the latter inthe factor markets.
Yet, there are two reasons to believe that none o f these conditions is prevailing in Colombia.
First, the government was obviously worried about this trend because reversing it was one o f
the objectives o f the fiscal operations. Second, the decline in public sector investment has
taken place in a country where, as shown in Figure 9, overall gross capital formation has been
well below the levels o f the Latin American region as a whole. T h i s level has been
increasing fast in the last few years, but it is still much lower than in two comparable
countries, Chile and Mexico.

C.            Central Administration Risks: Taxes and Expenditures

4.13 Figure 10 shows that the improvement o f the country's basic tax collection was
not a recent phenomenon. It has been improving since 1995 and even before at
approximately 0.54 percentage points o f GDP per year. The problem i s that total
expenditures, which started from a larger basis, have been expanding at a higher rate
(0.65 percentage points o f GDP per year). As a result, the gap between total expenditures
and tax revenues widened from 2.8 percent to 4.9 percent o f GDP in ten years. If this
trend continues, non-tax revenues would have to increase continuously as a percent o f
GDP to prevent the fiscal deficit from increasing. Or, in other words, the rate o f growth
o f tax revenues is not enough to reduce or even maintain the central administration
deficit.15 Hence, despite their satisfactory growth, tax collections have not been
sufficient to support the rapid expansion o f expenditures.

D.             The Risks of Debt and Interest Expenditures

4.14 The curves shown in Figure 11 provide an optimistic view o f the debt situation for
three reasons: (a) the net debt o f the non-financial public sector (gross debt minus debt in
any currency held by public sector institutions minus foreign currency held in the non-
financial public sector) is much smaller than the gross one, mainly because many cash-
generating institutions o f the public sector accumulated assets during the period; (b) this
net debt is l o w by international standards; and, (c) it f e l l by about 12 percentage points o f
GDP from 2002 to 2005.

  The central administration has been able to keep its deficit constant i
8 only because its non-tax revenues have increased substantially during the last few years.

4.15 There are two observations that should be made regarding this picture, however.
First, the net debt concept may be deceivingly optimistic in terms o f reducing the burden
o f the debt o f the public sector. For example, if the central government used the cash
accumulated by other government institutions to service its own debt, or defaulted on the
bonds it sold to them, the obligations o f these other institutions would revert back to the
central government, as i s happening today with the pension liabilities. Or, if the central
government used the resources o f ECOPETROL to pay i t s debts, or defaulted on the debt
it sold to Ecopetrol, it would diminish Ecopetrol’s ability to invest, which in turn would
revert in terms o f larger deficits as a result o f the company’s declining o i l production.

4.16 The second observation i s that, as shown in Figure 12, rather than diminishing,
the total debt o f the central government remained constant as a percent o f GDP since
2002. In fact, the total debt would have increased by 5 percent o f GDP if the nominal
exchange rate against the U    S Dollar had remained constant at its 2002 level. In other
words, if the currency were to depreciate back to that level as a result of, say, a decline in
commodity prices, the debt o f the central government would be around 60 percent o f
GDP .

4.17 There was also sizeable substitution o f domestic for external debt in 2005 (Figure
12), when the government prepaid $3 billion in external debt while issuing a comparable
amount in pesos in the domestic market. At the same time, there was an increase in the
interest rates paid by the government. The increases in the interest rates o n 10-year U.S.
treasury bonds had triggered a depreciation o f the peso o f about 8 percent vis-a-vis the
U.S. dollar starting in February 2006, together with a fall in equity prices and a rise in
yields on government securities. The Government expects that these developments will
result in an increase in interest payments equivalent to one percent o f GDP in 2006
(Figure 13).

E.             Fiscal Commitment, Public Debt and Overall Risks

4.18 It is clear that the fiscal situation o f Colombia improved markedly during the
years o f the fiscal operations. Yet, such improvements were mainly due t o exogenous
improvements in the Colombian economy. As i s frequently the case, a country's
economic variables become all positive when the prices o f commodities are high and
capital inflows substantial; conversely, the country's economy becomes depressed when
those prices and inflows decline.

4.19 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the fiscal crisis was at its worst,
everything conspired against the fiscal health o f the country: the fall in commodity prices
led to a fall in exports and GDP, and to a rapid depreciation o f the currency; in turn,
currency depreciation raised the debt burden; and the combined situation, aggravated by
adverse political events, reduced capital inflows and turned them into net outflows. Since
2002, commodity prices have gone up and, with them, the country's exports and GDP;
the currency appreciated, leading to a fall in the premium o f peso over dollar interest
rates and a decrease in the burden o f the external debt; and dollar interest rates went
                                               44


down to record l o w levels. That is, all the exogenous factors are favorable. Any
deterioration in such circumstances would worsen the fiscal situation o f the country
again. The question is, has the country’s fiscal vulnerability to a crisis declined as a
result o f the fiscal operations?

4.20 Given that the fiscal situation tends to deteriorate when there i s an economic
downturn, it i s important to compare the 2005 situation with the one which prevailedjust
before the fiscal crisis. In 1997, the year before the 1998 crisis, the deficit o f the core o f
the public sector, the central administration, was 3.5 percent o f GDP. This deteriorated to
5.2 percent and 7.4 percent o f GDP in 1998 and 1999, respectively. If the fiscal deficit
deteriorated at the same pace today, it would reach 6.5 percent in one year and 8.7
percent in two years, creating a situation that would be much worse than that which the
country faced at the turn o f the century. The situation o f the broadest measure o f fiscal
operations, the combined public sector, would deteriorate even faster if, as assumed, the
country’s terms o f trade deteriorated as well, or if, as likely to happen regardless o f the
behavior o f o i l prices, Ecopetrol reduced i t s contributions to the government as a result o f
i t s investment needs.

4.21 It could be argued that the government would react more quickly this time to
adjust expenditures to the lower level o f revenues; yet, as it has been extensively
discussed in the previous chapters, the budget remains very rigid, in some areas more so
than in 1998.

4.22    We can conclude that:

        First, the central administration i s not stronger than when the fiscal crisis started.
        Second, the burden o f the debt is heavier. In 1997, the ratio o f the central
        government debt to GDP was 20.2 percent o f GDP; in 2005, it was 55.4 percent.

4.23 That is, the fiscal improvement o f the central government is not likely to be
sustained if there i s a downturn in the economic activity o f the country.

4.24 Given that the improvements in the non-financial public sector and the combined
public sector largely depend on the prices o f o i l and on the limited implementation
capacity o f the local and regional governments-two factors that can change in the
future-it seems that their fiscal balances are also prone to deteriorate very rapidly in
case o f a crisis.

4.25 For these reasons, and given that the objective o f the FIAL program was to
improve the fiscal situation in a structural way, independently o f the circumstances, this
report rates the Overall Fiscal Commitment o f the FIAL program unsatisfactory. In terms
o f the achievement o f the objectives, the report rates the program modest.

F.      Summary and Overall Rating of the Combined Fiscal Operations

4.26    Insummary:

        The balance o f the non-financial public sector improved substantially, but mainly
        because o f declining investment, increasing royalties resulting from atypically
                                            45


       high o i l prices, and expenditure delays resulting from the lack o f implementation
       capacity at the regional levels.
   e   The primary balance o f the central administration remained negative (-1.2 percent
       o f GDP in 2005).
   e   Regardingthe public debt indicators, these improved as a result o f a reduction in
       the ratio o f external debt to GDP. Yet, such reduction was due to two major
       trends:
   e   First, the currency appreciated in nominal and real terms. This, o f course, i s
       reversible.
   e   Second, the government substituted domestic for external debt at the margin.
       This has increased the burden o f the interest payments. The government
       estimates that this would represent an increase equivalent to one percent o f GDP
       in 2006.
   e   Also, as discussed in the previous chapters, the fiscal situation improved while the
       most important structural issues were not resolved.

4.27 For all these reasons, this report rates the improvements attained in the last few
years as unsustainable in the face o f a crisis. Therefore, the risk to development
outcomes i s rated as high for both operations.

4.28 These considerations apply not just to the operations as a whole but also to the
macroeconomic framework and the over-all fiscal commitments o f the SFAL and the
FIAL series.
                                            47


5. Lessons

5.1   The lessons learned in these operations are not new to the Bank.

      First, as noted in IEG’s I C R Review o f FIAL 1    11, project design needs to be
      clearly aligned with development objectives to attain the latter, Even if the
      structural deficit o f the central administration i s “highly sensitive and political” as
      the I C R states, the magnitudes o f these structural rigidities were such that they
      must be addressed if progress i s to be made in achieving the substantial fiscal
      adjustment that is required for sustained macroeconomic stability.
      Second, loans with large numbers o f objectives and conditions, and involving too
      many institutions relative to the management capacity o f the Government and the
      Bank itself, overtax the implementation capacity o f both the Bank and the
      borrower and results in cumbersome execution. While there may be differences
      in opinion regarding what would be the maximum number o f tasks that i s
      practical to carry out under a loan, according to the opinions collected by the IEG
      mission in the country, practically all the people involved in the implementation
      o f this operation thought that the number o f objectives, conditions and
      participating institutions in these operations was excessive and felt that they
      overtaxed the Bank’s and the borrower’s implementation capacities and dispersed
      the energies o f reform. Just the FIALs had 10 sub-components, with an average
      o f four to five activities per sub-component that should be performed to meet the
       sub-component objectives. Given that there were 3 FIALs (there were originally
      4 but one was dropped), this made for roughly 150 sub-activities, which required
      follow up, comments, discussions and recommendations.
      Third, the inclusion o f objectives o f widely different levels o f priority and weak
      connection with the ultimate goals o f the operations tends to obscure the degree o f
      attainment o f the latter. In the operations reviewed in this report, the impact on
      the fundamental goals o f the operations o f many o f the sub-components, activities
       and sub-activities was very tenuous. This mix o f highly important with much less
       important activities obscured the ultimate objectives o f the operation to the point
      that the government could comply with most o f the objectives o f the components
       and sub-components and s t i l l fail to comply with the fundamental objectives o f
      the loan.
      Fourth, success depends on the borrower’s ownership o f the objectives o f the
       loan. The reviewed operations met this condition at a very general level-the
       government wanted to improve i t s fiscal condition. Yet, the government did not
       actually share the objective o f reducing the rigidity o f the system. This was
       evident in several ways:

          A s noted in the IEG’s I C R Review o f the FIAL 111, these operations did not
          address the main rigidities-the ones related to the transfers to the local and
          regional governments-even if their President’s Report recognized their
          importance.
          The S F A L supported a reform that actually increased the rigidity o f the
          system.
                                       48

    The FIAL program also included an important reform that would worsen the
    rigidity o f the system, not just in terms o f quantities but also in terms o f their
    allocation: the plan to earmark the royalties received by the government.
    As noted in paragraph 3.59, “after the FIALs presented as their main objective
    the reduction o f budgetary rigidities, which included earmarking prominently,
    the government has not yet decided i t s policy about earmarking, is not ruling
    out the possibility o f issuing new earmarked expenditures and i s considering
    the possibility o f eliminating only those that have achieved their objectives.
    This undermines the credibility o f the most important objective o f the FIALs
    and shows that i t s commitment t o this objective is s t i l l lacking almost 4 years
    after the Program was approved.”
    Also, there was another sub-component, the management contracts, which the
    Bank insisted in including in the FIALs against the opinion o f the
    government. The lack o f ownership was one o f the reasons for the failure o f
    this sub-component.
