Project within the\n            program will focus primarily on the following key policy\n            actions: a) acceleration of the phase-out of tax exemptions\n            for profits of certain firms; b) increased revenues derived\n            from improvements in tax administration of at least 0.3\n            percent of GDP, between 2003 and 2004, while maintaining\n            DIAN - Direccion de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales -\n            administrative costs per peso collected, below 0.96 percent;\n            c) submission of a new budget law to improve the overall\n            budgeting framework, complementing the 2003 Fiscal\n            Responsibility Law; d) further improvements in the royalty\n            transfer system, including restructuring of the National\n            Royalty Fund; e) implementation of the legal defense of the\n            State policy; f) establishment of oversight bodies for both\n            procurement and asset management; g) compliance with the\n            pilot management contracts with ICBF - Institution\n            Colombiano de Binestar Familiar - and SENA - Servicio\n            Nacional de Aprendizaje; and, h) further progress in the\n            monitoring system for the public sector reform process.\n            Nonetheless, risks exist, namely: the uncertain political\n            environment in the midst of a campaign for a presidential\n            re-election; difficulty in controlling aggregate expenditure\n            levels because of failure of key measures to contain them;\n            institutional gaps that may remain after the public\n            downsizing exercise, thus jeopardizing key roles, and\n            responsibilities; external macroeconomic shocks; and, the\n            current armed conflict."}, "docdt": "2005-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
