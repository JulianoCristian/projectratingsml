           Assessment Report (PPAR) for four structural adjustment\n            lending operations to Colombia from 2001 to 2005. The\n            overall rating for all the four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            rating, and also the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower for all four projects is rated as satisfactory. The\n            main lessons learned from this review are: (i) as noted in\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG's) ICR Review of\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL III), project\n            design needs to be clearly aligned with its development\n            objectives in order to attain the latter. Even if the\n            structural deficit of the central administration is\n            \"highly sensitive and political\" as the ICR\n            states, the magnitudes of these structural rigidities were\n            such that they must be addressed if progress is to be made\n            in achieving the substantial fiscal adjustment that is\n            required for sustained macroeconomic stability; (ii) loans\n            with large numbers of objectives and conditions, and\n            involving too many institutions relative to the management\n            capacity of the Government and the Bank itself, overtax the\n            implementation capacity of both the Bank and the borrower\n            and result in poor execution; (iii) the inclusion of\n            objectives of widely different levels of priority and weak\n            connection with the ultimate goals of the operations tends\n            to obscure the degree of attainment of the latter; and (iv)\n            success depends on the borrower's ownership of the\n            objectives of the loan."}, "docdt": "2008-04-22T14:21:00Z"}
