The following lessonswere cited:\n            1)  A high number of project components increases particular\n            risks. This project had a total of 11 components in 4 broad\n            groupings where the sheer breadth of topics, each with a\n            specific reform plan, made the program particularly risky.\n            The risks arise from the failure of a single component,\n            which places the entire program at risk, since the\n            assumption is that the program is a coherent\n            \"whole\" that will lose integrity if parts are\n            removed; high transaction costs due to the need to deal with\n            multiple implementing agencies, retain multi-sector\n            competency in the supervising team, and achieve enough\n            analytical depth in each of the sectors; and losing a grasp\n            of the overall program's coherence. This project was\n            considered to be a fiscal adjustment operation and therefore\n            subject to different standards. 2) Keep the number of policy\n            actions reasonable. High numbers of policy actions increase\n            the risk, add to transaction costs, and often do not add\n            substance. Focus on results. That was done in the tax\n            administration component, where the initial focus on a large\n            set of specific actions (developing taxpayer registries,\n            carrying out audits, improving information quality, and\n            more) was substituted later on by two results indicators\n            (evasion and efficiency). 3) Where the assessment indicates\n            a relatively low probability of passing laws, the scope of\n            the reform program should be narrowed to include only those\n            elements under the Executive Branch's control. 4) Add a\n            coherent and comprehensive package of technical assistance.\n            5) Monitoring and evaluation arrangements must be ready\n            up-front. 6) Task management from the field adds significant\n            value; close and constant interaction with the client\n            improves the probability of a successful outcome."}, "docdt": "2005-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
