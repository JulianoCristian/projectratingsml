                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the Project is urgently to increase the volume and reliability of the national energy supply, especially, thermal power in the winter season,
                         thereby supporting the implementation of the GoKRâ s Energy EmergencyMitigation Action Plan (EEMAP).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All activities have been completed and the project has achieved its anticipated objectives. With increased power and heat generation at the Bishkek and Osh Combined Heat and
                         Power Plants (CHPs) the project has contributed to implementation of the Kyrgyz Government's Energy Emergency Action Plan. It has eased the energy emergency that the Kyrgyz
                         Republic faced starting in 2007/08 and, ultimately, contributed to the increased amount of water stored in the Toktogul reservoir.

                         The project has increased both the reliability and volume of power and heat generation by ensuring
                         (a) uninterrupted handling of coal (through supply of coal handling equipment - truck lifts, bulldozers, and coal conveyor band),

                         (b) greater efficiency and reliability of the repaired heat boilers at Bishkek CHP, and
                         (c) reduced operational inefficiencies through rehabilitating Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs).

                         More specifically, during the last three winters, the Project resulted in:
