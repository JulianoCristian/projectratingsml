                                  Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for the Kyrgyz Republic, Emergency Energy Assistance Project
(Credit No: 4524-KG/Grant No: H429-KG, P101392) and its Additional Financing
(Credit No: 4668-KG/Grant No: H534-KG, P119227) will be extended from the current
May 31, 2011 until March 31, 2012.

2.       The progress towards achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDO),
which is “…to assist the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to increase the volume and
security of the energy supply, especially, the supply of thermal power in the winter
season…”, is satisfactory. Most the activities of the original Energy Emergency
Assistance Project (EEAP) of SDR 7 million (US$ 11 million equivalent) have been
completed, resulting in an increase of power and heat outputs at Bishkek and Osh
Combined Heat and Power Plants (CHPs). 2009/2010 winter outputs exceeded the
baseline by 192 GWh of thermal power and 273 GWh of heat output. The planned
activities under its Additional Financing (EEAP AF) of SDR 2.6 million (US$ 4 million
equivalent) have been partially completed including completion of delivery of coal
transportation equipment (truck lifts and coal conveyer band) and repair of five heat
boilers at Bishkek CHP.

3.      The primary reason for the extension request is the significant delay in the
effectiveness of the EEAP AF due to the change of the Government in April 2010 and the
subsequent unrest in May-July 2010 that delayed implementation. While the EEAP AF
was signed on February 1, 2010 it only became effective on August 5, 2010. This delay
led to cancellation and re-tendering of a number of procurement activities that had
started. Currently ten out of the total sixteen contracts under EEAP AF have been
completed; four contracts have already been signed; and two more contracts are under
process. The proposed extension is necessary to (a) complete all the planned activities
under the Additional Financing and (b) process the final payments and carry acceptance
of the works under the original project.

4.     This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension from April 30,
2010 to May 31, 2011 was made at the time of approval of the Additional Financing. An
updated implementation plan has been prepared by the Government.
