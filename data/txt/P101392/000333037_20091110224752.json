     for Kyrgyz Republic is to increase the volume and\n            reliability of the national energy supply, especially\n            thermal power in the winter season, thereby supporting\n            implementation of the Energy Emergency Mitigation Action\n            Plan (EEMAP).The additional financing will help finance\n            costs associated with the following: (i) a scale-up of\n            project activities for the provision of equipment,\n            materials, and spare parts to increase thermal power\n            generation and heat output at the Bishkek combined heat and\n            power plant for the 2009-10 winter; and (ii) corresponding\n            scale up of the support for project management. No major\n            change is anticipated in EEAP design, except that project\n            indicators will be altered to include the scale up and the\n            project closing date will be extended by a year until May\n            31, 2011."}, "docdt": "2009-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
