                         The development objective of the Project is urgently to increase the volume and reliability of the national energy supply, especially, thermal power in the winter
                         season, thereby supporting the implementation of the GoKR s Energy EmergencyMitigation Action Plan (EEMAP).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is satisfactorily reaching its development objectives. The Project contributed in significantly increasing the production and reliability of both heat and power at Bishkek and
                         Osh thermal plants and, thus, helping the people of the Kyrgyz Republic in meeting the winter energy demand.

                         Despite about a 7-month delay in the effectiveness of the Additional Financing, most of its activities have been completed. To help the Kyrgyz Government complete all the planned
                         activities under the Additional Financing, the project closing date has been extended by 10 months, until 31 March 2012.
