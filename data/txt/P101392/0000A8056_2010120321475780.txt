                         Implementation Status Overview
                          The Project is progressing satisfactorily and on track to achieve its development objectives. The Project contributed to significantly increasing the production of both heat and power
                         at Bishkek and Osh thermal plants and, thus, helping the Kyrgyz Republic in meeting the winter hardship.

                         However, the effectiveness of the Additional Financing, which was signed in February 2010, has significantly delayed and it only became effective on August 5, 2010. While, the
                         reasons for effectiveness delay are understandable, it puts significant pressure on the project teams to expedite the implementation of the project within much shorter period of time
                         to fully achieve the targeted objectives of the project by the project closing date of May 31, 2011.
