The closing date for the project and\n            Additional Financing (AF) will be extended from the current\n            May 31, 2011 until March 31, 2012. The primary reason for\n            the extension request is the significant delay in the\n            effectiveness of the EEAP AF due to the change of the\n            Government in April 2010 and the subsequent unrest in\n            May-July 2010 that delayed implementation. Currently ten out\n            of the total sixteen contracts under EEAP AF have been\n            completed; four contracts have already been signed; and two\n            more contracts are under process. The extension is necessary\n            to (a) complete all the planned activities under the\n            additional financing; and (b) process the final payments and\n            carry acceptance of the works under the original project."}, "docdt": "2011-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
