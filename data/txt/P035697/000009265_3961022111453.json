by increasing sustainable production levels at the Baganuur\n            mine to 4 million tons per year. Additional, associated\n            objectives are for Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) to:\n            1) develop financial self-sufficiency; 2) increase equipment\n            productivity and improve efficiency; 3) operate as an\n            independent commercial company; and 4) operate in an\n            environmentally acceptable manner over the long term. The\n            principal components of the project are: 1) procurement and\n            commissioning of equipment to rehabilitate the Baganuur coal\n            mine operation; 2) procurement and turnkey installation and\n            commissioning of equipment for a coal-handling plant\n            consisting of crusher, linear stacker, underground reclaimer\n            and train-loader; and 3) technical assistance to BJSC\n            including in-country and overseas training to: (a) improve\n            mine operations and mine supervision practices and\n            procedures; (b) develop mine maintenance management and\n            materials management systems; (c) upgrade financial and cost\n            accounting/management information systems; and (d) improve\n            environmental management capabilities."}, "docdt": "1996-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
