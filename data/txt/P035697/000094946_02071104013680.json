Project is rated\n            as satisfactory, sustainability as likely, institutional\n            development impact as sustainable, Bank performance as\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance as satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned from this project are: 1) The project\n            could have benefited from a more comprehensive approach to\n            addressing the problems of the energy sector, and\n            particularly from a more deliberate and stronger connection\n            to the downstream energy companies. Development of a\n            stronger IDA relationship with those downstream companies\n            might have helped alleviate the coal payments arrears\n            issues. 2) The use of a numerical target as part of the\n            project's main development objective proved to be\n            imprecise, compared to a more strategic development goal. 3)\n            The development of the Energy Project as part of a broader\n            energy assistance program, proved to be a very important\n            factor in IDA's ability to convince the government to\n            address its failures to meet assurances during this first\n            energy project. 4) At the outset of this project in\n            Mongolia, IDA could complete this project in time mainly\n            because the project design was simple, the objective was\n            focused, and there was only one principal beneficiary. 5)\n            The appointment of an internationally experienced financial\n            auditor by Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) to audit the\n            project and corporate accounts, as IDA's initial\n            insistence, proved to be particularly important and\n            beneficial to BJSC in this project."}, "docdt": "2002-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
