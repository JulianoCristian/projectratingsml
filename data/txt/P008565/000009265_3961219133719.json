industries Export Development\n            Project (AEDP) in Poland. The objectives of the project were\n            to: (a) remedy the existing constraints to rapidly\n            increasing Poland's exports of processed agricultural\n            products to convertible currency (CC) countries; (b) assist\n            the lending institutions associated with the project and the\n            state-owned enterprises financed under it to operate in a\n            market-oriented environment; (c) promote further involvement\n            of the private sector in food processing activities that are\n            export-oriented; and (d) help maintain supplies of livestock\n            to processors, and thus sustain meat exports. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (a) credit lines are inappropriate instruments in the\n            absence of strong financial intermediaries and in\n            environments of significant monetary instability\n            characterized by high inflation and interest rates; (b)\n            successful restructuring of medium to large state-owned\n            enterprises   cannot be accomplished without sweeping\n            reforms that address questions of enterprise ownership and\n            governance; (c) the need for Bank projects to have strong\n            institutional components to complement the provision of\n            funds; and (d) the danger of emphasizing disbursements, as a\n            measure of performance, as they are not necessarily\n            correlated to results on the ground."}, "docdt": "1996-08-08T00:00:00Z"}
