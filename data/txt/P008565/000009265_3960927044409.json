the\n            Agroindustries Export Development Project will be: (a) to\n            remedy existing constraints to rapidly increasing\n            Poland's exports of processed agricultural products to\n            convertible currency (CC) countries; (b) to promote further\n            involvement of the private sector in food processing\n            activities which are export oriented; (c) to assist state\n            enterprises financed under the project to operate in a\n            market-oriented system; and (d) to help maintain supplies of\n            livestock to processors and thus sustain meat exports. In\n            order to generate incremental CC export earnings, the\n            project will aim to rehabilitate, modernize and expand\n            existing agro-processing industries. Investments in the\n            needed equipment will be such as to allow Polish products to\n            be upgraded to levels of quality required in western markets\n            and will result in higher prices because of improved quality\n            and packaging, and increased volume of exports. This will be\n            particularly the case for ham in cans and in vacuum packing,\n            frozen fruits and vegatables and forest products including\n            game meat and berries, which are exported mainly to EEC\n            countries. The project will also include support for export\n            marketing activities of agro-processors and will meet part\n            of the shortage in livestock feed and thus help maintain\n            adequate supplies of livestock to processors."}, "docdt": "1990-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
