taking environmental considerations into\n            account by: (a) increasing the commercial orientation of the\n            Port of Durres through establishing an autonomous port,\n            privatizing operations, improving Customs procedures, and\n            improving operations and safety; and (b) rehabilitating port\n            infrastructure to accommodate anticipated traffic demand and\n            attract transit traffic.  The project components include:\n            civil works, navigation aids, lighting, warehouses, cranes\n            and spares, anti-pollution, customs modernization,\n            miscellaneous equipment, studies, technical assistance, and training."}, "docdt": "1998-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
