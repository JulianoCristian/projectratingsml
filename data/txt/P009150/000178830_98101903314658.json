Only the\n            first-class hotel will be open year-around. The site for the\n            project is the small coastal promontory of Bernardin located\n            to the west of the city of Portoroz and 1.5 km from the\n            ancient walled city of Piran. Piran, an attraction in\n            itself, offers a summer festival of traditional music and is\n            within easy access by road and hovercraft from the major\n            tourist centers of Trieste and Venice. As in Babin Kuk, the\n            project concept of a nucleus hotel with annexes permits\n            operational flexibility and offers potential economies.\n            Management systems will be developed with the assistance of\n            management consultants."}, "docdt": "1971-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
