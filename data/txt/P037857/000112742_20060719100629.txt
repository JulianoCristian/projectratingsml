  About this Report
         The IndependentEvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities of the World Bankfor two purposes:
  first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
  expected results,and second,to helpdevelop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthroughthe
  dissemination of lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, IEG annuallyassessesabout 25 percentof the
  Bank's lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative,
  large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which Executive
  Directors or Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and thosethat are likelyto generate important lessons.
  The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluationstudies.
        A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
  Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
  PPARs, IEGstaff examine projectfiles and other documents, interviewoperational staff, and in most cases visit
  the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to
  validate and augment the informationprovided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
  IEG studies.
         Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally, the
  PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank departmentand amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
  sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers' comments are attachedto the document that is sent to the Bank's
  Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the IEG RatingSystem
        The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
  methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEGwebsite:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
        Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistentwith the country's
 current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
 goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, CountryAssistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
 Operational Policies). Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve,a return higherthan the
 opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
        Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
        lnstitutional DevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
 to make more efficient, equitableand sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
 better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability,and predictabilityof institutionalarrangements and/or (b)
 better alignment of the missionand capacity of an organization with its mandate,which derives from these
 institutional arrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
 project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BankPerformance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
 supported implementationthrough appropriatesupervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
 for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
 quality of preparation and implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
 achievement of developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
 Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface


This project performance audit report (PPAR) covers two projects: the FourthPopulation
and Health Project (FPHP, Credit 2259-BD for US$ 180million) andthe Health and
PopulationProgram Project (HPPP, Credit 3101-BD for US$250million). These
projects closed inJune 1998 and June 2005, respectively.

The PPAR was preparedbythe Independent EvaluationGroup (IEG, formerly OED),
based uponthe ImplementationCompletionReports (ICR), project documents, and
interviews with government officials andBank staffwith experience ofthe projects. The
report also draws on the OED impact study Maintaining Momentum? An impact
evaluation of interventions to improve Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition
Outcomes in Bangladesh. Fieldwork was undertakeninMarch 2006, which benefited
from the support o fMs. ShirinJahangeer, who also assistedinthe preparation o fthe
report. The missioni s gratehl to the manypeople who sparedtheir time to share their
views, andfor the cooperation ofthe Government ofBangladesh inundertakingthis
study.

These projects were selected for review for several reasons. Bangladesh has a good track
record inimproving healthoutcomes, a successwhich hasbeenachieved with the help o f
a succession o f Bank-led, donor-supported projects, culminatinginthe largest externally-
fundedhealthproject inthe world (HPPP). As an early example ofthe sector wide
approach (SWAP), valuable lessonscan be learned about this instrument. The study will
also inform the health sector review to be undertakenby IEG.

Following standard IEGprocedures, the draft o fthis PPAR was sent to the borrower for
comments before finalization, but none were received.

 Summary

          The FourthPopulationandHealthProject (FPHP) andthe HealthandPopulation
 Program Project (HPPP) were the latest ina series o f World Bank projects supporting the
 creationo f a health and family planningservice inBangladesh, starting with the First
 PopulationProject in`1975. These Bank-ledprojects, with substantial cofinancing, have
 made a clear and demonstrable contribution to the country's remarkable success in
 reducing fertility and under-fivemortality.

          FPHP, continuingthis pattern, expanded project coverage to have a stronger focus
 on healthservices. Like earlier projects, fundingwas providedto construct andrenovate
 facilities, train staff andpay a share o f their salaries. There were also interventions for
 specific healthissues,, such as the successful TB program, which once again demonstrated
the country's ability to deliverhealth services through government channels, though in
this casethrough apartnership with a number o fNGOs. These project outputs are linked
to the continuedrise incontraceptive prevalence and consequent decline infertility.
Health outcomes, notably under-fivemortality, also continuedto improve. The outcome
ofFPHPis ratedsatisfactoryoverall, as are bothBank andborrower performance.
Givencommitment to the programbyboth government and development partners (DPs)
sustainabilityis ratedas likely.However, whilst successful inservice delivery, the
project approach o fFPHP, which was treatedby government as 66 separate projects, was
seen as time consuming and inefficient. The project did little to address these issues, so
that institutionaldevelopment is rated as modest.Inorder to address this issue, the
follow on project was designedas a sector wide approach (SWAP): the Healthand
Population Sector Program (HPSP).

          HPSP i s the largest health sector programinthe world, and i s often heldup as a
model o f a successful SWAP inpractice. Yet, whilst the SWAP has been successfully
established, there were many unsatisfactory aspects inthe implementation o f HPSP. The
programincludedthe controversial reform to unify health and family planning
directorates. Although designedwith high-levelsupport, andpopular amongst workers at
the field level, the policy was strongly opposedby a vocal minority o f family planning
employees and eventually reversedby government. The Bank suspended loan
disbursementsinMay 2003; the resultingtensions taintedmanyother aspects o fHPSPby
association, set back government-donor relations and disrupted service delivery. Very
many activities which were planned under HPSPdidnot take place at all or were only
partially implemented. The major program o f civil works was the creationo f a new tier o f
service provisionthrough the construction o f community clinics. But this programwas
abandoned after fewer than 10,000 o f the planned16,000 clinics hadbeenconstructed,
and the vast majority are unutilized. Access rates to public clinics declined duringthe
project, and doorstep delivery o f contraceptives, the cornerstone o f the country's success
infamilyplanning,also suffereda setback.Although there were some areasofsuccess,
such as expanding immunization coverage and continuation o f the TB program, most
areas o f the project were not satisfactorily implemented. It i s therefore not plausibleto
attribute continued improvements inthe health outcomes to the project. Indeed,the
decline ininfant mortality stalled duringthe project, and that fact may well be a result o f
the problems resulting from the project. On account o f these factors, the outcomesof

                                            X



HPSP and both Bank and borrower performance are all rated as unsatisfactory.
Giventhe failure ofreforms, institutionaldevelopment impactwas modest.However,
sustainability is likely since commitment to service delivery remains high.

A number o f lessons follow from the analysis contained inthis report:

  Aid-financed health infrastructure can work in improving health outcomes..      .
  provided other conditions are inplace: the creation of an extensive health and family
  planning system, with considerable assistance from external finance, has made a
   demonstrable improvementto the health outcomes o f Bangladeshis. However, this
   successwas achieved throughthe balanced growth o f infrastructure and trained staff.

  Public andprivateprovision are complementsnot substitutes:The health demands
  o fBangladeshis are met bybothpublic and private providers. These suppliers do not
  work inparallel, but co-exist through various symbiotic relationships.

  A SWAP takes time to implement and is an evolutionaiyprocess. InBangladesh it
  took 20 years o f donor coordinationto beginthe process of implementing a SWAP. It
  i s not feasible to jump from a project approach to filly-fledged SWAP overnight:
  institutions needto evolve though a series o f interiminstitutionalarrangements.

   Wide stakeholderparticipation inpreparation helps ownership but can weaken
  design.The broadparticipatoryprocess made it difficult to prioritize. A compromise
  needbe sought between participationand technical guidance.

  Think through the implications of the new system. A SWAP implies a change in
  how things are done inways which are oftennot well understood. It i s imperativeto
  thinkthroughhow systemswill actuallywork, andmake surethat all involved
  understand this. This process will necessarily take time.

  Draw on the appropriate skills mix. Many aspects o f the design and implementation
  o f a SWAP do not fall within the competence o f health specialists. Thus, the need for
  appropriate expertise should berecognized and drawn on. Bank staff should seek to
  draw on the Bank's experience with similar issues inother countries, makingsure that
  local staff, DPs and government can all benefit from this experience.

  Failure to assessfully thepolitical economy of reform and toprepare both a
  proactiveplanfor addressing/mitigating risks and a contingencyplan will
  considerably diminishprospectsfor successful reform. Ina politicised environment
  policy reversals are the norm not the exception. Donor agencies shouldbeprepared to
  adapt their approach: maybe renaming institutions will suffice, but it may not be so.

e Too much donor/Bank intervention can undermine government capaci?y and
  ownership of a SWAP approach. Preparation o f the SWAP startedwith a highdegree
  o f local ownership. But the extensive role playedby donors inthe reviewprocess, and
  the importance o f the tasks which eventually fell to Health Program Support Office
  (located inthe World Bank office), butwould have beenbettercarried out by
  government, reduced local ownership.

0 Be realistic in tackling major reform objectives. HPSP combinedthe move to a
  SWAPwith two major sets ofreforms: unification anddecentralisation, as well as the
  introductiono f a new tier o f service delivery at community level. This was rather a lot
  to hope to achieve ina singleproject. A more focused approach may have achieved
  some ofthe goals HPSP failed to reach.

 1.1      At Independence in 1971Bangladeshhadamongst boththe highestfertility rate
 and the highest population density inthe world. The newlyindependentgovernment
 recognized population as one of the country's most pressingproblems. The FirstFive
 Year Planproposed ahealth and family planning system comprising a hospital ineach
 district, which insome cases was supplementedby a Maternal and Child Welfare Center
 (MCWC) at sub-district level. Eachupazillawas to have an Upazilla HealthComplex
 (UHC), andthen eachunion a Family Welfare Center (FWC); see Box 1.

 Box 1.A note on Terminology

 Bangladeshhas six divisions, which are divided in64 districts. Each district is sub-divided into a number o f
 upazillas (called at various times thanas), o f which there are currently 490. An upazilla i s further sub-
 divided into a small number (five or six) unions, each consisting o f a number o f villages.

All healthand family planning facilities (except primary care inurbanareas) fall underthe Ministryo f
Healthand Family Welfare. For most o fthe time since independence health and family planning have been
functionally separate with,a directorate for each, and each having their own facilities at the different
administrative levels. Whilst, there have been various name changes at various times, especially during the
period o f unification when facilities were merged.This report, however, uses the nomenclature outlined
below.

1.2      Government's efforts to reduce populationgrowth cannot be separatedfrom the
role o f external agencies, since these agencies were central from the outset, paying the
majority o fprogramcosts, including salaries. The Bank was invited to participate in
implementationo f the plan and first fielded a missioninMay 1973. Donor coordination
was envisaged from the outset. However, disagreement arose over whether family
planning should fall under a separate organization or be integrated with health services.

                                                     2


Somewhat ironically, givenevents 25 years later, the Bank ledthe group which
successfully urgeda separateprogram for family planning, on the grounds that a vertical
programwas requiredto attain the necessary focus.' Six bilateral agencies cofinancedthe
FirstPopulationProject (1975-84, Table l), the objective of assisting the
                                                      with
development o f a comprehensive fertility-control program. This project was the first
cofinanced social sector project undertakenbythe World Bank anywhere inthe world.
Already in 1970s elements o f a sector wide approach (SWAP)2were inplace: donor
activities were coordinated inthe context o f a government-led strategy (the First Five
Year Plan), with a large part o f support to the sector under a single project.

1.3      The FirstPopulationProject set about creating the infrastructure neededfor
service deliveryby the Ministryo fHealth andFamily Welfare (MOHFW): bothhard and
soft. Sixty-nine percent o fproject costs were for civil works, halfo f that amount being
for the construction o fupazilla health complexes (UHCs) andthe bulk o f the remainder
for FamilyWelfare Visitor (FWV) training institutes (FWVTIs). Onthe software side,
most o f the funds were used for the training and salaries o f fieldworkers (FamilyWelfare
Assistants, FWAs). By 1978 16,700 FWAshadbeenposted, with UNFPApaying salaries
for most o fthose not supported with Bank finance.


1.The debate over verticalversus integrated services continues, for example regarding HIV/AIDS. Inmany
countries immunization has been a vertical service, thoughBangladesh i s an example of how it can be
successfully integrated into service delivery.
2. InBangladeshthe SWAP is most usually referred to as a sector programor programmatic approach. This
report uses the expression SWAP throughout unless as part o f a name or direct quote.

                                                  3


 1.4      Duringpreparations for the SecondFiveYear Plan, the government invitedall
donors to participate as technical advisors indrawing up the family planning strategy,
alongside a request for preparations for a follow-on populationproject, subsequently
named the SecondPopulationand Family HealthProject. Once again, about halfo f
project costs went on civil works, mainlyUHCs andFamilyWelfare Centers. The third
project continued this pattern. Although the projects paidthe salaries o f field staff,
government was assuming a larger share. Under the first two projects government had
paid only 10percent o fproject costs, but this sharerose to 17percent by the thirdproject
and was plannedfor 28 percent inthe fourthproject, but infact reached 40 percent.
UnderHPSP government financed themajorityshare ofprogramcosts.

Success in Family Planning

 1.5     Bythe late eighties there was firm evidence that the massive expansion inservice
delivery supported bythe first three projects was having animpact. The Bangladesh
Fertility Survey (BFS) o f 1989 showed a steep decline inthe total fertility rate (TFR)
from 6.8 in 1979 to 4.6 in 1988. Other surveys revealeda similartrend. An OEDreport
from 1991 said there was incontrovertibleevidence o f fertility decline andthat Bank-
financed projects had contributed to that trend. The project completionreport (PCR) for
the thirdproject said that the progress was remarkable andthe contributionofthe Bank's
projects both substantial and undeniable. OED's recent impact evaluation confirmedthat
family planningprovision has indeedbeenamajor factor behindfertility red~ction.~

Health Services

1.6      With the emphasis on familyplanning, health services were relatively neglected,
though with important exceptions. One i s the NationalDrugPolicy o f 1982, which
helpeddevelop a nationalpharmaceutical industrymakinglow-cost medicines widely
available. The other exception was the immunizationprogramo f the 1980s: the Expanded
Program o f Immunization(EPI), launched in1985 with financial support from several
donors increasedimmunization from less than 5 percent to over 50percent inits first five
years. The following two projects, which are the subject o f this report, substantially
expanded the focus on health.

The FourthPopulationand HealthProject(1992-1998)

Preparation

1.7      The FourthPopulation and HealthProject (FPHP) followed on logically from the
previous three projects, with project preparation missions beingcombined with
supervision o f the Third PopulationandHealthProject. The project concept document
(PCD) was preparedinOctober o f 1988, with identificationthe following March. Pre-
appraisal was inFebruary 1990, followed by the appraisal mission inOctober o f that
year. Things then moved quickly to get the project to the Boardby June (Le. the same

fiscal year) since other major projects inthe country's pipeline, notably Jamuna Bridge,
were lagging. The conditions for effectiveness were reachedbyMarch 1992.

 1.8     The project continued support to familyplanningactivities, thoughwith a greater
emphasis on healththan hadbeenthe case inpreviousprojects. There was also less
emphasis on civil works, though theywere present, andmore focus on improving service
delivery through both supplies, specific healthcomponents (e.g. TB, ARI and support to
EPI), andquality-enhancing activities. Government was actively involvedinproject
preparation, with the leadtaken by the Planning Cell o fMOHFW. Government's Fourth
FiveYear Planprovidedthe overall context for theproject, though a gap emerged
between the government and donor planningcycle.4Project proposals were put to the
planningcell thr0ugh.aseries ofworking groups involving government staff, consortium
members, andNGOs. The SAR was based on the approved project proposals.

 1.9     InternalBank discussions duringpreparation raised two concerns related to the
size o fthe project. One issue was that the project was very complex, combining a
program approach, inwhich the Bank and other donors were paying a share o f recurrent
expenses, with a more traditional project approach. Concerns were also raised about the
largenumber o fcofinanciers andwhether Bank supervision structures could manage such
a large programwith so manypartners. To cater for these concerns it was proposed that
the project be split into a sector adjustment program andtwo or three stand alone
investment projects. The argument against these points, which eventually prevailed, was
that the project followed on from three previousprojects which had also successfully
contained these features, including Bank management o f a large consortium.


Objectives

1.10     The objectives o fFPHPwere to: (a) reduce fertility byincreasing the CPR to 45-
50%; (b) lower morbidity and mortality inchildrenunder five; (c) improve maternalcare
andensure safer deliveries therebyreducingmaternalmortality from the current 6-8 to 4-
5 per 1,000 live births; (d) reduce disability, morbidity and mortality from common
poverty-related diseases; (e) enhancethe nutritional status o f women and children; and (f)
improve effectiveness and efficiency inthe planningand delivery o f FP and health
services to accelerate the achievement o f the above objectives.

Project Components

1.11 The project hadfour main components, most ofwhich hadmanysub-components,
so that there were 66 sub-components underthe project as a whole (Table 1; the sub sub-
component budgets are inAnnex B). The first component, to strengthen family planning
and M C H services, was the largest, accounting for 60 percent o fthe plannedproject cost,
over halfo fwhich (56 percent) was to improve access to FP services byrecruitment,
training, contraceptive supplies, andrenovation and constructiono f facilities.



4. The Five Year Plancovered the period 1990-95, whereas FPHP was set to runfrom 1991-96, andinthe
event was effectively 1993-98.

                                                      5


 1.12     The component to strengthen healthservice delivery(26 percent o f costs)
 included substantial elements of training, but also supported several healthprograms -
 including TB and leprosy, the Vitamin A and Iodine Deficiencies andARI Programs, and
 the IntestinalParasite Control Project - as well as construction andrehabilitationof
 health facilities. The third component (12 percent o fbase costs) supported institutional
 activities for service delivery.

 Financing

 1.13     Inthe FinalExecutiveProject Summary (FEPS), theproposed IDA contribution
 to FPHP was US$ 85 million, Since the project could absorb more, this figure was taken
 as a `low scenario', with a `highscenario' figure o fUS$ 150million. However, the S A R
 putthe Bank's credit at US$ 180million. This figurewas stated as beingderivedfrom
 the gap between the budgetfor agreedproject activities and contributions from
 government and other donors. While the gap could have been reduced by cutting
 activities, the country team was keento have the larger amount approved since other
projects due to go the Board inthat fiscal year were lagginginpreparation, so a larger
 credit to FPHP would helpmaintainthe volume o f the country program.

 1.14    Inthebudget giveninthe SAR FPHPwas to beco-financed by 10bilateral
 agencies, though inthe event only 8 took part. IDA and the Government o f Bangladesh
 (GOB)were to meet around 30 percent ofproject costs each, andthebilaterals thebalance
o f 43 percent.

The HealthandPopulationProgram(1998-2005)

Preparation

1.15     Preparation for HPPP began under FPHP, with the project concept document
beingissuedinFebruary 1996. Originally calledthe FifthPopulationandHealth
Program, and then the Health andPopulationProject V (HAPP V), it was finally named
the Health andPopulation Sector Program (HPSP, see Box 2) inrecognitionofthe move
to a SWAP. The name also reflects the fact that, unlike earlier programs, prominence was
to be givento healthrather than family planning. The project was appraised inFebruary
1998, going to the Boardjust four months later (June) as there was pressure to have the
project approved that fiscal year; effectiveness was reached two months later.

                                                       7


 Box 2. A Noteon Terminology 2: HPSS,HPSP,HPPP and HNPSP

 The government's strategy during the SWAP was the Healthand PopulationSector Strategy (HPSS).
 Activities carried out insupport o fthis strategy were financed under the Health and Population Sector
 Program (HPSP). The support o f the Bank and cofinanciers to HPSP were provided through the Health and
 PopulationProgramProject (HPPP). The follow onproject and program are called the Health, Nutrition
 and Population Sector Program (HNPSP).

 1.16     Preparation o f HPSP was a highlyparticipatory process with a large degree o f
 stakeholder consultation, but also moremissions than the norm to support the in-country
preparation activities. The Health andPopulation Sector Strategy (HPSS) was prepared
by a GOBteam (the Project Preparation Cell, supportedbybilateral agencies) basedon
 inputsby seventeenworking groups, which hadatripartite structure of GoB-
 DevelopmentPartners (DPs)-NGOs. Technical missions were fieldedby the Bankto
 support these working groups. Consultations were heldwith government workers, civil
 society and other stakeholders at both local and national level as the strategy developed.
 There were, however, clear lines for donor influence. Most notably, the broadthrust o f
the strategy towards basic services was set inthe framework o fthe 1993 World
Development Report on health. The decision that these ideas - and the notion o f
prioritising services based on a cost effectiveness assessed against the burdeno f disease -
 should form the basis o fthe strategy was taken at a Consultative Group meeting inParis
in 1995. Indeed,theidea ofcreating aprioritisedEssentialServicePackage, was already
beingdiscussed inthe context o fFPHPby 1996. Aspects o fthe HPSP design, notably the
community clinics, appear to have beenintroducedrather late inthe day, and it i s not
clear where the initiative came fromS5

 1.17     Giventhat HP.SPwas later to become highlypoliticized, with the name "HPSP"
beingequatedbymanywith the destruction o fthe country's familyplanningservices, it
i s worth remembering that (1) HPSP was initiated under one party and introduced by
another,6and that the change ingovernment mid-way duringthe program markedthe
start o f serious implementationproblems (2) there was a very broad consultation process,
and (3) the proposals were owned at the highest levels o f government, notjust inthe
MOHFWbut also byFinance and the Prime Minister's Office.

1.18      As mentioned,above, the ESPapproachwas agreedinthe donor-GOB consultative
meeting inParis to discuss next phase o f consortium support in 1995.' The basis for the
package was that identified in WDR 93, though that package cost US$12 per person
whereas Bangladesh had abudget o fUS$3.50 per person. A technical working group was
formed to develop the package, which formed four subgroups, which grew insize and
spawned subgroups o f their own. Eachgroup developed a wish list with little thought for
prioritization. These lists were not informedby a burdeno f disease (BOD) analysis or

5. Some respondents believe this was a World Bank idea introduced at the last minute; others suggest it was
included to sell the programto the prime minister.
6. The BangladeshNationalParty (BNP) was inpower when the basic approach to HPSP was agreed,
although most o f the design and initial implementationfell to the Awami League administration.
Implementationproblems came to the fore once BNP came back to power.
7. This paragraph i s mainly based onAbdo Yazbeck, `How to Buy a $12 Package at $3.50, a Bangladesh
case study', September 1999,World Bank, mimeo.

                                                        8


 calculationo f the relative cost-effectiveness o f different interventions, which i s the basis
 o fthe approach advocated inthe Bank's WDR. Datato inform such an analysis were not
 available and no attempt was made to compile them at the time. The resulting sub-group
proposals totalled greatly inexcess of the available funds. A rankingexercise was
undertaken to refine the proposals into a package within the budget envelope, but it
proveddifficult to drop any o f the programs identified.Whilst BOD analysis may not
 always be cost effective inresource poor environments, the lack o f systematic application
 o fBangladesh-specific data inthe exercise resultedinconsiderable inertia inthe types o f
 service beingprovided, but didprovide a platform to attempt to shift the focus fiom
 costly curative care.

 1.19     The experience o fESP supports the view, statedinthe ICR, that wide
 consultation resultedina diffuse program, whereas one drawn up by a narrower technical
 group may have beenmore focused. An alternative point o f view i s that leaving designin
the hands o f the medical profession would not have achieved a reorientation o fhealth
 strategy toward primarycare. The ICR also claims that consultation prolongedthe
preparation process. However, the time taken betweenthe PCD and appraisal (25
months) was the same as that for FPHP. A perhaps more serious point i s that the strategy
made little differenceto the patterno f service provision inpractice.

Objectives

 1.20     The objectives are not clearly statedinthe Project Appraisal Document (PAD),
but the following can be extracted, although the specific objectives are a mixture of
inputs, outputs and outcomes.* As the projectwas part of a SWAP, the objectives o f
HPPP were the same as those stated for HPSP, which were based on the government's
strategy, HPSS.

 1.21     Overall objective: To assist the Government o f Bangladesh to improve the health,
nutrition and family welfare status o fthe population o f Bangladesh, particularly
vulnerable women, childrenand the poor, andto reduce mortality and slow population
growth. Inthe PAD the overall objective i s givenmore concretely as "better access to
essential services for the poor, lower maternal mortality andmorbidity, and continued
improvements inchild health and family planning".

1.22     Specific objectives:

0    Objective 1: technical support and funding to improve coverage and quality o f
     essential health and family planning services for vulnerable groups, particularly poor
     women and children, through the deliveryo f the Essential Service Package. ESP was
     targetedto receive 60-65 percent of government expenditure inthe sector and 50
     percent o f donor assistance.



8. The objectives vary between the DCA and PAD. The overall objective givenhere i s from the DCA.
However, the D C A does not include any specific objectives, which are derived from the PAD. The specific
objectives as stated inthe P A D do not, however, state certain aspects of these objectives very clearly, so
that additional text from the P A D i s usedto elaborate the objectives.

                                                  9


     Objective 2: support public sector reorganization andreform efforts to achieve more
     cost-effective service delivery, eliminationo f duplication, improvedquality, and
     betterutilization. Two key aspectsofthis objective were (1) unification ofthe health
     andfamily planningdirectorates and (2) sector-wide approach established and
     operational.

     Objective 3: laying the groundwork for broader healthreform, including greater
     involvement o fNGOs and the private-for-profit sector inservice delivery,
     decentralization (including hospitalautonomy), cost recovery andnew approachesto
     financing.

Project Components

 1.23     Though HPSP had a complex designthere were essentially three areas: (1)
 provisiono f an integrated Essential Services Package (ESP); (2) re-organization o f
 MOHFW; and (3) implementinga sector-basedapproachtoward aidmanagement. The
 full list ofactivitiesis giveninTable 4. The largest share oftheprojectbudget (56
percent) was the Essential Services Package (ESP), plannedas an integrated health
 service program includingreproductive health. Other services under the first component
 included hospital services, public health and support services such as behaviour change
 communication (BCC) and the mergero f the four management informationsystems into
 a single MIS.There was also a sub-component for expanded service delivery through
NGOs andto develop aregulatory framework for the for-profit sector.

 1.24      The second component covered programmanagement and sector reorganization
 andreform. Central to this component was the unification o fthe Health and Family
 Planningdirectorates and integrationo f service delivery at thana level andbelow. Also
 includedunder this component was implementationo fAnnual Operational Plans (AOPs)
 andAnnual Performance Reviews(APRs), intendedto changethe nature o f sector
 management and the government-donor relationship.


 Financing

 1.25      TheNetherlands, SwedenandDFID agreedto pay funds into a PooledFunds
 Account, which together with the IDA contributiontotaled US$250 million. These funds
 were not allocated to specific activities, but were disbursed against agreed categories o f
 goods and services. Just over US$ 50 million was pre-allocated between the five
 categories inthe appraisal document, but the bulk o f funds were unallocated. The
 allocationwas to bemade on an annual basis based on the work program agreed with the
 development partners;

 1.26      So o f the $2,895 million, US$705 millionwas to come from the donors, o fwhich
US$ 522 millionwere disbursedthrough the pool, which MOHFWcoulduse to meet
expenses incurred inexecution o f the Annual Operational Plans. The remainingUS$183
millionwere linkedto specific components. Many DPs also continued support health
activities outside o fHPSP.

Nutrition

 1.27     Nutrition was not a major focus o f either project. Inaddition to vitaminA and
iodine supplements, FPHP provided institutional support to the NationalNutrition
Council inreadiness for a larger scale nutrition intervention. By the time o fHPPP, a
separatenutritionproject, the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project (BINP)," was
underway, with discussions already taking place for a follow-on NationalNutrition
Project (NNP).Hence nutrition didnot fall under HPSP."




9. Category 1: Goods, other than those under 2 and 3, works and operating costs; Category 2: drugs,
vaccines and contraceptives; Category 3: diagnostic and surgical goods, and ambulance; Category 4:
technical assistance, training and fellowships, and survey and research; Category 5: NGO support.
Category 1was called 'time-slice financing' since it covered all sector expenses not under the other four
categories.
10. BINP i s discussed extensively inIEG's impact evaluation and subject to its own PPAR (Report No.
32563).
11.The inclusiono fnutrition as an activity underHPSP inthe PAD is an example o f why the intended
activities ina sector programdocument can be unclear, since the project description includes activities to
be implemented under entirely different projects.

2.        IMPLEMENTATIONISSUES

2.1       This section begins bybriefly reviewing progress inimplementation o fthe two
projects. The main focus is, however, on HPPPinorder to learn the lessons o f the SWAP
experience, includingthe transition from a project approach under FPHFto a SWAP
under HPPP. The SWAP i s meant to address a number o fproblems inthe project
approach. The way inwhich these problems manifestedthemselves under FPHP i s
discussed inthe presentation o f FPHP implementation. Turningto the SWAP, the
following issues are discussed: (1) the transition to the SWAP approach; (2) supervision
under the SWAP; (3) procurement anddisbursement; and (4) governance issues. A final
section reviews the performance o f the Bangladesh SWAP.

Implementationof FPHP

2.2      Dates and financing. The start up o f FPHPwas delayed by two factors. First, the
bilateral financing agreements were not inplace at the time of effectiveness, andwere not
untillate 1992or early the next year. Hencemanyproject activities couldnotbeginuntil
one year after effectiveness. Once they began, those infamily planningproceeded
without much difficulty, as there was a well-established track record. By contrast, many
health projects experienced serious implementation delays, so that actual spending
continued to lagbehind planned (Figure 1).

extension o f any project" rule was inplace in 1996. Nonetheless, Bank staffmounted a
case for extending FPHP based on both mitigating circumstances and need. The
mitigating circumstances were that the project had gone to the Board inJune 1991 since
other major projects for Bangladeshwere lagging inpreparation, but didnot really get
going untilearly 1993 because o f the time needed to put the bilateral cofinancing
agreements inplace. The need-based argument was to avoid a disruption to service
delivery between project close andthe follow on HPPP. Given these arguments, a single
18 monthextension, untilJune 1998, was allowed.

2.4      Use o f funds. In 1995 the government requested that SDR 17.4 million (13
percent the IDA total) be re-allocated to medical supplies on account o f increasesinthe
price o f these supplies, notably contraceptive products. The funds would be taken out o f
the unallocated budget line andthat for consultant services. The Bank approved a SDR 9
million reallocation from the unallocated budget line. The following year government
again requested the balance, which this time the Bank agreed to, takingthe money mainly
inequalpart from consultant services andequipment, andlesser amounts from other
budgetlines. Inaddition, seven sub-projects were cancelled as aresult o f either
implementationproblems or a view that they were o f low priority.

Problems in the Project Approach

2.5      FPHP presents many o f the problems o f aproject-based approach. The sixty-six
sub-components (and the other 60 odd donor projects outside o f FPHP) were each treated
as a separateproject withinMOHFW, eachrequiringseparate approval, appointment o f a
project manager, preparation o f an annual audit report and so on. Donor agencies fielded
supervision and evaluation missions for eachproject separately;" as one senior MOHFW
official put it "every day there were people from one donor agency or another inthe
corridors". Managing such a large number o fprojects, and almost an equal number
outside o fFPHP, was clearly a very time consuming activity for ministryofficials, taking
time away from thetask ofmanagingthe sector. Government's completionreport for
FPHP stated that: "IDA fielded supervision missions too frequently.. . Too manyvisits by
the IDA Missions kept most o f the best officers busypreparingbackgroundmaterials and
positionpapers, causing at times disruptioninthe normalproject implementationworks"
(FPHP ICR:49).

2.6      At a systemic level, reliance on external finance meantthat MOHFW focused on
attracting donor resources rather than settingpolicy and making choices about resource
allocation. To the extent that these things were considered it was so as to increase the
chance o f external finance, Since such finance paid the bulk o f health expenditure the
government's healthbudgetbore little relationto what was happening inthe sector.
These tendencies underminenormalprocesses o f accountability. These shortcomings
                                                                              l3
were present despite the coordinated approach taken by donors to the country's health
sector since the FirstHealthProject. The problems were well-recognizedbyMOHFW
officials, who bemoan the lack o f accountability o fprojects, the difficulty o f
coordination, andthe lack o f autonomy from the Ministryo f Planning.

ImplementationofHPPP

2.7     Under a SWAP there are no development projects, rather aid finances the
government execution o f sector activities by the line Ministry.The position o fProject
Director disappeared, beingreplacedwith that o f Line Director. This was not a mere

12.This is true for projects outside FPHP. The situation for projects under FPHP was a bit more
complicated, and is discussed inthe sub-section on monitoring and evaluation.
13. These arguments became a standard critique against the projectized approach bythe late nineties. For a
statement inthe context of the health sector (specifically FPHP) see "Evaluation o f the European
Commission's Country Strategy for Bangladesh", November 2003.

 semantic change, there were two important changes. Line Directors fall under their
relevant Director General, whereas Project Directors reported directly to the Minister,
undermining the accountability structure. The Line Directors prepare Annual Operational
Plans (AOPs) which outline their activities for the year and the proposedbudget. These
plansare approvedbywithin MOHFW.Bycontrast, projects hadto be individually
 approved by the Ministry o f Planning.Under the new systemjust one project was
 approved (HPSP) which encompassed all donor activities falling under the sector wide
 approach, including the Bank's HPPP, thus givingMOHFW discretion on the use o f the
US$2.8 billion without further recourse to Planning. The importance o f these system
reforms should not be under-estimated and are a significant achievement o f the SWAP.

2.8     Although the SWAP was executedthrough MOHFW, program units (equivalent
to the old project cells) were created. These were the Change Management Unit (CMU)
andthe Program Coordination Cell (PCC). Onthe donor side the HealthandPopulation
 Support Office (HPSO) acted as a secretariat for the project.

2.9     As discussed indetail below, unfamiliaritywith Bank procurement procedures
andrapidturnover o fgovernmentprocurement staffresultedinsubstantial delays, which
were still being identified as a problem at the time o f the mid-term review, despite the
training inthese matters. The disbursement profile (Figure 2) does not, however, show
any serious lags inthe early years o f the project. Indeed, actual disbursements exceeded
planned for a while. This occurred since pool finance was partlyused to finance a "time
slice" o f government expenditures inthe sector, from both the recurrent and development
budgets, and so including local expenditures (notably salaries), for which procurement
was not required.

The delays inthese activities created a drag on disbursements, negative disbursements
taking place when GOBhad to repay funds incases o f declared misprocurement. The
suspension from May-July 2003, although a very important symbolic event, had little
impact on disbursements.

2.11    As theproject close date drew near a largerdisbursement laghadopened up and,
more importantly, manyproject activities were at best partially implemented. And, once
again, preparation o fthe follow on projectwould not be completed intime to avoid a gap
betweenprojects. Hence two project extensions were granted, totalling 18 months. Whilst
the extensions avoided the gap, they didnot contribute that much to the completiono f
uncompleted activities for reasonsthat are explored below. They also didnot help expend
the IDA credit since the government chose to spendgrant funds from other donors first,
so that only US$224 milliono f the plannedUS$250million from IDA were disbursed,
though o f course the extension didenable the bilateral cofinanciers spendtheir remaining
balances.

The Transitionfrom Project to SWAP

2.12    Government's own evaluation o f HPSP states that the 128 donor projects "were
declared officially non existent from July 1,1998.., without allowing a time frame for
transition from a projectized approach to programmatic approach" (IMED, 2003: 24).
This claim appears to be an overstatement, although similar sentiments were echoed in
both donor and government communities. A more balanced picture has to take account o f
the fact that manyprojects didindeedcontinue underHPSP, althoughtheir modus
operandi changed, andthat boththe ProgramCoordinationCell andthe Change
Management Unit inMOHFW hadresponsibilities for overseeing and supporting the
transition. So there were transition arrangements, but they turned out to be insufficient.

2.13    Manyo fthepersonnel involved, from both GOBandDPs, hadlittleunderstanding
o fwhat a SWAP was. A note on an early meetingto discuss HPSP mentionsthat there
was no agreement on adopting a SWAP as no one present knew what it was. The change
from project to programhas far reaching implications. Therewas little appreciation o f the
extent o f these changes, and far too little attention to thinkingthrough their implications.
Changeswere requiredat many levels reflectingboth new institutional arrangements,
including unification, new responsibilities (procurement, preparingannual operational
plans etc.) and the reorientationo f service delivery inline with the introduction o f ESP
and the shift toward facility-based services. Such wide-ranging changes needto be
supported by a concerted effort to win staff over to the new arrangements and to make
sure they fully understandthe new structure andtheir responsibilities within it. There
were also losers from the transition amongst project employees andreduced power for
the Ministry o fPlanning, but no effort was made to accommodate their resistance to the
changes.

2.14    Lengthydocuments were prepared on the SWAPbythe DPs, which were
transmitted to government. But it cannot be assumedthat the mere transmission o f
documents means they have been absorbed. Many commentators believe that government
(andpossiblyDPs) didnot realize what they were signingoffto interms o fchanges in
administrative responsibilities (a euphemism for power) under HPSP. The example o f
procurement i s discussed below. It i s one thing to design a new procurement systemin
accordance with the new structure. It i s quite another to ensure that it will be able to
function efficiently once the program starts.

                                                   15


 Supervisingthe SWAP

2.15     A large numberofplannedactivities underHPSP didnot take place. Foremost
 amongst these was the unification ofhealth and family planning. But there was much
 else, some o fwhich, but not all, were directly linkedto the failure o f unification: the
unificationo fManagement InformationSystems, implementationo f a BCC program,
hospital reforms (no delegation o f authority or local accountability took place, a new
systemwas developed for fee management andretentionbutnot implemented)14,
agreeing an allocation formula to redressthe fact that better off districts received more
resources, andthe proposed quality assurance mechanisms were not acted upon. Several
reports or other documents were preparedbut not acted upon, such as the "Strategy for
Change" drafted for HPSP, engagement withNGOs, and the output o f the Health
EconomicsUnit (although the latter had a greatly increasedbudget from that originally
planned). Other areas were subject to long delay, such as the construction of community
clinics. The question which arises i s whether the move to a SWAP approach, inwhich
funds are no longer linkedto the implementationof specific activities, allows planned
activities to slip. Ifso, i s this because supervision no longer pays adequate attention to
such matters, or becausethere is no leverage over government?

2.16     The system designedinBangladesh should have safeguarded against such
problems. There were two channels for supervision. At a macro level i s the Annual
Performance Review, which reviewsprogress on a rangeo fprocess, output and outcome
indicators andpresents a qualitative analysis o fprogress. The APR consisted o f (i)      a
reviewo fperformance indicators, (ii) GOB-DPfield visits, (iii) o fprogress
                                           joint                         review
toward HPSP goals, and (iv) dialogto addressproblems.

2.17     The APR was initially managedbyMOHFW, but once the programunits inthe
ministrywere closedresponsibility shiftedto HPSO.TheAPR process canberegardedas
a good model o f donor involvement ina SWAP. Rather thanbeinginvolved inday-to-
day micro-management, the APR provides a means o fregular, less ftequent, interactions
with arm's lengthinputs.However, over time it hasbecome an exercise for the benefito f
donors rather than a management tool for senior officials inthe health sector. This
problem partly reflects the lack o f a results-focus inMOHFW. But it also resulted from
the way inwhich the APR was carried out, especially after the PCC was disbandedin
2003 so that HPSO became responsible for the management o f the APR. The benefits o f
the APR have become diluted andwere, anyhow, offset by the second channel for
supervision through the AOPs.

2.18     The 22 line directors preparedAnnual Operational Plans (AOPs) against which
theywere provided an annual budget. DPs were parto fthe AOP approvalprocess. It is
not clear that there was a precise mapping made o f the AOPs onto HPSP, but the
allocation o f line director responsibilities follows the strategy's main areas o f focus, so
that all activities should be covered. Donors became heavily involved inthis review
process, partly inresponseto requests from government to do so (especially once the
PCC was disbanded), to the extent that micro-management o fthe sector by DPs has not

                                                       16


 beenremovedby the shift from projects to programs, The review o fprogress on AOPs
 resulted inaction plans, though the proposed actions were often not undertaken.

 2.19       Supervision failure i s not, then, the reasonthat many o fthe activities under HPSP
 were not implemented.Rather, each case o f non-implementation has its own specific
 factors. But for many.ofthese cases the politicisationo f HPSP around unification is a
 critical factor. The MIS and BCC components were not implementedbecausethey were
 based on unification and so foundered on the non-cooperation o fhealth and family
 planningstaff. Onthe reform front, decentralisation was also apolitical challenge. But
 the donors, the Bank inparticular, exhausted all their political capital inthe unsuccessfbl
 fight over unification. There was none left to pursuedecentralisation, which probably
 matters far more for service delivery.Post-reunification "HPSP" was virtually a curse
 word, andnothing associatedwith it could expect support.

 Procurementand Disbursement

 Procurement

 2.20       Three issues are discussed relatingto procurement: (1) MOHFW capacity in
 managingprocurement, (2) the use of UNagencies for procurement, and (3) local versus
 internationalprocurement.

2.21       MOHFW Capacity: UnderFPHPmost procurement was carriedout bythe
 specialized UNagencies, such as UNFPA andUNICEF. Inline with the SWAP
philosophy o f a government-led program andmerginggovernment and donor finances,
HPSP envisaged responsibility for procurement shifting to MOHFW following the
Bank's procurement guidelines. However, there was inadequateplanningat the design
stage for this increase inresponsibilities. There was no overall procurement plan inplace
at the time o f approval, and insufficient attention to the needto buildMOHFW capacity
inthis area. Theresultwas that theprocesswas lengthyandprocedures were not
followed correctly, so that Bank staff checkingbiddingdocuments frequently referred
themback to government. Onaccount o fthese problems itwas nearlytwo years after
project effectiveness that the first procurements were made under HPSP,15creating a
widespread impression that the IDAprocurement systemi s itself inherently slow.'6 The
situation has improved substantially since then, with the majority o fbids receiving at
most minor modifications which do not delay the procurement process; fewer than five
percent are referredback on more serious grounds such as too narrow a technical
specification. In2003 GOBissued new Public Procurement Regulations, which are very
similar to the Bank's procedures, with standard biddingdocuments which are by and
large the same as those o fthe Bank.However, highstaff turnover amongst MOHFW
procurement staff continues to be a problem, as it does inother units, with as much as 50


15. The result was that actual health spending fell below that budgeted inthe early years o f HPSP (whereas
under FPHP it has typically beenmarginally higher than budgeted), because o funder-utilization o f aid
resources (PublicExpenditure Review, 2003: 68).
16. Infact a study done comparing Bank and government procurement procedures found the former to take
a little less time.

                                                         17


percent staff turnover each year." Nonetheless, the fact that under HPPP all procurement
 was beinghandled by government represented a considerable improvement incapacity.

 2.22     MOHFW logistics staffstill complain ofthe slowness ofprocurement, though
 they are very clear that it is to bepreferredto UNprocurement bothbecausethey are
 more incharge andbecauseo fthe cost savings they can realise. This perceivedproblem
 i s partly a PR failure by the Bank to have people understandthat properly processed ICB
 can sometimes take 8-10 months, thoughthere may be some limited scope for
 streamliningprocedures,'* or to keepMOHFW staff adequately informedwhendelays do
 arise. The fact that procurement takes this long should not be aproblemprovidedthere i s
 adequate forward planning o f supplyneeds.

 2.23     UNProcurement: UNagenciesstatethat theywill act asprocurement agentsin
the absenceofgovernment capacity to executethis hnction, thoughwith aneye also to
 developing that capacity. The practice on the ground i s somewhat different.Despite the
presence o fprocurement capacity inMOHFW, agencies such as UNFPA continue to be
involved inprocurement. This involvement i s not issue free. UNprocurement i s costly,
with MOHFW procuring at a cost ofup to 30 percent less than UNFPA. There are two
reasons for such discrepancies. First, UNFPA procurement carries a service charge o f 5
percent, reflecting inpart the higher salaries o fUNprocurement staff compared to those
o fMOHFW staff, althoughthey are doing the samejob. Second, UNFPA does not award
contracts on a competitivebasis but selects from a list o f eligible suppliers. There i s also
a conflict o f interest between UNFPA's role as a donor and a supplier.''

2.24      Localprocurement: Bangladesh has a world class pharmaceutical industry,
meetinginternationalstandards inproduction. But pharmaceutical products for the health
projects are procuredinternationally, not inBangladesh, partlybecauseoral
contraceptives, which account for a large share o fprocurement, are not produced in
country. But a second reason i s that the move to the SWAP means very large orders,
whereas individualpr,ojectsmeant smaller orders. Local firms do not have the scale o f
productionto be eligible for these large orders. But infact there was little local
procurement under FPHP either, inthat case on account o fthe reliance under that project
on procurement by UNspecialised agencies.




17. The PAD for HNPSP includes a condition that staff should remaininpost for five years, but there is
little scope for enforcing this. Training i s given on a quarterly basis, which somewhat mitigates the
problem, as shown by the fact that under HNPSP the first procurements were completed less than one year
after effectiveness.
18. Ministrystaff say that they have hadto change all their procedures to meet IDA Guidelines, could not
the Bank streamline its Guidelines to meet Bangladesh's needs.
19. During 2005 UNFPA was been arguing with GOBthat there was a serious contraceptive shortage,
which Bank staff were convincedwas not the case (UNFPA's figures ignored supply already inthe
pipeline). With this apparently flawed argument, UNFPA urged government to use US$ 12 milliono fpool
funds for UNFPA contraceptive supply, and that contracts inthe pipeline under IDArules be cancelled,
even where bids had already beenreceived. UNFPA stood to gain US$600,000 from such a move. Once
UNFPAjoined the pool under HNPSP created a clear organizational conflict o f interest.

 Disbursement Procedures

 2.25    Although a SWAP, HPSP didnot fund the government budgetby mixingdonor
 and government funds. Donor funds, including the pool, were stillheldinspecial
 accounts, as hadbeenthe case with projects but with the important difference that
 MOHFWcould access the whole US$2.8 billionwithout havingto seek Ministryof
 Planning andECNEC approval on a project-by-projectbasis. Since HPSP useda familiar
 system o f special accounts, no especial disbursementproblems occurred. This is not so
 under HNPSP, where funding does now flow through government systems, the
 procedures involving Central Accounts Office (CAO). A tiny proportion (0.2 percent) o f
 the money available has beendisbursed, which staff o fMOHFW's Financial
 Management Unitattribute to lack o f familiarity with the requiredprocedures on the part
 o f CAO staff. This problem i s similarto that encountered inprocurement under HPSP,
 and might require gap filling TA whilst the gap i s closed. Line Directors also complain o f
 the system o f WAYby which they must first spend andthen be reimbursed.But they do
 not have funds to spend, and the size o f advance available i s too low to allow anybut
 marginal activities, so, they claim, the system prohibits spending.

 Monitoring andEvaluation

 2.26   Monitoringprojects with manypartnersand very many activities i s a major
 challenge. Was it feasible to monitor all 66 sub-components o fFPHP? Giventhe size and
 complexity o f the project, monitoring was built into the project usingthe MOHFW MIS
 systems. The Family PlanningMIS was well establishedbythe endo fFPHP. Healthis a
more complex sector and less progress was made. Donor supervision missionthus had
unevendata on which to draw. Supervision was coordinated amongst donors withtwo
joint missions each year. These were large, multi-donor missions; the donor team for the
mid-termreview had51people. Having such large teams providedthe possibility of
covering the whole project; the report from each supervision missionincluded an annex
with a table givingarow to eachofthe 66 sub-components stating implementationstatus
andissues. However, the missiontimetable shows that up to eight sub-components were
reviewedina single two hour meetingwith the ProjectDirectors (PDs). A 15 minute
meetingwith the PD i s clearly very light supervision. Smaller specialized teams were
occasionally fieldedto monitor specific components, but these missions were not that
frequent. At the end ofFPHP the consortiumcommissioned an evaluation which
reviewedprogress on all 66 components. Overall the M&E system under FPHPwas
satisfactory, ifillustrating the problems o f monitoring a largeprogramwith many sub-
components, and the M&E structure laid the basis for that adopted under HPSP.

2.27    Whilst not formally part ofthe supervision process, another important activity
was that Bank staffwere askedto review the government's Three Year Rolling
InvestmentPlan, enabling staffto check consistency with plannedproject activities. Not
only could it be checked that planned activities were reflectedinthe planbut also that
government was committing the level of resources that hadbeen agreed. The Bank also
identified"low priority projects" which were dropped fromthe financing program.

2.28    HPSPhad a sound modelfor monitoring, though there were drawbacks in
implementation. Monitoringwas based on an Annual Performance Review (see para.

                                                     19


 2.16). The indicator review for the APR presentedthe most recent data available, data
 quality, measurement issues andmatters arising from performance, utilizing indicators
 across the logframe. The designof the monitoring systemfor the Bangladeshhealth
 program can beheldup as a bestpractice model for monitoring a SWAP.But there were
 problems inimplementation. First, once the project cells inMOHFW were closed
 responsibility for managingthe APR passedto HPSO, with a consequent loss o f
 ownership ingovernment. The APR i s seen by many as an exercise for the benefit of
 donors, with scant evidence o f an effective feedback loop into sector management by
 government. Second, whilst the APR itself stayed at the level o f sectoral strategy, donors
 were also involvedinthe review o fthe AOPs, and throughthis mechanism became
 closelyinvolvedinday-to-day issues o f sector management: one independent annual
 review accuseddonors or trying to "out micromanage" each other. Properlyused, the
 APR systemwould have kept donor attention on matters ofpolicy, but they havebeen
 drawn into detailed issues o fprocess matters such as disbursementprocedures. Third,
 there were significant problems inthe healthand family planningMIS for much o f
 HPSP. Hence the Ministry's own data generation systems were not a significant source o f
 data for the APR, drivinga further wedge between government and the content o f the
reports. Finally, the system covered monitoringbut not plansfor evaluation. Despite the
 excellent design o fthe M&Esystem, andthe commendable features that were put in
place, the performance o f M&Eas a whole under HPSP mustbe considered only
moderately satisfactory.


GovernanceIssues

2.29     Corruption i s said to be endemic inBangladesh, with the country appearing at the
bottom o f Transparency International's ranking o f corruption in 159countries.2oThe
health sector i s not exempt from these issues, the problemmanifesting itself inthe
following ways: (1) charging o f unofficial fees (Le. bribes) to receive services inpublic
facilities; (2) procurement malpractice; and (3) absenteeism. The extent to which these
problems hinder performance i s open to question, since the country i s recognizedas
having one o fthe most successful family planningprograms inthe world, andthe same is
now said o f the more recent TB program. Moreover, it i s claimed that governance
problems are not restricted to government, with allegations beingheard regardingboth
NGOs andDPs."

2.30     A 2005 household survey conductedbyTransparency Internationalfound that:22

     0   Over a quarter (26.4 percent) o f out-patients hadto pay bribesto doctors for
         receivingmedical treatment at the public hospital, averaging 60 taka per visit.23

the NGO sector.

           percent) hadto pay an average o f 516 taka for an X-ray, and 60 percent o f
          patients who didpathologicaltest hadto pay 410 taka as bribes.

 2.31      Fraudulent practices are proxiedby audit observations, though o f course mis-
 procurement also occurs from genuine errors arising from lack o f familiarity with the
 Bank's requirements.Thehealthprojects havebeen subject to a largenumber of audit
 observations. At the time FPHP closed there were 7 outstanding observations from the
 ThirdProjectand45 from the Fourth. HPPPhadincurred 50 audit observations bythe
 end o f 2003. The Central Medical Maintenance Unit (CMMU) and Central Medical
 SuppliesDepartment (CMSD) are associatedwith anunusuallyhighlevel o f
 observations. The high level o f audit observations for these projects cannot merelybe the
 result o f inexperience, but also likelyreflects corrupt                      There are allegations o f
 pay-offs along the supply chain from CMSD, through the civil surgeon down to upazilla
 stores. There is certainly a documented discrepancy betweenwhat i s suppliedat the top
 endofthe system andwhat comes out insupplies to the public, which canbeattributed to
 pilfering.

 2.32     The lack o fmedicalpersonnel inrural clinics i s a product o f two factors, high
 vacancy levels, as it i s difficult to attract skilledpersonnel to positions away from major
 urbancenters, and absenteeismamongst those who do accept such appointments. The
 overall vacancy rate i s 26 percent, but 41 percent for doctors. Where there i s an
 appointment, the overall rate o f absenteeismi s 35 percent, but again over 40 percent for
 doctors, being as highas 74 percent for doctors attached to UpgradedFamilyWelfare
              Health workers were far more likelyto be absent inthe afternoon, since they
carry out private practice at this time. One factor behindabsenteeism i s the common
practice o f doctors seeking posts inrural areas, collectingthe resettlement allowance, but
thennot takinguptheirpost and seeking another reassignment after some months.

2.33      Until recently, many o f these issues were not openly addressedina formal
manner by the Bank or other DPs: neither the FPHP S A R nor the HPPP PAD use the
term `corruption', and the word `governance' appearsjust three times inthe over 100


23. This figure is higher than estimates from other sources. A more common practice appears to be that a
brief free consultation has to be followed up witha later consultation with the same doctor inhis or her
private practice.
24. A review o f audit observations inthe early years o fFPHP shows the following four problems to be the
most common: funds collected from sale o f tender documents not deposited with government, being unable
to produce vouchers, funds paid to an agency but the planned activity hadnot taken place, and unauthorized
expenditures. Eacho f these may be indicative o f corrupt practices, but each may also reflect weaknesses in
accounting systems andor delays inimplementation.

Facilities" Policy Research WorkingPaper 3065, Development ResearchGroup, World Bank, Washington

 page HPPP PAD, though not inany o f the contexts mentionedhere.26Nor is there any
 mention o f the problems o fbribery, mis-procurement or absenteeism.

 2.34      The main donor response for most o f the period covered by this assessment can be
 seen as side-stepping the issue byretaining parallel systems andtrying to ensure that
 `their activities' are not affected. Despite the SWAP ideal o f financing government
 programs, HPSP created the PCC and CMUinMOHFW, used a Bank-managed pool
 rather than provide sector budget support, and HPSO was heavily involved inday-to-day
 monitoring o f procurement (rather than relying on periodic audits) and other process
 issues. Donors became involved indiscussing the details o f AOPs (agreeing actions that
 were not acted on) rather than staying at the level of strategy, or developing strategy to
 address the corruption problems.

 2.35      This situation has changed inrecent years, with the Bank taking a more proactive
 position on governance issues, startingwith raising governance duringdiscussions
 around liftingthe 2003 suspension. A first response was that government agreed to
 commission a public expenditure tracking study,A number o f documents have been
 produced as a basis for policy dialogue, such as the reports on absenteeism and that on
various aspects o f governance, both cited above. Carryingout such analytic work is
 standard entry point on reform issues, but this process is still at the early stages. It can be
 expected to be carried forward given the prominence o f governance issues inthe Country
Assistance Strategy. Inthe meantime formal measures have been instituted with respect
to mis-procurement. There were a large number o f unsettled audit observations from
HPSP. Settlement o f these was a matter for negotiation for HNPSP (50 percent o f the
value hadto `settled). The last observationwas settled inDecember 2005 inresponse
HNPSP disbursements being heldup untilthis was done. Moreover, agreement has now
been reached that government employees shall be subject to disciplinary action inproven
cases o f corrupt activities resulting inmis-proc~rernent,~~However, such cases are rare,
since the standards o f proofrequired by the Bank's legal department are very rigorous.
Hence inthe majority o f cases mis-procurement can be observed, but the strong suspicion
o f corrupt practice not pursued. Nonetheless the Bank did canceljust over US$ 1million
from three projects, o f which HPPPwas one, inNovember 2005 as a result o f evidence o f
collusive practices.    28




26. The governance problems identifiedinthe PAD are political resistance to reforms such as unification
and hospital autonomy (HPPP PAD: 15).
27. Normal practice is for the government to have to repay the funds incases o f mis-procurement, but the
Bank does not take a position on action against the responsible officials, so there i s little incentive for such
activities.
28. This case hadbeen referred to the Bank's formal investigationdepartment (INT). Itwas observed that
this process was very lengthy and so notpracticalfor the large number o fobservations inmostprojects.

Reflections on the SWAP Experience

A government owned strategy?

2.36      Today, health strategy inBangladesh appears increasingly donor driven. The SIP
for HNPSPwas prepared by external consultants hiredgovernment for the purpose (with
Japanesemoney), rather thanbeinginthe context o fthe planor preparedby ministry
working groups as hadbeendone previously. The strategy for HPSS was a government
document, but with considerable donor influence, the basic parameters havingbeen set at
a CGmeetinginParis in 1995.DPs currently express concerns over the quality o f
documents produced by MOHFW and so it might be concluded that lack o f government
capacity has required.donorsto assist inidentifyingstrategy.

2.37      But the argument that government lacks capacity seems a bit odd when
considering the historical experience. The earliest programs did take place within a
government-defined framework, namely the FiveYear Plans. The First Five Year plan
was written by a small group o fBangladeshis called uponby government. For the Second
Plan, the government took the leadininvitingdonors to provide technical inputs inan
exercise that ledto the secondproject. Later, Bangladesh ledthe world inestablishing an
essential drugspolicyinthe early eighties (theNational DrugsPolicy of 1982), despite
opposition from the UnitedStates and, later, the WorldBarkz9This policy helpedboth
create the large pharmaceutical sector inthe country andmake essential medicines
available at low-cost. Clearly at that time the Bangladeshi government hadboththe
capacity andwill to implementan imaginative and difficult healthpolicy. So why i s it
that today external consultants are usedto write the country's strategies?

2.38      There are anumbero f reasons, many to do with the changing role playedbythe
DPsS3'   The nature ofthe aidrelationship around the world changed inthe 1980swith the
advent o f structural adjustment, with DPs increasingly seeing their role as influencing the
policy environment. InBangladesh this shift corresponded with the start o fmilitary rule.
The end o f elections meant that government was less not concerned with how its policies
affected popularity at the polls: tax payers hadno formal means o f expressingtheir
concerns. Anyhow, donors rather thantaxpayers provided a large share o f government
revenue, so the voice o f each individual donor carried considerable weight. Hence
accountability was shiftedaway from the people toward the donors. Meanwhilethe
numberofaidprojects was growingrapidly, so that there were literally manyhundredsof
aid projects. The time o f government officials was thus spent onproject procedures and
catering for visiting missions rather than the business o f deliveringgovernment services.
The incentivestructure withingovernment favored seekingproject appointments, for
their salary supplementsandperksof transport andoverseastravel. At themacro level,


29. In 1993 the head o f the Bank's Industryand EnergyUnitinDhaka wrote to government stating that the
protective measures under the DrugPolicy should be liberalized. The Bank's health staff were not
consulted, learning o f the letter from the newspaper. A new letter was sent modifying the Bank's position.
See Zafrullah Chowdhury (1996) ThePolitics of Essential Drugs. Themakings of a successful health
strategy: lessonsfrom Bangladesh. Dhaka: University Press Limitedfor more discussion o f the incident.
30. The arguments inthis paragraphdraw onresponses from a number o f sources. The first two points are
directly attributable to Professor Rehman Sobhan.

                                                      23


 the incentives are for the government to agree with the donors since this will securethe
 aid funds. The donors know exactly what theywant, so why not let them write it?Any
 conditions won't be enforced, and government will carry on makinggenuinepolicy
 decisions without consultation, as was the case with the recent decision to undertakea
 major expansion o f curative care.31Finally, it i s generally conceded that the quality o f
 senior public sector workers has declined as the more capable have been driven out by
 the increasinglypoliticizednature o f government employment.


 Coverage: what's in and what's out?

 2.39      SWAPSare tornbetweenthe needto be all-inclusive and avoiding over-
 complexity. The need'to avoid an over-complex project design i s a perennialtheme in
 IEGevaluations, but inattempting to cover thewhole sector, SWAPSnecessarily appear
 complex. This point remains an unresolved, andpossibly irresolvable, dilemma. But there
 are also more practical points regardingHPSP as to what was inand what was out.

 2.40      Though HPSP i s complex it can still be seen as having left things out. The two
most glaringomission are the urbanand for-profit private sectors. MOHFW i s
responsible only for health services inrural areas, the Ministryo f Local Government
beingresponsible for primary health inurbanareas. The SWAP covers the Ministry
rather than the sector, so urbanhealthis not part o fthe program. This i s certainly a
departure from the "SWAP ideal". More importantly, it may result indisparitiesinthe
level and quality o f service provision, with the rapidly growing urbansector lagging
giventhe highlevels of fundingavailable through the DPprograms for rural health.32
Whether this i s or i s not the case i s not known since the issue has not beenon the radar
screen o f the donors.

2.41      HPSPincludeda component for programs implementedbyNGOs, andtheir other
components which work with NGOs, notably TB activities. But the for-profit private
sector, both traditional andmodern, is ignored. Betweenthemthese account for over 60
percent o f service provision inrural areas, so an inclusive approach can illafford to
ignore them. Some other parts o fthe healthcare system also fell outside the SWAP.
WHO (2004) claims that the TB programhas suffered from its lack o frecognition inthe
HPSP logframe. UNFPAretainedparallel financing inpart becauseunmarriedpeople
have no access to the government reproductive health services supported by HPSP.33

2.42      Finally, two areas were "taken out" o f the program: HIV/AIDSandnutrition. It
was felt by the Bank that HIV/AIDSwas inadequately reflectedinthe strategy and given
insufficient attention by GOB.Hence a HIV/AIDsproject was initiated which i s a
separateproject with its own financing andproject structure. There i s a conflict between

31,District hospitals and upazilla healthcomplexes are to be increasedin size (from 50 to 100beds, and 38
to 50 beds, respectively). This government decision was not discussed with the donors.
32. There i s a division o f labor amongst the DPs with ADB financing the mainly NGO-implemented Urban
HealthProject (which does not cover all urbanareas) and the rest rural areas.
33. It is not being suggested that UNFPA should have abandoned its program so that all activities could fall
under the SWAP. However this case highlights, as does the case o f HIV/AIDS, the tension between the
ownership ideal o f the SWAP withthe fact that donors may not agree with all government policies.

                                                    24


 having an ESP-based SWAP which has prioritised services, andthenintroducing a
 separate program for something the DPs feel has not received sufficient priority.
 Government hasmaintained that HIVIAIDS can behandledwithin the context o f the
 health sector, which i s a plausible claim, giventhe low prevalence and likely
 transmission channels inBangladesh. Nutrition was also removed, though hasbeen
 reintroducedunder HNPSP, thoughit is not yet clear how this will work.

Donor coordination: who's in and who's out?

 2.43     The Bangladesh health programhas a longhistory ofdonor coordination, a major
 part o f which has beencofinancingo f the Bank's projects, beginningwith the First
 PopulationProject. This highdegree o f cooperation no doubt assistedthe move to a
 SWAP. Some donors have historicallyremained outside ofthese arrangements, notably
 USAIDandthe majorUNagencies (UNICEF, UNFPAandWHO, althoughthese have
 beenexecuting agencies or suppliers), but the SWAPhasbrought them closer. USAID
was a member o fthe consortium, as were the UNagencies. Hence these donors have
 coordinated under the government's strategy, i.e. following under HPSP but not HPPP.
Hence compared to many other countries there i s a highdegree o f coordination, but this
 does not mean that it i s problem free.

2.44      The major issues under HPSP have beenthe relativepositiono fpool andnon-
pool donors and the role playedby HPSO. Donors not contributing to the poolhad a
feeling o f being "second rate partners". Indeed, this was more than a feeling, as they were
openly told that they were observers at some meetings with GOBandshouldnot speak,
andmany decisions were taken inthe HPSO Steering Committee, consisting ofpool
donors only, rather than the wider consortium. Evenas more responsibilities shifted to
the consortium, smaller donors felt their voice was notbeingheard. UnderHNPSP
matters have beenformalized with a voting scheme basedon one member one vote, plus
a share o f votes weightedby contributionto the program, though inpractice most
decisions are made by consensus.

2.45     HPSO is situated inthe Bankoffice, though actuallyinan annex to the main
building,givingit some, though not much, se~aration.~~           Giventhe early problemswith
procurement and disbursement, HPSO became heavily engaged inthese issues inthe first
two years o f the program, increasing its identification as being a "Bank office". Onthe
other hand, Bank staff felt that HPSO's structure allowed for donor "interference" in
Bankaffairs.35Whilst someDPshave criticizedthe closeness ofHPSOto the Bank,the
Bankwas giventhis responsibilitypreciselyso the consortiumcoulddraw onthe Bank's
strong technical expertise. Despite this, HPSO staff didnot have a close relationshipwith
the rest o fthe Dhakaoffice, For example, there were other skills neededat the time o f
suspension: these were available but not drawn upon. This problem was exacerbated by
the fact that the Bank did not have a HNP specialist inDhaka separate from HPSO,
though o f course this expertise was available inheadquarters. Such a staff member,


34. The Bank office has moved to a new building since the end o fHPSP.
35. The Bank staff stationed inHPSO were interviewedby a selection committee including the pool
donors, so the line of authority appeared ambiguous.

                                                      25


situated inthe mainBank office, rather than the HPSO annex, would have provided a link
with other Bank staff, andamore strategic vision comparedto the day-to-day
management issues that HPSO got drawn into, andhelpedmaintain a separation between
the Bank andmanagement o fHPS0.36

2.46     Has the SWAP reduced transaction costs? There were 22 AOPs, compared to the
66 sub-components o fFPHP. Hence it may bewondered ifthe transaction cost savings in
terms o f staffburdencan be that great.37These savings                 substantial for two reasons.
Firstthe 22 AOPs cover notjust the 66 projects, but also the 60 oddpreviouslyoutside of
FPHP. More importantly, the move to a SWAP broughtwith it the important systemic
change already mentionedo f now beinga singleproject.

2.47     Savings have also beenrealizedfrom donor coordinationandharmonization.
Interactions with donors are now coordinated, and donors contributing to the pool have
commonreporting requirements.The supervision burdenhas beenreducedby the
introduction o f a single APR involving all donors. The Bank's supervision costs for
HPPP were a thirdthose for FPHP, not becausethere were fewer supervision missions (in
fact there were more), but because they had fewer staff since other DPswere formally
integrated into the supervision structure. However, Bank staff also complainedthat the
fixed supervision budget was too low for such a large, complex project.

2.48     Onthe other hand, transaction costs have not beenreducedby as much as might
have beenthe case because o f continuing parallel structures, partly as donor financing
continued to be separate. Bilateral donors continue to have separate agreements with
government, though there i s little alternative to this unless they were to channel funds
exclusively through the Bank. And donor representatives continue to be heavily involved
inday-to-day aspectsofthe healthsector.

2.49     What should donor officials do? The SWAP philosophy i s that donor officials
shift their attention to issues o f strategy andpolicy rather than day-to-day details o f
project management. This does not appear to have happened under HPSP, with donors
becomingmore involved indetailed discussion o f the increasinglydetailed AOPs. What
were the reasonsfor this?

2.50     One simplereasonis that agency staff located inDhakahave to do something and
their time would not be fully occupied by evenmonthly discussions on strategy and
reading quarterly audit reports. Moreover, many o fthese staffhave spent their careers
overseeingproject implementation, so the temptation to get drawn into these details wil
be strong. From a transaction costs point ofview, simplyhavingmany parties involved n
these discussions can hinderprogress. As long as bilateral agencies continue to have
projects outside the SWAP then these staff can continue intheir traditional role. But for
those whose aid starts to be almost exclusively inthe SWAP, especially ifthrough the
poor, thenremedies to this problemare required. A first possible remedyi s a well-


36. There i s some ambivalence inwriting this. H a d there been a HNP specialist separate from HPSO, there
wouldno doubt be a comment that this arrangement didnot make sense.
37. The ICR raises this same question saying there are 38 AOPs. But the increase from 22 to 38 was under
HNPSP.

defineddivision o flabor betweendonors withinthe sector. The secondis for some
agenciesto be `silent partners', providingresources but not takingan active part insector
management (though they receive reports for accountabilitypurposes). Although there
are no silent partners, Sida has reduced its involvement by no longer having a Health
Advisor inDhaka; there i s one local staffwith the title `Program Manager'.

2.5 1 The irony is that donor officials spenda great deal o f their time discussing matters
they are not particularlyqualifiedto discuss. As health specialists they shouldbefocusing
their skills onmatters ofhealthpolicy, rather than the design andimplementationof
disbursementprocedures. Inprinciple, these routinematters o fprogramimplementation
should be left to the Bank. This does not happen, both for the reasons given above (donor
officials have to do something), but also because the bilaterals apparently do not trust the
Bank to manage these issues. This lack o f trust may partly be continued fallout from the
suspension episode, but also reflects that the Bankitselfi s also leavingtoo much
responsibility for these matters inthe hands o fhealth specialist^.^^

Waspooledfinance a successful financing approach?

2.52      Ofthe original budgetof US$2,895 million, US$ 705 millionwas to come from
the donors, o fwhich US$ 522 million(74 percent the donor total) was to bepool finance
(see paragraph 1.25 above on the workings o f this fund). Of the funds for the pool US$
250 millionwas to come from the Bank, which put all its funds inthe pool, other donors
putting59 percent oftheir funds throughthis channel. Other donors providingparallel
financing are not reflectedinthese figures, so the share o f support through the pool i s
over-stated, but nevertheless still substantial. O fthe US$390.3 million disbursed, the
difference beingaccounted for by (1) EC cancellation o fUS$ 39 million following de-
unification, (2) cancellations resultingfor mis-procurement and, (3) exchange rate
fluctuations at the time o f disbursement.

2.53     This approach worked as planned.MOHFWwas given flexibility inallocatingthe
resources between activities on the basis o fthe agreed AOPs, and financing the full range
o f sector expenditures. Although there were a large number o f audit observations, this
had also beenthe case for the earlier PHP projects, and so cannot be said to be a result o f
pooled finance. The b.udgetsupport approach to financing was a successful aspect o f
HPSP, but this successhasbeen over-shadowed by unification episode.


3.       ACTIVITIESAND OUTPUTS

3.1      BothFPHPand HPPP were large, complex project, so all components are not
dealt with indetail. First, an overview i s giveno f the continued, albeit uneven, progress
inthe expansion offacilities andservice deliveryunderbothprojects. Dataarethen
presented on selected specific activities: community clinics, the TB and leprosy program,


38. Procurement and disbursement specialists were included insome supervision missions, though not as
many as might be expected given the problems being experience. Butprocurement and disbursement
officers do not rank high inthe Bank's hierarchy, and these issues are unlikely to be given a highpriority.

 training, MIS, and the Institute o f Child and Maternal Health. HPSP outputs included a
 series o freforms, which are also discussed.

 ContinuedIncreasesinHealthOutputs: An Overview

 3.2     The IEGimpact evaluation showed how the externally-supported creation o f a
 family planning infrastructure playeda critical role inthe reductiono f fertility described
 above. EPI, providedthrough satellite clinics and national immunizationdays, playeda
 similar role inreducingunder-five mortality. Health outputs have continued to increase,
 and intermediate outcomes, such as contraceptive prevalence and use of antenatal care
 have continuedtheir steady rise throughout the periodo fthe two projects. There were,
 however, disruptions o f service duringHPSP and the creation o f a new tier of service
 deliverywas unsuccessful.

 3.3     FPHP continued to support the expansion of the health and FP infrastructure
 created by the first three projects: 87 FamilyWelfare Centers were constructed, 429
 Rural Dispensaries upgraded, and 10new Upazilla Health Centers established. Many
 other facilities were upgraded (see Annex B for a complete overview). Civil works
 construction targets were mostly met or nearly met. Training was provided to, amongst
 others, female HAS(FHAs) andTBAs. Traditionally FWAswere female, but the health
 equivalent at community level, Health Assistants (HAS)hadbeenmale. With the
increased emphasis on M C Hthis was not appropriate, so 4,500 female FHAswere
recruited and trained under FPHP.

3.4      Inadditionto the numberoffacilities, the scaleofserviceshas also been
expanded. For example, Mother and Child Welfare Centers (MCWCs) began to provide
immunization services,39and the majority (67 out o f 95) have beenequipped to provide
Emergency Obstetric Care, though this i s through a UNFPAproject started outside o f
FPHP. DuringFPHP C-sections at MCWCs increased by 273 percent, and those at
district hospitals increased by 51 percent, the latter partlya result o fFPHP's Thana
FunctionalImprovementPilot Project (TFIPP), though a separateUNICEFproject also
contributedat district level. From 2000/1-04/05 C-sections at MCWCs increased by a
further 188percent (FPMIS data).

3.5      Civil works were less satisfactory under HPPP. The main activity was the
construction o f 16,000 community clinics. The programwas delayed andthen abandoned
before 10,000 hadbeencompleted. The clinics themselves are largely unused. HPSP's
targets related to levels o f access and customer satisfaction. Giventhe disruptions in
service delivery causedby unification(see below), use o f ESP curative services inpublic
facilities actually fell from 13 to 10% between 1999 and 2003, althoughhas since
re~overed.~'Similarly the number ofwomen receivingdoorstep delivery o f family
planning declined, though has also recovered.

39. Operation o f EPIthrough MCWCs is an example o fthe defacto collaboration between health and
family planning at the field level, despite the failure o funification.
40. The former figures are from the Service Delivery Survey (SDS), the subsequent observed increase is
based on the trend data from the facilities surveyed inthe FMPR study.

3.6       Table 5 reports selected intermediate indicators related to the two projects' MCH-
related objectives. As reported above, contraceptive prevalence continued to rise, with a
corresponding fall inthe unmet need for contraception. After a fall inthe rnid-90s'
immunization rates have risen to new highs, and there has been an increase inthe
proportion o f children with diarrhea treated with ORs, though with a very modest
improvement inthe most recent period. There has been slower progress with respect to
maternal health, with steady but modest increases inattended births and those taking
places infacilities, but a better record with respect to expanded coverage o f antenatal
care. The percentage o f deliveries by C-section has risen from a negligible number to 3.5
percent.41Inurbanareas the target o f 15 percent o f deliveries being by C-section has
practically been

41. DHS only collected data on C-sections inthe last two rounds. The FPHP evaluation states that C-
sections inthe early 90s were less than 1percent o f the target o f 15 percent o f all deliveries, i.e. less than
0.15 percent.
42. Urbanareas means the respondent resides inan urban area. Practically all, ifnot all, C-sections take
place inurbanareas regardless o f the place o fresidence o f the respondent. As incomes rise, it i s likely that
a proportion o f C-sections are non-essential, but the data do not allow us to identify this proportion.

 SelectedProjectActivities andOutputs

 Training

3.7      FPHP included a large amount o f training. Onthe family planning side, this
training was carried out throughthe National Institute o fPopulationResearch and
Training (NIPORT), the apex organization for the FWVTIs and RDCs around the country
for training FWVs and FWAsrespectively. There were difficulties ingettingrelease o f
staff from government for training. Deeper problems began to emerge toward the end o f
the project. The target numbersofFWVsandFWAswere reachedbythe mid-90sYso
these very sizeable training facilities beganto operate at low capacity rates (at best 20
percent). Second, there were moves to makeNIPORT an autonomous institution, which
were resisted by staff, a conflict which underminedtheir productivity. Onthe health
service side 27,000 staffwere trained under FPHP's main training sub-component, and
many others under other sub-components. A major initiative was training Female Health
Assistants, as HAShadpreviously beenmale, which was inconsistent with the emphasis
on MCH.

3.8      HPSP also included a great deal o f training for bothhealthand family planning,
butNIPORTwas not usedas the agency for any o fthis training, being amajor reason
why FWVTIs andRDCs operated at very low capacity for nearlyof a decade. NIPORT
was by-passed as a result o fboth the internalproblems mentionedabove, and as another
by-product o fthe tensions createdby the merger, with health staff feeling that NIPORT's
family planningfocus made them ineligiblefor training inthe unifiedprogram. The line
director for training instead passedtraining to district andupazillamanagers who either
conducted training themselves or contracted it to NGOs, who often hadno facilities, and
certainly not the residential facilities requiredfor multi-dayprograms. The quality o f
training i s said to have sufferedas a result. Under HNPSP, NIPORThas beenmade the
line director for training. Although they are now undertakingmidwiferyand SBA
training for FWVs, under-utilization o fFWVTIs remains an issue.

3.9      Training Traditional BirthAttendants (TBAs): Training o f TBAs, started under
the ThirdPHP, was a major component o f FPHP, althoughdiscontinued toward the end
o f the project with the shift o fpolicy infavor o f SBAs. DHS data show that the
proportion o fbirths attended bytrained TBAs steadily increased throughout the period
from 4.3 percent in 1993 to 13.8 percent in2004. IEG's impact study showed that abirth
beingattended by atrained TBA reducestheprobabilityo fneo-natal deathby around 7
per 1,000. Other evidence from Bangladesh shows that trained TBAs are more likelyto
adopt the `four cleans' o f safe delivery than are untrainedones. The IEGreport
acknowledged that the impact o fmaternal mortality will be limited inthe absence o f an
EOC system to which trained TBAs can refer complicateddeliveries. However, as the
data presentedinthis report show, such a system o fEOC is beingput inplace,
reinforcing the message o f the IEGimpact study that abandoning the training o f TBA
was not necessarily the best policy decision: it was already having an impact on infant
mortality, and the expansion o f EOC creates the potential for an impact on maternal
mortality,

 Management Information System

 3.10     Bythe time ofFPHP, a goodMIS systemhadbeendeveloped infamily planning.
 A Logistics MIS(LMIS)was beingdeveloped whichwouldhave helpedensurethe
 smooth supply o f contraceptives. Built uponthe records o f the FWAs, the FP MIS had
 data collectionbuilt into their routine work, and a clear needfor the information
 produced. FWAshad a strong incentive to recorddata, since there were performance
 targets. The situation inhealthwas somewhat different, with the range ofpossible
 indicators more varied andcomplex, and a less clear use for these data from the point o f
 view o fthe healthprofessionals inthe system.

 3.11 Under HPSP the healthand FP were to be unified.A unifiedreporting system was
 designed and the procurement process started. This process was subject to considerable
 delays owing to failures to meetthe IDA Guidelines.Once over that hurdle, attempts to
 implementthe systemmet withresistance from bothhealthand family planning staff.
 However, the UnifiedMIS office initially publishedreports based on earlier data, and,
 prior to being disbanded,bought out the first annual report from the new geographical
 reconnaissance systemwhich hadbeendeveloped.43

 3.12     The current situation is that there are separate MISinhealthand familyplanning.
 So, for example, EOC i s providedinboth MCWCs, which are FP facilities, andUHCs,
 which are healthfacilities. Hence data on the number o f C-sections inthe former i s
 collected bythe FPMIS and those inthe latter by the healthMIS. Butno one i s adding
 upthese two figures to reporttotal C-sections inpublic facilities. There are two possible
 solutions to this situation. One i s to situate the MIS at Ministrylevel rather thaninthe
 two directorates. Ifthis cannot be done,44then a separate MIS coordinationcell at
Ministrylevel shouldbechargedwith this function. However, there appears little demand
within government for MIS data, other than forecasts o f contraceptive demand; it i s
undesirable that changes inthe MIS should be donor driven. Creatingdata systems which
 are demand, not supply, driven requires time to buildup awareness amongst users o fthe
role data can play, andto be clear that systems can provide policyrelevant inf~rmation.~~

Institute of Child and'Materna1Health

3.13     The Instituteo f Child and MaternalHealth has three areas o f activity: training,
patient care andresearch. The idea for I C M Hdates from the early eighties. Japanhad
agreed to fundthe project but withdrew after lengthy delays inthe project approval
process. In 1991the Bank agreed to finance construction o fthe Instituteunder FPHP on


43. The geographical recqnnaissance system was a detailed set o f data collected at union level onhealth,
family planning and aspects o f living conditions (water and sanitation); see GeographicalReconnaissance
Data -2002, UMIS, MOHFW.
44. The fallout from HPSP means it i s still notpossible to propose any form o f "unification". Bothhealth
and FP staff are adamant that healthand FP M I S are necessarily separate activities, though the strongest
reason given is that the former is supportedby WHO and the latter byUNFPA.
45. A current example would the usefulness o f a good manpower planning system, as the healthworkers
trained during the initial establishment o fthe system are approaching retirement, so that replacement
training programs needbe planned for.

conditionthat it became an autonomous institute.46Constructiono f the campus was
completed andthe institute operational by 1998, with patient care provided through out-
patient services at the nearby Jalkuri site since 1994.

3.14     The development o fthe institutewas not trouble free. There were continuing
court cases against I C M Hfrom its acquisition o f 12.6 acres o f landto construct the
campus.47I C M Hemployees resisted the establishment autonomous status. These
disagreements lasted two years (1999-2001) endingwith the removal of the Director,
who hadbeen the keymover inthe founding o fthe Institute. Ittook some years for the
Instituteto regain its focus with a successiono fDirectors. These problems have subsided,
withthe current ExecutiveDirector inpost since 2004, andall areas o f activity-patient-
care, training andresearch - now beingsuccessfully implemented(see Annex D for a
briefoverview).

3-15     The overall assessmenti s that ICMHwas successfully constructed and has
become operational. There i s aproblem o funder-utilization which takes two forms. First,
training facilities are not yet infull use, but there i s a clear upward trend. Second,
questions can be asked as to whether resources are appropriately applied. Giventhe high
level o f qualification o f its staff, ICMHHospital should act as a tertiary facility, but inthe
absence o f a referral systempatients from surrounding areas come with conditions that
could be treated at upazilla level. Similarly, training should focus on senior medical
professionals andtraining of trainers, rather than direct training o fpara-workers.

TBand Leprosy Programs

3.16     The ICR calls TB andLeprosyprograms initiated under FPHP "amongst the most
effective oftheir kindinthe world" (ICR, 1999: iv). Though they accounted for just
under2 percent ofthe totalproject expenditure, these programs, implementedthrough a
government-NGO partnership, made a major contributionto improvedhealth outcomes.




46. The Bank met 58 percent o f the costs and government the remaining 42 percent.
47. As the most densely populated country inthe world, land i s a contentious issue, and there is a high
opportunity cost to constructing under-utilized facilities.

remain. First, despite the substantial rise the case detection rate was still only 30 percent
at the end o f the program; though it has continued to rise it is still well below the target o f
70 percent. Second, NTP was a vertical program, a structure seen to be inconsistent with
the integrated health service delivery envisagedunder HPSP. However, the integration o f
vertical programs into general health services has not always been positive as specialized
technical knowledge i s lost (see Annex E).

3.18        The National Leprosy EliminationProgram o f Bangladeshwas also supported
under FPHP, aiming to detect over 85 per cent o f the estimated cases within 5 years, to
provide multi-drugtreatment to all registered cases, to achieve a cure rate o f 85 percent
andto reduce deformity rate innewly detected cases from 21.4 per cent at the start ofthe
project in 1993 to less than 5 per cent by the year 2000. The estimated prevalence o f
leprosy declined from 13.6 per 10,000 population in 1992 to less than 1per 10,000 since
December 1998, achieving effective elimination o f the disease as a public health problem
two years ahead o f schedule. The deformity rate among newly detected cases declined
from 21.4 per cent in 1993 to 7.9 per cent in 1999. As with TB a factor inthe success o f
the project was a successful partnership between government andNGOs, with both
sectors providing services indifferent areas.

 Community Clinics

 3.19    Under HPSP primary care was to beprovidedthrough 16,000 static clinics,
 staffed by the FWA and the HA. Construction of these clinics was delayed, and less than
 10,OQO completed. More seriously, the utilizationrate was very low. The IMEDstudy
 reported that from 44 clinic visits only nine (20 per cent) were operational. Some clinics
 are now operated byNGOs through a DFID-implemented"Public-Private" scheme which
 provides matching grants to organizations taking on the runningo f clinics. But the
 majority remains non-~perational.~~ didthis happen?
                                            Why

 3.20    There are anumber o fpossible reasons givenwhy the community clinics failed,
 and the truthi s most likely a combination o f these. The first i s that they fell foul o fbeing
 identifiedwithHPSP. Rejectionofunification meant that anything associatedwith HPSP
 also suffered. But it i s also possible that the clinics were political victims intheir own
 right: the new government was happy to have very visible signs o fthe "failure" ofthe
 previous government's efforts lying around the country. Second, it i s widely argued that
 drugs were not available at the clinics, so people didnot come and, consequently, health
 andFPworkers stopped usingthe clinics as abasis for their operations. However, the
 clinics were providing fiee drugs at community level, so demand would behighand it i s
 little wonder they rapidly ran out o f stock. A final reasoni s that the quality o f services
 was generally insufficient to attract patients, who went either to traditional healers or
 direct to secondary facilities ifthey felt the need.Healthassistantsreceiveda negligible
 amount o f training (three weeks) to enable them to deliver ESP, which was insufficient to
provideproper services.5o

 Reformsunder HPSP

Macroeconomic Stability and Budget Context

3.21     Macro stability was not included inthe objectives o f the projects under review.
Butthe idealfor a SWAP is astable macro environment ensuredthrough awell-managed
fiscal program, utilizing a MediumTerm Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for
consistency between sector spendingplans and overall budget limits.The country lacked
a MTEF duringHPSP, though one i s now beingdeveloped. Infact, the ThirdYear
Rolling InvestmentPlans under FPHP played a similar role to that intendedfor the
MTEF. The country has nonetheless preservedmacro stability: since 1990 Bangladesh
has achieved areasonable growthperformance combinedwith low inflation, the rate o f
price increase reaching a low o f less than 2 percent inthe early part o f this decade.




49. The ICR states that 8,600 have been handed over to NGOs; but the general impressionis that most are
not operating. Even those selected by local MOHFW staff for the mission field visits were not operational.
50. This problemwas identified ina memo included inthe "HPSP preparationpackage", stating that the
programwas heavy on little trained field workers and short o fbetter trained paramedics, but that the plans
for HPSP would not redress this imbalance.

 Unijcation and Suspension

 3-22     Whether health and family planning should be combined or delivered separately
 has been a perennial issue inBangladesh. The Bank led donors inurgingthe creation o f a
 separate Family Planning service at the inception o fthe First Population Project, but later
 changed its position and urgedre-unification, including under the FourthProject. The
 original plan to have this structural reform as a part o f FPHPwas shelvedwhen it was felt
 not possible given the political context o f a new government ina new, but possibly
 unstable, democratic system. Instead a reorganization study was to be undertaken, but
 suffered serious delay and was finally made redundant bythe development o f HPSP.
 Two management units were established and FPHP, but neither functioned effectively
 andwere closedprematurely.

 3.23     Inthe run-upto HPSP the plan for unification was developedby a GOBHigh
 Level Committee. Under this proposal, services were first integrated at the field level
 (upazilla and below), proceeding next to district level and finally national level to achieve
 a fully unified service. Inaccordance with these plans, HPSP included specific activities
 such as a unified M I S and BCC.

 3.24    Unification never got further than the upazilla, the new government `de-unifying'
 the service. However, many aspects o f service delivery continue to be integrated defacto
 at field level. For example, FP staff provide EPIservices through MCWCs, andthe FWA
 and HA holdjoint sessions inthe community clinic. A 2002 report from one upazilla
 states that whilst issues inthe management structure remain to be resolved `integration at
the grassroots level happened, both psychologically and functionally'               .51Supporters o f the
reform say that service provisionwas boostedby the reform, but there are no data to
support this position, and so detractors are equally able to claim the opposite. For
example, the HPSP evaluation report by IMED says that the rivalry created by unification
was bad for service delivery.52 In particular the move away from doorstep delivery to
facility-based services was seen as very harmful, and called by one Bank respondent "a
monumental                     Inprinciple, these two aspects o freform(unification, andone
stop service) are separable, and this separation matters as the former is now a political
non-starter, whereas the latter may be put back on the agenda. More convincing
arguments against the success o freformrelated to the absence o f a clear management
structure once the reforms began.

3.25     Critics o f unification say that it was a mistake to proceed bottom-up, since the
bifurcated management structure complicated the command chain. Field-level staff
confirm that there were difficulties instaff management and accountability at that time.
Butdefenders o fHPSP point out that alternative means o funificationwere discussedby


51. "Assessment o f HPSP at upazilla level and below inBegumgonj, Noakhali", mimeo. This
comprehensive report was prepared by the UHFPO apparently on his own initiative.
52. Earlier drafts o fthe IMEDreport came out infavor o funification, presenting evidence that it was
working, but later versions o f the report were substantially revised.
53. Defenders o f reform say that there was never any order to stop doorstep services, but that FP staff were
given this order unofficially to undermine the program. Data show that there was a dramatic reduction in
these services, with a halving of the number o f women receiving doorstep services from 1999to 2003.

                                                       35


 the committee. A bottomup approach was decided onprecisely becauseit was
 recognized that it would take time to work withthe Ministryo f Establishment to merge
 the cadre at the upper levels. However, they argue that the whole processwould have
 been completed within a reasonable time and that these problems would have been
 temporary ones hadnot unificationbeenheldup by court challenges by individual FP
 staff. The matter went from the HighCourt to the Supreme Court, who eventually ruled
 infavor o funification. Butthe changeingovernment changedthe situation, withthe
 reformsbecomingidentifiedwith the now oppositionparty.54Opponents o fthe reform
 mobilized support, allegedly raising substantial financial contributions from FP staff to
 support their position. Withthe politicization of the issue, the new secretary and minister
 also took a stand against reform, and the service was de-unified.

 3.26     The bilateral agencieswere dividedon how to respond to this situation, but a hard
 line position emerged, identifiedwith the Bank and the USAID the chair o f the
 consortium at that time. The decision to suspendwas taken, some bilateral agency staff
 feelingthat there was inadequate discussion ofpossible alternatives or consultation over
 the final decision, thoughBank staffrecallthat at the time bilaterals backedthe decision.
 Bank-MOHFW relations becamevery sour with no dialogue takingplace. The health
 specialists inthe Bank possibly put too muchpressure on the Minister o fHealth, rather
 than realizing that the blockage was also inthe Ministryo f E~tablishment.~~High-level
 staff from three bilateral agencies (Dutch, Sida andDFID) came to help resolve the issue.
 This group enabled two keysteps to be undertaken: MOHFW andthe donors restarted a
 dialogue, and GOBwas invitedto join the consortium. Followingthese steps it was
 agreed that government could submit a revisedstrategy inthe light o f de-unification. The
 episode was concluded when the Bank's new country director liftedthe suspension as
 one o fher first acts on arriving inDhaka. But the experience left a bitter aftertaste, with
 both continuingtension between the two directorates and a feeling that GOB-donor
relations received a considerable set back.

 3.27     It is easywith hindsight to say that things might have gone better. ButBank staff
 at the time had goodreasonsto be confident about the success o f reform. It had clear
ownership at the top, the specific proposal coming from a GOBHighLevel Committee,
with support from the highestlevels o f government. Healthstaffwere ina favor, as were
thevast majority ofthe lower reachesthe FPprofessionas theywouldbe shiftedfrom the
development to the recurrent budget, giving thempermanent government positions and
the benefits that entails. Oppositioncame from a smaller, butnonetheless powerful,
group o fmiddle to highranking FP staff. Therewere other losers from HPSP, who
therefore had some interest inthe reforms failing. These includedinthe Ministryo f
Planning, who lost power inthe move from aproject to a SWAP, and, it i s claimed, some
o f the non-pool donors. It canbe claimed with some fairness that more work could have
beendone to containthe discontent ofthese groups. A second shortcoming was the
failure to work directly with the relevant government agency (the Ministryo f

54. Identification o f the reforms with the Awami League (AL) was reinforcedby the Secretary responsible
for the design o f HPSP standing as an AL candidate inthe 2001 elections.
55. The Ministry o f Establishment hadbeen earlier involved inthe preparations for the SWAP, including
unification, the Joint Secretary going on a study tour o f African SWAPS.It was through MoE's
involvement that some FP staff were switched from the development to recurrent budgets.

Establishment) inimplementing the reform. This i s o f course not the area o f expertise o f
health specialists, but they should have recognizedthis fact and incorporated appropriate
 skills ifnot at the Dhaka office, then at least into supervision missions. The decisionto
 suspendcan also bequestioned: it created an apparent division amongst donors andnon-
pool donors continued to disburse, and didnot produce the desiredresult. Instead it
created an impression that the Bankwas inflexible and confrontational. Whereas
unification failed, normally divergentvoices on the Bangladeshi side became unifiedin
standing up to the Bank, creating fallout which has causedthe unification question to be
 shelvedfor manyyears to come. Manyother activities becametaintedby association with
HPSP and suffered as a result.

Decentralization and Hospital Autonomy

3.28     Hospital management was to be reformedineleven pilot hospitals, includingboth
newmanagement systems andhospital autonomy, enabled inpart by the retention ofuser
fees. Although training took place, the new systemswere not implemented. Inparticular,
there has not beenevena modest delegation o f authority to hospitalmanagement or
development of local accountability. The proposed HospitalBillto allow autonomy has
made little progress.

3.29     Hospital autonomy i s an example o f an activity which most likely suffered as part
ofthe fall out from the unificationexperience. Likeunification, this was apolitically
difficult policy. As already argued, the Bank spent all its political capitalpushingfor
unification, leaving it,unableto push for progress on hospital autonomy.

Introduction of a Sector WideApproach

3.30     Incontrast to theunsuccessful experience withunification andthe lack of
progress with respect to hospital autonomy, considerable progress was made inthe
development o f a sector approach. The SWAP lacked some features o f an `ideal SWAP'.
Table 6 summarizes how HPSP fared against desiredcharacteristics o f a SWAP as stated
bythe Bank's Operations Policy andCountry Services (OPCS). However, the OPCS site
also states that "there'are no strict pre-requisites that must bemet inorder for an approach
to be called a SWAP. Rather, the SWAP is characterized more importantly by the
intentionand the directiono f intervention over time." The experience inBangladesh can
indeedbe seen as such an evolutionaryprogress, moving from highdegrees o f
coordinationunder the earlier Population and Health Projects to creating a SWAP
framework under HPSP, which i s beingfurther developed under HNPSP.Indeed, many
now see HPSP as havingbeena pilot stage for HNPSP. The advantages o f a SWAP over
aproject approach are clearly recognized amongst both government and DPs. Despitethe
badname o f HPSP, there is no talk at all o f going back to a project approach; GOB
discourages stand alone projects outside o fthe SWAP.

                                               MOHFW, rather than the health sector, and so excludes

4.          OUTCOMESAND RATINGS

Relevance

4.1         The objectives ofbothprojects are highlyconsistent with the overall strategies of
government and the Bank. FPHP was aligned with the country's Fif'th Five Year Plan,
taking its quantitative targets from that document. The I-PRSP, issued inMarch 2003,
includes as one o f its goals to "ensure effective and equitable access to health services to
all", stating that "the control o f communicable diseases and improvedmaternal and child
healthto reduce highchild and maternal mortality remains the highestpublic priorities".
"Consolidating gains inhumandevelopment" i s the first "line o f attack on poverty" inthe
Bank's 2003 Country,Assistance Strategy (CAS).

                                                       38


 4.2       Whilst, relevant at the overall level, some specific points about relevance can
 nonetheless be made. First, the objectives o f FPHPwere rather over-extended, including
 the reduction o f maternal mortality and nutritionobjectives which were not realistic as
 there were few activities related to achieving these objectives. Second, HPPP aimed to
 both improve service delivery whilst at the same time undertaking a substantial
 reorganization, which proved extremely disruptive. Tackling both at once was somewhat
 unrealistic. Whilst unification and decentralization and establishing the ESP were all
 desirable steps, the net result was that none o f these were achieved. A phased approach
 givinggreater chance'ofsuccess to any one o fthem would therefore have been
 preferable. Third, the I-PRSP supports "health for all" andthe project objectives and
 targets relate to health outcomes for Bangladesh as a whole. But, as noted above,
 MOHFW is responsible only for health inrural areas, andthe projects only covered those
 areas. Moreover, public services account for a minority o f service provision, with the
private sector (NGOs,for profit, and traditional) being more important but which had
 limited engagement inthe two projects. This i s least so for NGOs, who were involved in
both preparation and service delivery, though not on the scale envisaged. But the project
withdrew from training traditional TBAs, and did little with the modem for-profit private
 sector.

Efficacy

 ContinuingBangladesh's Successful TrackRecord

4.3        Inthe 25 years following independence, Bangladeshachievedrapidreductions in
both fertility and under-five mortality. The decline inthe TFR continued, albeit at a
slower pace, duringthe 1990sYs6          as contraceptive prevalence continued to rise (Figure
3b). The decline inunder-five mortality was most rapid inthe 1980s, matching the period
inwhich the immunization programbecame established(Figures 3c and3d). The decline
slowed inmost recent years, progress inreducing infantmortality stalling altogether.
Progress inimmunization faltered inthe mid-90sYbut has since recovered. Continued
expansion inimmunization coverage is consistent with the fact that child mortality has
continued to fall, whereas infant mortality, which is more dependent on other medical
services, halted its decline.




56. It is commonly argued that fertility decline stalled (hit a plateau) inthe mid-90s. However, as shown in
IEG's study, this assessmentis a misreadingo fthe data, with severalreasons to believe that the rate
continued to decline.   .

  Objective-related Outcomes

  4.4       Table 7 reports outcome indicators with respect to the main common areas inthe
  objectives o fthe two projects. FPHP achieved lower fertility, higher contraceptive
  prevalence, lower infant and child mortality, a modest reduction inmaternalmortality
  andincreased access to services. Thepicture was moremixedunder HPPP, service use
  fell, e.g. fewer childrenwith ARI or fever were taken to clinics, and infantmortality
  stagnated. But immunization and antenatal care improved, as did fertility, child mortality,
  and maternal mortality.

  Poverty Aspects

  4.5     The project objectives targeted poor menandwomen. Whilst there havebeenno
  specific mechanisms for targeting the poor, the overall design o f the projects didthis in
  two ways: (1) focus on essential health services inrural areas, and (2) expandingpublic
  services at a time when the less poor increasinglyrelied onprivate providers. These
  factors mean that increases inservice coverage will include the poor, often
  disproportionately so. Figure4(a) shows that under-fivemortality has fallen more rapidly

                                                    40


among the poor than the non-poor, so that the ratio o fmortality rates betweenthe two
groups, shownby the dotted line, has declined. The proportiono f children with no
vaccinationhas declined dramatically from around one-thirdto less than 5 percent
(Figure 4b). The increase incoverage has benefitedall groups, far outweighing the
remainingvariations incoverage betweenwealth groups.

 Performance on SpeciJc Objectives

 4.6     Health and family planningoutcomes continued to improve duringthe project,
 although falling short o f the ambitious targets that were set, especially for nutritionwhere
 the project inthe enddid little as a newproject was starting. The recordon specific
 objectives was as follows:

 0    Reduce fertility by increasing the CPR to 45-50 percent: Achieved. The proportiono f
     marriedwomen currentlyusingcontraception was 40 percent in 1991and 50 percent
     in1996/97.

 0   Lower morbidity andmortality inchildrenunder five: Achieved. Inthe five years
     preceding the 1992/93 DHS the under-fivemortality rate was 134 and the infant
     mortality rate 88; inthe five years before 1999/00these figures had fallen to 94 and
     66 respectively. Reliablemorbidity data are difficult to obtain; the data from DHS
     (fever, cough and diarrhoea) show no clear trend.57

 0   Improvematernal care and ensure safer deliveries thereby reducingmaternal
     mortality from the current 6-8 to 4-5 per 1,000 live births: Partially achieved. There
     has been a decline inmaternal mortality, though not to the extent hoped                      Since
     FPHPhadlittle onmaternal healththis is not surprising. There has, however, beena
     rise inEOC.

 0   Reduce disability, morbidity and mortality from commonpoverty-related diseases:
    Achieved. The TB and leprosy programs are notable areas o f success. More generally
    the project supported the continued expansion ofpublic healthservices.

 0  Enhance the nutritional status o fwomen and children: The project didtoo little inthe
    nutritional field to achieve this outcome, these activities beingpickedup by the
    separateBangladesh IntegratedNutrition Project. The main area o f activity was
    VitaminA supplementation, which was successful inraisingcoverage from less than
    50 percent to 80 percent over the life o fthe project.

0   Improve effectiveness and efficiency inthe planningand deliveryofFP andhealth
    services to accelerate the achievement o f the above objectives: Not achieved. There
    were no significant institutionalreforms duringFPHP.


Health and Population Program Project

4.7      Whilst healthoutcomes continued to improve under HPPP, progress was not
uniform, as infant mortality stagnated. To the extent that there were improvements, it i s
less plausibleto claim such a clear link with the project as was the case with previous


57. DHS 92/93 to 96/97 show a reduction inAFU and diarrhoea prevalence, but this trend didnot continue
inthe next two rounds.
58. Whilst the maternal mortality survey showed a MMR of 4 per 1,000 bythe early part of this decade, it
estimated it to have been4.9 per 1,000 a decade earlier, rather than the 6-7 per 1,000 believed when the
target was set. Hence the percentage reduction was less than planned.

                                                      42


projects. The continued provisiono fhealth and family planning services may have
played a role: but many specific components o fHPPP didnot contribute to this.
 Constructionefforts focused on community clinics which are not utilized. Attempts to
reform health services failed, and indeeddisruptedservice delivery: use o f government
 facilities fell andhome visits dropped dramatically. Reductions inservice use may have
 actually contributed to worseninghealthstatus, including the stagnation o f infan
mortality. However, services have since beenrestored- and some services, such as
 satellite clinics for immunization-continued throughout, as shownby the steady rise in
immunizationcoverage. So some activities supported by the program did contribute to
the continued improvement inoutcomes, but those activities where the bulk o fthe money
was spent didnot.

4.8       Performance by specific objectives was as follows:

      Technical support and funding to improve coverage and quality o f essential health
      and family planningservices for vulnerable groups, particularlypoor women and
      children: At best partially achieved. The community clinics failed and utilizationo f
      some public facilities declined inthe unificationperiod (though has since recovered).
      These shortcomings were not because government didnot provide the agreed finance,
      which it did, but because o f the problems inimplementation.59The continued
      improvements inhealthoutcomes and fertility reductioninBangladesh may well
      have been inspite o fHPSPnot becauseof it.

      Support public sector reorganization andreform efforts: Partially achieved.
      Unificationwas unsuccessful. However, the SWAP was successfully established, as
      documented insection 2.

0     Laying the groundwork for broader healthreform: Not achieved. Although the SWAP
      was established, unificationwas reversedand decentralisation reforms were not
      implemented,and limited engagementwith NGOs and, especially, the private sector.

4.9      Insummary, FPHPcontinuedthat lineofcofinancedBankprojects which
successfully helpedconstruct the country's health and family planninginfrastructure.
These services supportedby FPHPhavedirectly contributedto the reductionin
fertility andunder-fivemortality.Bycontrast, HPPPfailedon manyfronts.Reforms
were not implemented and the major infrastructure was not used. However, the SWAP
was successfully established.


Efficiency

4.10     Whilst there i s internationalagreement regardingthe success o f Bangladesh's
family planningprogram, andthe same i s coming to berealizedo f much o f its health

     ~          ~             ~




59. Under HPSP actual GOBspendingwas 99.7 percent o f that planned, compared to 95.2 percent for the
Bank and 79.1 percent for the cofmanciers. Government share o fproject financing has risen fromjust 10
percent during the first two projects to 50 percent under HPSP. The HPSP perfonnance indicator that 65
percent of MOHFW spending should be for ESP delivery was surpassed, reaching approximately 70
percent.

 program, questions might beraised about cost-effectiveness. However, what little
 evidence there i s shows the country fares well on international comparisons. The FPHP
 Evaluationreporteddata on the cost per couple years o fprotection (CYP) by different
 means o f contraceptive delivery. The CYP range ofUS$3-6 per year6' compares
 favorably with the average o fUS$l2-20 inother low and middle income countries.
 IEG's impact study estimatedthat the cost per life savedbyimmunizationwas inthe
 range $80-300 per life saved. It is difficult to get comparable data (many studies consider
 vaccine costs only rather than the cost o fvaccination), but estimates are usually inthe
 thousands o f dollars rather than hundreds.Finally, the FMRP study on the sector updates
 internationalcomparisons made by HEUfor the cost o f inpatient admission and an
 outpatient visit as a percent o f GNP: Bangladesh ranks third and second cheapest
 respectively (FMRP, 2005: 126-127). All available estimates are thus favorable,
 suggestinga good level o f efficiency.61Since the project successfully supported the
 expansion o f this service, FPHP's efficiency is rated as substantial.By contrast, HPPP
 supported creation o fnew infrastructure which i s mostly unusedand failed to bring about
 the intendedefficiency-enhancing reforms (disrupting service deliveryinthe process), so
 HPPP's efficiencyis negligible.

 Sustainability

4.11 Bothprojects were part o f a continuing partnership between government, the
Bankandother DPs, which is now continuingunderHNPSP. Government's share of
programcosts has increased over time, so that the projects have beenresilient to the main
risks such projects may suffer regarding financial support. Ingeneral they are also
resilient to any risks associatedwith weak government ownership or institutionalsupport,
though HPPPsuffered with respect to these on account of the unification episode.
Nonetheless, the sustainabilityofthe services providedthrough the projectsis likely.
There are two important caveats: (1) the community clinics are barelyutilized, and (2)
the reform agendafor decentralisation needbekept infocus. Ifformal decentralization
proves impossible, other means for increasing local autonomy and accountability needbe
sought.

IDImpact

4.12      Bothprojectshadonly a modestimpact on institutionaldevelopment.Under
FPHP there were few'activities to improve institutionalperformance o f MOHFW.
DuringHPPP there were instances ofsuccessful institutionaldevelopment, mostnotably


60. The cost differences between government and NGO delivery were not substantial, with NGOs cheaper
intwo ofthe three systems. As is to be expected facility-based delivery was cheapest, andhome visit the
most expensive.
61. However, to be sure o fthis conclusion, it is necessary to compare the design o fthe programwith what
could be achieved given the same resources taking into account the country's specific cost structure and
burdeno fdisease. Suchan analysis is precisely what is intended to be carried out indeveloping anESP,
but, as discussed above, this was not done. Inthe absence of such analysis, a conclusion cannot be reached
regarding cost-effectiveness o f the program against its potential cost effectiveness. (A burdeno f disease
analysis, including future projections, was produced by ICDDR-Bin2001 and a unit cost analysis in2004,
though these documents do not seem to have been usedinplanning HNPSP).

 the move to a SWAP, but also the development o f procurement capacity and the
 development o f the HealthEconomics Unit.But there were also ambitious reforms for
both unification and decentralizationwhich were not realized, and areas o f institutional
 deterioration such as MIS andBCC. Bothprojects had substantial amounts o f training,
butwith limitedimpact on account o fbothimplementationdifficulties andthe rapid
 turnover o f staff on the government side. Turnover i s less o f a problem for field level
 staff who were also trained under both projects. FPHP trained female HASand TBAs,
 though the latter was abandoned. HPSP envisaged development o f substantial capacity to
 deliver primary services, but didnot do so ineffectively on account o f inadequate
 training.

 Outcome

4.13     FPHP is rated as satisfactory. Contraceptive prevalence, and so fertility,
continued to improve, as didunder-five mortality. Whilst the other objectives related to
maternal health and nutritionwere not achieved, these were over-ambitious and fell
beyond the scope o f the activities supported by the project.

4.14     HPSP is rated as unsatisfactory,despite the continued improvement in
outcomes duringthe period. It can plausibly be claimed that, as has been done inthe
HPSP indicator reviews, that other factors, such as continued economic growth, the rapid
expansion o f female education and earlier investments, account for these successes rather
than then HPSP since service use actually fell during the course o f the project. These falls
were a result o f the disruption caused by the unification episode, supported by evidence
that there has been a recovery since then especially inthe use o f secondary facilities.


Borrower Performance

4.15     Borrower performance was satisfactory during FPHP, with the line staff o f
the two directorates executing their functions to deliver services. But borrower
performance was unsatisfactoryunder HPSP. Government allowed reforms to be
stalled and then reversed, despite the highlevel o f commitment that hadbeen there.
Service delivery suffered as a result. The Change Management Unit and Project
Coordination Cell were disbanded on political grounds. The community clinic concept
was also abandoned, a waste o f a sizeable investment. Other parts o f the reform agenda
were neglected.

Bank Performance

4.16     Bankperformance under FPHP was satisfactory. The project continued a long
line o f successful projects inthe country, contributing to improving welfare outcomes.
The Bank continued its successful donor coordination role and oversaw the expansion o f
the scope o f the project to have a stronger health focus.

4.17     Bank staff faced many challenges under HPPP infacilitating the transition o f both
GOBandother DPsto the SWAP, andthere were manynotable achievements inthe face

                                                          45


 o f these challenges. But on balance Bankperformanceduring HPPP is judged as
 unsatisfactoryfor a number o freasons.

 4.18      Onthe designside, the community clinic concept canbe seen as a seriously
 flawed, over-ambitious design, and one supported by insufficient logistical backup and
 inadequate training for the HASintended to act as primary health care workers. It would
 have made sense to focus resources on the under-utilized union level facilities, upgrading
 their skills andtryingto ensure provision o fadequatehealth and family planning services
 at that level so that patients did not by-pass these centers, going directly to upazilla and
 district facilities.62There were also shortcomings inthe design o f ESP, which was
 allowed to become a weakly prioritized wish list. These shortcomings indesign reflect
 poor performance on the part o f both the Bank and the govenment.

 4.19      The failure to properly think through the implications o f the SWAP, to make sure
 that it was fully understoodby all parties, and check capacity to utilize the new systems
 must also be laidat the door ofthe Bank as leaddonor. Bythe time o fpreparationthe
 Bank did have experience o f health sector SWAPSina number o f African countries, but
 it does not seem that adequate efforts were made to draw on these resources inlearning
 how to apply the approach.

 4.20     The main supervision failure is the suspension episode, with a common
perception amongst many that the Bank and other pool donors over-reacted and handled
 the matter inan inflexible                      These problems may stem from a number o f issues
inthe Bank's management o fits healthportfolioinBangladesh. First, there was
inadequate separationbetween HPSO and Bank activities. The Bank should have
maintained HNP expertise inthe country independent o f HPSO. Second, the senior Bank
staff member at this time was new to the Bank, whereas responsibility for managing such
a large program should ideally rest with someone with more experience inacting as the
Bank's representative. Finally, HPSO does not have local staffinprofessional
whereas such staff can play an important intermediary role, especially indifficult
circumstances.

4.21      The ratings given inthe Project Supervision Reports (PSRs) show some
complacency. Financial management was rated satisfactory despite slow disbursement
and the large number o f audit observations. Second, the project was never rated
unsatisfactorywith respect to the overall project development objectives, despite the fact
that the Bank felt it necessary to suspend the project.




62. As noted above, this i s notjust the benefit o f hindsight. These same warnings were made during HPSP
preparation.
63. This i s not the view o f Bank staff directly involved at the time who maintain that a stand had to be
taken to demonstrate to government that they could not simply ignore all the commitments that hadbeen
made. But they concede that they under-estimated government's willingness to stick to its position inthe
face o f donor pressure.

64. It does for nutrition, but this i s a separateproject.

 5.      LESSONS LEARNED

 5.1     Aid-financed health infrastructure can work in improving health outcomes..      .
provided other conditions are inplace: this PPARhas produced additional evidence in
 support o f the main argument o f IEG's impact evaluation that the creation o f an extensive
 health and family planningsystem inBangladesh, with considerable assistance from
 external finance, has made a demonstrable improvement to the healthoutcomes o f
 Bangladeshis. However, this success was achieved through the balanced growth o f
 infrastructure and appropriately trained staff, The experience o fthe community clinics
 shows that services will not be usedifthey lack resources or the skills o fthe staff are
 inadequate for what i s expected o f them.

 5.2     Public andprivate provision are complementsnot substitutes:The health
 demands o f Bangladeshis are met bybothpublic and private providers. These suppliers
 do not work inparallel, but co-exist through various symbiotic relationships.

 5.3     A SWAP takes time to implement and is an evolutionaryprocess. InBangladesh
 it can be said it took 20 years ofdonor coordinationto beginthe process o fimplementing
 a SWAP. It i s not feasible tojump from a project approach to fully-fledged SWAP
 overnight. Rather institutionsneedto evolve from one to the other, though a series o f
 interiminstitutionalarrangements.Thechanging way inwhich donor funds havebeen
handled under FPHP, HPSP andHNPSP i s an example o f this.

 5.4     Wide stakeholderparticipation inpreparation helps ownership but can weaken
design.The broadparticipatoryprocessmade it difficult to prioritize, notably with
respect to ESP. A compromise needbe sought betweenparticipation andtechnical
guidance to working $goups inorder to maintain satisfactory quality at entry.

5.5      Think through the implications of the new system. The move to a SWAP implies
a change inhow things are done for bothDPs and government inways which are often
not well understood. It i s imperative to think through how systemswill actuallywork,
andmake sure that all involvedunderstandthis. This process will necessarily take time.

5.6     Draw on the appropriate skills mix. Many aspects o fthe design and
implementationof a SWAP do not fall withinthe competence o fhealth specialists. Thus,
theneedfor appropriate expertise should berecognized anddrawn on. Bank staff should
seek to draw on the Bank's experience with similar issues inother countries, making sure
that local staff, DPs and government can all benefit from this experience.

5.7     Failure to assessfully thepolitical economy of reform and toprepare both a
proactiveplanfor addressing/mitigatingrisks and a contingencyplan will considerably
diminishprospectsfor successful reform. Ina politicked environment policy reversals
are the norm not the exception. DPs should beprepared to adapt their approach: maybe
renaminginstitutions will suffice, but it may not be so.

5.8      Too much donorBank intervention can undermine government capacity and
ownership of a SWAP approach. Preparation o fthe SWAP startedwith a highdegree o f
local ownership. But the extensive role playedby donors inthe review process, and the

                                               47


importance o f the tasks which eventually fell to HPSO, but would have beenbetter
carried out by government, reduced local ownership.

5.9     Be realistic in'tackling major reform objectives. HPSP combined the move to a
SWAP withtwo major sets ofreforms: unification and decentralisation, as well as the
introduction o f a new tier o f service delivery at community level. This was rather a lot to
hope to achieve ina single project. A more phased approachmay have yielded more
lasting results ina less acrimonious manner.

 Annex D.Briefoverview of ICMH activities


  ICMH's activities can be summarized as follows:

      0   Patient care i s now provided through the hospital building on the I C M H
          campus, the nearby ICMHMatuail Hospital, out patient services at Jalkuri and
          community based services. These services are fully utilizedwith bed
          occupancy rates exceeding 100percent inbothpediatrics, and obstetrics and
          gynecology departments.

          Teaching andtraining has ranged from international conferences to training o f
          paramedics inESP. ICMHwas a designated LeadTraining Organization,
          providing substantial amounts o f training financed by FPHP and HPSP, for
          bothhealth and family planning staff. However, since the Institutewas
          constructed with ample facilities, usage rate (including o fresidential
          accommodation) i s currently around 50-60 percent.

          Staffhave been carried out close to 100researchprojects, some financed by
          HPSP, but also attracting funding from arange o f organizations. About one-
          fifthoftheseprojects have resulted inpublications ininternationallyrefereed
          publications. Policy has been informedby some o fthis research, most notably
          the UNICEF-fimded survey o f injuries which identifiedthe importance o f
          drowning as a cause o f child death.

     0    ICMHbecame autonomous in2002 and has beencovering a growing share o f
          its costs, achieving 37 percent inthe last financial year. It i s not, however,
          intended to achieve full cost recovery status (thetarget i s 50 percent).




1.I C M Hclaims to be the busiest pediatric department inthe country, with 300-500 cases a day.
However, the mission visited FeniDistrict Hospital, which handles 800 outpatients a day, and so is at
least close to the same number of pediatric cases.

Annex E.VerticalProgramsina SWAP: the case of the
NationalTB Program(NTP)


A WHO report (WHO, 2004) identifies difficulties faced inintegratingNTP into
HPSP, drawing parallels with the fate o fthe country's malariaprogram.

Bangladesh had a successful, vertically operated, MalariaEradicationProgram, which
begunto beintegrated into the Integrated UpazillaHealthProgramfrom 1977with
the result that malariacontrolwork at thana and district levelstarted to be undertaken
by staffwithout expertise inmalaria; as one report putit, itwas the malariologists
who were being eradicated not malaria. Moreover, fundingbecame available only for
curative care rather than prevention. The resurgence o fmalaria inthe Chittagong Hill
Tracts and Cox's Bazaar areai s linkedto these weaknesses (WHO, 2004).

Turningto NTP the WHO report identifies several issues to be faced inintegrating
the programinto the SWAP. First, the centralization o fprogram management
restricts the flexibility neededby individualprograms such as NTP, andmay cause
themto lose momentumas focus shifts to management systemsand away from
service delivery. However, this argument does not appear valid inthe light o frecent
events. There was a polio case inComilla (the first infive years) immediately prior to
the PPARmission and a meetingo f government and DPs quickly convened to agree a
response. Respondents argued that the SWAP allowed such a rapidresponse, since
underthe oldproject approach approval would have hadto be sought from the
MinistryofPlanning. Second, the WHO report points out that the overall objective o f
HPSP includes improvingthe healtho f vulnerable women, and TB i s recognizedas
the major killer o fwomen duringtheir reproductive years. ButNTP does not appear
inthe logframe, nor do any TB-relatedmeasuresappear amongst the indicators. The
report also argues that eveninNTP achieves its objectives it will not reduce the
numberof active new cases emerging as there are already 60 millionpeopleinfected,
so a new, more comprehensive approach, i s needed. HPSP potentiallyprovides the
opportunity for this more comprehensive approach, since integrationmeans that, for
example, TB-related messagescan be incorporated into BCC, better coordination
with other programs such as that for HIV/AIDS (e.g.joint training), andNTP can
become involvedinquality control o fprivate sector treatment o f TB. However, to
date these remain largelypotential advantagesrather than actual ones.
