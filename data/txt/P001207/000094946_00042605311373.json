However, the perception by\n            investors on the country's risks, and the limited\n            capacities at the early stages of the project, affected\n            implementation, and outcome. But sustainability is very\n            likely, and both the Bank, and the Borrower's\n            performances were highly satisfactory. Lessons drawn from\n            the project, suggest that multidimensional programs, require\n            political considerations, in synergy with the technical\n            work, to be supported by commitments at the highest level of\n            Government, to ensure successful privatization programs. The\n            government provided this commitment, and allowed time to\n            evaluate options, and consultations with stakeholders, as\n            well as ways to resolve complex privatization issues.\n            However, specific policies, and actions for private sector\n            development should be closely linked, but it appears that\n            the Government gave priority to the pace of divestiture, and\n            to revenue maximization, over the objective of broadening\n            local share ownership, somehow preventing complete success\n            of the privatization process. Nonetheless, institutional\n            strengthening played a key role in the privatization\n            program, and debt management, due to the work of a highly\n            selected team, and the right training. Legislation, and\n            related reforms should be established to attract foreign investments."}, "docdt": "2000-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
