highly satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcomes was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Power Sector Development\n            Technical Assistance Project were as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcomes was high, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included:  public-private partnership model can efficiently\n            deliver large-scale and dispersed off-grid electricity\n            services, by deploying public funding through private sector\n            stakeholders. Flexibility to adapt to market conditions and\n            signals are the hallmarks of this model, while quality\n            assurance and after-sales and maintenance service mechanisms\n            are a necessity for acceptance by beneficiaries.  One-off\n            technical assistance or credit support operations should be\n            highly strategic, selective and practical in supporting\n            policy and institutional issues of a complex nature. The PSD\n            technical assistance project took on an ambitious agenda\n            covering power sector policies, regulation, industry\n            structure and private sector participation, and struggled to\n            get traction on any of these matters. Achieving broader\n            social and economic outcomes from electricity access\n            provision will primarily depend upon the pursuit of a least\n            cost path for grid expansion backed by appropriate sector\n            policies, complemented by off-grid electricity in the\n            interim or permanently as needed."}, "docdt": "2014-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
