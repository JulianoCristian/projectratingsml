This is the second\n            reallocation of proceeds of the project. The reallocation is\n            necessary to meet the increasing demand of fast moving\n            categories, utilize unspent amount in other categories and\n            finance new tasks on feasibility and preparation of\n            investment projects. Also 100 percent financing threshold\n            for goods and consultants services has been to improve\n            project implementation and disbursement.
