                         The project remains satisfactory. Project development impact continued to be substantial. Both completed and ongoing supports have added institutional capacity to power and
                         energy ministries and power and gas utilities, the notable ones being: i) transaction advice for Siddhirganj 335 MW CCPP resulted in selection of an EPC contractor and execution of
                         a few IPP contracts; ii) real time data on energy flow and system operations from interface meters reduced inter-agency disputes on energy and improved system operations and
                         energy balance; iii) ongoing feasibility and other studies and operational supports are improving analytical, human resource and management capacity of power and gas utilities

                         procurement, project preparation and implementation; vi) multiple training and study tours enhanced capacity and understanding of power, energy and planning ministries and utilities
