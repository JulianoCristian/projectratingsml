b) create capacity within\n            the energy regulatory commission to regulate the sector\n            effectively; and c) prepare and secure financing for, at\n            least two well-structured power sector investment projects\n            that are then efficiently implemented. This is the second\n            reallocation of proceeds of the project. The project\n            continues to play an important role in improving the quality\n            and implementation of power and energy policy reforms;\n            strengthening institutional capacity in the Power and Energy\n            Ministry, the utilities and the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory\n            Commission (BERC); preparing and promoting investment\n            projects; and improving the quality of power generation\n            transactions in the public and the private sectors. This\n            restructuring reallocates XDR 230,000 of credit funds to\n            categories originally identified to be financed only through\n            grant funds, to cover shortfall of funds for committed\n            contracts. In addition, a number of new, relatively small,\n            contracts are also approved to be financed through the\n            credit funds. Of the original credit and grant amounts of\n            $15.5m, 81 percent has already been disbursed. Of the\n            balance, the grant funds are fully committed and expected to\n            be disbursed by the project closing date of December 31,\n            2012; committed contracts financed through credit funds are\n            also expected to be completed by the closing date. A few\n            additional activities are currently under procurement and\n            some of them are expected to be completed by the closing\n            date.
