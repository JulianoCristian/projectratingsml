satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: participants that undergo project\n            training program should be retained in the project or\n            involved in similar capacity building activities or in\n            sector reform implementation for as long as possible. This\n            can help retain the capacity and competencies in the sector.\n            Evaluation of an overarching TA project is complex. For\n            projects that aim to achieve sector reforms (i.e., policy\n            making and regulatory adoptions), it is difficult to foresee\n            at appraisal how outputs will shape policies and reforms and\n            how concerned stakeholders will react to the policy\n            recommendations. TA projects, especially those aiming at\n            sector reforms, should not be too ambitious on what can be\n            achieved and the time frame required to achieve the expected\n            outcomes. The experience of corporatizing the South Zone\n            utility makes a case for thinking about alternative models\n            of corporatization that can still achieve the same autonomy,\n            accountability and a legal title."}, "docdt": "2013-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
