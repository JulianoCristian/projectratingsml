2.      Project implementation remains satisfactory in all three implementing agencies: Power Cell,
Petrobangla, and the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC). The project continues to
play an important role in improving the quality and implementation of power and energy policy
reforms; strengthening institutional capacity in the Power and Energy Ministry, the utilities and the
BERC; preparing and promoting investment projects; and improving the quality of power generation
transactions in the public and the private sectors. A few new tasks have been undertaken under the
project (power plant performance improvement, cumulative environment impact assessment of
Siddhirganj region, CFL recycling policy, CFL bid process consultants, and business process
consultants) and all these activities remain consistent with the PDOs.

3.      As per the Development Financing Agreement of the project, the Power Cell accesses both
credit and grant funds, and both Petrobangla and BERC access only grant funds. A few large
contracts under the grant components implemented by Petrobangla and Power Cell (namely, LNG,
Implementation and Financing Plan for gas sector development, Ghorashal repowering etc.) have
exceeded the estimated costs and the available grant funds are not adequate to cover the committed
contracts. On the other hand, the credit component (which is currently only accessed by activities
implemented by the Power Cell) is indicating surplus funds. This restructuring reallocates XDR
230,000 of credit funds to categories originally identified to be financed only through grant funds, to
cover shortfall of funds for committed contracts. In addition, a number of new, relatively small,
contracts are also approved to be financed through the credit funds.

4.     Of the original credit and grant amounts of $15.5m, 81% has already been disbursed. Of the
balance, the grant funds are fully committed and expected to be disbursed by the project closing date
of December 31, 2012; committed contracts financed through credit funds are also expected to be
completed by the closing date. A few additional activities are currently under procurement and some
of them are expected to be completed by the closing date. As a result, an estimated amount of $
0.785 million of credit funds will remain undisbursed and be cancelled from the following
categories:
Categories             Amount ($)
1-A                    127,000
1-B                    155,000
2-A                    503,000
Total                  785,000
The total expected disbursement is $15.74 million.

5.      The Borrower is in compliance with all loan covenants of PSDTA and there are no
outstanding audits. The Project’s development objectives continue to be achievable and the outcome
indicators are on track to be achieved by the closing date.

6.     This is the third reallocation of proceeds of the project. The proposed reallocation is
necessary to meet the increasing demand of some categories (1-d, 2-c, 3-b and 4-b), utilize unspent
amount in other categories (2-b, 3-a, and 4-a), and finance the proposed new tasks. 100% financing
has been maintained for all categories of expenditures. The above reallocation is effective from July
1, 2011 to cover up the expenditures incurred from July 1, 2011 against the reallocated amounts.
