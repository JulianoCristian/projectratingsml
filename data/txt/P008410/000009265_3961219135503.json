   Credit Project is to support the Government's economic\n            reform program aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability\n            and at promoting the resumption of growth and improvement in\n            living standards. The reform program comprises three sets of\n            policies: 1) those aimed at reducing and redefining the role\n            of the public sector in the economy; 2) those that foster\n            the development and increase the efficiency of markets; and\n            3) those that maintain a minimum social safety net through\n            improved targeting of benefits. Among the key reforms are\n            price and trade liberalization, phasing out of the state\n            order system, restructuring of the Government sector,\n            privatization, private sector development, and improved\n            targeting of social benefits. Other objectives of the credit\n            are to: provide budgetary support to maintain the level of\n            basic public expenditures, in particular for wages and the\n            social safety net;  provide foreign exchange for the\n            purchase of critical imports; improve the functioning of the\n            foreign exchange market; and provide a framework for\n            financial assistance from other donor agencies."}, "docdt": "1995-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
