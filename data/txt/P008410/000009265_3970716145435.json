The\n            main objective of the Credit was to support Georgia's\n            economic reform program which set out to restore\n            macroeconomic stability, promote growth, and improve living\n            standards. Other objectives were to: (a) provide budgetary\n            support to maintain the level of basic public expenditures\n            (in particular for wages and the social safety net); (b)\n            provide foreign exchange to finance critical imports; (c)\n            improve the functioning of the foreign exchange market; and\n            (d) provide a framework for financial assistance from other\n            donor agencies. The performance of the Bank was\n            satisfactory. The performance of the Government of Georgia,\n            the borrower has been highly satisfactory. The outcome of\n            the project is rated as highly satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned were: (i) strong Government commitment and an active\n            and open policy dialogue are essential for success; (ii)\n            providing adequate and timely institutional support for the\n            implementation of reforms boosts the probability of success\n            for economies in transition; (iii) desperate situations\n            often afford the greatest possibilities for change; (iv)\n            areas that are part politically sensitive, such as land\n            reform in Georgia, it is important not to underestimate the\n            political difficulties and to begin broad discussions early\n            on with all parties involved, particularly the ultimate\n            decision makers; and (v) in Georgia substantial attention\n            was given to social concerns very early on in the reform process."}, "docdt": "1997-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
