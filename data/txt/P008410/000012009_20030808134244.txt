I       OED Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellenceand independence in evaluation.                      I
 About this Report
       The Operations Evaluation Department assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first,
 to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producingthe expected
 results,and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the disseminationof lessons
 drawn from experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations. In
 selectingoperations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
 relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which Executive Directorsor Bank managementhave
 requestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate important lessons.The projects,topics, and analytical
 approachesselectedfor assessment supportlarger evaluation studies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR)is based on a reviewof the ImplementationCompletion Report
 (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare PPARs, OED staff
 examine project files and other documents, interview operationalstaff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
 onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries.The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the information
 provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader OED studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally, the PPAR
 is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then sent to the
 borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attachedto the documentthat is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive
 Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


 About the OED Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessarylevel of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or sectoral
 approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and
 rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more informationis available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectivesare consistent with the country's current
 development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistancestrategies and corporate goals (expressed
 in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,Operational Policies).
 Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the opportunity
 cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possibleratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
 This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
       Sustainability: The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely, Unlikely,
 Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
       lnstitutionalDevelopmentlmpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region to
 make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a) better
 definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictabilityof institutionalarrangements and/or (b) better alignment
 of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these institutional arrangements.
 Institutional Development lmpact includes both intended and unintendedeffects of a project. Possible ratings: High,
 Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
       Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently.Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly unsatisfactory.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported
 implementationthrough appropriatesupervision (includingensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular
 operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure quality
 of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the achievement of
 development objectivesand sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
 unsatisfactory.

 Summary

 1.       Attached i s the Project Performance Assessment Report on seven credits to
 Georgia, which were implementedfrom 1994 to 2002. The main objectives o fthe four
 adjustment operations were to establish and maintain macroeconomic stability; foster
 growth; improve financial discipline inthe private and public sectors; and alleviate
 poverty. They were intendedto support the government's program to remove the
 remaining distortions and controls from the central planning system, remedy institutional
 deficiencies, streamline the government sector, improve the efficiency o fpublic
 spending, and set up amarket-friendly regulatory framework. The three technical
 assistance credits provided capacity-building and advice in support o fthese reforms.

2.       Followingthe cessation o f civil strife in 1994, rapid progress was made in
macroeconomic stabilization and implementation o f "first generation" reforms:
privatization o f SOEs; establishment o f a liberal trade regime; elimination o f state control
 over distribution; and creation o f an appropriate legal framework. The adjustment credits
were largely successful inachieving stabilization and GDP growth. However, Georgia
has an extemal debt o f about halfo f GDP, and debt service now consumes 36 percent o f
government revenue. Employment growth has beennegligible, and poverty increased
 substantially, reaching 53 percent in2000.

 3.      Duringtheperiodo ftheprojects covered bythis PPAR, several constraints to
 economic development loomed. First,political power became increasinglyfragmented.
Constrained by other power centers, and short on budgetary resources, the central
government-while        willing-was   increasingly unable to implementfurther reforms.
Secondly, corruptionbecame more pervasive and unpredictable. A key PPAR finding i s
that the credits accorded insuf$cient emphasis topoverty alleviation and anti-corruption
measures.

4.       The PPARrates the outcomes o fboththe Institution BuildingCredit and the First
Structural Adiustment Technical Assistance Credit as satisfacto y,institutional
development impact (IDI) as substantial, sustainability as likely, and Bank and Borrower
performance as satisfacto y,the same as inthe ES. It rates the outcome o f the Second
Structural Adiustment Technical Assistance Credit as moderately satisfacto y,as
compared to satisfactovy inthe OED ES. This change i s largely because assistance to the
State Tax Service and Customs Department did not improve their effectiveness to the
extent envisioned (although tax revenue as a percent o f GDP rose). Also, assistance in
the areaof judicial reform achieved less than envisionedbecause o fthe overall lack o f
respect for the rule o f law and the highlevel o f corruption. Sustainability i s rated likely,
ID1modest andBank performancesatisfacto y,as inthe ES. Borrower performance was
assessedas unsatisfacto y inthe PPAR, compared to satisfacto y inthe ES, because o f
the Borrower's lack o f cooperationinthe tax collection area and tolerance o f conditions
that underminedjudicial reform.

5.       The PPAR rates the outcome o fthe Rehabilitation Credit as satisfactory, ID1as
substantial, and Bank performance as satisfactory, the same as inthe ES. Sustainability
i s rated as highly likely, compared with likely inthe ES because, with the passage o f time,
these reforms have become an integral part o f Georgian society, and are reinforced by

                                               xii


Georgia's entry into the WTO and by follow-on Bank and Fundoperations. Borrower
Performance is ratedsatisfactory, compared to highly satisfactory inthe ES, because o f
delays inthe passage o f new legislation, and slower progress inrevenuemobilization
than envisioned.

6.       The PPARrates the outcome o fthe First Structural Adiustment Credit as
moderately unsatisfacto ry, compared to satisfactory inthe ES. Sustainability i s rated
likely, and ID1modest, as inthe ES. Bank and Borrower performance are rated as
unsatisfactory, compared to satisfactory inthe ES. The project's objectives were only
modestly relevant because they did little to address poverty alleviation or corruption.
SAC Iachieved its macroeconomic, streamlining government, privatization, and financial
sector reform objectives. However, poverty and health status worsened, the energy
quasi-fiscal deficit grew, and although financial sector reforms were largely successful,
benefits were limitedgiven the small role o f the sector ineconomic activity. Bank
performance was unsatisfactory due to deficient quality at entry: too little emphasis on
poverty alleviation, and excessive reliance on energy collections as a measure o f
compliance, and on quantityover quality inprivatization. Borrower performance was
rated unsatisfactory because the energy quasi-fiscal deficit grew, and the Borrower
tolerated an environment intax and customs administration inwhich theft and corruption
were so pervasivethat reforms were undermined,and economic development was
hindered(although revenue targets were met).

7.       The PPAR rates the outcome o fthe Second Structural Adjustment Credit as
unsatisfactory, compared to marginally satisfactory inthe ES. Sustainability i s rated
likely, and ID1modest as inthe ES. SAC I1objectives were o f modest relevance. While
the credit supported a poverty assessment and specified minimumbudgetallocations for
health and education, these actions were not commensurate with the importance of
poverty alleviation. The objectives inprivatization, raising electricity tariffs, and inthe
financial and education sectors were generally achieved, but progress inmacroeconomic
stabilization faltered, poverty worsened, conditions on minimumbudgetary allocations
for the social sectors and energy collection levels were not met, and the financial
situation o fthe energy sector worsened. Bank performance i s rated as unsatisfactory,
compared to satisfactory inthe ES, for the same reasons as in SAC I.Inretrospect, the
issuance ofwaivers for insufficient healthbudgetary allocations and for satisfactory
energy collections was unwise, and may have sent the wrong signal to the Borrower.
Borrower performance was highly unsatisfactory, compared to satisfactory inthe ES: the
Borrower did not maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, did not pursue
satisfactory efforts to alleviate poverty, attempted to circumvent the letter and spirit o f the
budgetary allocation to health, and maintained insufficient collection rates inthe energy
sector based on faulty data. Overall, the Borrower failed to maintain policies and
conditions that supported achievement of project objectives.

8.       The PPARrates the outcome o fthe Energy Sector Adiustment Credit as
satisfacto ry, sustainability as likely, and Bank performance as highly satisfacto ry, the
same as inthe ES. ID1i s rated as substantial, compared to modest inthe ES, because
privatization o f major energy facilities substantially improved the country's ability to
make use of its financial resources, and changes inthe legal framework related to
pipelines enabled the country to earn substantial transit fees. Borrower performance i s

                                            xiii


rated unsatisfactory, as inthe ES. Despite a positive attitude toward privatization, the
bovvowev did not maintainpolicies and conditions that supported achievement of pvoject
goals. The performance o f state-owned firms worsened, and detracted from the
achievement of project goals.

       The main lessons were:

       Georgia's weak governance severely limits the country's ability to create
       conditions conducive to economic development and the effective use o f
       development assistance.
       For a country such as Georgia, which experienced economic collapse, it i s
       incumbent upon the Bank to give highpriority to prompt measures that can
       directly mitigate conditions for the poorest.
       Turnover on the country team limitedprogram effectiveness.
       A more robust andtimely ESWprogramwouldhavebeenbeneficial to the design
       o fthe reform program.
       Turnover among policy officials hinderedreform progress.

 1.       IntroductionandMain Themes

 1.1      Georgia became independent inApril 1991,andjoined IDA inAugust o f that year. The
Government was immediately challengedby insurrections inAbkhazia and South Ossetia (see
map on page 89), which eventually became autonomous regions that have minimal relations with
Tbilisi. Armed gangs also challenged governmental authority elsewhere inthe country until
 1994, when order was gradually restored. The area o f Adjara also attained substantialautonomy.
These three regions comprise more than 20 percent o f Georgia's population, and more
importantly, straddle key transit routes to Turkey and Russia. An important Black Sea port,
Batumi, i s inAdjara. Inmany locations, there i s virtually an open conduit for smuggling. This
fragmentation challenges GoGauthority and control and limits revenue collection.
 1.2      By 1994, Georgia faced three maindevelopment challenges: (a) large macroeconomic
imbalances and a huge fall inGDP; (b) transition fkom a centrally planned to a market economy;
and (c) fragmentation o f the country. The first and second challenges were faced by all transition
economies, while the thirdwas specific to Georgia.
 1.3      Early Reforms. Georgia was an early, willing, and active reformer. Civil conflict limited
early progress, but the 1994-95 reform programincluded "first generation" reforms.' The
macroeconomic situation was starting to improve. The Bank reform strategy appropriately
focused on macroeconomic stabilization and completion o f first generation reforms.2 Other
aspects included strengtheningrevenue mobilization and financial sector regulation; energy
sector restructuring and enhanced payment discipline; reducing and restructuring the public
sector; and better benefits targeting. By2001, significant progress hadbeen made inmost o f
these areas.
 1.4      Further Fragmentation of Power. However, by 1998-99, it was apparent that the
fragmentation o f political power was increasing. The power o f the Executive vis-a-vis that o f
Parliament, o f the central government vis-a-vis the regions (even those nominally ruledby
Tbilisi), and o fthe central government vis-a-vis certain tightly-connected interest groups-
sometimes aligned with members o f Parliament-was                        diminished. Circumscribedbyother
power centers, and with a shortage o fbudgetary resources, the government-while
increasingly unable to implement further reform^.^                                                         willing-was


 1.5      Corruption. A further constraint on economic development i s Georgia's pervasive and
endemic corruption, which seemed to increase, and become more open, duringthe period o f this
PPAR.4 The government "attacked" corruption with presidential decrees, butmade little
progress; in July 2000, an anti-corruption campaign was establishedby Presidential decree, but

' "First generation reforms" included: privatization o f most state-owned companies; elimination o f price and wage
controls; elimination o f state control o f trade; establishment o f a liberal trade regime; endingstate control o f
distribution; and establishment o f a legal framework appropriate for a market economy.
  While this PPAR uses the term "Bank," it actually refers to IDA. All lending to Georgia has been on IDA
terms.
  An indicator of the strong power of the Parliament was the number of amendments made to the VAT during 1997-
2001 which acted to decrease state revenue or narrow the tax base (Annex 1). Similarly, Parliament's power i s
illustratedby its inaction for 13 months on the Electricity Support Project. The power o f the regions and
municipalities to pursue their self-interest is illustrated by the failure to agree on a plan to "group" the remaining 62
local electricity distribution companies into more easily-marketed packages. Insome cases, the central govemment
does not seemto have the ability to control what is done on its behalf. In 1999-2000, the Wholesale Electricity
Market incurred a debt-unauthorized       byhigher govemment officials-of         US$200million to purchaseenergy.

little progress was made. Another anti-corruption decree was signedby President Shevardnadze
inMarch, 2001, that promisedto introducemaximumtransparency instate institutions, make
clear distinctions betweenthe functions and duties o fpublic agencies, and provide adequate pay
for public employees. Some authorities on corruption believe meaningful progress i s unlikely
because an effective campaign would attack members o f the ruling elite uponwhom the
President relies: ". ..corruption inGeorgia i s so pervasive that anti-corruption fighters are often
not sure whom to target first."         Georgia i s rated by Transparency International 2002 Corruption
Perceptions Index as 85`h out o f 102 countries surveyed (Annex 8), Le., very corrupt. Also,
interviews with Bank staff and other donor agencies suggest that corruption may have a more
harmful effect on Georgia's economy because the country's relative openness and the weakness
o f central authority make corruption more unpredictable: Inthe seven projects reviewedinthis
PPAR, the two reform areas most severely affected by the lack of central authority and endemic
corruption are the energy sector and revenue mobilization. It has beenreported that tax and
customs officials at all levels "buy" their positions, because o f the lucrative franchise that it
represents. Taxpayers inthe formal economy often report efforts by various officials to extort
monies from them, sometimes inthe guise o f tax collection (see Annex 2).


Macroeconomic Performance

 1.6     Economic Collapse, then stabilization. Georgia's economic collapse after independence
was more severe than that o f any other CIS republic. By 1994, output had fallen by over
70 percent, the fiscal deficit was over 25 percent o f GDP, and the country was gripped by
hyperinflation. Inlate 1994, the Government launched a stabilization programmarkedby tight
monetary and fiscal policies. Growth was restored, reaching 10 percent in 1996, and inflation
subsided to single digits. A new currency, the lari, was introduced in September 1995, which
depreciated against the U S dollar by a relativelymodest 26 percent from 1996 to 1998, but then
by a further 45 percent inthe aftermath o fthe Russian financial crisis in 1998.

 1.7      Following the Russian crisis, exports and tax revenues fell, and the Govemment was
reluctant to cut expenditures inthe run-upto presidential and parliamentary elections. The
currency depreciation and the fiscal deterioration combined to reignite inflation, which
surged to 19 percent in 1999. Wage and pension arrears reached 3.5 percent o f GDP
(accumulated stock) inmid-2000, and inlate 1999 the IMF arrangement was suspended.6
However, inthe second half o f 2000, fiscal performance improved, no further arrears were
accumulated, and inJanuary 2001,the IMF approved a three-year Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PGRF).7Subsequent performance has been mixed; GDP growth has been
modest, averaging 3.1 percent per annum during1999-2001. Inflationmoderated, as did the
fiscal deficit, which fell to 1.9 percent o f GDP in2001 based on stringent Government



 Transparency Intemational, "Global Corruption Report, 2001,"p. 120. Several studies have documented the
problems o f state capture and corruption in Georgia. Some have ranked the country among the worst inthe CIS. See
Hellman, J., G. Jones and D.Kaufmann, 2000, `Seize the State, Seize the Day: State Capture, Corruption, and
Influence inTransition," World Bank Policy Research Paper 2444. Georgia ranked the highestin state capture,
judiciary capture, and administrative corruption severity-in  the latter by a high margin.
 The stock of expenditure arrears, principally for government wages and salaries and social security payments, grew
bynearly 300 million lari-or   4.8 percent o f GDP-in   the four years 1997-2000. IMF, "Recent Economic

for foreign investment is poor, and foreign direct investment outside o fthe oil sector has
been negligible.

1.8        Overall Development Assistance. As can be seen infigure A9.1 in Annex 9, from 1994
to 2001net disbursements from the Bank and other ILIs, as well as non-energy commercial
sources, comprised nearly US$1billion, with the Bank contributing around 45 percent, the Fund
33 percent, and bilateral donors 17percent. There i s a slight downward trendover the period,
with a pronounced drop in2000, due to a slowdowninBank disbursementsas well as negative
net disbursements from the Fund. The decline inBank disbursements during 2000 i s attributed to
the delay o fnearlytwo years inthe disbursement o fthe ESAC second tranche, as well as a delay
inthe disbursementofthe SAC I11second tranche, botho fwhich were eventually disbursedin
December, 2001.
1.9        Revenue Mobilization and Debt (Annex I). By 1994 Georgia had accumulated around
US$1billioninexternal debt-around                    halfto Turkmenistan for natural gas-some            o f which
resulted from borrowing that was not authorized by top government officials. Between 1995 and
1998, Georgia negotiated 11rescheduling agreements, but still accumulated additional arrears to
Turkmenistan. The stock o f overall debt also increased as a result o f increasedborrowing from
multilateral lenders. The current level o f external debt i s around US$1.7 billion, or around half
o f GDP, and debt service comprises around 36 percent o f central government revenue. Revenue
mobilization, the subject o f substantial and sustained donor effort from 1994 to 2001, leveled off
at between 14 and 15 percent o f GDP inthe last 3 years, includingrevenue o f around 4.6 percent
earmarked for local uses and 3.5 percent for extra-budgetary revenue (mainly pension
contributions).8 This level o f central government revenue mobilization make it more difficult for
the government to service debt, finance satisfactory social services, maintain human capital, and
refurbish critical infra~tructure.~

February, 2002.
 "Total Tax Revenue" i s usedto measure the government's revenue mobilization results, rather than the more
inclusive "Total Revenue." The former was the measure utilized in the adjustment operations that are the subject of
this PPAR, and since the latter includes privatization revenues and other volatile sources, Total Tax Revenue is
considered as a more accurate and sustainable measure.

1.10     Increase in Poverty. Poverty inGeorgia can be measuredin several ways (Table 1.2).
While the measures differ, they are consistent inindicating that poverty has increased. Poverty
increased, inpart, because while GDP grew, inequality also grew; the Gini ratio rose from 0.29 in
1990 to 0.46 in 1998, puttingGeorgia inthe middle o f CIS countries inthis regard. Visible
examples o f luxuryautomobiles and housing have given many people a cynical view o f the
benefits o f economic reform." Growth was concentratedinjust a few sectors, and there has been
no net increase inemployment. The Bank's Poverty Assessment'' proposed an anti-poverty
strategy, and while the Government agreed to this strategy, its efforts have not been successfbl in
preventing poverty from worsening.

2.        Objectives andDesignofthe ReformProgram

2.1      The seven operations that are the subject o fthis PPAR supported a consistent and
cohesive program o f reform over the period 1994-2001. They were consistent with the objectives
stated inthe partial country strategy o f 1995 and the fbll country strategy o f 1997.l2
The four adjustment and three TA credits provedto be a potent stimulusto the reform process.

2.2      The Heritage Foundation Indexo f Economic FreedomI3rates the progress o f Georgian
reforms (2002) at 3.40 (where 1i s the highestand 5 i s the lowest), and the country ranks number
108 out o f 155 inthe world. Georgia's ratinghas improved from 3.95 in 1996 (earliest date
available), and the country has the third highestrating (2002) o f the 12 CIS republics. However,
inthe sub-categoryofproperty rights, Georgia is ratedat 4, the lowest inthe CIS (tiedwith 9
other CIS countries); for black market activity, Georgia i s rated at 5, a rating that i s shared among
CIS countries only with Turkmenistan, Belarus, and Tajikistan.

2.3      Annex 7 shows all o f the areas o f reform addressed by each project. The following were
the most prevalent areas o fprogram support:


     0   Economic management: macroeconomic stabilization; revenue mobilization.
     0   Privatization support: legal support; privatization strategy and implementation; public
         information.

l2The 1995 partial country strategy aimed to promote private sector development, redefine the role o f govemment
and make it more efficient, rehabilitate infrastructure, strengthen public management, and strengthen the social safety
net. The 1997 country strategy aimed to strengthen public finance, diversify sources o f growth, protect the
environment, and reduce poverty.

        Government sector restructuring: reduction in size; restructure health sector; minimum
        budgetary allocations to social sectors.
        Energy sector: bolster financial performance o f energy firms; restructure sector; privatize
         energy firms; develop regulatory framework; improve service, decrease fiscal burden.
        Financial sector: strengthen bank regulation and supervision; privatize state-owned
        banks; assure that banks meet minimumprudential standards.
         Improve functioning o f markets: remove export restrictions, price controls; substantially
        raise prices o f some basic items.
        LegaVjudicial reform: establish legal framework sufficient to support market economy.
         Social sector: improve targeting; replace subsidies with cash compensation.

Notably absent from this list i s a programo f anti-corruption measures. This i s a deficiency o f the
projects reviewed inthis PPAR, and reduced their relevance. Also, considering the centrality o f
poverty alleviation to the Bank's mission, there was relativelylittle emphasis on poverty inthe
overall program.

2.4     The reformprogram was aimed at removingthe distortions and controls left over from
the central planningsystem, remedyinginstitutional deficiencies, and setting up a framework that
could support a market economy. The explicit assumptionunderlyingthe programwas that if
these actions could be successfully completed, and the vast majority o f assets privatized, then a
"supply response" would be forthcoming, and growth inincome and employment basedmainly
on private investment (both domestic and foreign) would occur.
2.5     However, after 1998-99,the environment inwhich the Georgian reform program
operated became increasingly inimical to further reform progress or to the development o f the
private ~ e c t o r . 'The Bank partially changed its focus inresponse to the changing environment.
                       ~
For example, when it became evident that further energyprivatizations (beyond those achieved
within the framework o fthe ESAC) would be difficult, the Bank appropriately changedits
approach: the Electricity Market Support Project, approved in FYO1, facilitated the hiring-
through management contract-of international contractors to manage non-privatized energy
sector assets. And when SAC I11(not the subject o f this PPAR) became effective inAugust
1999,it placed more emphasis on improving the environment for private business and further
progress on privatization o f land, inaddition to continuing much o f the reform thrust o f SACS I
and 11.I n retrospect, it can be questioned whether it was reasonable to continue adjustment
lending in an environment with obstacles to development asfundamental as those in Georgia.

2.6     Inthe sections that follow, the three technical assistance credits (IBC, SATAC I,                SATAC
11)are consideredtogether, while the adjustment operations are discussed individually.




14More accurately, it became inimicalto the development o f legitimate privatesector business. Foreigndirect
investment 1996-2000constituted around3 percent of GDP per annum, highly concentratedinpipeline construction
andprivatizations. Domestic investment was negligible.

3.       TechnicalAssistance Credits(IBC, SATAC I,SATAC 11)

Objectives

3.1      The InstitutionBuildingCredit (IBC) was intendedto buildthe capacity o f the
government-and       assist it to move to a market economy-in     3 key areas: financial sector
reform; economic management; and privatization and enterprise reform. Inthe financial sector,
emphasis was placed on improving accounting and auditing systems; conducting diagnostic
studies o f five state-ownedbanks; and reviewingexisting payment systems. Ineconomic
management, the project focused on policy formulation, statistics, customs and tax
administration, treasury, debt management, and aid coordination. And assistance was provided
for privatization. IBC was highly relevant, providingbasic technical and policy advice and
equipment at a time when the country was emerging from a mindsetfocused on central planning.
The sectors inwhich the project providedassistancewere fundamental to the emergence o f a
market economy; "commercial banks" associated with existingenterprises were proliferating,
and there was a substantial possibility o f a financial sector crisis unless regulation and
supervision were strengthened. Inthe area o f customs and tax administration, there was a clear
needfor assistance: tax revenue was just 5.6 percent o f GDP in 1994.

3.2      The objective o f the Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit I(SATACI)was
to provide technical assistance to support policy reform under SAC Iand SAC I1inthe following
areas: privatization and post-privatization support; strengthening the financial sector; social
protection reform; continued assistance modernizing customs and tax administration;
strengthening the regulatory framework for energy; and restructuring the energy sector. SATAC
Iwassubstantiallyrelevant. TheMassPrivatizationPlan(MPP)endedinmid-1996,and
SATAC Iprovided assistance with the cash auctions and case-by-case privatizations that
followed. The restructuring o f the energy sector was the first step inrestoring the financial health
o f the newly independentenergy firms. And, as with the other TA projects, continued efforts to
strengthenthe financial sector were neededto preventa financial crisis.

3.3      Structural Adjustment Technical Assistance Credit I1(SATAC11) objectives were to
support SAC I1and ESAC by providing TA inthe following areas: judicial reform and an anti-
corruption initiative; financial sector; energy sector reforms; social protection; health; resource
mobilization; and public information. SATAC I1was substantially relevant. With the exception
o fjudicial reform, anti-corruption, and social protection, SATAC I1essentially comprised a
continuation o f activities started under the earlier TA credits. The extension o f activity to
judicial reform and anti-corruption showed an accurate diagnosis that these areas constituted
significant barriers to development.
Implementation Experience
3.4      The IBC credit inthe amount o fUS$10.1 millionbecame effective inAugust 1994, and
was the first Bank credit to the country. Itwas co-financed inthe amount o f US$0.6 millionby
the Government o ftheNetherlands. Once effective, progresswas slowed duringa nine-month
period duringwhich the PIUdid not have adequate facilities. The IBC closed inJune, 1998, six
months later than envisioned.
                                                    P

                                                          7


3.5       The SATAC Icredit inthe amount o f US$4.8 million equivalent was made effective in
June 1996, and closedinDecember 1998, eight months later than the original closing date.15The
government provided an additional amount o f US$0.41 million, for a total project cost o f
US$5.21 million. The SATAC I1credit inthe amount o f US$5.5 millionbecame effective in
November 1997, and closed 6 months later than expected inDecember 1999. The entire credit
was disbursed.

Outcome

3.6       IBC outcome was satisfactory. Most o fthe project's objectives were achieved, with
some shortcomings. Inthefinancial sector, support was provided to the National Bank o f
Georgia (NBG) for the development o f an automated clearing and settlement system for domestic
payments.16 NBGwas also providedwith expert assistance inthe area ofbank supervision (in
conjunction with the Central Bank o f the Netherlands), and comprehensive diagnostic studies
were performedo fthe five state banks-which              served as a first step intheir eventual
privatization.

3.7       A law governing the functions ofthe NBGwas passedbythe Parliament inJanuary 1995,
which consolidated the authority o f the NBGover central banking operations, monetary and
credit regulations, and banking supervision. It also strengthened NBG autonomy to carry out
monetary policy and limit the financing o f government, and authorized NBG to introduce a new
national currency, which it didwith the introduction o f the lari in September 1995. Consultants
provided advice on upgrading bank accounting and auditing, inconjunction with the IMFand the
EU. While these efforts were largely successful, weaknesses incorporate governance and delays
inthe full implementation ofIAScomprise remaining shortcomings.
3.8       Inthe area ofeconomic management, IBC consultants andtraining-assisted                        byresident
advisors funded by the Netherlands and USAID-contributed significantly to the design and
implementation o f the successful economic stabilization program (described earlier), which was
also the subject o f the Rehabilitation Credit (RC) as well as IMF support. Consultant services
and training were provided to the State Department for Social and Economic Information for
household surveys, and a consultant study was done to streamline a number o f government
functions, including economic policy formulation (though few o f its recommendationswere
adopted).

3.9       The IBC was less successful inthe area o f strengtheningtax and customs administration
(done inconjunction with the IMF). Incooperation with UNCTAD, the AYSCUDA systemwas
installed at Tbilisi airport; a functional review o f issues affecting revenue mobilization was
conducted; and investigative and anti-smuggling programs were undertaken. While the Tbilisi
installation was intended as a pilot system, no other AYSCUDA systems were installed in other
parts o f the country, in large measure because o f opposition from the Customs Department.
(Tbilisi airport handles around 70 percent o f total legal imports into the country, by value.) A
planned effort to computerize some customs functions was also dropped due to a lack o f
commitment by the Customs and Taxation staff. However, it should be noted that tax revenue as


  The delay was mainly due to later than expected arrival o f computers and other equipment in support o f the
Customs and Treasury automation components.
16While the interbank funds transfer system, which was the focus o f IBC assistance, works well, little progress has
been made in augmenting govemment capacity on intrabank payments, use o f checks and credit cards, and the
securities market settlement systems. IMF, "Georgia: Financial System Stability Assessment," November, 2001, p. 7.

                                                   8


a percent o f GDP rose consistently duringthe IBC, from 5.6 percent in 1995 (earliest data
available) to 12.8 percent in 1998.
3.10     Thepublic information campaign was particularly successhl, both in support o f the
privatizationprogram as well as the overall reform program. A Public Relations Information
Center on Economic Reforms was established, and consultants assisted inthe development o f TV
programs, professional workshops, press seminars, additional seminars invarious regions o f
Georgia, and various types o fprintedmaterials.

3.11     Intheprivatization area, IBCtechnical assistance helpedthe government designand
implement the MPP (mediumand large enterprises), and the voucher auctions started inJune
 1995 (see para 4.5). Assistance was also provided for consolidation o f shareholder data; review
o f a draft securities law preparedby local experts; assistance in selection and establishment o f
pilot share registries; and training. Inthe area o f aid coordination, an Aid Management
Commission was established, and assistance providedwith training a resident advisor, and
modern office equipment. The debt management function was strengthened with the assistance
o f UNCTAD, the government successfully tracked down and enumerated (unauthorized) debt
(Annex 2).

3.12     SATAC Ioutcome was satisfactory. After the MPP had ended,privatization assistance
was generally successful at facilitating cash auctions (Annex4). This consisted o f legal support
to the cash auction process, as well as assistance inclassifylng enterprises, developing an
information package on firms to be sold, and grouping enterprises for sale. Assistance was also
provided inthe case-by-case sale o f large enterprises by tender-in    marketingthe sales, grouping
firms for sale, setting a minimumprice, completing limited restructuring, and helping the
MinistryofState PropertyManagement (MSPM) inliquidationproceedings. While at first too
higha reserveprice was specified, and saleswere slow, inmid-1997 the arrangementwas
modified and sales increasedconsiderably. Finally, advice was provided on establishment and
operation o f a pilot share registry.

3.13     SATAC Isupplemented UNCTAD assistance to the CustomsAdministration with
additional hardware and training incustoms processing software, including the ASYCUDA.
This assistance was delayed, as Customs didnot consistently support the project, butbyproject
closing the training hadtaken place envisioned along with associated equipment. The TA didnot
succeed in strengthening the agency, however. Despite a Resident Advisor inthe area o f anti-
smugglingand training, there was no evidence o f a decline insmuggling, or increase inthe
proportion o f imports on which duty was paid.

3.14    Instrengtheningthefinancial sector, a Central Treasury Data Base was set up,
establishing a regional network throughout Georgia that controlled disbursal and utilization o f
funds inaccordance with designatedbudgetary limits. Inaddition, a ResidentAdvisor was put
into place, and computerization support was provided to the NBG inbank supervision. Work
was also done to improve the debt reporting system, integrate macroeconomic analysis indebt
sustainability scenarios, and provide training inthese areas to MOF staff. Achievement o f
project goals was substantial, although delays were encountered inprocurement o f some
hardware.

3.15    Inconjunction with the restructuringo fthe energy sector, assistance was providedto
Sakenergo (the former state energy monopoly) to prepare a Debt Management Planprior to its

                                                    9


division into separate generation, transmission, and dispatch companies. Subsequently,
assistance was providedwith the actual restructuring o f the company. Support was also provided
to the government inrestructuring the energy sector into separate generation, transmission, and
distribution companies (inclose coordination with U SAID), and indetermining the market
structure and privatization strategy. This set the stage for the subsequent privatization o f Telasi
(theTbilisi electricity distribution company).

3.16    The comprehensivepublic information program continued and had a noticeable impact
on public perception o f the reform program, according to a number o f individuals interviewed.

3.17    Overall outcome o f SATAC I1was moderately satisfactory, compared to satisfactory in
the ES. Most majorproject objectives were achieved, butwith shortcomings inthejudicial
reform and revenue mobilization components and inthe procurement error described below.

3.18    The credit financed an assessmento fthejudicial reform agenda,17 which laidthe
groundwork for the Judicial Reform Credit (FY99). The credit financed facilities bywhich the
MOJ could publishan Oflcial Gazette and promulgate court decisions and official executive
branch documents. Legislationwas also developed to enhance the independence o f the judiciary.
A programto trainjudges was implemented, with the assistance o fUSAID and TACIS.
However, assistance withjudicial reform did not achieve the envisioned benefits due to the lack
o f respect for the rule o f law and the country's rampant corruption.

3.19    Inthefinancial sector, SATAC 11,inconjunction with the IMF,providedtechnical
advice and equipment that strengthenedNBG's bank supervision capacity. A major improvement
during SATAC I1was an increase inthe requiredcapital adequacy ratio. This contributed to the
ongoing process o f sector consolidation started under earlier operations (Annex 3), and the
number o fbanks continued to decline.

3.20    Inthe energy sector, a contractwas awardedto MerrillLynchto assist inthe auditing and
valuation o fpower companies, and assist infinding buyers. This resulted inthe successhl
privatization o fthe Tbilisi distribution company, Telasi, which was sold to AES-an     American
energy firm-in December 1998 (see Energy Sector Adjustment Credit below). Privatization
resulted inbetter collection rates and improvedpower supply (Annex 2).AES also purchased the
Gardabani generation facility. SATAC I1also providedtechnical assistance and hardware to
GNERC, the energy regulatory authority, which bolstered its rate-making capabilities.

3.21    Inthe socialprotection area, SATAC I1improvedthe quality andtimeliness ofstatistics
by supporting the development o fa povertymonitoringmethodology andthe implementation o f
a household survey. Training was provided to staff and management o f the State Statistics
Department, both inTbilisi and inthe UnitedStates. Also produced under this component was
an assessmento f how to improve collections inthe pension system.

3.22    Inthe health sector, the credit financedpreparation ofaNational HospitalRestructuring
Master Planthat was to be usedto identify excess facilities for closure. A separate plan was
produced for each region, and workshops were heldwith heathprofessionals invarious parts o f
the country. Rationalization efforts under SAC I1reduced the number o fhospitals by 33 percent,
and the bedcount by 60 percent (see Annex 5). While these reforms were successfully

                                                   10


implemented, the country's poor fiscal condition reduced its ability to benefit from the
restructuring; poor facility governance; and low regulatory capacity limited the returns

3.23     Thepublic information program continued successfully, and the government was highly
satisfied. Inthe area o f resource mobilization, computers were provided to the State Tax Service
to facilitate transfer o f data between the regions and Tbilisi. The Service didnot make good use
o f the new equipment; as has been discussed earlier and i s discussed inAnnex 1ingreater detail,
the functioning o f the State Tax Service has not noticeably improved duringthe period under
examination (although tax revenue as a percent o f GDP has risen). Continued assistance to the
Customs Department still hadno perceptible impact on its functioning.

3.24     A contract was awarded for pre-shipmentinspection o fgoods inboundto Georgia to
improve accuracy and reduce opportunities for fraud. Essentially, the contractor stationed its
staff at sites from which large volumes o f goods would be shipped to Georgia. However, during
the course o f this 3-year contract, relations betweenthe contractor and the Customs Department
were poor, the arrangement neverproduced the benefits envisioned, and no further use o fthis
mechanism was made after the end o f the contract inMay 2002. This sub-component thus
produced negligible benefits.


Sustainability

3.25     Sustainability o f the benefits producedby all three TA projects i s assessedonbalance as
likely. Macroeconomic management has been successful-with            the exception ofthe period
following the 1998 Russian financial crisis-so     there i s a strong expectation that this will
continue. And Georgia has not experienced a financial sector crisis as have some other transition
countries. The stronger bank supervision capacity to which both SATACs contributed has
continued to grow, and the financial sector i s ingood condition (see Annex 3).

3.26     Other Treasury functions were also strengthened, and Treasury continued to evolve into a
more competent agency. The analytical basis was developed for the Judicial Reformproject,
which has had a positive and continuing effect on the country's judiciary. Mediumand large
firms sold at cash auctions have remainedprivate. The energy sector was restructured as
envisioned and the privatization assistance set the stage for the subsequent sale o f Telasi. While
energy privatizationhas not progressedto the extent originally envisioned, the potential exists for
improvement through the use o fmanagement contracts (Annex 2), and the privatization o f Telasi
will continue to provide benefits. SATAC I1work inthe health area has hadmixed results; while
some underutilized facilities have closed as a result o f the development and implementation o f
the Master Plan, benefits havenot materializedto the extent envisioned. Giventhe reinforcement
o f a perennially strained budget, the health sector achievements seem likely to be sustained.

3.27     The main shortcoming o f SATACs Iand I1was in failing to bolster the capacity o f the
State Tax Administration and Customs Department. Georgia's revenue collection agencies were
resistant to improvement throughout the period covered by this PPAR and sustainability o f
benefits achieved inthis area i s unlikely.

                                                 11


InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

3.28     For the IBC, ID1i s assessed as substantial. The IBCbuilt Borrower capacity across
almost all o f the areas noted. Major accomplishments included improvement inbank
supervision; a new legal authority for the NBG; improvedbank accounting and auditing; an
enhancedmacroeconomic management capability; transfer o f state-owned enterprises to private
ownership; and establishment o f a competent debt management capability.

3.29      SATAC I,ID1was also substantid. The legal andregulatory framework for the
privatizationprogramwas improved, the capacity o f the Central Treasury to collect and disburse
funds was strengthened, debt reporting was improved, andMoF staffacross a number o f hnction
areas received training. SATAC Ialso supported the restructuring o f the former energy
monopolist, Sakenergo.

3.30     SATAC 11, ID1was modest. While the credit made substantial contributions inthe areas
o f strengtheningthe financial sector, energy sector restructuring, social protection, and health,
these were partially offset by deficiencies inthe areas o fjudicial reform and resource
mobilization-where     the benefits achieved were diminishedby the difficult context inwhich
they were introduced.


Bank and BorrowerPerformance

3.3 1 For the IBC, Bankperformance i s assessedas satisfactory. Working under difficult
conditions, the Bank identifiedkey areas inwhich assistance would be needed, and worked with
a number o f partners inproviding appropriate support inthose areas. Procurement and project
financial managementproceeded well, which i s not always the case for a new borrower.
Government ownership was good for nearly all the elements o f TA provided.

3.32     Bank performance under SATAC Iwas satisfactory, The credit was well-conceived and
aimed squarely at facilitating achievement o f reforms beingpursued under the SACS. The Bank
exhibitedflexibility inusingcredit resources, for example, byinitiatingthe Public Information
program as requested by Georgian authorities. Bank efforts to identify and coordinate providers
o f TA were successful and were greatly appreciated by Georgian officials.

3.33     Bank performance under SATAC I1was satisfactory. The project was well-designed
and effectively complemented the adjustment project. Project shortcomings inthe area o f
revenue mobilizationwere common to that function inGeorgia generally. The only failing in
Bank performance was its failure to identify the group o f Finance Ministryemployees who, on
"leave" from the Ministry, formed a "consulting firm" that won a contract o f US$51,000 to build
a data system to monitor external debt. This shortcoming was, in essence, the responsibility o f
the government, which aside from beingresponsible for procurement, should have beenable to
identify and disqualify this group.

3.34     Borrowerperformance was good for most IBC and SATAC Icomponents, and i s
assessedas satisfactory overall for both projects. Agencies that were provided with assistance
and equipment made good use o f it, and o f course today most have a much greater level o f
capacity than duringthe IBC. As noted earlier, Borrower commitment was good for most aspects
o f the projects, except for Customs and Tax Administration. Key staff incognizant agencies

                                                    12


were provided with training and equipment, and innearly all cases readily absorbed the
informationand support provided. Considering the Borrower's inexperience, delays were
minimal (except inthe case o f Customs and Tax Administration). Inpolitically difficult areas,
such as privatization, the Borrower collaborated with Bank staff and developed a feasible
program, which was implementedwith relatively few difficulties. The SATAC Iimplementing
agency (PIU) was effective-in      particular inmanagingprocurement. Ingeneral, officials were
enthusiastic about the new capabilities that the TA brought, and benefited accordingly.

3.35     Borrower performance was positive inmany areas o f SATAC 11. However, efforts to
furtherjudicial reformwere weakenedbythe country's rampant corruption andlack ofrespect
for the rule o f law. Also, as described above, efforts to enhance revenue collection performance
were less successfulbecause o f the lack o f cooperation o f the Customs and Tax Administration.
Finally, it was ultimately the Borrower's responsibility to ensure that procurement was conducted
inaccordance with Bank requirements,which itdidnot do (para 3.33). Onbalance, Borrower
performance i s therefore assessed as unsatisfactory, compared to satisfactory inthe ES.


4.       RehabilitationCredit

Objectives

4.1      The project was intended to restore macroeconomic stability and promote the resumption
of growth and improvement inliving standards by: (a) reducing and redefiningthe role o f the
public sector; (b) fostering the development and increasedefficiency o f markets through policies
governing price regulation, competition, trade, and finance; and (c) maintaininga minimum
social safety net. Among the keyreforms were price and trade liberalization; phasing out the
state order system; restructuring the government sector; privatization and private sector
development; and improved targeting o f social benefits.

4.2      The RC was highly relevant to the circumstancesand capacity o f the country. Georgia
was just emergingfrom a debilitating Civil War, and the capacity o f the government was
severely limited. The credit supported the reform programundertaken bythe government in
September 1994-after      extensive discussions that year with the Bank. Restoring macroeconomic
stability was critical; the 1994 hyperinflationhad improved to an inflation level o f 163 percent in
1995, and a tight monetary and fiscal policy was essential. Restoration o f growth was also
essential. Downsizing government was also highly relevant: in April 1995, around 10 percent o f
the population, and 18 percent o f the working-age population, was employed inthe public
sector.'* The social protection systemcould not afford the level o f benefits it was paying, and
there was evidence that some payments were not well targeted. Finally, achievement o f the
structural goals o f the credit could lay a foundation for the start o fprivate sector-led growth.

ImplementationExperience

4.3      The credit inthe amount o f US$75 million equivalent became effective inApril, 1995,
and was the first policy-based loan to the country. Cofinancing o f US$3 million equivalent
was provided by the Government o f the Netherlands. The credit was disbursed from April

'*World Bankreport. This was comparableto other CIS republics.

 1995, to January, 1996, and closed on the original closing date o f June 30, 1996. The RC was
implementedconcurrently with the IBC, which aimedto build government capacity.

Outcome

4.4        Outcome i s assessedas satisfactory, with most major objectives achieved, and only
minor shortcomings. Macroeconomicstabilization was successful: the monthly inflation
rate fell from an average o f 64 percent inthe first three quarters o f 1994 to an average o f
3 percent inthe first nine monthsof 1995. The exchange rate (the currency was then the
"coupon") was stable after the end o f 1994.19 Economic growthresumed, with an increase in
GDP o f2.6 percent in 1995 and 10.5 percent in 1996, albeit from a very low base. The fiscal
deficit declined substantially (Table 1.l), mainly through reduction o f expenditures,
                                                       although
as tax revenues rose only slowly. Inpriceandtrade liberalization, the government abolished
the export tax andreduced the numberof items subject to export licensing andquotas. Most
price controls were eliminated,*' the foreign exchange surrender requirement was abolished,
and inJune 1995, the state order system was also abolished.
4.5        Inthe areaofrestructuringgovernment, the government in 1995reduced the number
o f budgetary positions by 40 percent, well above the R C target of 25 percent. Most o f this
occurred inthe health sector, where inAugust 1995, 130,000 workers were removed from
the budget, andbeganwork under contract to their newly-independentfacilities. Inthe area
ofprivatization, by December 1995, around6,400 small enterprises were privatized, up from
1,700 just a year earlier. Progress was also achieved incorporatization o f medium and large
firms. Actual privatization o f large enterprises occurred more slowly than envisioned under
the credit, however (see Annex 4). The MPP, designed with the assistance o f the Bank,
beganinmid-1995,utilizing voucher auctions as the principal means o fprivatization for
medium and large-sized enterprises. Fiscal transfers to large enterprises beganto dwindle,
and were virtually gone by the completion of SAC 11. In 1996, a law on land ownership was
adopted giving individuals the right to own, lease, and inherit land.
4.6       Regarding the improved targeting of social benefits: pensions to working pensioners
were ended; certain categories o f child and deathbenefits were eliminated; and modest
increases were made inpensions and other benefits paid to the neediest. Finally, initial
efforts to strengthen thefinancial sector were completed (see Annex 3), including diagnostic
reviews o f 5 state-owned banks, anddevelopment o frestructuring/privatization plans for
them; elimination o fdirected credits from NBG; andimprovedprudential supervisionby
NBG. A new commercial banking law was adopted in 1996. However, it should be kept in
mindthat the sector suffers from very low levels offinancial intermediation, andconsequently
its role in facilitating economic developmenthas been limited(Annex 3).




19As noted earlier, stabilization laidthe groundwork for the introduction of a new national currency in September
1995.

electricity prices were raised substantially under the RC.

Sustainability

4.7      Sustainability o f reforms under the RC i s highly likely, as compared to likely inthe
ES. These reforms havebecome part o fthe fabric o f Georgiansociety, andhavebeen
reinforced by Georgia's membership inthe WTO, as well as by subsequent Bank and Fund
operations. Citizens appreciate the macroeconomic stability inthe country, and would
oppose irresponsible macroeconomic policy. And the country's budget stringencies tend to
limit the potential for expansion o fthe bureaucracy.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

4.8      ID1was substantial, the same as the ratinginthe ES. Liberalizationo fthe trade
regime, including elimination o fthe state order system, improved the efficiency o fresource
utilization. Similarly, the downsizing o f government and privatization o f small enterprises
encouraged more efficient use o fresources. And initial improvements were made inthe
financial sector.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

4.9     Bankperformance i s assessedas satisfactory. The Bank team moved quickly to enter
a dialogue with the government after hostilities died down. Bank performance was excellent,
except that the Bank team somewhat underestimated the political difficulties attendant to
reforms that requiredlegislation, e.g., landprivatization, bankruptcy, anti-monopoly laws,
which were passed later. The Bank also underestimated the difficulty o f improving the
performance o f revenue mobilization.
4.10    Borrowerperformance was satisfactory, as compared to highlysatisfactory inthe ES,
especially considering that the Civil War hadjust ended and that there was a substantial lack
o f capacity. Progress was not as rapid as expected inthe areas o fnew laws on land
privatization, bankruptcy, and anti-monopoly (which were passedlater), and revenue
mobilization, which improvedmore slowly than envisioned.


5.      First StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC I)

Objectives

5.1     The mainobjective o fthe credit was to consolidate the stabilization, foster a strong
and sustained growth recovery, and reduce poverty. This was to be achieved through
implementationo f a reform program aimed at: maintaining a tight monetary program
supported by an improving fiscal position; streamlining the government sector and improving
the efficiency o fpublic spending; andinducing a rapid adjustment o fthe productive sector to
new market signals. Among the keyreforms sought were: (a) removal o f tax exemptions and
strengthening o f tax administration; (b) improving collection inenergy payments;
(c) changes inthe provision and financing o f social services; (d) acceleration o fprivatization;
(e) restructuring the financial sector; and (f)trade liberalization and promotion.
Macroeconomic objectives included ensuringthe sustainability o f the reform process and

                                                          15


financing critical imports neededto foster growth recovery and provide budgetary support to
maintain a level o fbasic public expenditures.

5.2        SAC Iwas o fmodest relevance to the country at its stage o f development.
Macroeconomic stabilization was clearly a key to sustained growth, and two years after the
hyperinflation, a strong emphasis on consolidating the stabilization was essential. Giventhe
country's low (but rising) level o f tax revenues and large fiscal deficit, action inthis areawas
appropriate. Improved energy collections could serve as a foundation for a healthier sector,
and quicker privatization and trade liberalization could provide a basis for an emerging
private sector.

5.3       However, the credit didnot address corruption, which was increasingly recognized as
a key barrier to economic development (see para. 5.16). Also, considering that poverty
alleviation was one o f three overarching objectives, the credit design gave insufficient weight
to this area-a       critical shortcoming inan area o f great importance to the Bank and its
mission. And while the inclusion o f efforts to bolster the financial sector was appropriate,
the country's very low levels o f intermediation limit the benefits that can be derived
(Annex 3).

5.4       The quality o f SAC Idesignwas also diminished, as was that o f the other adjustment
operations considered by this PPAR, by an undue emphasis on counting the numbers o f
enterprises privatized, with inadequate attention to the quality o f privatization.21 This
emphasis shiftedthe focus from other important goals such as facilitating bankruptcy and
liquidation, and promoting the entry o fnew firms. Privatization hadbeen expected to lead to
significant gains inthe short- to medium-term-and                  a decrease inthe fiscal burdenwas
achieved-but         institutional weakness and lack o fprogress on enterprise restructuring and
governance, among other factors, limitedthe gains.22 SAC Idesign was also diminishedby
its reliance on "energy collections" as a key measure o f progress and condition for tranche
release.23As described inAnnex 2, this was an unreliable indicator.


ImplementationExperience

5.5       SAC Ibecame effective inJune 1996, and an initial tranche o f US$30 million
(equivalent) was disbursedagainst the achievement o f specified conditions (e.g., budget
deficit a maximum of 3-4 percent, allocation o f a minimumbudgetary share to health and
education, privatization o f most small enterprises, privatization o f state banks and
establishment o fbank certification program). The second tranche, also o f US$30 million,

21This deficiency is discussed in World Bank, OED, "IDA Review o f Private Sector Development," March 2001       ."
However, it should be noted that Georgia's privatization conformed to the "best practice" o f that period. Expost
reviews have clarified that implementation o f complementary measures-e.g.,    stronger enterprise governance and
legal protection for minority shareholders and other investors-would    probably have increased the gains from
 rivatization.
  See "IDA Review of Private Sector Development," op. cit; "World Bank, "Transition: the First Ten Years,"     2002,

and World Bank, "Between State and Market: Mass Privatization in Transition Economies," September, 1997.
23"Energy collections" refers to the degree to which consumers and organizations are current in their payments to
energy suppliers. Inmost instances, they apply both to end consumers as well as to payments between energy
suppliers and distribution companies.

was disbursedinDecember 1996, as planned; the credit closed on the original closing date in
December 1997. SAC Iwas prepared at a time when the first benefits of the stabilization
program begununder the RC could be seen. Georgia made rapid reform progress during
SAC I, conditions for tranche release were met, andno waivers were requested.
          all


Outcome

5.6       Taking account o f the modest overall relevance o f the SAC objectives, and
unsatisfactory efficacy inachieving some o f them, the SAC Ioutcome i s rated moderately
unsatisfactory, as compared to satisfactory inthe ES.24Although most key objectives were
achieved, they did little to ameliorate Georgia's most pressingdevelopment problems,
including poverty andpublic corruption. Shortcomings inthe way energy sector reforms
were conceived and implemented, together with the project's negligibleimpact on corruption
and poverty alleviation, contribute to the rating o f outcome.

5.7       Areas o fpositive achievement include the macroeconomic area, where the credit
successfully supported stabilization: The budget deficit declined slowly (and continued to
decline through 2001). While the credit's inflation goal o f 25 percent for 1996 was
exceeded-inflation          was 39.3 percent in 1996-inflation           declined the following year and has
since remained at a relatively low level (except for 1999). Revenue mobilization, at
10.6 percent of GDP in 1996, exceeded the SAC Igoal o f 6.7 percent. Regarding
streamlining government expenditures, achievement was also satisfacto ry. Some 11,000
positions were eliminated inthe education sector-a
top of a 1995 decrease o f 33 percent for the sector.25 Fees were introduced for tuition in loth
                                                                    furtherdecreaseo faround 7 percent on

grade and above, and for some activities. Government salaries were increasedby around 40
percent but pay levels still remained very low. The Government implemented a newbenefit
targeting approach, replacing the existing child allowance system, that better targeted
vulnerable groups. Prior to Board consideration, the retirement age was increased by 5 years,
andpayroll taxes to the Employment and Social Security Funds were reduced.
Responsibility for payment o f sickness benefits was shifted from the government to
employers.

5.8       Other objectives were only partially achieved, or were fully achieved, but had little
meaningful impact. For example, inthe health sector, reforms begun under the RC
continued and management was devolved to individual facilities; a newpayment system was
implemented; and a new accreditation system was implemented. Health sector reforms also
included privatization o f drugstores and dentists' offices, and the start o fprivatization o f
polyclinics (Annex 5). Yet, although healthsystemrestructuring was achieved, the
country's poor fiscal position significantly reducedthe benefits derived. It shouldalso be
noted that throughout the period covered by this PPAR, health outcomes measured interms o f
life expectancy at birth, infant and under-five mortality rate and maternal mortality rate worsened
significantly (although they compare favorably with other CIS countries; see Annex 5).26 Infant


24 Given that the credit's objectives were only modestly relevant, achievement under    SAC Iwas insufficient to
warrant a more positive rating o f outcome.

26The information in the section i s based on the discussion in the PER, op. cit., p 85-86.

mortality increased from 9 deaths per 1,000live births in 1991to 24 in2000. Similarly, the
maternal mortalityrate inGeorgia i s 51per 100,000 live birthswhich, while low incomparison
to other developing countries, i s up from 32.4 in 1993. The incidence o f infectious and parasitic
diseases has also increased substantially, as it has for all the CIS countries. Achievement inthe
health area was unsatisfactory.

5.9       Inthe energy sector, reportedenergycollectionsincreased from around 10percent in
1995 to around 65 percent inlate 1996, and a 30 percent tariff increase for electricity was
implemented. Inaddition, a framework was adopted to restructure the sector, and create
separate generation, distribution, and transmission companies (which was later successfully
accomplished). However, while the actions envisioned inthe SAC were nominally achieved,
the expected improvements inthe energy sector didnot occur. While data on the financial
performance o f energy companies are not available, a 1997 Bank s t ~ d estimated that the   9 ~
quasi-fiscal deficit o f the electricity sector was 3 percent o f GDP in 1997,3.6 percent in
1998, and 4.3 percent in 1999 (based on 4 months data).28 The worsening performance o f the
sector at the same time that improved collections were beingreportedprobably reflects
corruption and the inaccuracy of the collection data, which were subsequently acknowledged
as inaccurate by Bank staff. Because o fthe worsening overall situation inthe sector, SAC I
achievement inthis area i s assessedas unsatisfactory.

5.10      Inthe areaofremoval of tax exemptions and strengtheningof tax administration,
although the measures foreseen were implemented,the gains proved illusory, as numerous
subsequent attempts had to be made to achieve the same goals. For example, although most
tax exemptions were eliminated inMarch 1996,the Parliament regularly added new ones,
narrowing the tax base and reducing revenue (Annex 1). The new tax and customs laws
drafted during SAC I(with the assistance o f the IMF)were excellent, but they were
underminedand circumvented by exemptions introducedby Parliament and continued
corruption inthe State Tax Service. However, as noted earlier, revenueperformance
exceeded the goals set inSAC I,          and consequently achievement inthis area i s assessedas
moderately satisfactory.

5.11 Accomplishment o f SAC Igoals inthe area ofprivatization i s assessedas moderately
satisfactory, as privatization o f small enterprises was nearly completed, with over one
thousand additional firms privatized-reaching               around 8,100, or 90 percent o f the universeo f
9,000 enterprise^.^^ Landprivatization moved forward, with around 54 percent o f cultivated
land under private ownership, and a Law on Land Ownership and a LandRegistration and
Titling Law were passed in 1996. The State Bread Corporation was privatized, as were more
than 500 medium and large enterprises, mainly through voucher sales. However, as
described below under SAC 11, a large majority o f the book value o f the medium and large
firms remained in state hands.

5.12      Achievement infinancial sector reform was satisfactory. The bank certification
program initiated in 1995 was completed, and the number o fbanks declined from 229 in


21World Bank, report on power sector deficit.
28Insubsequent years, the quasi-fiscal deficit declined as major units were privatized (see Annex 2).
29It was later determinedthat there were around 10,000 small enterprises, with nearly all eventually privatized.

                                                    18


March 1995, to 65 by November 1996. DuringSAC I, three former state banks (FSBs)
                                                            the
reached agreement with NBGto improve their operations inaccordance with a time-bound
program that requiredthemto meet specific benchmarks. Completion of this program would
bringthem into compliancewith NBGprudentialregulations. SAC Irequiredthat all three
banks be pri~atized;~'     however, failure o f the employees and managers o fAgrobank to
complete payment left 27 percent o fthe shares o f that bank instate hands. (Agrobank was
sold to a Russianbank during SAC 11) However, as notedearlier, the sector suffers from very
low levels of financial intermediation, andconsequently its role infacilitating economic
development has been limited.

5.13    Inthe areaoftrade liberalization andpromotion, achievement was satisfactory.
Exportprohibitions on certain products were removed, an ex ante registration requirement o f
export contracts abolished, and an adequate foreign investmentcode was adopted.

Sustainability

5.14    Sustainability o fthe reforms achieved under SAC Ii s likely. The sustainability o f
trade liberalization i s enhanced bythe country's membershipinthe WTO, and its consistent
support o f a liberal trade regime since the mid 1990s. Financial sector reforms have
considerable support within the government, and Georgians are cognizant that they have not
suffered a failure o ftheir financial system as have a number o f other transition countries.
Aside from 1999, strong macroeconomic management since 1994 provides reason to believe
that it will continue satisfactorily (see discussion under SAC 11. Given the perennial lack o f
budgetary resources, it would seem unlikelythat social sector reforms-including         the
restructuring ofthe health system-will be undone, or that government agencies will be
expanded. Enterprise privatizationhas become an accepted part o f Georgian society, and
there has beenno serious discussion o fbacktracking.

InstitutionalDevelopment Impact

5.15    ID1is assessedas modest, the same as inthe ES. SAC Ihad amodest influence on
improving the country's ability to make use o f its productive resources through
improvements inmacroeconomicpolicy management, reductions inthe size o f government,
privatization, financial sector reform, and trade liberalization, as well as the first steps in
restructuring the health sector. As noted above, expectedbenefits inthe area o f energy
restructuring did not eventuate inthe long run.


Bank and BorrowerPerformance

5.16    Bankperformance i s assessedas unsatisfactory. Quality at entry and project design
were unsatisfactory; weaknesses included inadequate emphasis on poverty alleviation; undue
reliance on energy collections as a measure o f compliance; and excessive reliance on




30With zero direct state ownership.

                                                 19


counting the numberso f enterprises privatized (which probably detracted from other
important aspects o fprivate sector development). Also, the project did not address the
country's pervasivecorruption or weak govemance. Supervisionwas generally effective.

5.17    Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. While there was nominal compliance
with project conditionality, the energy sector's financial status deteriorated (para. 5.9); the
worsening performance at the same time that improved collections were beingreported
probably reflected corruption and inaccurate data. Inthe area o ftax administration, the
Borrower-as     observed with the benefito f greater time-tolerated    andor fostered an
environment inwhich theft and corruption were so pervasive that reforms were undermined,
and economic development was hindered (although revenuetargets were met).


6.      Second StructuralAdjustment Credit (SAC 11)

Objectives

6.1     The objectives o fthis credit were to: strengthen public finance while maintaining a
prudent monetary policy; develop the private sector; and alleviate poverty. The key reforms
supported were measures to improve tax revenuecollection; restructure public spending;
accelerate privatization; develop capital markets; improve financial discipline inthe energy
sector; restructure the banking sector; and reform the provision and financing o f social
services (to prevent the deterioration of humancapital). Macroeconomic objectives included
financing critical imports and easing fiscal adjustment by financing current and capital
expenditures as well as closing the country's financial gap.

6.2     SAC I1largely continued the reform thrusts o fthe earlier program. Many structural
reforms had already been achieved-including       price, trade, and exchange rate reform, as well
as privatization o fmost small enterprises. Clearly, continued prudentmonetarypolicy and
economic stabilization were an essential precondition key to continued growth. Private
sector development was intended to foster the role o fprivate firms as an engine o f growth.
However, while SAC I1addressedpoverty by supporting a poverty assessment and
specifying minimumbudgetary allocations for health and education, the weight o f these
actions was not commensurate with the importance o f these issues to the Bank's mission.
Also, the Credit didnot adequately address corruption, an increasingly important and well-
known obstacle to economic development. And as with SAC I,          the design o f SAC I1was
diminished by undue emphasis on counting the number of enterprises privatized and on the
use o f energy collections as a measure o f compliance. Consequently, SAC I1objectives are
assessedas having modest relevance.


ImplementationExperience

6.3     SAC I1was approved in September 1997. The first tranche o f US$40 million was
disbursedupon effectiveness inNovember 1997 against achievement o f specified conditions
(e.g., implementationof teacher certification, increase inelectricity prices, achievement o f
65 percent collection rate for electricity, "zero price" auctions for enterprise privatization,

                                                            20


minimumbudgetaryshares for social sector) andthe second and last tranche ofUS$20
 million, inDecember 1998. Two specified conditions for the secondtranche were not met,
 and a waiver was issued (see below).


 Outcome

 6.4      Outcome overall i s assessedas unsatisfactory, as compared to marginally satisfactory
 inthe ES. The credit had shortcomings inthekeyareas ofstrengthening public finance,
 maintaining a prudentmonetary policy, preventingthe deterioration ofhumancapital,
 alleviating poverty, and improving the financial performance o f the energy sector. These
 deficiencies detracted from the credit's achievements infostering privatization, restructuring
 the health sector, increasingenergytariffs and establishing a solid energy regulatory regime.

 6.5     Performance in macroeconomic stabilization, strengtheningpublicflnance, and
 maintaining aprudent monetarypolicy was negatively affectedby the 1998 Russiancrisis.
 Georgia's monetary aggregates had grown strongly before the crisis, against a backgroundo f
declining inflation and exchange rate ~tability.~'              Butthe Russiacrisis as well as widespread
concern over domestic budgetary problems triggeredan exchange rate crisis, which
necessitated the floating o fthe lari inDecember 1998;inthe event, it depreciated by
45 percent. With respect to improving revenue performance, tax revenue as a percent o f
 GDP leveled off in 1998, after 4 consecutive years of growth, androse gradually after that,
reflecting generally satisfactory performance. However, the Government was reluctant to cut
 expenditures before the elections, and following the Russia crisis, exports fell and tax
revenues plummeted.The 1998 revenue shortfall ledto the substantial accumulation o f
 expenditure arrears, especially inhealth and education.32The IMF Executive Board observed
that: ". .little headway hadbeenmade in addressing deep-seated fiscal problems since the
          ,
 end o f 1997.Although the external environmenthadbeen difficult, the mainsources of
weakness had been policy slippages. Directors observed that weak governance and
widespread corruption hadplayed a major role, and that these problems needed to be
 addressedurgently."33After the close o f the credit, Governmentwage andpension arrears
 surged, reaching 3.5 percent o f GDP (accumulated stock) inmid-2000, and inlate 1999 the
IMFarrangement was suspended for eighteenmonths.34 Outcome inthe above areas is
 assessedas unsatisfacto ry.

6.6      Poverty worsened during SAC I1and subsequently(para. 1.lo), as the country's
modest growth after 1998 was accompanied by a less equitable income distribution andno
net increase in employment. The Bank's Poverty Assessment stated that the Government
was not successful inimplementingthe recommended measures to reduce poverty.35 While
thepoverty assessment undertakenunder SAC I1(and fundedby SATAC 11)was certainly a

34The stock o f expenditure arrears, principally for govemment wages and salaries and social security payments, grew
bynearly 300 million lari-or    4.8 percent of GDP-in    the four years 1997-2000. (IMFdata).
35These measures included: sustained GDP growth; improved capacity for income redistribution through taxation and
expenditure policies; creating incentives to foster private sector employment; protection o f existing level of poverty-
focused transfers; and selected targeted regional interventions. World Bank, "Georgia Poverty Update," op. cit.

step inthe right direction, it was an inadequate step compared to the magnitude o f the
problem and the centrality o fpoverty to the Bank's mission. Consequently, outcome i s
assessedas highly unsatisfactory inthis area. The relatively modest efforts to improve the
efficiency of public spending were satisfactory. Around 19,000 budgetarypositions were
eliminated in 1997, and inparallel, civil service salaries were substantially increased.

6.7       Inthe areaofpreventing the deterioration of human capital, the government didnot
meet the condition that the approved 1998 budgetinclude 7.3 percent and 13.0 percent
allocations for health and education respectively, and requested a waiver for release o f the
second tranche, which was granted.36 At first, the government artificially increased the
allocation for healthby attempting to include the full undisbursedbalance o f the IDAhealth
project inthe Ministry budget. After discussions with IDA, the government agreed to
increase allocations to health duringthe actual implementation o fthe budget, which was
done. Aside from the issue o fBorrower commitment, which was clearly lacking inthis
instance, outcome data for health showing increased morbidity and mortality (Annex 5)
indicate that efforts to stem the deterioration o f human capital were not successful. Also, as
noted earlier, fiscal constraints severely limitedthe benefits from sectoral restructuring.
Achievement inthis area is assessedas unsatisfactory.

6.8       Inthe energy sector, asecond waiver for second tranche release was requested
regarding the condition that the average electricity collection rate (wholesale and retail) be
raised to 70 percent for 1997 and 85 percent for 1998. Reported collection rates for the first
nine months o f 1998 were 58 percent for distribution companies and 65 percent for
transmission companies. The region concluded that collections had risen considerably inthe
previous several years,37and that the remaining improvement could not be achieved "without
restructuring the industryas a whole," and requested a waiver. Acknowledging that the main
purpose o fthis condition was to improve the financial condition o f the power sector (see next
paragraph), the waiver was recommended"based on measures [already] taken to reach
financial sustainability."

6.9       However, corruption and inaccurate data mislead the Bank, and inactuality,
collections inthe state-owned sector deteriorated after 1997, which contributed to the
deterioration o fthe quasi-fiscal deficit (Annex 2). However, Telasi was able, with
considerable effort, to increase its collections, which reportedly rose to 63 percent by 2002.3*
It is arguable that withholding this tranche might have inducedthe government to enforce
greater payment discipline inthis area; the granting o f the waiver was unwarranted.

6.10      An important SAC I1accomplishment was the raising o f electricity tariffs. In 1997,
the price o f electricity was increased around 40 percent, to U S 3.5 cents/ kwh. The
foundation o f an energy regulatory body-the                National Electricity Regulatory Commission
(NERC)-was          established under SAC 11. Regulations were issuedgoverning the




36 The government later revised its 1998budget to include a higher allocation for health.
3 1Collections were reported to be 20 percent overall in 1995.
38 Telasi supplies around 40 percent of the country's electricity.

                                                      22


relationships between various firms inthe sector; a new tariff methodology was adopted
(resulting inthe electricity price levels noted above); andNERC issuedlicenses to firms in
the sector.

6.11 Inretrospect, although many o fthe energy sector conditions were nominally
achieved, they did not achieve the objective of "improving financial discipline inthe energy
sector," and the credit didnot result inan adequate foundation for a robust energy sector. As
described inAnnex 2, the collection rate for electricity declined inthe last 4 years-except
for Telasi-and       the financial condition o fthe remaining state-owned energy firms
deteriorated, and no further privatizations o f distribution companies occurred.39
Consequently, SAC I1outcome inthe energy sector i s assessedas unsatisfactory.
6.12     Inthe areaofdeepening healthsector structural reform, restructuringhadstarted in
1995, andcontinued through SAC II.40           Around 20 percent o fhospitals and polyclinics in
Tbilisi were privatized, less inother areas; inaccordance with the master plan adopted,
rationalization efforts succeeded inreducing the number o fhospitals by 33 percent, and the
bedcount by 60 percent.41 While these reforms were successfully implemented, the country's
poor fiscal condition reduced its ability to benefit from the restructuring; poor facility
governance and low regulatory capacity limited the returns.42 It should also be reiteratedthat
health outcomes deteriorated over the period covered by this PPAR. Equityinaccess to
health care-a      key goal o fthe program-was        reduced by physicians' reliance on informal
payments bypatients. And the control o f accreditation bythe Ministry o f Education-which
had little incentive to maintainhigh standards among health professionals (Annex 5)-
limitedthe gains inthis area. Implementation o fthe health sector structural reforms
undoubtedly made the situation better than it would otherwise have been. However, despite a
well-designedprogram and strong govemment support, outcome inthis areamustbe
assessedas moderately unsatisfactory.

6.13     Inthe areaofprivatization, achievement was satisfactory. Progress was made in
privatizing mediumand large enterprises, and the government initiated "zero auctions" i.e.,
those with no minimumprice, for firms that had not sold earlier. Large firms that accounted
for 40 percent o f the book value o f the large enterprise category were privatized, more than
fulfilling the condition o f25 percent. However, while the government had committedto the
privatization o f 109 enterprises with a book value o f at least US$60 million (of the 140in
that subcategory), in fact it privatized 91, arguing that 22 energy firms from another category
should count against the goal. The Bank's argument inapproving second tranche release was
that the condition had been"met insubstance," and this PPAR agrees with that judgment.

6.14    Inthefinancial sector, progress begununderthe earlier operations continued, and so
achievement i s assessedas satisfactory. Agrobank was restructured and a majority share
(54 percent) purchased by a Russianbank. As detailed inAnnex 3, bank supervision

continued to improve, and most banking indicators remained relatively steady through the
1998 Russian crisis. Incapital markets development, the credit supported enactment o fthe
Law on the Securities Market (1998) and establishment o f other measures to support capital
markets infrastructure. While these measureswere successful, the market is still very thin,
with only a few hours o ftrading per week.43And the market for government securities is
limitedto small amounts o f short-term bills.

6.15     Inthe education sector, achievement was moderately Satisfactory, as the government
metthe minimumbudgetary allocation for 1998 o f 13 percent, substantially raisedteacher
salaries, and successfully conducted a program o f re-certifying teachers. However,
enrollment inpre-school and upper secondary education fell sharply duringthe period
covered by this PPAR, which tends to detract from the SAC I1accomplishments (see
Annex 6 for a more detailed discussion o f education reform).


Sustainability

6.16     While many o f the credit's objectives were not met, those benefits that were achieved
are assessedas likely to be sustainable. Revenue performance, while not meeting
expectations, has risen gradually. Similarly, increases inenergy tariffs, an important
achievement, have been sustained since the start o f the transition and the government seems
to have the political will to maintain them. Improvements infinancial sector regulationwere
successful, the country's financial sector was relatively unaffected by the 1998 Russia crisis,
and the government would seem to have a strong incentive to maintain the new regime.

InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

6.17     ID1was modest, with accomplishments including the energy regulatory regime;
privatization; and increased energy tariffs. These were outweighed, however, by
shortcomings inhealth sector reforms which were initially successful but which did not
achieve the impact envisioned due to poor facility governance and low regulatory capacity;44
and education reforms, where achievement was moderately satisfactory when decreased
access i s taken into account.

Bankand BorrowerPerformance

6.18     Bankperformance was unsatisfactory, compared to satisfactory inthe ES. The SAC
I1design didnotreflect an adequate emphasis onpoverty alleviation and anti-conuption
measures. SAC 11's reliance on "energy collections" detracted from its effectiveness. Within
the donor community at the time there was considerable skepticism regarding the validity o f
these numbers as supplied by the g~vernment;~~ESAC, which became effective
                                                             the
21 months after SAC 11, placedminimal reliance on these data.

                                                        24


6.19      The Bank's granting o f a waiver for lower than envisioned energy collections was, in
hindsight,unwise. The effort bythe government to circumvent the letter and spirit o fthe
budgetary allocation to health should have alerted Bank staffthat Borrower commitment was
flagging. Inaddition, the macroeconomic situation was unsettledinNovember-December,
 1998, when the Bank was considering a waiver for tranche release.46 Inretrospect, issuance
o f a waiver inthis instance was unwarranted, and the Bank should have delayed
disbursement o fthe second tranche, which would have sent a clearer message to the
government.

6.20     Borrower performance was highly unsatisfactory, compared to satisfactory inthe ES.
Onthe positive side, the modest efforts under SAC I1to improve the efficiency o fpublic
spendingwere successful. Action to increase electricity tariffs-which                    took considerable
political courage-and      the development o f an effective energy regulatorybody, were
successful. And actions to strengthenthe financial sector and raise tax revenues were largely
successful.

6.21     However, Borrower performance inmaintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic
framework was deficient, as described above inpara. 6.5. Borrower efforts to alleviate
poverty were unsuccessful, as were efforts to prevent the deterioration o fhuman capital-
where the government attempted to circumvent both the letter and spirit o f SAC
conditionality. Collection rates inthe state-owned energy sector were inadequate and
misleading, reflecting insufficient action by the government to improve the culture inthat
sector, where theft and corruption were endemic. Overall, the Borrower did not maintain
policies and conditions that supported achievement of project objectives.


7.       EnergySector Adjustment Credit (ESAC)

Objectives

7.1      The objectives o fthe Credit were to: (a) maintain the momentum o freform; (b) help
mitigate its social costs; (c) enhance financial management; (d) combat corruption;
(e) increase energy availability on a sustainable basis; (f) catalyze private investment;
(g) realize Georgia's pipelinetransit potential; and (h) upgrade environmental management.47
Prior to consideration o f ESAC by the Bank Board, the Tbilisi distribution company, Telasi,
was sold (for US$250 million) to an American investor experienced inthe region, AES;
privatizationwas a pre-Board condition. The other main ESAC conditions were that the
remaining electricity distribution companies be offered for sale, tariff increases be

program for 1999." SAC I1Memorandum for releaseo f SecondTranche, December 21, 1998.

implemented, legal measures be implementedto facilitate construction o ftransit pipelines,
the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) commence operation, andpoverty benefit arrears
be cleared.

7.2      The ESAC objectives were highly relevant. They were designedto providean
impetusto the ongoing effort to restructure andprivatize the energy sector. The Bank
strategy o f seeking to privatize the distribution companies as a first step was sound, as it had
the potential to generate revenue critical to the sector's financial health and for use in
rehabilitating decrepit equipment. Inparticular, because the capacity and authority o f the
Georgian state were so limited, reforms short o fprivatization-such                as the
commercialization o f firms still under government ownership-would                    not have been
appropriate (and indeedwere not successful where they were tried).


ImplementationExperience

7.3      The ESAC was approved inJune 1999. The first tranche ofUS$12.5 millionwas
disbursed upon effectiveness against achievement of specified conditions (e.g., privatization
o f Telasi, offering for sale o fremaining distributionand generation assets, new Electricity
law, and an increase inelectricity tariffs), and it was expected that the second (and last)
tranche would be disbursedinearly 2000. Disbursement was delayedby the deterioration o f
economic policies inlate 1999, but implementation o fmost energy sector reforms continued.
Inthe secondhalfof2000, macroeconomicperformanceimproved (para 1.7). Two
disbursementso fthe PGRFwere made inJanuary andMarch2001, andthe IMF supported
disbursementof the ESAC second tranche. However, the IMF's May review ofthe PGRF
program was delayed because of performance shortcomings, and disbursemento f the ESAC
second tranche o f US$l1.5 million was delayed untilDecember 2001,


Outcome

7.4      Outcome was satisfactoy.Most importantly, the sale o f Telasi beganthe process of
improving financial management inthe sector and stemmingits fiscal drain. Inthe three
years since AES's entry, non-paying customers have been disconnected, Telasi collection
rates have risen, and tamper-resistant meters have been installed.48 Inaddition, a new actor
enteredthe sector which had a strong incentive to fight corr~ption.While the progress o f
                                                                                     ~ ~
the newly-private firmhas not been smooth, there i s no question that the privatizedportion o f
the electricity sector i s inmuch better condition than would have beenthe case ifit had
remainedinstate hands.

7.5      Inaddition, while data on the availability ofelectricity inGeorgia are difficult to
obtain, the supply (inTbilisi) seems to be improving. The measure most often used inthis
context i s the wintertime availability of electricity inTbilisi. Anecdotal reports indicate an


48Some of the cost of the new meters was supportedby USAID, which also transferred around US$lO million for
"winter heat" (2001-2002) which was eventually paidto Telasi.
49So while corruption remains an enormous obstacleto development, the introduction o f AES i s considered as having
achieved objective (d), combating corruption.

                                                       26


improvement inthis measure since 1999, and Table 7.1 below provides partial data for the
last two winters that reinforce this conclusion (objective [e],increase energy availability).

7.6     In2000, AES purchased the largestthermal generation facility inthe country-the
Gardabani plant-which         hadbeenresponsible for incurringconsiderable govemment-backed
debt inpayment for fuel.50 This purchase further reinforced the positive effects o f the Telasi
privatization. These accomplishments contributed to the achievement o f objectives (a),
maintainingthe momentum o freform, and (c) improving financial management ofthe sector.

7.7     Additional private investment was made inpipeline facilities, with the so-called
early-oil pipeline from Bakuto Supsa commencing operations and earning around US$lO-1I
million annually. InSeptember 2002, ground was broken for the 1,100 mileBaku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhanpipeline, to transport oil from Azerbaijan to the Turkishport o f Ceyhan. This
pipeline has the potential to earn US$42 million per year for the country (see Annex 2).
Also, the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline along roughly the same route i s expected to be
completed by 2005, earning additional revenue or payment inkind. These investments,
together with the privatizations described earlier, comprised the achievement o f objectives
(f), catalyzingprivate investment, and (g), realizing the country's pipelinetransit potential.

7.8     The credit helpedmitigate the social costs o f reform (objective b). A poverty benefits
program-covering       around 45,000 families-established            as part o fthe program supported by
the credit, was inarrears as the Government was slow to pay the stipulated benefits after the
1998 financial crisis. However, inaccordance with ESAC conditionality, the accumulated
arrears were repaid, although with some delay, and the paymentsbecame more regular in
2001. The Government continued to disburse poverty benefits in2002, after ESAC closed,
and as of end-2002, payments were current.

7.9      Also, an acceptable natural gas tariffmethodology was implemented,and the country
adopted a law that clarified environmental liability (objective h). And specified firms inthe
energy sector adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS), and their 1999 financial
statements were audited.

7.10    After the sale o f Telasi, nearly all o f the remaining distribution capacity remained
state-owned; most assets were offered for sale, inaccordance with ESAC conditions, but no
offers were received. Corruption inthe state-owned energy sector worsened, as workers
apparently perceived that opportunities for rents mightbe lost ifthe state-owned firms were
sold.5' Beyondthe assets purchasedby AES, privatization didnot proceed due inlarge
measure to lack o f investor interest inthe assets remaining for sale. This was due to the
relative lack o f attractiveness o f the remaining,widely-dispersed firms; the unsatisfactory


50ESAC conditionality specifiedthat the remainingdistribution and generation capacitybe offeredfor sale.

experience o f existing private investors; and Georgia's poor climate for foreign investment.
Electricity collections inthe state-owned sector fell, andthe financial situation ofthe
remaining state-owned energy firms did not improve (See Annex 2 for more detail).
However, the sale o f Telasi and the Gardabani plant removed from public ownership the two
largest contributors to the country's enormous energy deficit.


Sustainability

7.11 Sustainability i s likely. Sustainability i s diminished by uncertainty over whether AES
will remaininGeorgia, and questions over Borrower commitment to reform stemming from
parliament's 13-monthdelay inratifying the Electricity Market Support Project (ESMP).
However, AES' operational and financial results are improving (see Figure A2.1 and Table
A2.3 inAnnex 2), and there i s no evidence that the company i s currently considering leaving
the country. The law on eminent domain seems likely to remain, as it underpinsthe potential
for the country to earn transit fees, and the other benefits achieved inthe area o f transit
pipelines seem likely to endure, as well, for similar reasons. Electricityprice increases seem
likely to continue; despite its fragmentation andweak govemance, the country has not
reneged on any o f the energy price increases put into place since independence, all o f which
were u n p o p ~ l a r .Overall, the country's continued dependence on and involvement with
                        ~ ~
InternationalLendingInstitutions-with               their emphasis onmaintainingpovertybenefits at a
current level-enhances       sustainability.


InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact

7.12     ID1was substantial, compared to modest inthe ES andthe ICR. The ESAC made a
significant contribution to the country's ability to utilize its financial resources by the
privatization o f Telasi and Gardabani. Additionally, the changes inthe legal and regulatory
regime pertinent to pipeline operation enabled the country to attract considerable investment
inthat area, whichwill result insubstantial future transit fees. Finally, laws andregulations
pertaining to environmental aspects of pipeline operationwere adopted.

BankandBorrowerPerformance

7.13    Bankperformance was highly satisfactory. Qualityat entry was highly satisfactory,
as the project contributed to the momentum o f a sound sector policy. The project
appropriately focused on privatization as the strategy which could have the greatest impact
on the sector's enormous problems. The intensification o f theft and corruption was
envisioned as a possible response to privatization, but Bank staff and govemment officials
felt that achieving progress by success with AES/Telasi and continued privatization were the
best way to overcome this possibility. Supervision was also satisfactory: despite generally
satisfactory progress inimplementingstructural reforms, disbursement o f the second tranche
was delayed by nearly a year and a halfbecause o f unsatisfactorymacroeconomic




52As described inAnnex 2, electricity prices in dollar terms have risen consistently 1994-2001

performance. This delay, despite the government's pressing need for additional revenue, was
entirely appropriate under the circumstances. Both tranches were disbursed only after
completion o f all specifiedreforms.

7.14     Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Despite a positive and helpful attitude
towardprivatization o f energy assets (as noted above), the borrower did not maintain
policies and conditions that supported achievement of project goals:53


    0    Performance o f state-owned firms worsened; ineffect, theft accelerated inanticipation o f
         potential privatization, contributing to the sector's quasi-fiscal deficit.

    0    The state-owned dispatch organization divertedelectricity to nonpaying customers for
         political reasons; this damaged the financial viability o f the sector, and sometimes caused
         AES to impose rolling brownouts on its own paying customers

         The lengthand uncertainty o f court proceedings impeded AES from collecting funds due
         from customers; when AES discovered that some o f its employees were involved with
         theft, it fired them, butwas forced to rehire them on the order o fa Georgian court.

    0    The 13-monthdelay by Parliament inratifjmgESMP further diminished the interest of
         potential investors, who inany case were deterredby the poor investment climate-in
         part due to govemment policy. Regional and local interests who benefited from
         continued public ownership o f the remaining distribution companies impeded grouping
         them into potentiallysalable units.

    0    The government tolerated a culture inwhich revenue collection agencies hinderedthe
         operation o fprivate firms-including          AES andthe private firm managingWEM-by
         arbitrary demands for payment that were o f dubious legality.


8.       Lessons Learned

8.1      Georgia's weak governance severely limitsthe country's ability to create
conditions conducive to economic development and the effective use of development
assistance-The        problems that limit growth inGeorgia transcend economic policy. The
political and geographic fragmentation o f the country poses severe challenges to the
executive. The inability o f the executive to overcome obstacles posed by the parliament and
regional officials, establish a minimumlevel o f the rule o f law, and overcome a pervasive
culture o f corruption severely limits the country's ability to establish sustained, broad-based
growth with significant job creation.

8.2      For a country such as Georgia, which experienced economic collapse, it is
incumbent that the Bank give high priority to prompt measures that can directly
mitigate conditions for the poorest.




53This section is based on interviews with energy sector firms, govemment officials, and Bank staff.

                                                 29


8.3     Turnover on the country team limited program effectiveness-From             1994to
1998,there was one Country Economist for Georgia. Officials interviewed cited the benefits
that they believe this continuitybrought. However, since 1998, there have been3 Country
Economists, and an interval o f around6 months duringwhich the position was unfilled.
While there werejust two Country Directors duringthe periodcoveredby this PPAR, and
good continuity on the rest o fthe Country Team, the tumover diminished the continuity o f
the program, andprobablyconstrained the ESW that was performed.


8.4    A more robust and timely ESW programwould have been beneficial to the
design o f the reformprogram-The        Country's first poverty studywas completed in 1999;
the design o f the reform program would have benefited from earlier work inthis area. A
study o fthe "sources o fgrowth" might also have beenbeneficialbyidentifyingsectors from
which growth might be expected to flow, and then considering means by which to facilitate
such growth. A Public Expenditure Review-a         veryuseful analytical tool for a country with
Georgia's perennially weak fiscal situation-was     completed in 1996, and then not again until
2002. Fiduciary reports (CFAAs and CPARs) were completed infrequently. The rapid
tumover inCountry Economists was probably part o fthe reason for the weak ESW.

8.5    Turnover among policy officials hinderedreform progress-During              the seven
years coveredby this PPAR, there were seven Prime Ministers and four Ministers of Finance.
There was also substantial tumover among other officials concerned with implementingthe
reform program. For an official contemplating a brieftenure, it i s more difficult to
appreciate the benefits o f reform, and so this tumover made reform progress considerably
more difficult.

                            ExternalDebt and Revenue Mobilization

Debt

1.        Georgia has accumulated a large external debt, i s illiquid, and has a limited ability
to service this debt. As noted earlier, by 1994 Georgia had accumulated an external debt
ofUS$1 billion, mostlyto purchase natural gas and electricity. Around half o fthis
resulted from actions o f the former energy monopoly, Sakenergo, that were not
authorized by higher officials. (Sakenergo has now been divested o f nearly all o f its
assets.) The firm importednatural gas and electricity from neighboring countries' and
incurred substantial debt, most on commercial terms, and nearly all carrying a
government guarantee.

2.        The country's debt has been rescheduled more than a dozen times; the current level i s
around US$1.7 billion, roughly halfo f GDP. Around half i s to multilateral institutions, with
the other halfowedto other countries. All Bank lendinghasbeenon IDAterms. At a Paris
Club meeting inMarch, 2001, principal repayments for 2001/02 were rescheduled over 20
years, with an interest rate o f 4 percent for most o f the debt. Payments to Turkmenistan (to
which Georgia owes US$337 million) were restructured on the same terms, even though
Turkmenistan i s not a Paris Club member. The country's main vulnerability i s the lack o f
public sector liquidity and mobilization o f adequate revenue to service the debt. Despite the
earlier rescheduling agreements, debt service in2000 amounted to around 37 percent o f
central budget revenue. In2001, international reserves were around 1.2 months o f imports.

3.        A joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis2concludes that even with favorable
assumptions on revenuemobilization and macroeconomic perf~rmance,~there would be a
severe liquiditysqueeze in2003, and a need for additional debt rescheduling.
The ratio o fthe net present value o f debt to public revenuewould fall, under these
assumptions, from 356 percent in2000 to 252 percent by 2005. The ratio o f public debt
service to revenue-even       assuming stronger performance on revenue mobilization-would
rise to over 40 percent o f GDP in2003/04, before declining to 36 percent in2005. A
reduction inprojected disbursements on concessionary terms would intensifythe liquidity
squeeze.

4.        Assumingless robust export growth andrevenuemobilization, the analysis concludes
that the 2005 ratio o f the net present value o f debt to public revenuewould range from 263 to
318 percent, depending on debt rescheduling terms. The 2005 ratio o fpublic debt service to
revenue would range between 31to 43 percent in2005, also dependingon the terms.

Revenue Mobilization

5.        As shown inthe table below, tax revenue as apercent o f GDP improvedsignificantly
from 1994 to 1999, but has increased only slightly since then4 It should be noted that tax
revenue includesfunds earmarkedfor spec@ uses; in2001,for example, funds equal to 3.5
percent o f GDP were earmarked for extrabudgetary expenditures, and 4.6 percent for local
government expenditure^.^ So o f the tax revenue o f 14.6 percent o f GDP in2001, after
deduction o f earmarked funds, revenues o f around 6.5 percent o f GDP would be available for
all other purposes. This level o f revenue mobilizationmakes it more difficult for the central
government to service debt, finance satisfactory social services, maintainhuman capital, and
refurbishcritical infrastructure.6 And the lack o frevenue has beenparticularlydifficult for
thepoor.7

  Tax revenue i s used as a measure of overall revenue mobilization because (1) it was the measure usedinthe
adjustment operations reviewed in this PPAR; and (2) becausenon-tax revenue, e.g., privatization proceeds, i s
more erratic. Consequently "Tax Revenue" i s considered as a more accurate measure o f long-term sustainable
revenue mobilization.
  IMF,"Georgia: SecondReview Under the Three Year Agreement," November, 2002, p.20.
  Infrastructure requirements are massive. The IMFestimates that the energy sector would require around
US$1billion to bringfacilities up to modem standards, (IMF, "Recent Economic Developments," November
2001, op. cit.), while around US$200 million would be needed for the health sector, cf. Eurohealth, Autumn,
2001, op cit.

improvement inrevenue mobilization was too slow, especially over the last two years; at the same time, quasi-
fiscal subsidies (especially inthe energy sector) continued to have perverse distributive effects. Facedwith
constant lack o f funds, the Government failed to consistently finance benefits targeted to the poor and allowed a
substantial buildup o f arrears." 2002 PovertyUpdate, p. v.

7.      Inaddition, improvedrevenuemobilizationhasbeenthe subject of strong, sustained
efforts by other donors, including the IMF,USAID, and the EU. Improved revenue
performance has been the principal subject o f most IMFmissions duringthe period 1994-01.
Most recently, the IMF supported an advisor to assist incustoms reform and modernization,
with 3 two-month visits in2001and early 2002. The Fund's February, 2001, assessment o f
Georgia's State Customs Department (SCD) and its deficiencies i s not dissimilar from those
found inBank and Funddocuments five years earlier:

        "The geopolitical situation makes it difficult for SCD to control smugglingthrough
        certain regions o f the country. However the situation on secure borders and inland
        terminals still has immense room for improvement. Clearance and collection
        procedures are weak. Risk assessmentto operate selective controls i s not used.
        Control o f exemptions i s inadequate. Diversion o f transit cargoes i s a major source
        o f revenue leakage. The ASYCUDA computer system operates only inone location.
        The [privately contractedprogramo f pre-shipmentinspection] didnot attain its
        revenue targets; cooperation between the company and SCD are poor; and
        reconciliation o f assessments and actual collections i s difficult. The low level o f
        customs collections also results from poor staff commitment, lack o f integrity, and
        low remuneration."

Tax System

8.      Georgia introduced a comprehensive and modern Tax Code in 1997, with substantial
foreign assistance, principally from the IMF. The main taxes are the VAT, excise, income,

                                                    38                                        Annex 1


profit, social, and customs. Rates are moderately high, with the VAT at 20 percent, personal
income rates from 12 to 20 percent on a progressive scale, and corporate tax at a flat rate o f
20 percent.

9.        However, since enactment o f the law, numerous amendments have beenmade. Some
have been to improve tax collection and administration, but most were the result o f interest
group lobbying and have had the effect o f decreasing state revenue. For example, inthe
years 1997-2001,there were 75 amendments to the tax code pertaining to the VAT, as
summarized inthe Table below. Approximately 65 o f the changes made had the effect o f
decreasing state revenue, while 10 had the effect o f increasing state revenue.

10.      Prior to 1999,the M o F was responsible for revenue collection, but in 1999 the
Ministryo fRevenuewas createdto facilitate reforms. However, the MORwas never givena
clear vision o f its long-termrole and mission, and thus endedup implementinga number o f
separate programs initiatedby highofficials or by donors. The Customs Administration has
provedparticularly impervious to reform, and no progress was made inintegrating the work
o f tax and customs administration.* InMay, 2002, the two ministries were mergedonce
again.

 11.        Pervasive corruption has heavily constrained the govemment's ability to raise
revenue: "Revenue administration operates ina highly corrupt environment inwhich tax
favors are bought from tax inspector^."^ To control such practices, in2001 the government
developed an Inspector General at MOR,but its power to access informationand conduct
audits i s highlycircumscribed, and thus far it has not had the anticipated impact. Overall,
efforts to improve tax administration and revenue generation have been less successful than
envisioned.Io

 12.        The total stock o f tax arrears at the end o f 2001 stood at LARI394 million (LAM
 1,024.5 million including penalties), equivalent to one year's total revenue collection."
Moreover, tax arrears have grown. Frommid-1997 to mid-2001, the stock o f tax arrears
(including penalties) increasedfrom 4.6 percent o f GDP to 10.5 percent."

 13.       I n sum, revenueperformance has been hampered by pervasive corruption, weak
institutions, a lack ofpolitical will to enforce collections, and limited control over a
signi9cant part of the country's borders.

Expenditures

 14.        The majority o f the country's successful fiscal adjustment has been a result o f
cuts inexpenditures. However, inlarge measure because o f weak budgeting procedures,
the Government has not yet met its revenue and expenditure targets, and large arrears
have accumulated, e.g., inwages and pensions. The Government has not yet

                                                 Energy Sector

Introduction

1.        The energy sector plays a critical role inGeorgia's economic performance as well as
inthewelfare ofits citizens. Inthe Soviet Unionelectricity hadtraditionallybeensuppliedat
very low rates, and citizens were, ineffect, not accustomedto paying for the power they
consumed. Not surprisingly, after the end o f the civil war, reported collections' were very
low-around        6 percent in 1994-96-but         were said to have risen substantially by 1997-98to
around 65 percent, inlarge measure due to the country's compliance with SAC Iand I1
conditionality (see table below). However, since 1998, collections have fallen precipitously
(see tables below).2

2.        Beyondpoor cost recovery, the sector i s faced with other severe challenges: massive
corruption throughout the system (except inTelasi); dilapidated or non-functional
eq~ipment,~ technical losses estimated at a high 13.3 percent; political dispatch of
                with
electricity to non-paying customers; operational difficulties; non-payment for electricity
providedto autonomous region^;^ theft o f electricity, inpart by managers and employees
(estimated at perhaps 15 percent o f the total electricity supplied); and massive debt. Despite
the strenuous efforts o fthe government andthe Bank, the sector has deteriorated in the
period 1994-2001,has detracted from the country's growth, and has been a fiscal drain
(although it was less o f a fiscal drain at the end o f the period). m i l e the Bank's efforts
slowed the sector's deterioration, it did notprevent its continued downward slide. A leading
bilateral donor heavily involved inthe area believes that Georgia's energy sector-despite its
recent progress-is         inthe worst conditionofthat ofany CIS country, andthat there is ahigh
risk o ffurther deterioration.

3.        The price o f electricity, traditionally very low inthe Soviet Union, was gradually
raised under the reform program-which                requiredconsiderablepolitical courage. In
September 1995, the tariff for consumers was raised 600-foldto 1.9 U S centdkwh. In 1996,
the consumer tariff was raisedagain to 2.5 U S cents. A further increase to 3.5 U S cents
occurred in 1997.5 The current price i s 3.9 U S centskwh, although it has risenproportionally
muchmore inlari. This price i s for all consumers except those served by AES/Telasi, for
which the tariff i s U S 6.2 centskwh. One result o f the sustained increase in




' "Energy  collections" refers to the degree to which consumers and organizations are current intheir payments to
energy suppliers. A s explained earlier, data on collections are unreliable, but are presented here because: trends
inreportedcollections canbe indicative; and collection levels were an explicit goal o fthe SACS.
  Ironically, one o f the reasons for the drop incollections seems to have been the prospect o f privatization;
corrupt workers and managers, faced with the possibility that their source o f fundingwould pass into private
hands, apparently intensified their theft.

operational and some o f them may be damaged beyond repair." IMF, "Recent Economic Developments,"

 prices i s a reduction inenergy consumption. Georgia's ratio o f primary energy consumption
 to GDP i s the second lowest o f the CIS countries, around 11.5 percent (1999), compared to
 ratios o f over 15 percent for all CIS countries except Armenia-which                      also raised rates
  substantially.6

 4.         Electricity supplies are erratic inthe state-owned sector, with continuing outages; as
 noted above, electricity supplyhas improved inTelasi-served areas, with an improved
 wintertime supply o f electricity inTbilisi. However, inother parts o f the country,
 interruptions inpower supply significantly affect industrial prod~ction.~The protracted
blackouts have severely hinderedthe prospects for growth, and have also caused social
 discontent.

 5.         The energy sector incurred massive debt, although the privatizations o f 1998 and
2000 reduced the sector's quasi-fiscal deficit. In 1997, a Bank study' estimated that the
 electricity sector deficit was 3 percent o f GDP in 1997, 3.6 percent in 1998, and 4.3 percent
in 1999 (based on 4 months data). The power sector deficits for those years were much
larger than the budgetary deficits, and had significant negative consequence^.^ The
privatizationo f Telasi and Gardabani, as discussed earlier, prevented these facilities from
 hrther contributing to the sector's quasi-fiscal deficit. While data are imprecise on
 collections at the end-user level, Bank staff estimates place the 2001quasi-fiscal deficit o f
the electricity sector at approximately 2 percent o fGDP-a                    distinct improvement attributable
to progress achieved under the ESAC. Nevertheless, by 2001, the total debt accumulated by
the energy sector reachedUS$1billion, o fwhich around halfwas official debt owed to
Russia and Turkmenistan, and the rest was the commercial debt o f state-owned energy
companies.loInaddition, in 1999-2000 the Wholesale Electricity Market incurred debt-
unauthorized by higher government officials-of around US$200 millionto purchase energy.
The debt owedbythis one sector thus comprised around one fiftho fthe country's GDP in
2001*

 6.         Duringthe period 1994-96, the government endeavoredto improvethe situation in
the energy sector through better statemanagement, butachievedlittle. Thus the Institution
BuildingCredit (1994) didnot have any energy provisions, and the Rehabilitation Credit had
conditions limitedto increasing energy prices to reflect "full cost recovery." By 1996,
however, with the help o f the Bank (SAC Iand SATAC I),                      the government embarked upon a
sector restructuring and privatization program. The former energy monopoly (Sakenergo)
was restructured into generation, distribution, and transmission and dispatching units. While
the Tbilisi distributioncompany-the                country's largest-was        kept intact, the government
unfortunately split the rest o f the distribution sub-sector into around 62 separate firms which

    ...Georgia  has used its electricity sector as the major source o f subsidies for social protection and for

substantially larger than the narrow fiscal deficit for many years. This has fostered massive corruption, provided
an extremely poorly targeted social safety net, frozen resources in value-subtracting industries, and caused over
U S $ l billion o f debt accumulation. As a result, protracted electricity blackouts have severely undermined
economic growth prospects and caused growing social discontent. This has major macroeconomic and social

were for the most part owned by the municipalities or regions that they served. Division in
this manner hinderedthe possibilityof selling the smaller firms because theywere usually
too small to comprise an attractive package, and it strengthened their political ties to the local
communities which now owned them.

7.         Overall electricity collections have declined inthe past few years." Table A2.1
below shows the situation in2002. The low national rate o f retail collections, 33 percent,
persists despite the good performance o f the nation's largest distributor, AES/Telasi, which
received cash collections for 63 percent o f the electricity for which it billed.

Electricity Privatization

8.         The privatization strategy for the sector, developedjointly betweenthe Bank and the
government, was to privatize the distribution companies first, to lay a financial foundation for
privatizing other parts o f the system. InDecember, 1998, the Tbilisi distribution company,
Telasi, was sold to AES, an American utility investor experienced inthe regional2Georgia
thus becamethe second CIS country-after                 Kazakhstan-to        sell an electricity distribution
company to a strategic investor. AES also purchased (in2000) the productionfacilities at
the Gardabani thermal power plant andtook a long-termlease on two hydropower plants.

9.         After the Telasi sale, the government decidedto privatizethe rest o fthe distribution
firms;    however, protracted wrangling followed over how to group andpackage the firms for
proposed sale.13 At the time o f this writing, IFC has taken the role o f advisor to the power
sector and i s working with the distribution firms, which remain state-owned. Telasi was sold
very quickly-in         around 9 months. However, subsequent privatizations stalled for several
reasons:
       0   The remaining distribution companies were not as attractive to outside buyers as Telasi


*I Despite the inadequacy o f collections as a measure, the data in this section are presentedas indicators o f broad
trends.
   This transaction was facilitated by the assistance o f an intemational investmentbank, which was fundedby
SATAC 11.
13 It is possible that the remaining firms would not have been successfully soldno matter how they were grouped,
but the long dispute didnot help.

                                                  44                                      Annex 2



     0   Regional and local interests which were benefiting from continued public ownership
         didnot facilitate grouping the companies into a salable unit
         AES didnot have a positive experience inits first years o f operation (see next two
         paragraphs)
     0   The extremely poor physical and financial condition o fnearly all components o fthe
         sector has deterredpotential investors.

10.      Ineffect, theprivatizationstrategy was dependent on a successful experience
with Telasi, which could have built momentumfor further progress. However, Telasi
encountered numerous difficulties inits first few years, and expended great effort in
improving its operational and financial performance. The Telasi experience was
probably not encouraging to other potential investors. As for the state-owned sector, the
risk o f asset-stripping was recognized (see ESAC MOP, para 43), but it was hoped that
momentum from the first sale could lead to further progress. However, due to the
reasons cited earlier, no new privatizations o f distribution companies occurred. (Two
300-MW units at the Gardabani thermal power plant were also sold to AES inApril
2000).

11.      Insum,while theprivatizationsto date have hadpositive results, further progress
seems unlikely. AES has had some success inimproving collections (from around 10 percent
in 1998to around 63 percentnow), especially inareaswhere tamper-resistant meters have
been installed, and its financial performance i s improving (see Table A2.3 and FigureA2.1,
below). The company reports that collection from budgetary organizations has improved,
and large firms that fail to pay their electricity bills have been cut off. However, the
company has invested US$250million inGeorgia, and so far has realized little or no profit.
Telasi has had difficulty inreducing the theft o f electricity and inprosecuting those
responsible. Because o f the lengthand uncertainty o f court proceedings, the company prefers
to sell receivables at 50-80 percent o f their face value rather than pursue cases. And, because
o f the politically-motivateddiversion o f electricity (by the dispatch organization) to non-
paying customers outside Tbilisi, AES has sometimes hadto impose rolling brownouts on its
own paying customers, which has inhriatedthem. Finally, when AES fired some o f its own
workers who it found were involved intheft, it was requiredto rehire themby a Georgian
court.

FinancialResults

12.      As noted above, ESAC conditions requiredthat additional generationassets and the
remainingdistribution companies (beyond what AES hadpurchased) be offered for sale.
While this was done, no offers were received. The authorities are reconsidering, with the
advice o f IFC, whether to repackage the 62 additional distribution companies, which did not
sell when packaged into two units, and there may be another effort to privatize them.
With privatization stalled, the US$ 27.4 millionElectricityMarket Support Project,14
approved by the BoardinApril, 2001, recognized that the only realistic strategy may be to
retain international contractors to manage non-privatized distribution assets-as                  has been
done for the dispatch company (see discussion below)-while                   I L I s andbilateral donors
provide financial support on concessional terms. However, the course this credit has taken
does not augur well for the sector's progress; it was stalled inthe Parliament-apparently                   by
factions who stood to lose from its enactment-for                13 months, untilits approval in May,
2002. There i s considerable resistance inthe country to retaining foreign management firms
to operate key parts o f the sector." After approving the credit, the Parliament imposed
onerous conditions that would require its approval o f certain actions taken by the
management contractor.

13,      Underthe ESAC, in 1999the Wholesale ElectricityMarket (WEM) was established,
which i s incharge o f financial settlements between buyers and sellers o fpower inthe
marketplace. Prior to the retention o f a foreign management firm, WEM management
borrowed around lari 400 million, which was not technically within their authority. Then, in
2001, a Spanish firm, Iberdrola, received a management contract to operate the WEM.
However, as o f mid-2002, Iberdrolawas experiencing severe operational difficulties that, in
the judgment o f its management, made its continued operation problematical: l6

         The Ministryo fTaxationhadfrozen its bank accounts due to an allegation o f lari
         5.5 million inunpaidtaxes (which Iberdrola disputes). Iberdrola's position i s that it
         cannot operate as a clearing operation ifit does not have the use o f its bank accounts.
     0   Iberdrola has repeatedly disconnected several large power customers (e.g., state-
         owned water companies), only to be contacted bypolitical officials who negotiated
         an arrangement rescheduling the debt; when cash payments were not received on
         time, the process was repeated. (However, ingeneral the programto disconnect non-
         paying industrialcompanies was successful)

14The objectives o f this project are to provide support for equipment for metering, dispatch, communications,
and transmission, as well as to fund international management contractors.

        The Ministryof Taxation (ina dispute separate from that notedabove) stated that
        WEM i s subject to the VAT, while Iberdrolabelieves that, as a clearinghouse that
        does not add value, it should not be subject to the VAT. (Inaddition, the VAT
        Department calculates the tax due on the basis o f the amount billed, rather than that
        received).
        Without WEM permission, the VAT Department removed lari 1.3 million from
        WEM bank accounts inMarch, 2002, 97 percent o f all revenue received that month.
        InJanuary and February, lari 0.8 millionand0.5 millionwere removed.

14.     Data for 2001 collections illustrate the magnitude o f the problem facing WEM:
billings consisted o f lari 188.9 million, o fwhich 33.8 percent was collected. Upon further
inspection, "collections" were comprised o f 29.3 percent cash, 44.8 percent offsets, and 25.8
percent subsidies. Thus, WEM received cash for only around 10 percent o fwhat it billed.17

15.     The transmission and dispatch companies remainstate-owned, with a foreign
management contractor that started operations inmid-2002. Most sector participants
interviewedbelieve that the dispatch o f energyhas been heavily influenced bypolitical
factors as well as by bribes to managers inthese two companies. The supply o f electricity i s
also degradedby dilapidated transmission and dispatch facilities and technical limitations on
the flexibility with which power canbeprovidedto various localities.

16.     A soundregulatory framework was establishedunder the 1997 ElectricityLaw, with
the Georgia NationalEnergy Regulatory Commission beginning operations in 1998.              **
GNERC has significant technical capacity-supplemented          byconsiderable USAIDtechnical
assistance-and     i s not subordinate to the Executive Branch o f Government. The agency
licenses all firms active inthe energy area-in     the power, natural gas, transport, and pipeline
sectors. The agency has functioned well ina very difficult environment. While the agency
has considerable independence inconcept, a number o f sources stated that, inpractice, it i s
becoming increasingly subject to political influence.

Electricity Collections

17.     SAC Iand I1relied on electricity "collections" as a keymeasure o fprogress and a
condition to release funding. However, this reliance may have been misplaced. Interviews
with Bank staff, representativeso f other donors, and foreign firms providingtechnical
assistance inthis area indicate that the Bank relied on data provided by the Ministry o f
Energy. Inthose instances where a detailed inquirywas later made into collections ina
specific district, actual collections were often lower than those reported by the Ministry. In
addition, a large segment o f "collections" was not cash, but offsets against other funds owed.
For example, as described above, data from in-depthstudies by foreign providers o f technical
assistance indicated that in2001, only 10 percent o f the payments made to the WEM were in
cash. Thus, the reliance o f the Georgian adjustment program on this measure seems
misplaced.

Natural Gas

18.      The gas sector inGeorgia was very hardhit bythe economic decline after
independence. In 1990, the country consumed 5.45 billion cubic meters (BCM), o fwhich
5.4 billion was imported. By 1995, owing largelyto the huge debt incurred to Turkmenistan
and the consequent decline inaccess, domestic consumption fell to 0.9 BCM, and then
declined further to 0.8 B C M in 1997-all       importedfrom Russia. Most o f the gas importedi s
used for power generation and industrial uses. The supplyto households has shrunk to very
low levels because poor meteringand billing/collection systems hinder commercial operation
o f a gas distribution system. And finally, technical losses intransmission remain very high.
The mandate o fthe GNERCwas extendedto encompass the monopolistic aspects o fgas
supply,includingtransmission and distribution, although it will not regulate exploration and
production.

Oil and Gas TransitPipelines

19.      Georgia's geographic location presents substantial potential for the transit o f crude oil
and natural gas from the Caspian basin. The "Early Oil" pipelinei s currently transporting oil
from fields off the Azeri coast to the Black Sea port o f Supsa. The construction o f the
pipeline-the    Georgian section o f which cost around US$300 million-resulted      ina strong
increase inGeorgian construction a~tivity.'~         Thispipeline eams around US$10-11 million
annually on shipment o f 5.5 million tons o f oil. Feasibility and preliminary engineering
studies have been completed on a more ambitious pipeline which would also transit Georgia.
The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipelinewould ship Caspianbasin oil to the TurkishMediterranean
Sea port o f Ceyhana2' The design concept for this pipeline i s for 50 milliontons per year, and
Georgia has negotiated a royalty of US$O.12per barrel, which could generate an annual
income o f around US$42 million ifthe pipelinei s built (it could potentially open in2005).
Another pipeline transports Russian gas to Armenia, and Georgia receives 10 percent o f the
gas transported as an in-kindpayment.

                                           Financial Sector

10.      Georgia has advanced significantly inthe development o f its financial sector,
including a two-tier banking system, divestiture o f all state-owned banks (SAC I),and
strengthening o f the legal and institutional framework for bank regulation. Inlarge
measure because o fthe introduction o fminimumcapital requirements o f 5 million lari in
1997(SAC I)as well as a bank certification program (SAC I),the sector went from
having 225 banks in 1995 to just 27 inearly 2002. The market share o f the former state
banks has dropped steadily, and as o fmid-2001 comprised around 32 percent. The
Former State Banks are not dominant inany one sector. The banking sector i s highly
concentrated, however, with around 80 percent o f assets controlled by the 10 largest
banks.  '

11.      However, although bank supervisionwas strengthened, weaknesses incorporate
governance and delays inthe full implementation o f Intemational Accounting Standards
(IAS) comprise remainingweaknesses. The sector also suffers from low levels of
financial intermediation, and consequently its role infacilitating economic development
has been limited. Assets account for around 12percent o f GDP (mid2001) and deposits
around 5 percent o f GDP.2 Eventhough the level o f intermediationhas increased
150percent since the 1998 Russia crisis, Georgia i s still among the lowest CIS countries
interms ofthe level ofintermediati~n.~           The principal reasons for this are:

         0   Lack o fconfidence inbanks; hyperinflation inthe early 1990seroded confidence
             inbanks as savingsmechanisms


         0   A very large informal sector, which does not utilize banks

         0   The lack of informationavailable to lenders and the weak enforcement ofcreditor

             Harassmentbytax authorities o fbusinesses' deposits inbanks, oftenblocking or
             evenremoving a firm's funds (without the depositor's authorization), while the
            justification for the authorities' actions i s unclear4


         0   Widespread doubts about the quality o fbank management. Dollarization i s very
            high-around       82 percent inmid-200l-up from 58 percent in 1997, with the
             increase stimulated bythe devaluation o f the lari (against the US$) o f around
             50 percent inthe wake o fthe Russian financial crisis in 1998. Prudential
            regulation o fthe sector improveddramatically over the period 1994-2001, and
             capital adequacy and bank liquidity indicators remained relatively stable during
            the 1998 Russia crisis. The bankingsystemas awhole was reportedto be

                understatement o f distressedassets and non-performing loans, and a resultant
                overstatement o f capital and profitability. The main riskto the banking system i s
               judgedto be a credit risk,principally due to inadequate risk identificationand
                insufficientlyrigorous monitoringand managementpractices. The government i s

 12.       It shouldbenotedthat the highdegree o fdollarizationraises the foreign exchange
 risk inthe bankingsystem. This is because around 75 percent o fthe banks' foreign
 currency denominated assets comprise loans to borrowers, most o fwhom do not have
 foreign currency incomes or hedging facilities.

                                                Privatization

1.       The legal and institutional framework for privatizationwas established by the
government in 1991and 1992 with the establishment o f the Ministry o f State Property
Management and a 1991Law on Privatization (a revisedlaw was passed in 1997). The
initial privatizationprogram-mainly             focused on small enterprises-was              approved by
Parliament in 1992, and in 1994, a decree introduced direct sales and discounts for
purchases by employees as an additional privatization option. As o f October, 1994,
around % o f the 6,500 small enterprises then identified hadbeenprivatized by auction,
commercial tender, or direct sale.' By the start o f the Rehabilitation Credit (March,
1995), 40 percent o f the 6,500 hadbeenprivatized, and by the end o f SAC I1(December,
1998), nearly all o fthe 10,000 small enterprises then identified hadbeen sold.

2.       The Mass Privatization Program (MPP), designed inpart with the assistance o f
the Bank, began inmid-1995, utilizing voucher auctions as the principal means o f
privatization for medium and large-sized enterprises. Every Georgian citizen was
eligible to receive one voucher, which had anominal value o fUS$35, but which
commonly traded inthe secondary market for aroundUS$3-5. Vouchers could be used
to purchase up to 35 percent o f the shares o f an enterprise. Enterprise employees
received 5 percent o f shares free, and were giventhe option to buy an additional
51percent (part o f which could be purchased with vouchers) at a discount to book value.
Duringtheperiod June 1995-June 1996,45 voucher auctions were held and around
800 mediumand large-sized enterprises were offered for sale.2 By October, 1996, around
500 o fthe 1,000 mediumand large-sized enterprises then identified hadbeen sold.

3.       Following the end o fthe voucher program, cash auctions were utilized, which
commonly hada minimumreserve price 50 percent above book value; as a result o fthis
constraint, few firms were sold at first. Inmid-1997, inconsultation with the Bank, the
government agreed that ifa firm failed to sell 3 times at auctions with a reserve price, then it
would be sold with no minimum. Under SAC 11,unsold firms were classified according to
their book value and the extent to which ownership remained instate hands, andthe Bank
establishedtargets for the sale o f firms within each category. In 1997 and 1998, around
300 additional mediumand large-sized firms were sold for cash at "zero price" auctions.
(Additional firms were sold as part of the energy sector privatizationprogram, as described in
Annex 2).




' Inthe Georgian privatization program, prior to 1998 there was considerable uncertaintyover how many
enterprises of a given size were in existence. The universe o f small firms was later recognized to be around
10,000, and of medium and large-sized firms to be around 1,000.
  One weakness of the auction program was that no announcement was made o f the entire list of firms that was to
be sold.

Structural Reform

1.        Efforts by the Bank to foster structural reform inthe Georgian health sector began
during 1995 (though not formally part o fthe RC) and continued through SAC 11. The
starting point for the programwas the large oversupply o f facilities and staffthat were the
legacy o f the Soviet era. In 1988, Georgia had 10 hospital beds per 1,000 population, which
by 1999 hadbeenreducedto only 4.6 beds/1,000, a signal achievement, but still almost twice
as highas the average Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
level (2.5 beds/1,000). Despite this restructuring, almost 60 percent o f the existing beds in
Georgia's 287 hospitals remainunoccupied. Georgia's occupancy rate o f 42.1 per cent (1999)
i s the lowest inthe region compared to neighboring countries Armenia 64.8 per cent (1997);
Azerbaijan 56.2 per cent (1997); and Turkey 67.3 per cent (1997). Excess supply o fhuman
resources i s also a problem, particularlyo f doctors, where inGeorgia one physician serves
only 237 people on average, compared to 400 inOECD countries.'

2.        Supported by an intensivedialogue and the 2 SACS,as well as a health investment
project, the reform program aimed to reduce the number o f facilities and staffby:
          0  Introducinga new payment system that only pays for services that are provided;
          0  Limitingthe rightto practice to accredited and licensedmedicalinstitutions and
             health care professionals; and
          0  Privatizinga large portion o f the sector.

Provider Payment Reforms

3.        A new systemo f social health insurancepooledrevenues from the payrolltax and
central budget into a newly created State HealthAgency, which itselfwas incorporated into
the State Medical Insurance Company in 1997. Co-payments and user fees were also
introduced to raise additional revenue. The legal status of hospitals was changedfrom
budgetary institutions to autonomous enterprises and removedfrom the national budget.
Simultaneously in 1995, staff entered into contractual relationships with hospitals and were
no longer civil servants paid through the government budget.

4.       Money thus began to `follow the patient,' and hospitals were paidusinga new case-
basedreimbursement system. A key element o f the reform was the introductiono f
competition between providers for public funding. The aim was to use the market to provide
incentives to improve efficiency and quality at the same as time divesting government from
responsibilities it was no longer able to fulfill.

5.       The country'spoorfiscal performance reduced its ability to leverage major change
through financial incentives. Evenpotentially small improvements were difficult to achieve
because o f unclear governance arrangements and poor regulation. For example, hospital
administrators were given the freedom to manage their own revenues and budget and
prioritize expenditures. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that perhaps as little as

                                                     54                                            Annex 5


4 percent o f revenues went to salaries spread thinly across a large numbero f staff.
Administrators have been reluctant to downsize and strongly oppose any changes inthe
present system. Revenueswere spent on utility costs, medical supplies, payroll and a portion
to the state budget, but no one knows what happens to the rest except the administrators.

6.       Market forces without effective public financing and regulation failed to produce
expected results, and have contributed to inequality in access to health services. As market
failures have become more obvious, the government has found itself ina stronger positionto
move towards selective contracting usingpublic financing through the State Medical
Insurance Company (SMIC).2 The decision to introduce selective contracting was politically
nearly as difficult as the one to close hospitals. Usingmaternity hospitals as a pilot, SMIC
signed contracts with only 3 o f the 11maternity hospitals inTbilisi. At the same time,
reimbursement for deliveries has increasedfrom 120 lari to 256 lari. For the first time there
has been a response with an increase inpatient load inthe three contracted facilities, and a
decrease inthe others. Preliminary studies suggest that this i s due inpart to a decrease in
informal payments inthose facilities.

7.       However, system-wide, there i s evidence that physicians and other health care
workers continue to rely on informal payments by patients. For example, the average official
annual salary o f a typical hospital physician remains low: in 1998 it was 573 lari-around
US$285. Shiftingthe financial burden for health care onto consumers has reduced access to
services. Between 1990 and 1999, the rate o f hospital admissions per 100 population fell
from 13.8 to 4, and the average number o f outpatient visits per person per year dropped from
7 t o 1.2.
Licensingand Accreditation

8.       Another approach the Ministryo f Healthhas taken to influence the supply side o f the
market i s the licensing o f medical facilities and medical professionals. The law on health
care stipulated that all physicians and facilities be licensedby July, 2001. The licensing o f
health care providers has been completed, with significant numbers o f both graduating
students and practicingphysicians failing the exam. However, there i s as yet no discernible
impact on the supply o fhealth personnel and facilities.

9.       The government's attempts to control the supplyo fhealth sector personnelthrough
licensing graduating students and practicing physicians was made much more difficult by the
growing number o f medical schools inthe country. Since 1991over 50 private medical
schools have opened, with an enrollment o f 14,000 and an expected annual graduating class
o f 3,000. In 1996, a Commissiono f Accreditation for medical education was formed with the
intentiono f closing a majority o f the schools that did not meet minimal standards. However,
in 1998, responsibility for accreditationwas delegated to the MinistryofEducation,
essentially putting an endto all progress as this Ministry had little incentive to fight strong
political opposition from the medical schools. The Ministry o f Healthresigned itselfto
reducing supplyby limitingthe number o f admissions to residency programs over which it
had control.




'SMIC's  budget was financed 70 percent by the central government and 30 percent by municipalities.

                                                        55                                 Annex 5


 10.     So despite major reform efforts, there have been problems with introducingthe
licensing o f health care organizations inGeorgia. Nearly all facilities are ina very poor
condition and few facilities would pass even basic standards. The facilities argue that they
are unable to improve conditions since their payments from government are inarrears.
Privatization

11.      Privatization was the third strategy the government usedto reduce excess capacity.
The 1996 Law on Privatization o fPublic Enterprises establishedrules for privatization o f
state enterprises including health care facilities. The first batch o f 400 facilities (mostly
pharmacies and dental offices) were privatizedduring 1996-97. As with most countries,
privatizationo fpharmacies and dentistswas relatively easy. Privatization o fphysician
clinics, polyclinics and hospitals has moved more slowly, with around 20 percent o f hospitals
inTbilisi privatized, and a smaller percentage intherest ofthe country. So far, this hada
negligible impact on supply.

Health Outcomes

12.      Health status indicators inGeorgia are imprecise, but available data indicate that
Georgia's health outcomes measured interms o f life expectancy at birth, infant and under-
five mortality rate and maternal mortality rate compare favorably with other CIS co~ntries.~
(Table A5.1). However, it should be noted that Georgia's health indicators have worsened
significantly over the past decade: infant mortality increased from 9 deaths per 1,000 live
birthsin 1991to 24 in2000. Similarly, the maternalmortalityrate inGeorgia is 51per
100,000 live births which, while low incomparison to other developing countries, i s up from
32.4 in 1993. The majority o f maternal deaths inGeorgia (38 percent) occurs from bleeding,
one cause o f which i s anemia, which typically should be addressed duringthe prenatal stage.
This is yet another indicationo fpoor health system performance.

13.     The incidence o f infectious and parasitic diseaseshas also increasedduringthe last
decade. For example, there has been a huge increase innew tuberculosis cases (as inall o f
ECA), from 1,531 in 1991to 4,515 in 1999. Also, while the number o fdiphtheria cases has
declined from 425 in 1995 to 60 cases, it i s still considerably higher than 1992 (when 3 cases
were reported). The situation innon-communicable diseases has also worsened. Social
illnesses such as drug addiction are also increasing (from 1,347 in 1984 to 4,873 in 1996).

Enrollment

1.       At independence, Georgia inheriteda highly developed education sector that
provided free education at all levels, and the country hadthe highestproportion o f university
graduates o f any CIS republic. Adult literacy was nearly universal (99.6 percent in 1989) and
enrollment o f children ingrade 1-9was around 97 percent.' The sector was heavily
overstaffed, however, and in 1992 employed some 250,000 workers, or around 4.6 percent o f
the country's entire population. The economic decline after 1991and the severe squeeze on
public resources translated into a rapid deterioration inthe quality o f education and a drop in
enrollments. By 1993, education spending was less than 10percent o f its 1990 level.
Sectoral employment also fell, to 163,000 in 1995 (underthe RC), and to 120,000 by 1999
(SACSIand 11).

2.      Enrollment inbasic education (ages 7-14) remains highinGeorgia-around
90 percent in2000. However, enrollment inpre-school and upper secondary educationhas
fallen sharply: enrollment o fpre-school children fell from 41.6 percent in 1990 to
24.3 percent in2000, coincidingwith a fall o f around 50 percent in the numbero fpreschools.
While the gap between poor and non-poor students for compulsory grades i s small, it i s quite
significant inthe pre-school age groups (Table A6.1, below). As documented inWorld Bank
studies, the main reason for missing school i s poor quality o f education related to teacher
absenteeism, physical deterioration o f facilities, and lack o f free (or any) textbooks and basic
equipment and supplies.

Funding

3.      The funding o f education inGeorgia has become increasingly privatizedduringthe
transition. Available information shows that overall household expenditure on education i s
around 4.9 percent o f GDP, o fwhich 2.7 percent was out-of-pocket expense by households,
and 2.2 percent was the public contribution. The public contribution o f 2.2 percent i s well
below the average for OECD countries and for the CIS (4.6 percent).

4.      As shown inthe table below, SACSIand I1specified minimumbudgetary allocations
for the education sector, as well as other reforms involving teacher salaries and teacher re-
certification. All o f these were achieved, which had a modest effect on improving the
education sector.

                                                   Corruption

 1.       Georgia was ranked            out o f 102 countries inthe 2002 Transparency
International Corruption Perceptions Index,' with a rating o f 2.4 (where 1i s very corrupt
and 10 is "clean"). Among CIS countries, only Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Kazakhstan
scored lower. InTransparency's 2000 corruption index, Georgia was ranked 84thout o f
99 countries surveyed, worldwide. And an IMF study found that among CIS states,
Georgia's shadow economy was the largest, at 64 percent o f GDP; Russia's was 44
percent of GDP; and Uzbekistan's was the smallest, at 9 percent.2

2.        The government "attacked" corruption, but made little progress; inJuly, 2000, an
anti-corruption campaign was established by Presidentialdecree, but little progress was
made. Another anti-corruption decree was signed by President Shevardnadze inMarch
2001, that promisedto introduce maximumtransparency instate institutions, make clear
distinctions between the functions and duties ofpublic agencies, and provideadequate
pay for public employees.




' The Corruption PerceptionsIndex ranks 102 countries in terms of the degree to which corruption i s perceivedto
exist amongpublic officials andpoliticians. It i s a composite index, drawing on 15 different polls and surveys
from nineindependentinstitutions carried out amongbusiness people and country analysts, including surveys o f
residents,both local and expatriate.www.transvarencv.org

                           OED Response to Borrower's Comments


OED appreciates the comments received from the Government, and notes that they
substantially agree with the PPAR assessment o f the seven projects. Where appropriate,
the text o f the report has beenmodified to take the comments into account.

As the letter from the MinistryofFinance observes, the PPARis partially based onthe
informationprovided inthe ImplementationCompletion Reports and Evaluation
Summaries. However, the PPAR also benefits from additional time elapsed (after project
completion) and resources. While the criteria for assessment are the same inthe PPAR as
inthe earlier reports, the assessmentinthe PPARisbasedon additional qualitative and
quantitative information collected from multiplesources, as well as interviewswith
current and former Government officials, representatives o f other multilateral and
bilateral donors, NGOs, a broad range o f Bank staff, academics, and other memberso f
civil society ina position to provide information and perspective on the impact o f the
projects.

Onthe question o fthe ratio o f external debt to GDP, we have revisedthe data inthe
PPAR to reflect the informationprovided bythe Government. However, on the
proportion o f central budgetrevenue requiredto service the external debt, a number o f
analyses estimate that approximately 36 to 40 percent o f central budgetrevenuewill be
requiredto service debt, dependingon assumptions regardingrescheduling.'

With regardto the local consulting office (LCO) established under SATAC 11, the issue
highlightedinthe PPAR i s not whether the office developedandmet highstandards o f
quality andperformance. Rather, the PPAR notes that under Bank procurement
guidelines, government employees, even ifon leave, should not have beenallowed to bid
on government contracts.
