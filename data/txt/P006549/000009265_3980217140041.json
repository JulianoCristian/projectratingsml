The project has three\n            components.  The first component is the construction of a\n            557 (km) kilometers section of the pipeline in Bolivia from\n            Rio Grande in Bolivia to Corumba in Brazil, as well as soft\n            costs including interest during construction (IDC).  The\n            second component is the construction of 2,593 km of the\n            pipeline in Brazil extending from Corumba to Porto Alegre\n            including Penapolis compression station and expropriation of\n            land.  The third component consists of all soft costs for\n            the Brazilian section including IDC and working capital."}, "docdt": "1997-11-26T00:00:00Z"}
