    objective is to transport natural gas produced in central\n            Bolivia to major industrial centers in Brazil, opening a new\n            market for existing Bolivian reserves of natural gas and\n            bringing an additional source of power to Brazil. No\n            displacement of households is anticipated. Air quality will\n            be impacted by pollutants and emissions from construction\n            activities. Water will be used to wet the construction\n            areas, proper engines will be used and properly maintained.\n            Best management techniques for blasting will be used to\n            reduce ground disturbance, which may result in wind and\n            water erosion. Erosion prevention, erosion control\n            techniques, and revegetation will also be applied.\n            Application of wetland and stream crossing techniques will\n            mitigate the risks of scouring and bank erosion. To minimize\n            sedimentation in water bodies and disturbance to wetland\n            areas, controlled procedures for wetland and water body\n            crossings will be implemented. Wells will be properly cased\n            to avoid aquifer interaction. Spill prevention will reduce\n            the potential of groundwater contamination. Reduction in\n            surface water availability will be minimized by calculating\n            surface flow and withdrawal rate and volume. Surface water\n            contamination can be prevented by proper disposal of\n            hazardous materials. Vegetation clearing will be restricted\n            to designated areas to reduce elimination of forest canopy.\n            Work force will be trained regarding fauna protection."}, "docdt": "1997-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
