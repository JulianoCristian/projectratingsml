as\n            highly satisfactory. The lessons learned from this project\n            include: 1) This project clearly demonstrates the high value\n            added brought by the Bank in such a complex public-private\n            infrastructure project involving a whole spectrum of risks -\n            political, regulatory, environmental, and social, while\n            being important for regional economic development and\n            integration. 2) This cross-border ownership was tackled\n            through technical, environmental, financial, and market\n            committees comprised of experts provided by all the\n            sponsors. 3) The sector reform objectives were described in\n            a policy letter sent by the Government of Brazil to the\n            Bank. The policy letter approach includes mechanisms for\n            joint review, to implement difficult sector reforms, rather\n            than agreeing on a set of rigid conditionalities. 4) It is\n            important to secure the first tranche of transport capacity\n            for the first contracts, but ensure that at least some\n            uncommitted upside capacity be available for use by third\n            parties and will be auctioned according to the criteria set\n            by the regulator. 5) It is key to have both an independent\n            auditor and an ombudsperson as they have different functions\n            regarding the monitoring of social and environmental\n            compensation and mitigation programs and the protection of\n            individual and community rights, as well as proactively\n            interacting with nongovernmental organizations and communities."}, "docdt": "2001-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
