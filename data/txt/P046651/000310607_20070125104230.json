Mali, Mauritania\n            & Senegal Regional Hydropower Development Project is\n            rated satisfactory. As a result of achieving its physical\n            and its core development objectives, albeit with\n            considerable delays, the RKDP has enabled the provision of\n            low-cost hydroelectricity to the three countries, and has\n            improved access as well as the reliability and quality of\n            power supplies. The project also succeeded in involving a\n            private operator and initiated pilot programs to benefit\n            rural populations as well as mitigate the negative\n            environmental and health impacts of the dam. At the design\n            and preparation stage, good technical preparation is\n            essential if delays and cost increases are to be avoided.\n            Procurement activities related to the key components should\n            be as advanced as feasible prior to negotiations, in order\n            to allow sufficient time for project management  to take any\n            necessary corrective measures and avoid delays.\n            Harmonization of donor procedures, particularly on\n            procurement, should be established prior to implementation.\n            Financing and disbursement procures should also  be\n            harmonized to achieve better coordination among co-lenders\n            in the processing of payments. Mitigation of environmental\n            impacts should be appropriately covenanted in the legal\n            documents, and time-bound with provisions for remedial\n            actions by International Development Associations (IDAs)."}, "docdt": "2006-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
