F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The loan (along with loan 7165-UR) supports reforms to boost economic growth,
improve the competitiveness of the Uruguayan economy, and improve the general
welfare of the population through better provision of public and social services and
infrastructure.


                                                 ii

  Specifically, this loan aims to reduce prices, increase quality and coverage, and
improve efficiency of investment, production and distribution of services, and
infrastructure through: (i) upgrading regulation by strengthening regulatory frameworks
in all sectors; (ii) increasing competition by liberalization in the wholesale power market
and mobile phone services and sector restructuring of the petroleum, water and sanitation
and transport sectors; (iii) improve the efficiency of public expenditure by increasing
transparency and accountability and by reducing tax distortions; and (iv) strengthening
institutions to carry out functions of regulation, market oversight, sector planning and
management.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

When this operation was appraised in November 2002, Uruguay was still in the throws of
a deep economic crisis that was precipitated when neighboring Argentina defaulted on its
public debt and devalued its currency to one third of its previous value.

The crisis revealed that, although Uruguay had made considerable progress towards
macroeconomic stability during the 1990's, the pace of structural and policy reform had
not provided a sufficient cushion to absorb external shocks, nor did it insulate the
financial system and the economy at large from regional contagion. The crisis also
revealed underlying weaknesses in the economy, including an erosion of competitiveness
due to the high cost of public services and infrastructure, inadequate supervision of the
banking system, a financial sector made vulnerable by a high proportion of volatile non-
resident deposits, a highly dollarized economic system in which many private sector
liabilities were denominated in foreign exchange and in which a large part of the public
sector debt was also denominated in foreign currency with short- to medium-term
repayment peaks.

As a result of the crisis, GDP declined by 11 percent in real terms in 2002 and
unemployment rose to some 20 percent. Fiscal revenues were deeply affected by the
contraction in GDP. In addition, Uruguay was confronted with widening sovereign debt
spreads and with a country risk premium that reached more than 2000 basis points. There
was a close to 50 percent reduction in the dollar value of the peso following the adoption
of a currency float in June 2002 and bank deposits fell by 50 percent in the course of the
year. Liquidity support provided to banks contributed to a sharp fall in international
reserves and raised concerns regarding Uruguay's ability to service its external debt and
withstand additional pressures on the financial system.

In that context, the international financial community provided an unprecedented US$3.9
billion package of financial support to Uruguay with the aim of stabilizing the situation
and providing a basis for sustained economic recovery. As part of the package, the
Bank's Board first approved a structural adjustment loan and a special structural
adjustment loan for a total of US$300 million in August 2002 that focused on fiscal,
financial and social protection reforms. The Public Services and Social Sectors Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL) for an amount of US$151.52 million (covered in the present
ICR) and the accompanying Special Structural Adjustment Loan (SSAL) in an amount of
US$101.02 million (covered in the SSAL's ICR No. 34536) were approved as follow-up
operations to these earlier ones.

The economic crisis in Uruguay and the concerted response from the international
community spurred the Bank to prepare this operation within a short time-frame spanning
just a few months. It also encouraged the Bank to cooperate closely with the authorities to
expedite program implementation and, in the course of project execution, to be flexible



                                             1

and accommodating in seeking a way forward when unforeseen developments threatened
to obstruct progress.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Program Document covered the Public Services and Social Sectors SAL as well as
the accompanying Special SAL. They were presented to the Board jointly as supportive
of a single common program set out in the Government's letter of development policy.
The proposed loans shared the common objectives of restoring economic growth,
improving the competitiveness of the Uruguayan economy, and improving the general
welfare of the population: the SAL through greater efficiency in the provision of public
services and infrastructure, and the Special SAL through increasing the impact of public
expenditures in the education and health sectors. As described earlier, the SAL and the
Special SAL follow up on two earlier World Bank loans approved in August of 2002.
The four operations were approved as a part of a concerted effort by multilateral
institutions to help Uruguay withstand the impact of strong external shocks and set the
stage for recovery of sustained economic growth.

The Public Services and Social Sectors SAL covered in this ICR supported measures in
the energy, telecommunications, postal services, water and sanitation and transport
sectors aimed to reduce prices, increase quality and coverage, and improve the efficiency
of investment, production and distribution of services and infrastructure through:
(i) increasing competition by liberalizing the wholesale power market and mobile phone
services and restructuring the petroleum, water and sanitation and transport sectors;
(ii) upgrading regulation and strengthening regulatory frameworks in all of the above
named sectors; and (iii) improving the efficiency of public expenditure by increasing
transparency and accountability and by reducing tax distortions.

The specific objectives of the SAL (the loan covered in this ICR) were restoring
economic growth, improving the competitiveness of the Uruguayan economy, and
improving the general welfare of the population through greater efficiency in the
provision of public services and infrastructure. The Program Document also states that
the outcomes supported by the SAL were to reduce prices; increase quality and coverage;
and improve the efficiency of investment, production and distribution of services and
infrastructure in the energy, telecommunications, postal services, water supply and
sanitation and transport sectors.

The second loan approved as part of the Program, the Public Services and Social Sectors
Special Adjustment Loan (not covered in this ICR) focused on the health and education
sectors, and its specific objectives were restoring economic growth by increasing the
impact of public expenditures in those two sectors, while maintaining or improving
services in key priority areas through: (i) restructuring national health funding
instruments; (ii) reducing cross subsidies in the public hospital network; (iii) protecting
priority education programs: and (iv) improving the management of the education sector.




                                           2

The loan agreements for both loans incorporated cross-linkages so that disbursement of
the second and third tranches of either loan was contingent upon satisfactory progress
with the other. However, as detailed in Section 1.6 below, that cross-linkage fell into
abeyance when, in May 2005, the Special SAL was closed and the undisbursed balance
was cancelled at the request of the Government. The ICR for the Special SAL loan was
completed in February 2006. The achievement of all objectives was satisfactory or highly
satisfactory.

According to the latest ICR preparation guidelines dated August 2006, for evaluation
purposes, a project's objectives encompass both the PDOs stated in project documents
and key associated outcome targets. The guidelines state that whenever the PDOs stated
in project documents are broad and/or vaguely worded that they can preclude a
meaningful evaluation, intended project objectives are inferred by the evaluator from key
associated outcome targets (and/or project design features as relevant).

In the case of the SAL, although its overall and specific objectives and expected
outcomes are clearly stated in the Program Document, consistent with Bank practice at
the time of preparing the Program, no specific indicators (outcome targets) related to the
achievement of PDO were stated in the PD. Instead, key monitoring indicators closely
related to the loan covenants and conditionalities were included in the Policy Matrix, and
as most of the loan covenants, the monitoring indicators specified explicit outputs.
Consequently, success in achieving the PDO is assessed in this ICR through the
accomplishments made towards the specific original and revised Loan conditions as
stated in the Program Document and the amended Loan Agreement.

More details about the assessment of PDO achievement and evaluation of Program
outcomes are provided in sections 3.2 and 3.3.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

PDOs were not revised. However, given the change in the reform environment caused by
the number of external and domestic developments described in section 1.6 below and in
other sections throughout this document, the Loan was restructured in 2006 and the
conditionality amended to reflect the new policies and approaches of the Borrower at the
time. As discussed in section 3.3, achievement of both original and amended conditions
has been considered in this ICR for the purposes of the outcome rating (see section 3.3).
The justification for the revised conditionalities can be found in section 1.6 and 2.2 below.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The loan supported sector reforms in energy (power, natural gas and petroleum products),
telecommunications, postal services, water supply and sanitation, and transport (roads,
railways, ports and airports) with the objectives of reducing prices, increasing quality and
coverage, and improving the efficiency of investment, production and distribution of
public services and infrastructure. The reforms aimed to achieve this by: (i) strengthening



                                           3

and consolidating regulation; (ii) improving efficiency and increasing competition; and
(iii) upgrading and strengthening the institutional development capacity of Ministries, the
OPP and sector agencies.

Specific measures within each of the policy areas were as follows:

Regulatory reform focused on establishing, strengthening and consolidating two
multisector regulatory agencies: Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Energía y Agua
(URSEA) and Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Comunicaciones (URSEC). The
operational transparency of both agencies was to be enhanced with the introduction of
regulatory accounting. Accountability was to be enhanced by consolidating and
upgrading an information system of utility performance that would be accessible to the
public. Appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks were to be established or
consolidated for downstream petroleum products, natural gas, water supply and sanitation,
and postal services.

Efficiency and Competition focused on rationalizing public sector operations and
strengthening the framework for private sector participation (PSP). The accounting
framework for public utilities was to be made more transparent by establishing a
competitive wholesale market and a spot market in the power sector, by moving toward
import parity prices for petroleum products and by increasing competition in the retail
distribution of petroleum products, by making the market for mobile telephone services
more open to private providers to the market and by fostering competition in international
long distance services, by granting a management contract for the Montevideo water
supply system, and by awarding the management of Montevideo's international airport,
the multipurpose terminal port, and the operation of rail networks to private operators.

Institutional Development focused on bringing coherence to reforms in the energy sector
through the development of a national energy policy. High international oil prices and
region-wide shortages in energy were a serious setback for Uruguay which is heavily
dependent upon imported energy supplies. Hence, the development of a national energy
policy that would evaluate options and identify possible new sources of energy had
become a priority at the time of appraisal.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

Not applicable. However, although the three policy areas described above remained the
same after the 2006 restructuring, some of the premises on which the priorities and tools
were based did change and were consequently acknowledged in the new conditionalities.




                                           4

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

During the period of 2002-2007 and after the loan became effective on April 22, 2003
and the first tranche of US$51.52 million was released, there were a number of external
and domestic developments that changed the environment for reform in the country and
resulted in a shift in focus in some policy areas, as well as the relevance of some of the
measures envisaged under the SAL.

On the external events side, region-wide constraints in the supply of natural gas and
electric power affected the possibility of establishing a regional energy market. On the
domestic front, significant changes in the legislation governing the hydrocarbon and
water supply and sanitation (WSS) sectors and a change in government in the general
election of 2004 modified the environment for private sector participation and increased
support for public sector management of public services and infrastructure sectors. While
the new Government's policy focus remained committed to unbundling policy-making,
regulation and service provision roles, private sector participation was no longer
considered an appropriate tool for achieving greater efficiency in both the WSS and the
petroleum products sectors. The change in policy and the massive approval of two
referenda restricting private sector participation in those two sectors reflected public
opinion's preference for greater involvement of the public sector. However, private sector
participation still remained an option (albeit under modified arrangements) in ports,
airports, telecoms and railways.

As a result of these changes, the implementation progress was slower than envisaged and
a second tranche could not be released in November 2003 as contemplated in the program
document. A third tranche, envisaged for disbursement in June 2004 was likewise
delayed. The Bank extended the closing date in order to give the Government time to
resolve outstanding issues and move the program forward.

By late 2006 it became clear that, while there had been good progress with many of the
public sector-specific reforms supported by the SAL, in a few critical areas the targeted
reforms had been forestalled as the environment for reform had significantly changed and
affected the relevance and viability of some of these reforms. Section 2.2 provides more
details about the major factors affecting implementation. Once it became apparent that
the obstacles were unlikely to be overcome in the near term, the government and the
Bank reassessed progress with the SAL and took action to adapt and reconcile the
program to a changed environment. To reflect the new realities while, at the same time,
acknowledging the substantial progress achieved in many areas supported by the SAL,
the loan was restructured in December 2006 at the request of the Government.

The restructuring of the SAL acknowledged the significant changes that were made to the
legislative framework in key sectors over the course of the 2002-2006 loan period, as
well as in the focus of Government's policies after the 2004 general elections. The loan



                                          5

amount was also reduced from the original US$151.52 million to US$91.52 million. A
second tranche in the amount of US$40 million was disbursed on January 25, 2007 at
which time the outstanding US$60 million balance of the original loan was cancelled and
the loan was closed.

The original conditions for tranche release and the revised second tranche conditions are
set out in the policy matrix presented in section 2 below. The state of compliance with
each of the tranche release conditions was detailed in a project paper that was attached to
a memorandum and recommendation of the president (MOP) and circulated to the
Executive Directors on December 15, 2006.1

The Special SAL, which had cross-linkages with the SAL, was brought to closure in May
2005. At that time, the government requested that the second and third tranches of the
Special SAL be cancelled because Uruguay no longer required financial support on
special terms. As stated above, the ICR for the Special SAL concluded that the
achievements of all objectives were satisfactory or highly satisfactory. All second and
third tranche loan conditions of the Special SAL had been met, except for cross-linkages
with the SAL. In June 2005, the Board approved a DPL to continue support for
Uruguay's social sector reform program on regular IBRD terms. In view of the early
closure of the Special SAL and the cancellation of the second and third tranches, the
cross-linkage of the SAL with the Special SAL was superseded and was no longer
applicable.

The amendments to the SAL did not change the PDO with respect to sound
macroeconomic management, a more competitive economy, fostering price reductions,
improvements in quality and coverage, and increasing the efficiency in the provision of
public infrastructure and services.

The amendments however recognized that the full achievement of some of the proposed
outcomes would take longer to achieve than was originally envisaged. It was also
acknowledged that a longer time horizon and new operational modalities may, in turn,
increase program risks. The Government and the Bank opted to manage those risks by
shifting Bank financial support for the development of public infrastructure and services
from policy-based to investment lending instruments and AAA. This change in strategy
was consistent with the CAS for FY05-10 which was discussed by the Board on June 9,
2005.

The remaining paragraphs of this section present a summary of the main outputs and
measures implemented within the three specific policy areas (see section 1.4) under the
agreed revised loan conditions for tranche 2, including the measures imported from the
original conditionalities for tranche 3. More detail about the relevance of these outputs as
well as progress made against all original conditions and revised for tranches 2 and 3 can
be found in Annex 7.

Regulation of public services

As described above, some of the original loan conditions for disbursement of tranches 2
and 3 under this policy area were not fully achieved and had to be revised in 2006.
Nonetheless, over the course of the SAL implementation period, regulation was
successfully introduced and consolidated in Uruguay, despite the changing political and
economic environment within the country and the region. As discussed in section 3, this



                                                    11

strengthened regulation seems to have played an important role in helping to achieve the
Program Objectives of increased quality and coverage and enhancing the efficiency of
services and infrastructure. In some instances, increased regulation has also helped to
achieve a reduction in prices. As can be seen in the table above, in addition to the two
conditions included in tranche 1, all four amended conditions under this area were met.
Specifically:

(i)    The unbundling of policy making, regulation and operation functions of public
       services was completed with the creation URSEC, the regulatory agency for
       communications and postal services, in February 2001 and URSEA in December
       2002 covering both the energy (power, natural gas and petroleum products) and
       water (water supply and sanitation) sectors. Since then, URSEC and URSEA have
       become well established entities and started technical work needed for the
       implementation of regulatory accounting in the telecommunications, power, WSS
       and natural gas sectors (Action 1 of the revised conditions for release of the
       second tranche). In the power and WSS sectors, URSEA has completed this work
       and public utilities are preparing to implement it. In the telecommunication and
       natural gas sectors, consultant firms completed the technical work and regulators
       expect to complete the implementation of regulatory accounting in 2007. With the
       support of the national government, both agencies have continued to improve
       their performance and their technical and managerial capacities with renewed
       ownership, interest and dedication. The agencies have been staffed, directors have
       been appointed, and operational procedures have been defined. Both agencies
       have begun operations.

(ii)   The regulators have selected the sets of performance indicators to be reported to
       them by operators (Action 2) and publication has progressed significantly in the
       sectors of electricity, WSS and telecommunications. In the WSS sector, the water
       utility regularly published data concerning quality of service and complementary
       performance indicators both in the national press and, since February 21, 2003, on
       its web page. URSEA has posted water quality indicators on its web page since
       May 10, 2005. With respect to the power sector, although the selection of
       indicators had been completed earlier in 2004, the first set to be published was for
       the period January ­ June 2006. They relate to the quality of service both in
       technical and commercial terms. In telecommunications, URSEC has posted on its
       web page, aggregated performance indicators for fixed and mobile operators since
       October 2006. The intention is, in the medium term, to publish these indicators
       operator by operator.

(iii)  A regulatory framework for the commercialization of petroleum products was
       established through a decree (Action 3). A referendum on December 8, 2003
       revoked the 2002 law that ended ANCAP's monopoly over the import, export and
       refining of crude oil as well as the export of petroleum derivatives. The possibility
       that there may be resistance to privatization had been recognized in the Project
       Document as a possible risk to the program. Following the referendum, MIEM
       issued a decree establishing rules for non-discriminatory access to all stages of the



                                           12

        commercialization of hydrocarbons, including wholesale and retail distribution, as
        well as transport and distribution services. The decree introduced limited
        competition by allowing new distributors and service stations to be independent
        of ANCAP. Hence, ANCAP no longer has a monopoly on the domestic
        distribution and sale of petroleum products. Furthermore, in February 2004,
        URSEA issued two new regulations on LPG. As a result, there was an increase in
        the number of bids (from 2 to 4) from operators interested in the distribution of
        13 Kg LPG cylinders.

(iv)    A regulatory framework for the postal sector has not been established by decree,
        but most of the important sector issues were satisfactorily addressed in Articles
        77-79 of the 2005-2009 Budget Law. (Action 4 of the revised conditions for
        release of the second tranche). Articles 77-79 of the 2005-2009 Budget Law
        established a framework for URSEC to monitor and regulate the sector. It
        mandates universal postal coverage, defines the postal services fee and establishes
        the fund that will administer sector resources. Moreover, a law is a more powerful
        instrument than a decree and that underscores the importance attached by the
        government to postal service issues. The Executive has informed the Bank that
        the approval of the Articles was a first step toward a comprehensive regulatory
        framework for postal services. Meanwhile, a system has been introduced for
        monitoring sector performance including the quality of service, the volume of
        mail and the coverage of delivery services.

Other original loan conditions under the policy area of regulation, such as establishing a
target tariff for electricity distribution and a sector law for natural gas were not achieved.
Likewise, a sector regulatory framework for WSS has not been established. This is
explained by different factors. More significant however is the progress made in these
areas through other mechanisms and policies which may have also contributed towards
PDO achievement (see Annex 7 for detail).

In the case of the WSS, for example, the Government has begun anew to reorganize the
sector (provision of WSS services, urban drainage and water resources management).
New institutions have been created, and an extensive dialogue has begun between them.
Comprehensive legislation to underpin the legal and regulatory framework for the WSS
sector is now under-way. Significant progress has been made in preparing the draft law,
which is now expected to be presented to parliament within one to two years.

Efficiency and Competition

One quarter of the original loan conditions under this area were fully met as envisaged in
the Program Document. About one half of the conditions were partially achieved and
slightly more than one quarter has not been met due to changes in the legal framework
and in the regional and national sector contexts. The achieved outputs have contributed to
fostering a reduction in prices, an increase in access and consumption, and better quality
of services. In particular:




                                             13

(i)   Competition increased considerably in the telecommunications and transport
      sectors. Eighteen private companies began to provide international long distance
      services and three new mobile companies began competing with the national
      company in the mobile phone market. Interconnection regulation, an independent
      telephone numbering management system, a customer database administrator, and
      precise rules for identifying the origin and destination of phone calls were
      approved and implemented (Actions 9a, 9b and 9c of the revised conditions for
      release of the second tranche). In the transport sector, private operators now
      manage Montevideo's international airport (Action 6). On July 8, 2003 a contract
      for the 20-year concession of the Carrasco International Airport was signed
      between the National Ministry of Defense and the public company "Puerta del
      Sur." Arrangements are under way to improve railway operations by awarding
      management contracts to private operators and Parliament authorized the creation
      of the Corporación Ferroviaria del Uruguay ­ CFU (Railway Corporation of
      Uruguay), as a public company, responsible for the rehabilitation and
      maintenance of railway infrastructure through a contract with AFE (Action 10b).

(ii)  In the energy sector the results are mixed. Despite the limited success in opening
      access in the petroleum sector and in establishing an effective and competitive
      wholesale power market, there has been considerable progress in making the
      accounts of ANCAP more transparent (Action 5), in advancing towards the goal
      of closing the gap between the ex-refinery prices and the estimated import parity
      prices of petroleum derivatives (Action 7), and in reducing the discrepancies in
      the retail price of fuels between Uruguay and neighboring countries. (Action 8).
      Furthermore, a number of measures have been taken to broaden the sources of
      energy generation, including aero derivative gas turbines, wind power, biomass
      and small hydro projects. A transition program will gradually introduce wholesale
      market regulation and establish standards necessary to facilitate the development
      of independent generation projects. Recent developments have led the
      government to reconsider the market structure for power. There is a debate within
      the public sector as to whether, given the relatively small size of the domestic
      market, expectations from a broader competition framework may be unrealistic.
      There is also discussion as to whether the electric power utility should keep a
      strong vertical structure, in order to compete in a regional market that is
      dominated by large companies. It has been suggested that, at least for the time
      being, the function of load dispatching and system operations should not be
      transferred to ADME because it may weaken UTE. However, the transfer of those
      functions to ADME is crucial if new players are to be attracted and if
      competitiveness in the power sector is to be enhanced.

(iii) In the WSS sector, the original condition for OSE to award a performance-based
      contract to a private operator for the management of unaccounted-for-water
      (UFW) in Montevideo (Action 9) was not complied with as the Constitutional
      Amendment of 2005 made it unconstitutional to invite private operators to
      participate in WSS. However, OSE has made it clear that two of its top priorities
      are the development and implementation of new strategies for: (i) reducing UFW



                                         14

        and increasing water revenues; and (ii) the company's organizational renewal. As
        described later on this document, the Bank is supporting that endeavor with a
        recently approved second APL.

Specific obstacles and main achievements in this policy area within each sector and under
each of the original and revised loan conditions are discussed in detail in annex 7.

Institutional Development

Over the course of its implementation, the Program significantly impacted economic
development through its support in helping to establish and consolidate regulation in all
infrastructure sectors; separate sector functions; define sector policy; and restructure the
sectors and their entities. The Program's assistance to regulatory reform was discussed
above. The unbundling of sector functions has been notable and welcome in the WSS and
energy sectors, including the establishment of new policy making institutions. Particular
efforts have been made to strengthen DINASA, the new Directorate for Water and
Sanitation, and the DNETN, the National Directorate for Energy and Nuclear
Technology, notably through the World Bank's Public Services Modernization Technical
Assistance Project (TAL).

The SAL directly contributed to the achievement of these results by encouraging and
supporting the development and publication of the government's Guidelines for an
Energy Strategy, as described below. In addition, the SAL contributed more broadly to
these results by raising national awareness of the existing shortcomings and providing
momentum for institutional strengthening.

The SAL also made significant contributions to the strengthening of institutions in the
transport and communications sectors. In the transport sector, the SAL encouraged the
reorganization of the sectors, particularly the railways sector, and supported the
launching of new schemes and companies as the Mega-concession and the CREMA in
the roads sector, and the CFU and the CCFU in the railways sector. In the
communications sector, the SAL encouraged transferring the responsibility for the sector
from the Minister of Defense to the MIEM.

Specific achievements under the agreed revised loan condition (Action 11) to help
strengthen infrastructure institutions can be summarized as follows:

The Guidelines for the definition of a National Energy Policy have been issued and
published by the MIEM (Action 11 of the revised conditions for release of the second
tranche). On August 18, 2006 the MIEM issued and posted in its web-page the
government's "Guidelines for an Energy Strategy ­ Uruguay 2006," which provides the
basic building blocks of a policy. The strategy took account of inputs from the previous
ESMAP-financed work. The key objectives visualized by the Government for the energy
sector are to (i) ensure cost-effective supply to satisfy domestic demand, with a good
quality of service under the aegis of the State, by maximizing the use of local, regional
and renewable energy resources; (ii) promote energy efficiency, diversify the sources of



                                           15

supply and promote clean energy, and (iii) expand the sector with public and private
participation, by adapting the legal and regulatory frameworks as necessary. The
guidelines address issues relating to: (a) a robust and cost effective electric energy supply
system; (b) improved access to fossil fuel resources; (c) inclusion of natural gas in the
energy matrix; (d) a greater use of renewable (particularly biofuels, windpower, and
biomass-based power generation); (e) policies for energy efficiency; (f) updating and
improving the regulatory framework; (g) making energy more accessible to the poor; and
(h) encouraging coordination between institutions and participants in the energy sector to
better formulate policies and plans and to build capacity within MIEM, particularly the
National Directorate of Energy and Nuclear Technology (Dirección Nacional de Energía
y Tecnología Nuclear, DNETN).

Cross-Linkage of Tranche Release Conditionality

When the second and third tranches of the Special SAL were cancelled at the request of
the government and the loan was closed in April 2005, the link became redundant.

Additional Considerations

The impact of the Program went beyond compliance with the specific loan
conditionalities. Although some of the original conditions were not fully met as stated in
the Program Document and the Loan Agreement, the Government has widely
acknowledged that the SAL created a critical momentum during the crisis and its
aftermath to achieve necessary sector reforms. The explicitly stated outcomes were
largely met in most sectors, as described in section 3.2 and Annex 8, though in several
instances through different instruments than originally envisaged in the SAL. The fact
that the Government's strategy remained closely aligned with the overall direction
proposed by the SAL, though using different means, and sought to achieve the original
outcomes partially explains this positive result.


The above focus on sector outcomes was the approach followed during the supervision of
Program implementation. The Project team focused on assessing the likelihood of
achieving the PDO based on the positive evolution of outcome indicators, as well as
progress in the overall dialogue with the authorities on key sector issues, rather than
focus on specific outputs/conditions. This difference in approach partially explains the
inconsistency between the historic ratings given to the Project in the ISR reports, which
rated progress towards achieving the DO as satisfactory, and in this ICR, where outcome
assessment is based on compliance with original and revised conditionalities.


2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

As indicated above, while many of the public sector-specific reforms supported by the
SAL were implemented satisfactorily, some of the targeted reforms in a few critical areas
were forestalled by external events beyond the control of the Government and by
domestic developments that changed the environment for reform in the country. With
respect to external events, region-wide constraints emerged in the supply of natural gas


                                           16

and electric power such that the establishment of a regional energy market envisaged by
the SAL was no longer a practical proposition, at least in the near term. On the domestic
front there were two constitutionally sanctioned referenda that changed the public policy
framework on public service reform: the repeal in December 2003 of earlier legislation
that had opened the market for petroleum products to private enterprises and the October
2004 constitutional amendment that effectively prohibited private participation in the
provision of water supply and sanitation services. At the same time, in the general
election of 2004, a new coalition government was elected to office with increased support
for public sector management of public services and infrastructure sectors.

Those developments prompted the Government and the Bank to rethink the strategy for
achieving the development objectives of the SAL in some important areas. In water
supply and sanitation, private participation could no longer be pursued as an instrument
for increased efficiency. Instead, increased efficiency would depend more upon
institutional, policy and regulatory reform within the public sector. Similar constraints
applied to the import, export and refining of petroleum products. Region-wide problems
with the supply of electricity and natural gas necessitated a change in sector strategies
and ruled out, for example the development of a spot market for electric power, at least in
the short- to medium term.

The improved overall financial position of the government by 2005 made it unnecessary
for Uruguay to draw down the Special SAL beyond the first tranche. The Special SAL
was closed in May 2005 and the undisbursed balance cancelled.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

SAL performance was monitored and evaluated using monitoring indicators closely
related to the output indicators that were included in the Policy Matrix for the loan. As
noted in section 1.2, however, no specific indicators were related to the PDO in the
Program Document (as was common practice at the time). This presented significant
challenges during the preparation of this ICR, both in terms of finding appropriate data
sources and in assessing success at achieving the proposed outcomes (see section 3.2).

The continuity and effectiveness of supervision was not affected by the economic crisis
or by the changes in administration. The Policy Matrix and the associated monitoring
indicators were the main M&E tools for supervising project implementation, including
the regular preparation of Project Status Reports (PSRs). Particularly noteworthy was the
close cooperation between Bank staff and government officials in monitoring project
implementation, which ensured a continuous dialogue with the government's economic
team, including OPP, and sector ministries of both the former and the current
administrations. The new administration which took office in 2005 made good use of the
M&E framework in determining approaches and instruments to further advance the
Project objectives.

Additional support in monitoring and implementing the Program was provided through
the Public Services Modernization Technical Assistance Project (Loan 4598-UR). That
operation was founded upon detailed analytical work, and it incorporated lessons from


                                          17

the Bank's ongoing lending experience and policy dialogue. Drawing upon the
operational experience from sector projects in power, transport and WSS, the dialogue on
public service reform was expanded in 1996 and 1997 and additional analytical and
advisory work was undertaken. The Technical Assistance Loan added yet another
important dimension to the dialogue by providing the necessary inputs and capacity
building to implement the reforms, in particular the strengthening of the regulatory
agencies, the new Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DINASA), the National
Directorate for Energy and Nuclear Technology (DNETN) and other infrastructure
Ministries.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The SAL Program objectives and conditionality were well defined. They constituted a
well structured program of reform that would enable Uruguay to resolve the economic
crisis and advance its long-term development goals with respect to sustained growth with
equity. Program objectives reflected the priorities identified both by the Government and
by the Bank in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on April
19-21, 2005. They were also in line with the issues and recommendations identified in the
2007 Bank paper entitled "Strengthening Energy Security in Uruguay."4

The objectives of consolidating regulation and accountability, rationalizing public sector
operations, bringing coherence to reforms in the electricity, petroleum and natural gas
sectors through the development of a national energy policy, and strengthening the
framework for private sector participation were sufficiently flexible to accommodate
changing circumstances. These objectives target key areas of public services and
infrastructure where, partially triggered by the implementation of the SAL, there is an
active public debate on issues such as the development of a national energy policy and
the operationalization of the regulatory framework for electric power.

The program design was sound and properly based on a subset of the broad reform
program the Government was taking or planning to take in each sector, as outlined in the
Letter of Development Policy dated March 7, 2003. The design remains relevant today as
demonstrated by the revised Letter of Development Policy dated November 29, 2006
(and the May 4, 2005 letter sent by the Minister of Economy and Finance in relation to
the 2005 CAS).

Bank staff properly recognized the importance of infrastructure investment for economic
growth and poverty reduction, and made an accurate diagnosis of the infrastructure
weaknesses in Uruguay, particularly in terms of policy gaps, relative inefficiencies in the
provision of services and limited private sector participation. It reflects well upon the due
diligence of Bank staff that they foresaw how vulnerable Uruguay would be to regional
and global shortages in energy and to fluctuations in the cost of natural gas and other
fuels because of the limited generation capacity installed in the country at the time. Based
on that diagnosis, Bank staff properly selected public services and infrastructure as high-
priority sectors and, within those sectors, identified the areas of competition and
regulation, efficiency and competition, and institutional development as a focus for the
reform efforts of the SAL Program. Sectors and themes continue to be high-priorities as
they were at the time of Program appraisal.

The PD explicitly acknowledged the risk that the consensus for reform in Uruguay might
weaken. When that risk materialized, the Government was confronted with legal and
constitutional impediments which obstructed private sector participation in the provision
of WSS services and in the refining and international commerce of petroleum products.
The Government was, therefore, unable to achieve some of the originally agreed
conditions in those areas. A new administration assumed office in March 2005 with a
strong commitment to the public management of key economic and social sectors. In
addition, region-wide constraints emerged in the supply of natural gas and electric power
which made it impossible to establish a regional energy market as envisaged in the SAL-
supported program. As a result of those factors, the reform program fell short of
accomplishing its agreed outputs in important respects.

The operation focused on the right issues, but policy conditionality gave too much weight
to specific means (e.g. PSP) as opposed to intended outcomes. At appraisal, Bank staff
properly identified the impact of infrastructure investment on economic growth and
poverty reduction, and made an accurate diagnosis of Uruguay's weaknesses in the
infrastructure sectors, particularly in terms of policy shortcomings, inefficiencies in the
provision of services, close and restricted markets, and limited private sector
participation. The regulatory framework, efficiency and competition, and institutional
development were rightly identified as the areas on which the SAL-supported program
should focus. In hindsight however, the Program could have better recognized the
likelihood of the risk of shifts in public opinion and how this may have led to different
choices of instruments to achieve the Program objectives.

The amended program was also well structured, albeit more limited in scope than the
original program. It took into account the significant achievements made with many of
the policy and institutional reforms supported by the original program, while
acknowledging the impediments to fully implementing the original program. The
shortfall between the original program and the amended program was reflected in a
reduced loan amount from US$151.52 million under the original loan to
US$91.52 million under the amended loan.

Implementation was well organized and properly structured. Bank staff and Government
officials had a clear understanding of the macroeconomic and fiscal constraints


                                           19

confronting a population with limited resources. Joint monitoring of Program
implementation by Bank staff and government officials helped ensure a continuous
dialogue with the government economic team, including OPP, and the sector ministries of
both the former and the current administrations. The ease of the dialogue helped to build
a bridge to the new administration. The parallel implementation of the ongoing Public
Services Modernization Technical Assistance Project (Loan 4598-UR) offered valuable
additional support by securing the necessary technical and financial support to establish
and strengthen capacity at the regulatory agencies (URSEA and URSEC), the new
Directorate for Water and Sanitation (DINASA), the National Directorate for Energy and
Nuclear Technology (DNETN), ADME and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives (PDO)

This section summarizes whether the Program objectives of boosting economic growth
by improving the competitiveness of the Uruguayan economy and better serving the
public with infrastructure and public and social services have been achieved, as measured
by the achievement of the loan's anticipated development outcomes: macro-economic
stability, reduced prices, increased quality and coverage, and improved efficiency of
public services and infrastructure. Annex 8 reviews in more detail the evolution of these
outcomes and other progress at the sector level.

The overall conclusion is that Uruguay has largely met the broad development objectives
set out by the program, although some of the original conditions were not fully met and
some of the means prescribed by the SAL for achieving sectoral objectives (e.g. more
PSP in the water sector) were rejected by both Uruguay's population and its elected
government during the latter half of the program.

Macroeconomic Stability

The SAL Program has largely met its broad development objectives and from a
macroeconomic perspective has exceeded all expectations. The Uruguayan economy has
performed well, as it continued to recover from the 2002 financial crisis and deep
economic recession. However, in a few critical areas, targeted reforms were forestalled
by external events beyond the control of the government and by domestic political
developments that changed the environment for reform.

The SAL Program was part of a US$3.9 billion package pledged by multilateral
institutions in 2002 to help Uruguay to stabilize its economy following the 2002 crisis.
This exceptional package was successful in supporting Uruguay in overcoming the crisis,
without resorting to a debt default or actions that would have led to loss of confidence in
the banking sector. The recovery since 2002 has exceeded all expectations. After a
contraction of 11 percent in 2002, real GDP had recovered to 116 percent of its pre-crisis
level by end-2006. Unemployment has fallen, and inflation has been brought under
control, falling from 26 percent in 2002 to 6.4 percent in 2006. Public debt declined from
104 percent of GDP at the end of 2003 to an estimated 64 percent of GDP at the end of
2006. Financial indicators have improved. The high liquidity of the banking sector has



                                           20

reduced vulnerabilities: the liquidity of the banking sector and central bank reserves,
cover almost 80 percent of short-term debt and foreign currency deposits. Banking
deposits of residents have recovered to about 85 percent of the pre-crisis level.

The highly satisfactory 2002-2007 fiscal impact of the SAL positively contributed to the
excellent macroeconomic result. Originally estimated at US$168.6 million in the PD, the
actual net fiscal impact of the Program will exceed this figure. The sale of concessions to
private operators in telecommunications, airports and ports alone has reported at least
US$101.1 million to date (US$54.1 million from cellular bands, US$2.9 million from
radio links, US$7.5 million from the Montevideo airport, and US$36.6 million from the
logistical terminal of the port of M'Bopicuá). The US$101.1 million far exceeds the
US$81.7 million estimated for 2002-2006 in the PD. In addition to the revenues obtained
from private operators, total benefits to the government include a reduction of over
US$40.7 million in operating subsidies to AFE and DNV. Other benefits include the
transfers made by ANCAP, ANTEL and UTE to the Treasury and the taxes paid by
private and public utilities and ANCAP from 2002 to 2005. These fiscal benefits are over
and above the benefits to the public resulting from wider and better access to public
services and infrastructure.

Part of the explanation for these impressive results lays in the careful management of fuel
prices and public services tariffs, whereby periodic increases were made so that tariffs
could recover to their pre-crisis levels. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, both average power
and water tariffs recovered quickly from the 2002 economic crisis. An impressive result
considering that it was done without social conflict or protest, and without diminishing
the high regard that Uruguayans have for their utilities as illustrated in surveys of public
satisfaction.5

As discussed in section 2.1, the SAL Program led to important policy reforms and other
measures that successfully contributed to establishing, strengthening and consolidating
regulation, promoting competition and improving efficiency; and boosting institutional
development. All this has been done within the framework of fiscally sound policies and
free of the social upheaval that usually surrounds most reform programs. The fact that the
Government maintained and strengthened social protection programs, despite the
economic, political and social upheaval that ensued after the 2002 crisis, certainly helped
to achieve these results.




                                           22

Reduced Prices

In most sectors, prices have declined during the loan period (see figures 3 to 8 in annex 8).
The SAL contributed indirectly to the price declines through strengthened regulation in
the communications, water and energy sectors; increased competitiveness, and greater
utility efficiency.

Increased Quality and Coverage

High coverage rates of access to public services and infrastructure have been maintained
and the overall perceived quality of public services and infrastructure in Uruguay remains
good. The SAL program design widely recognized that Uruguay already enjoyed very
high coverage levels of public services and infrastructure in comparison with other Latin
American countries. Hence, the program objective was to ensure that the coverage rates
would be maintained, in spite of the crisis. No SAL conditions explicitly focused on
increasing coverage.

The overall perceived quality of public services and infrastructure in Uruguay remains
high, as noted in the World Bank's (2007) Investment Climate Survey and the World
Bank's (2007) Eficiencia en Infraestructura Productiva y Provisión de Servicios en
Uruguay.

Improved Efficiency

Overall, efficiency has improved, as demonstrated in the related indicators, mainly
through progress in management and performance, increased participation of the private
sector, more competition, and strengthened regulation to varying degrees in the different
sectors.

The significant progress that has been made in regulation has helped to improve
operators' efficiency and to strengthen sectors' institutions. The process of strengthening
and consolidating URSEA, the regulatory agency for energy and water and URSEC, the
regulatory agency for communications, is attested by the following results:

· Both agencies are now well established entities that have continuously improved their
    technical and managerial capacities.
· The presence, roles and responsibilities of both URSEA and URSEC are now
    acknowledged and recognized, and their reputation and standing with the companies
    they regulate and with the public at large are sound.
· Both agencies show a relatively high and increasing degree of compliance with
    existing legislation in the markets they regulate, regularly publish performance
    indicators, develop strategies to foster growth and competition, and help focus public
    scrutiny on both private and public utilities.
· Both URSEA and URSEC enjoy a large degree of autonomy. Both agencies have
    their own autonomous budgets; have defined and approved their own organizational
    structures; most of the staff who were previously working as short-term consultants



                                           23

    has been fully incorporated as public employees through a competitive process; and
    have put in place and are implementing ambitious training programs.

Increased private sector participation has also helped to improve efficiency and
competition in some sectors, particularly in telecommunications were 18 new private
companies began to provide international long distance services during the SAL
implementation period and three new mobile companies began competing with ANCEL
in the mobile phone market. Uruguay's economic growth and competitiveness have also
been boosted by extensive private participation in the ports sector. As shown in table 7,
76 percent of the US$48.4 million invested in ports between 2003 and 2005 and
78 percent of the US$500 million expected to be invested in 2006-2009 represents private
capital. Particularly important are those initiatives linked to the transport of forest related
products, as for example the ports of Nueva Palmira and M'Bopicuá which are now
strong contributors to the export of forest products.

        Source: ANP (2006)


As discussed earlier and in annex 7, private sector participation has also played a
significant role boosting efficiency and competition in airports and energy. In the energy
sector, new private operators have joined the distribution market of LPG in the last four
years, following URSEA's approval and implementation of regulation related to this fuel.
Additionally, eight new private power generators have joined the market as co-generators,
with a total generation capacity of 157.7 MW based in renewable sources (solid waste,
wind power and biomass).

The main achievements in each of the sectors per outcome can be found in annex 8.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Program Document clearly stated that the operation's main objective was to restore
growth in Uruguay at the very delicate6 juncture of the 2002 regional economic crisis, as
part of a concerted effort by multilateral institutions to help the country withstand the
impact of strong external shocks and set the stage for recovery. Expected outcomes

included (i) macroeconomic stability, (ii) increased efficiency and competition, (iii)
reduced prices, and (iv) increased quality and coverage of public services and
infrastructure. Significant progress was made in all of the above, as described in the
previous section and in annex 8.

In the case of the SAL, although its objectives and expected outcomes are clearly stated
in the Program document, consistent with Bank practice at the time of preparing the
Program, no specific indicators related to the achievement of PDO were stated in the
Program Document. Instead, key monitoring indicators closely related to the loan
covenants and conditions were included in the Policy Matrix, and as most of the loan
covenants, the monitoring indicators specified explicit outputs rather than outcomes.
Consequently, success at achieving the PDO is assessed in this ICR through the
accomplishments made towards the specific original and revised Loan conditions as
stated in the Program Document and the amended Loan Agreement.

According to the harmonized evaluation criteria for ICR evaluations and the ICR
guidelines issued in August 2006, the overall rating should be assessed against both the
original and the amended loan conditions. Following this criterion and with respect to
the originally programmed conditionality the operation is rated as unsatisfactory.
Few conditions were fully met before restructuring the Program and amending the loan.
This was particularly the case in the energy and WSS sectors. In the energy sector,
programmed reforms were forestalled by external events in the region-wide market
beyond the control of the government and agreed outputs could not be met as originally
envisaged. In the WSS sector, the 2004 Constitutional Amendment invalidated the
overall concept of the draft law that had been sent to Parliament and the agreed approach
of pursuing efficiency in controlling unaccounted for water through risk-based contracts
with private firms. There was also widespread public resistance to private participation in
these two sectors.

With respect to the amended program the operation is rated as satisfactory. As
amended, the revised program was made responsive to the development needs of
Uruguay at the present juncture. The role of the private sector is less than envisaged
under the original program but nevertheless substantial in some areas of infrastructure
and public services. Moreover, in the energy sector, the revised program corresponds
more closely to the present needs of Uruguay because it takes into account recent region-
wide constraints that were not present at the time of appraisal.

As shown in the following table that summarizes this exercise, the overall rating for the
operation would be Moderately Unsatisfactory.

While this program is rated as moderately unsatisfactory, the Government of Uruguay
has largely achieved the overall development objectives to which the program aspired.
As described in annex 8, there has been significant progress in moving towards attaining
the stated outcomes in most sectors. Prior to Board presentation, the government
responded to the crisis situation by introducing substantial structural reforms. These
reforms laid the basis for sustained economic recovery which continues today. Overall,
efficiency indicators have generally improved. Significant progress has been made in the
policy area of regulation and increased private sector participation (in some sectors) has
also helped improve efficiency and competition. In other sectors (water in particular),
improved management of a public utility without PSP explains many of the gains. In
most sectors, prices have declined during the loan implementation period. High coverage
rates of access to public services and infrastructure have been maintained, consumption
of public services has increased, and their overall perceived quality remains very good.7
Public services and infrastructure have been strengthened through improved management
and efficiency while, at the same time, protecting the access of the poor to public services.

During implementation, the performance of the loan was judged as satisfactory based on
progress toward the PDOs, and the flexibility of and strong partnership between the
Government and Bank in adapting to new context in order to sustain progress toward the
PDOs. As shown in the following table, the sector by sector results for each outcome are
mixed and the overall result is moderately satisfactory.




7 Since at the time of project design no specific PDO indicators, targets and monitoring mechanisms were
provided (see section 2.3), outcomes are assessed in terms of trends observed during the loan period and/or
comparisons with country performance across Latin America, depending on data available.

However, despite the achievement of the PDOs in Uruguay, this Program is rated as
marginally unsatisfactory in this ICR due to the following reasons. First, it is very
difficult to demonstrate that the achievements were accomplished through the instruments
laid out in the SAL conditions, since the SAL program failed to provide a results
framework that adequately linked the loan conditions and program outcomes. Second,
many SAL conditions were not actually met as specified in the original Program
Document and the Uruguayan government clearly achieved some results (such as better
results in the WSS sector) largely through improved management of a public utility,
rather than the full set of policy prescriptions (including PSP) contained in the PD.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Under the original program, the operation was cross-linked to a Special SAL which
sought to protect social programs from the effects of the economic crisis. Although the
cross-linkage was abandoned when the SAL was amended, the developmental objectives
of the Special SAL were fully achieved and documented in the ICR for that operation.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional
development)

The SAL Program has had a major institutional development impact in the areas of public
services and infrastructure. Substantial progress was made with administrative reforms in
URSEA and ANCAP that enhanced efficiency and set the foundations for further
institutional transformation in the future, including the establishment of new policy
making institutions. As stated above, particular efforts have been made to consolidate the
unbundling of sector functions and strengthen DINASA, the new Directorate for Water
and Sanitation, and the DNETN, the National Directorate for Energy and Nuclear
Technology, notably through the World Bank's Public Services Modernization Technical
Assistance Project (TAL). In the transport sector, the SAL encouraged the reorganization
of the sectors, particularly the railways sector, and supported the launching of new
schemes and companies as the Mega-concession and the CREMA in the roads sector, and
the CFU and the CCFU in the railways sector. In the communications sector, the SAL



                                             27

encouraged transferring the responsibility for telecommunications to the MIEM from the
Minister of Defense.

In the energy sector, small-scale power generation has been encouraged and this action
represents an important advance in terms of increasing competitiveness pressure in the
sector. In addition, the publication of guidelines for a national energy strategy was an
important step forward, although it falls short of the original objective which was to
introduce a full national energy policy. The reasons for this outcome are threefold. First,
external developments in the regional energy market necessitated a reassessment of
national energy policies. Second, there was a change of government that brought new
ideas to bear on national energy strategies and third, there was a need for additional time
to build a new national consensus on how the country should adapt to the changing
regional environment.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

In retrospect, the SAL-supported program may have been too ambitious in scope and
content to rally the widespread support needed for successful implementation. In
particular, the proposed initiatives to encourage Private Sector Participation (PSP) in
WSS and in the international trade and refining of petroleum products mobilized a
number of important constituencies that wanted those sectors to remain firmly in the
public domain. As a result, legislative and constitutional initiatives were invoked to block
the way. The SAL may have played a role in provoking opposition by elevating the
profile of PSP and possibly conveying the impression that the authorities were taking
advantage of a crisis situation to push through reforms that did not have broad public
support. In Uruguay, where there is a long tradition that calls for consensus, a more
measured and longer-term approach to PSP in WSS and petroleum trade may have
allowed more time to prepare public opinion. However, both the Bank and the borrower
were operating in a crisis environment where an accelerated reform appeared justified.

(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

For the first time in the last seventy years, the elections of 2005 brought to power a
political force other than the two traditional parties, the leftist movement, Frente Amplio.
The Frente Amplio has placed renewed emphasis on the public sector as a leading force
in the development process and on improving the efficiency of state-owned public service
providers, while maintaining the objective of private sector participation in the majority
of sectors. This new approach is still in its early stages. The public sector-oriented
approach to the provision of infrastructure and public services may lead to a more gradual



                                           28

and more limited improvement in efficiency than the approach that had been envisaged
originally under the Program. Although public utilities in Uruguay are not loss-making,
the longer-term financing requirements of the public investment program under the new
approach could also impose an added fiscal burden.

The gradualist, consensus approach that has traditionally characterized the Uruguayan
model continues to operate under the new administration. Maintaining the pace of the
reform process will be challenging given the need for social consensus, including the
labor unions and the business community, to carry out wide-ranging reforms aimed at
improving the investment climate. Delays in the passage of the tax reform illustrate the
challenge of developing the required consensus. On the other hand, the search for
consensus that characterizes Uruguay has historically helped to ensure that reforms, once
implemented, are generally sustained.

The domestic risks noted above are mitigated by the clear mandate the current
administration has received from the Uruguayan electorate and the alignment of the
overall objectives of the SAL Program with the government's program. A continued
focus on enhancing social protection will mitigate still further the risks arising from
social exclusion.

A source of external vulnerability to the program arises from possible restrictions in
electric power and natural gas supply that could beset the region. The government is
actively exploring improved electricity interconnection with Brazil to complement an
existing one with Argentina. Regional energy supply constraints mean that some
international cooperation agreements entered into before the crisis are not being honored
and will require modification. Those same problems may also be a deterrent to private
sector participation. On the other hand, the perspective of unmet energy demand in the
future strengthens incentives for investment and innovative market-driven solutions.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through
lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank collaborated effectively with the borrower in devising an effective strategy for
regulatory reform and for increasing efficiency and competition. Possible risks to
program implementation were clearly flagged in the Program Document. However, the
Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory. This is due to the fact that despite the appraisal team's
awareness of Project risks, particularly in terms of public opposition to PSP in the WSS
and hydrocarbon sectors, the push for structural reform went ahead without explicit



                                           29

alternative strategies in the event that the risks materialized. More generally, the design
of the SAL raises a more fundamental question about whether far-reaching structural
reforms can best be achieved at a time of deep crisis when conditionality can easily be
perceived as an attempt to use external financing as a way to force through policy
reforms without popular support.

Finally, the M&E arrangements were not very strong as the PDO were very broadly
framed, making difficult to assess their accomplishment.

Loan identification and design were consistent with the CAS. It built directly on previous
adjustment operations (SAL and Special SAL), and was consistent with the government's
development strategy. The Bank worked closely with the IMF, the IDB and other donors
on the design of the loan. Policy actions supported by the SAL program in the areas of
public services and infrastructure were well designed. They were designed to have a
positive impact on the quality of the public services while preserving access by the poor
to those services. The focus on policies that would protect electricity, oil and gas, WSS,
transport, telecommunications, and postal services was appropriate considering the social
and economic emergency in the country at the time.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank team kept a pro-active relation with government authorities during supervision
and was able to engage the new Government in a continued dialogue. The team
constantly adjusted, persuaded and engaged former and current authorities and brought
about a good result overall. The SAL was monitored through three full supervision
missions that included both infrastructure and human development specialists in
November 2003, May 2004 and April 2005, and supplementary supervision missions
carried out periodically by public services and infrastructure specialists in conjunction
with their other supervision responsibilities. The supplementary supervision missions
followed up progress on implementing agreed monitoring indicators and discussed results
with MEF, OPP, sector ministries and staff, and regulators. It is noteworthy that
supervision was not confined to technical Bank staff or to sector specialists. The country
Director and program managers took an active interest in program implementation and
were constantly available to provide assistance and additional resources when needed.

In addition to regular supervision missions there were ancillary activities that
strengthened the supervision function. The Bank funded an ESMAP technical paper that
provided support to the government for addressing strategic issues in the energy sector. A
Technical Assistance Loan provided an additional avenue of support for supervision of
the SAL.

Lastly, the continuity in task management that the Bank maintained both during project
preparation and supervision helped to keep a far-reaching multi-sectoral program on track
against a background of huge changes both in Uruguay and in the region.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall assessment of the Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.
Project identification and appraisal were moderately unsatisfactory in that a significant
amendment to the loan became necessary in the course of its implementation. The Bank
strove to minimize project delays resulting from political changes in the country, new
management teams, and new policy emphases. As it became clear that the project's
contingency funds would not be needed and there would be large savings, the Bank urged
the government to modify the Loan. Supervision was satisfactory at all stages of
implementation and it was intensified during the most severe stages of the economic
crisis.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower's role in loan preparation and implementation was rated as moderately
satisfactory. The borrower participated actively in the preparation and implementation of
the SAL. This included the preparation of interviews, information, research, surveys,
contacts, meetings and discussions. The borrower acted quickly, establishing the
conditions that made it possible to protect the most vulnerable sections of the population
from the effects of the crisis.

The change of administration in March 2005, although unprecedented in the history of
Uruguay, did not disrupt the program. The new government showed a high commitment
to the development objectives of the program. The communication between the MEF,
OPP, and sector authorities was fluent. OPP, with the support of the Ministry of
Economy and Finances, worked efficiently to implement the program and no setbacks on
the infrastructure sector were in evidence. However, the desire of the government to
evaluate anew some program actions (such as the articulation of a national energy plan)
has caused the time horizon for program implementation to be extended.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The principal agencies responsible for overall loan implementation were OPP and the
MEF and their performance is ranked satisfactory. The active involvement of high ranked
officials and their commitment to the implementation of the program is especially
noteworthy. The role of the sector agencies is likewise ranked satisfactory. The agents
participating in the Program had widely different responsibilities, and therefore



                                          31

performed different roles. The involvement and active participation of the MIEM after
the change in government is also noteworthy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The borrower's commitment to the adjustment program, and the arrangements made for
monitoring program implementation were good. Implementation was not easy because it
involved many different government agencies and ministries. Nevertheless, OPP and
MEF (and later on by MIEM) did a very good job in keeping track of the situation and
making sure that other agencies were aware of their respective obligations. Were it not
for the performance of OPP and MEF, continuity may have been lost as a result of many
changes in ministers. Where program implementation fell short of the original targets
(conditions), the Borrower cooperated with the Bank to find alternative strategies that
would satisfy the original development objectives.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

The experience preparing and implementing the SAL Program provides important lessons
for future operations.

(i)     The design of the SAL raises a fundamental question about whether far-reaching
structural reforms can best be achieved at a time of deep crisis when conditionality can
easily be perceived as an attempt to use external financing as a way to force through
policy reforms without popular support. This may be particularly true in consensus-
driven countries like Uruguay.

(ii)    Sector reforms should be based on a realistic assessment of the political and
economic context and the willingness of the people and the government to accept the
reform. Discussions with officials of the current and previous administrations during
program implementation showed that a program involving policy changes with many
different objectives (increased competitiveness, improved performance, reduced costs,
increased competition, greater private participation in many sectors, reduced vulnerability
to external changes, etc) involves regulatory rules and an institutional framework that can
only work with popular support.

(iii)   Regional economic and political issues present opportunities and risks that have
to be taken into account in Bank operations. Many infrastructure projects and some
services such as telecommunications and energy need a market size that is not to be
found in a small country such as Uruguay. The Bank should be mindful that reforms may
be affected by changes and have consequences beyond the national frontier and their
likelihood of happening should be carefully assessed.

(iv)    When cross-linking conditions for tranche release between development policy
loans, the financial leverage needs to be weighed together with the potential problems


                                          32

that might arise if reforms move at different speeds. While cross-conditionality provides
a good incentive to fulfill commitments, it may also slow down or impede
implementation. The experience with the SAL and the Special SAL shows that in some
cases, linking two or more operations that have no direct policy connections may have a
negative effect when a program that is progressing well does not receive the expected
support because of delays elsewhere.

(v)     A solid prior understanding of sector issues will facilitate the preparation and
implementation of the Program. Continuous dialogue with government counterparts and
independent analysts simplified the team's work during preparation, because the issues
could be clearly identified.

(vi)    Close and careful supervision can secure the sustainability of programs even in a
time of crisis or change in government. Despite the difficult economic and social
situation in Uruguay and the frequent changes of ministers and staff, proactive
supervision and a sustained dialogue with MEF, OPP and sector authorities engendered
support of the program from all counterparts, and ensured implementation even after
March 2005 when there was an unprecedented change of government. An active dialogue
enabled bridges to be built with the new administration.

(vii)   Other instruments such as a TA loan can help secure the successful
implementation of structural and institutional reforms. The Technical Assistance Loan
was instrumental in helping to implement the SAL. In particular, by securing the
necessary technical and financial inputs to establish and strengthen capacity at the
regulatory agencies (URSEA and URSEC), the new Directorate for Water and Sanitation
(DINASA), the National Directorate for Energy and Nuclear Technology (DNETN),
ADME and the Ministry of Transport and Public Works.

(viii) When a program is vulnerable to serious risks and those risks are identified at
appraisal, the operation should include contingency plans that can be mobilized in the
event that the risks materialize.

(ix)    Strong M&E arrangements should be clearly specified, including appropriate
indicators and targets to assess achievement of programmed outcomes.

(x)     PDO should be tightly defined to facilitate an objective basis for assessing
success.

(xi)    Tariff increases and other reforms are possible without social upheaval if properly
identified and smoothly conducted. The Bank should understand and acknowledge
cultural realities and, if needed, accept slowing down some reforms and relaxing some
measures and controls.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

Annex 4 presents the Government's comments to the draft ICR prepared by the Bank. In
general terms, these comments are consistent with the conclusions of the World Bank's
ICR. However, the Government left on record its discrepancy with the overall rating
("Moderately Satisfactory" in the draft submitted for their consideration), arguing that the
ICR provides enough information to justify a "Satisfactory" rating based on the
achievement of the PDOs and how the Government and Bank worked effectively to
continue to move toward the PDOs through changes in administration and regional
context.

This loan was negotiated and approved in the framework of the international financial
institutions' aid package for our country, in response to the serious financial crisis
weathered in 2002.

In addition to its purpose as a loan operation, it called for a series of reforms intended to
promote economic growth, enhance the economy's competitiveness, and improve the
people's social well-being.

At the conclusion of the operation it is possible to note substantial progress in attainment
of its objectives in terms of economic growth and social well-being, as well as
implementation of the reforms agreed upon in each sector.

In the course of the operation there were changes in the contextual setting, which entailed
a significant change in the implicit assumptions that justified a number of the actions
(established as conditionalities in the initial operating plan). Firstly, there was the crisis
in the regional electric and natural gas markets, which precluded broad integration of
markets as a mechanism of achieving greater competitiveness in the energy sector.
Secondly, there were two referendums (in matters concerning the petroleum sector, the
potable water sector, and sanitation) that resulted in changes in the legal framework, so
there was no legal basis for some of the proposed reforms. Thirdly, the government
elected by the voters in 2004, which supports the operation's objectives, placed greater
emphasis on the strategy of improving the management of public sector actors as a means
of attaining more effective and efficient provision of public services (in water and power).

Achievement of most of the objectives (economic growth with macroeconomic stability,
increased competitiveness, and improvement in the people's well-being), and the
successful completion of the operation, lead us to conclude that the latter was satisfactory.

Consequently, the government considers necessary to leave on record its discrepancy
with the overall rating ... which was given to the operation in Section 3.3 ("Justification
of Overall Outcome Rating"). Beyond this rating, the content of the document prepared
by Bank staff provides adequate information that will give the operation a rating that is
one category higher ("Satisfactory"). For example, with regard to the "Outcomes" table
of Section 3.2 ("Achievement of Program Development Objectives"), if the appropriate
point is awarded to each cell of the matrix and the average was calculated (by row or
column), an overall rating of "satisfactory" (5 points) instead of "moderately satisfactory"
(4 points) will be the result.

The manner in which this operation was designed, the changes in the regional and local
context following signing, and the negotiation process to modify a number of
conditionalities that were no longer feasible or appropriate, leave us with some lessons
for the design of future operations:



                                            39

-   It is important to have the destination of the loan proceeds closely linked to the
    operation's objective and the conditions set for disbursements.
-   Mechanisms must be designed to permit flexible terms when there are major
    changes in the premises and hypotheses, without necessarily altering the
    operation's basic objectives.
-   Carefully evaluate the political, social, and cultural viability of those conditions
    that call for actions that may not enjoy support by a broad sector of society, either
    because they are not fully understood or because there is no agreement on the
    means chosen to accomplish the objective.
-   When there is more than one way of achieving the same objective, choose the
    most effective one but do not reject the rest.
-   Distinguish clearly between the indispensable and accessory conditions for
    attaining given objectives.

In conclusion, despite significant changes in the contextual setting, we can assert that
the operation's objectives were achieved for the most part. It is also important to note
that the Bank staff and the government representatives both put forth considerable
effort during the negotiations at which both parties demonstrated flexibility in
prioritizing the initial objectives of the program, without retaining the conditionalities
that were no longer applicable.

Finally, as noted in the Charter on Development Policies of November 27, 2006,
successful economic development strategy requires alternatives that successfully
blend productive growth and social inclusiveness, setting aside the false dichotomy
between the two concepts. Taking this premise into account, and considering the
lessons and experience gained by all parties in the various stages of this operation, we
shall certainly improve the design and execution of future joint cooperation activities.

 Annex 7. Compliance with Original and Revised Conditions for Tranches 2 and 3


Regulation of public services

Over the course of the SAL implementation period, regulation was successfully
consolidated in Uruguay, despite the changing political and economic environment
within the country and the region. Following on from the establishment of URSEC, the
regulatory agency for communications, in February 2001, the unbundling of policy
making, regulation and operation functions of public services was completed with the
creation of URSEA in December 2002 which was charged with rule-making for both the
energy (power, natural gas and petroleum products) and water (water supply and
sanitation) sectors. Since then URSEA and URSEC have become well established entities.
With the support of the national government, both agencies continue to improve their
performance and their technical and managerial capacities with renewed ownership,
interest and dedication. No specific transport related outputs were part of the loan
conditionality.

Specific achievements within each sector and under each of the agreed loan conditions
established to help improve regulation can be summarized as follows:

The government successfully established two multi-sector regulatory agencies: URSEA
for energy & WSS and URSEC for communications & postal services. Hence, action 1 of
the amended conditions governing the release of the second tranche has been met. The
agencies have been staffed, Directors have been appointed, and operational procedures
have been defined. Both agencies have begun operations. The introduction of regulatory
accounting     has,   however,      progressed      at   different    paces      in   power, WSS,
telecommunications, and natural gas. In the power and WSS sectors, URSEA completed
the technical work needed for the implementation of regulatory accounting, and public
utilities are preparing to implement it. In the telecommunication and natural gas sectors,
consultant firms completed the technical work. The regulators expect to complete the
implementation of regulatory accounting in 2007.

The publication of performance indicators has progressed significantly. Hence, action 2
of the amended conditions for second tranche release has been met. In the WSS sector,
the water utility regularly publishes data concerning quality of service and
complementary performance indicators both in the national press and, since February 21,
2003, on its web page8. URSEA has posted water quality indicators on its web page since
May 10, 2005. With respect to the power sector, on December 24, 2003 URSEA
specified a list of indicators that would be published and the modalities of publication.
The first set of indicators to be published was for the period January ­ June 2006. They
relate to the quality of service both in technical and commercial terms. In
telecommunications, URSEC has posted on its web page, aggregated performance


8OSE no longer publicly commits to achieving certain performance levels by certain dates.




                                               43

indicators for fixed and mobile operators since October 2006. The intention is, in the
medium term, to publish these indicators operator by operator. In the natural gas sector,
URSEA is currently considering which indicators to request from the concession
operator.

Energy

The objective of establishing a target tariff for electricity distribution and converging
towards that tariff has not been accomplished to date. Hence, action 1 of the original
conditions for second tranche release has not been met. Uruguay has faced a tight power
supply situation for several years. Its strategy was based on hydropower resources and on
medium-term contracts to purchase power from Argentina. In 2003, URSEA completed a
value added study on power distribution and submitted it with a recommendation to the
government. However, the former administration left the approval of a target tariff for
power distribution to the successor government. After consulting with URSEA and UTE
and considering the changes that have taken place in the energy market, particularly in
the regional power and natural gas markets, the government decided not to issue the
decree at this stage. The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (MIEM) considered that
there were other policies that have higher priority, particularly the introduction of
transmission tolls. Clearly defined tolls are a basic requirement for attracting the interest
of private participants in power generation because they facilitate wholesale transactions.
In March 2004, Argentina began reducing energy exports to Uruguay because it was
experiencing domestic shortages and Uruguay had to make alternative arrangements
which raised the marginal cost of the Uruguayan system from US$54/MWh in 2004 to
US$209/MWh in 2006. Tolls for transmissions at voltage levels equal or greater than
150 kV and international transmission were finally approved by decree early in 2007.

A regulatory framework for downstream petroleum products was established. Hence,
action 3 of the amended conditions for release of the second tranche has been met. A
constitutionally sanctioned referendum on December 8, 2003 revoked the 2002 law that
ended ANCAP's monopoly over the import, export and refining of crude oil as well as the
export of petroleum derivatives, restricting the market for petroleum products to private
enterprises and therefore impacting competition. The possibility that there may be
resistance to private sector participation had been recognized in the Project Document as
a possible risk to the program. Following the referendum, MIEM issued a decree
establishing rules for non-discriminatory access to all stages of the commercialization of
combustibles, including wholesale and retail distribution, as well as transport and
distribution services. The decree introduced limited competition by allowing new
distributors and service stations to be independent of ANCAP. Hence, ANCAP no longer
has a monopoly on the domestic distribution and sale of petroleum products.
Furthermore, in February 2004, URSEA issued two new regulations on LPG. As a result,
there was an increase in the number of bids (from 2 to 4) from operators interested in the
distribution of 13 Kg LPG cylinders.

A sector law for natural gas has not yet been enacted. Action 5 of the original conditions
for release of the second tranche has not been met. A draft law presented to Parliament by



                                            44

the former administration was withdrawn by the current government which was
concerned that the draft law did not address the needs of the gas sector and did not reflect
its sector policy. The government believes that public and private sector responsibilities,
the tariff system and user rights are already well defined in concession contracts and
decrees. Furthermore, the law that created URSEA established regulatory principles for
all services for which URSEA is accountable, including natural gas. Today URSEA
enforces the terms of concession contracts, including tariffs, service quality and security.

Nonetheless, the government wants to improve the existing legal and regulatory
framework for the natural gas sector and MIEM is to lead the task. Options under
consideration include the consolidation of all natural gas regulations in a single text
(Texto Ordenado) and the enactment of a sector law. The objective of the original loan
condition was to create a stable legal and regulatory framework for the sector to
encourage the introduction of natural gas in the domestic and industrial market and to
take advantage of the potential for a regional natural gas market when it develops. Issuing
the Texto Ordenado would be a significant step towards that objective. The government
is concerned that new legislation might be perceived by private operators as a change in
the rules of the game that may require contracts to be renegotiated - a perception that
may be negatively received by the market.

Postal Services

A regulatory framework for the postal sector has not been established by decree, but most
of the important sector issues were satisfactorily addressed in Articles 77-79 of the 2005-
2009 Budget Law. Hence, Action 4 of the amended conditions for release of the second
tranche has been met. Articles 77-79 of the 2005-2009 Budget Law established a
framework for URSEC to monitor and regulate the sector. It mandates universal postal
coverage, defines the postal services fee and establishes the fund that will administer
sector resources. Moreover, a law is a more powerful instrument than a decree,
underscoring the importance of postal service issues to the government. The Executive
has informed the Bank that the approval of the Articles was a first step toward a
comprehensive regulatory framework for postal services. Meanwhile, a system has been
introduced for monitoring sector performance including the quality of service, the volume
of mail and the coverage of delivery services.

Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS)

A sector regulatory framework for WSS has not been established. Hence, Action 6 of the
original conditions for release of the second tranche has not been met. A draft law
establishing the regulatory framework was sent to Parliament by the former
administration but it was rendered unconstitutional by the October 2004 Constitutional
Amendment. Article 47 of the Constitutional Amendment requires WSS services to be
provided exclusively by state entities. That provision invalidated the overall concept of
the draft law. The government has begun anew to establish a legal and regulatory
framework for the entire water sector (provision of WSS services and water resources
management). New institutions have been created, and consultations have begun between



                                           45

them. Comprehensive legislation to underpin the legal and regulatory framework for the
WSS sector is now under-way. Significant progress has been made in preparing the draft
law, which is now expected to be presented to parliament within one to two years.

Article 327 of the Budget Law 2005-2009 makes the National Directorate of Water and
Sanitation (DINASA) responsible for national policies concerning the provision of WSS
services and Water Resources Management. Article 331 of the same law establishes an
Advisory Commission on Water and Sanitation (COASAS) to incorporate and implement
sector policies through inter-institutional coordination and public consultations. In
January 2006 the Executive appointed a director for DINASA and placed the entity under
the Ministry of Housing, Land Management and the Environment (MVOTMA). In
parallel, a coordinating structure has been established to align the new institutional design
with the Constitutional reform. An Executive decree was promulgated in November
2006, defining the COASAS' tasks and composition, and opening up a consultation
process for the development of the WSS regulatory framework. In addition, an agreement
has been signed between MVOTMA and the Universidad de la República to assess legal,
institutional and technical options for a WSS regulatory framework. Finally, with support
from the Bank-financed Public Services Modernization Technical Assistance Project
(TAL), work has begun on regulatory legislation with respect to Article 47 of the
Constitutional Amendment. It is clear, therefore, that the government is methodically
searching for new strategies to improve efficiency and the quality of service in WSS.

Efficiency and Competition

In the telecommunications and transport sectors the results are impressive. Five of the six
agreed outputs were fully achieved and the sixth was partially achieved. As a result
competition was considerably increased. Eighteen private companies began to provide
international long distance services and three new mobile companies began competing
with the national company in the mobile phone market. Interconnection regulation, an
independent telephone numbering management system, a customer database
administrator, and precise rules for identifying the origin and destination of phone calls
were approved and implemented. In the transport sector, private operators now manage
Montevideo's international airport (Action 6). On July 8, 2003 a contract for the 20-year
concession of the Carrasco International Airport was signed between the National
Ministry of Defense and the public limited company "Puerta del Sur." Arrangements are
under way to improve railway operations by awarding management contracts to private
operators and Parliament authorized the creation of the Corporación Ferroviaria del
Uruguay ­ CFU (Railway Corporation of Uruguay), as a public limited company,
responsible for the rehabilitation and maintenance of railway infrastructure through a
contract with AFE. (Action 10. b).

In the energy and WSS sectors the results are mixed. In the energy sector, despite the lack
of success in opening access in the petroleum sector and in establishing an effective and
competitive wholesale power market, there has been considerable progress in making the
accounts of ANCAP more transparent, in eliminating fuel tax distortions and in closing
the gap between ex-refinery prices and estimated import parity prices of petroleum



                                           46

products. Furthermore, a number of measures have been taken to broaden the sources of
energy generation, including aero derivative gas turbines, wind power, biomass and small
hydro projects. A transition program will gradually introduce wholesale market
regulation and establish standards necessary to facilitate the development of independent
generation projects.

In the WSS sector, OSE established and put in operation a special unit to manage
unaccounted for water activities. The 2005 Constitutional amendment precluded the
company from hiring private sector operators to manage that type of program.

Specific achievements within each sector and under each of the agreed loan conditions
established to help increase efficiency and competition can be summarized as follows:

Energy

Costs and revenues of the Administración Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland
(ANCAP) have been made more transparent. Hence, Action 4 of the amended conditions
for release of the second tranche has been met and has produced the desired result. On
February 2005, following the 2003 referendum that revoked the law establishing open
access to the oil market, ANCAP created a logistics unit to make costs and revenues more
transparent and to facilitate collaboration with companies interested in producing refined
products. The new logistics unit is responsible for storage, transport and delivery of
ANCAP's petroleum products. It operates separately from the commercialization unit,
and it has a separate management and accounting system. Except for the establishment of
separate finances, the new unit complies with the requirements of the original condition.

Region-wide constraints to the supply of electric power made it impossible for ADME,
the power authority, to arrange for power purchase agreements as envisaged under the
program. Hence, Action 7 of the original conditions for release of the second tranche was
not met. Law 16.832 of 2002 created an Electricity Wholesale Market (ADME) defined
as consisting of a market for fixed-term contracts and a spot market. Power purchase
agreements were to be an integral part of ADME. However, the supply of energy from
Argentina was seriously interrupted at the time of the economic crisis so that new fixed-
term contracts with private sector generators could not be secured. There was also a lack
of private sector interest in the development of new electricity generation in the
competitive market. The dollarization of export contracts and a temporary interruption of
gas supplies from Argentina further disrupted earlier agreements between UTE and
private agents in Argentina. There were no offers from private operators in the 2002
when bids were invited for a 300 MW natural gas combined cycle power plant.

In 2005, however, measures were taken to broaden the sources of energy generation in
Uruguay and in 2006 UTE signed a power purchase agreement for the installation of
1.2MW aero derivative gas turbine at the Maldonado Landfill. The government also
arranged for a wind power project within the framework of a debt restructuring
agreement with Spain and issued a decree allowing UTE to contract additional generating
capacity based on renewable fuels, and UTE has invited bids for 60 MW of power
generation projects based on wind, biomass and small-scale hydro power. To encourage


                                           47

small generation projects, the government is focusing on the security of supply, the
design of tolls and access to the transmission network.

Recent developments have led the government to reconsider the market structure for
power. There is a debate within the public sector as to whether, given the relatively small
size of the domestic market, expectations from a broader competition framework may be
unrealistic. There is also discussion as to whether the electric power utility should keep a
strong vertical structure, in order to compete in a regional market that is dominated by
large companies. It has been suggested that, at least for the time being, the function of
load dispatching and system operations should not be transferred to ADME because it
may weaken UTE. However, the transfer of those functions to ADME is crucial if new
players are to be attracted and if competitiveness in the power sector is to be enhanced.

Region-wide constraints to the supply of electric power also made it impossible for
ADME, the power authority, to establish a spot market for power supply as envisaged
under the program. Hence Action 4 of the conditions for third tranche release was not
met. A prerequisite for a spot market is the establishment of fixed-term contracts. The
government is working to develop a transition program that will gradually introduce
wholesale market regulation and establish standards for independent generation projects.

The private sector has not been given open access to the port and warehouse facilities of
ANCAP as envisaged under the program. Hence, Action 8 of the original conditions for
release of the second tranche has not been met. A referendum led to the repeal of Law
17.448, which would have permitted private operators access to ANCAP facilities.
ANCAP retains a monopoly position in this sector apart from the distribution and
retailing of petroleum products.

Significant progress has been made towards the goal of closing the gap between the ex-
refinery prices and the estimated import parity prices of petroleum derivatives. Hence,
Action 7 of the amended conditions for release of the second tranche has been met. From
March 2003 to July 2006, the gap for the main derivatives has been reduced significantly,
except for LPG (supergas) which is used widely by households in Uruguay for heating
and cooking. Due to the volatility of international prices it is very difficult to close the
price gap for derivatives and keep it closed. Nevertheless, the gap continued to be
reduced even when world petroleum prices spiked which indicates that higher prices for
derivatives, other than LPG, were fully passed on to the domestic consumer (see Figure 1
below). Key to this achievement has been the methodology established by URSEA in
August 2004 for calculating import parity prices for liquid fuels. Those import parity
prices are regularly posted on URSEA's web page. In July 2006, the government
decreased the consumer price for LPG to encourage substitution away from electricity as
part of its broader energy policy.

Discrepancies in the retail price of fuels between Uruguay and neighboring countries
have been significantly reduced. Hence, Action 8 of the amended conditions for release
of the second tranche has been met. Relative price distortions have been reduced in two
ways: (i) fuel taxes are now fixed instead of proportional as before; and (ii) the absolute
prices themselves have been adjusted. In August 2006, for example, tax on a liter of
Gasoline Supra 95 (Nafta Super) was 3.4 times higher than tax on a liter of Diesel (Gas
Oil). The difference is significantly lower than the 5.3 ratio that prevailed in August
2002. In part as a consequence of harmonizing taxes, a liter of Gasoline Supra at the
pump cost 1.5 times more than a liter of Diesel in August 2006. The gap is 30 percent
less than in August 2002. Consequently, price differentials between Uruguay and
neighboring countries are now smaller (less than 20 percent relative to Brazil and Chile).
The price differentials between Uruguay and Argentina are larger because of current
Argentine pricing policies.

Water Supply and Sanitation

OSE was not able to offer a performance-based contract to a private operator for the
management of a program to reduce Unaccounted-for-Water (UFW) in Montevideo.
Hence, Action 9 of the original conditions for release of the second tranche was not met.
The Constitutional Amendment of 2005 made it unconstitutional to invite private
operators to participate in the WSS. However, OSE has made it clear that two of its top
priorities - to be led by OSE are a public sector company - are: (i) reducing UFW and
increasing water revenues; and (ii) the company's organizational renewal. The Bank is
supporting these efforts with the recently approved second APL for OSE.

Telecommunications

An independent telephone numbering management system has been introduced and it has
improved competition in telecommunications. Hence Action 5(a) of the original
conditions for release of the third tranche has been met. Besides granting additional
licenses in both International Long Distance (ILD) and mobile markets, in 2001 the
government made URSEC responsible for planning and managing the telephone
numbering system and for assigning numbers. In December 2004, URSEC approved the
National Numbering Plan.

The adoption of a customer database administrator has improved competition in
telecommunications. Hence, Action 5(b) of the original conditions for release of the third
tranche has been met. Decree 442/01 appointed URSEC administrator of the customer
database. URSEC held public consultations on how best to access ILD operators and
finally adopted a system in September, 2006. The new system is based on dialing and not
on pre-subscribing to the data base of a particular administrator, as was the old system.

Precise rules for signaling (i.e., identifying the origin and destination of a telephone call)
have been defined and they have improved competition in telecommunications. Hence,
Action 5(c) of the original conditions for release of the third tranche has been met.
Decree 442/01 made URSEC responsible for the signaling plan. The precise rules for
signaling were laid out in the National Signaling Plan and legally established through
Resolution 429/04.

Transport

Private operators now manage Montevideo's international airport. Hence, Action 10 of
the original conditions for release of the second tranche has been met. On July 8, 2003 a
contract for the 20-year concession of the Carrasco International Airport was signed
between the National Ministry of Defense and the public limited company "Puerta del
Sur." The concession covers the administration, operation, maintenance and management
of the airport, including commercial activities such as duty free shops. The concession
payments consist of a "canon" or fixed charge of US$2.5 million (amortized over the life
of the contract) and a fee of US$2.3 per unit of work, which would result in a total
contract price of about US$34 million.

Invitations were issued to bid for awarding a management concession of the Montevideo
port multipurpose terminal (puerto polivalente). Hence, Action 6(a) of the original
conditions for release of the third tranche has been met. In December 2002, the National
Administration of Ports (ANP) invited bids for the concession of the multipurpose
terminal of the port of Montevideo. However, later on the bidding process was halted and
the multipurpose terminal concession has not been awarded. Nonetheless and as
discussed in section 3.2, the underlying development objective (boosting Uruguay's
economic growth and improving the operational efficiency and competitiveness of its
ports) was attained in other ways.

Arrangements are under way to improve railway operations by awarding management
contracts to private operators. Hence, Action 10(b) of the amended conditions for release
of the second tranche has been met. Under the previous government, MTOP invited bids
to renovate the railway sections between Montevideo ­ Rivera ­ Sagayo ­ Minas and
Toledo ­ Rio Branco but none of the offers received on March 2004 complied with
technical and financial requirements and the bid was cancelled. Subsequently, in January
2006 the current government reversed the separation of infrastructure management and
railways operations. Under the new sector policy, a scheme to integrate the railway
transport system with the private sector was launched. Under this scheme, Parliament
authorized the creation of the Corporación Ferroviaria del Uruguay ­ CFU (Railway
Corporation of Uruguay), as a public limited company, responsible for the rehabilitation
and maintenance of railway infrastructure through a contract with AFE.

The CFU is expected to be set up in 2007 and will then call for bids from private
companies for the rehabilitation of about 900 km of the rail network. The
Comercializadora de Carga Ferroviaria del Uruguay (CCFU), a parallel mixed (private
and public) entity is also to be created and, together with AFE, made responsible for
marketing, planning, coordinating and controlling the rail transportation of freight
throughout the country and the maintenance of rolling-stock. The objective is to attract
the participation of private companies, which would provide rolling-stock and operational
expertise. The private sector is expected to invest about US$30 million in infrastructure
investment and rehabilitation and US$40 million in capital investment in CCFU.

Institutional Development

Over the course of its implementation, the Program significantly impacted economic
development through its support in helping to establish and consolidate regulation in all
infrastructure sectors; separate sector functions; define sector policy; and restructure the
sectors and their entities. The Program's assistance to regulatory reform was discussed
above. The unbundling of sector functions has been notable and welcome in the WSS and
energy sectors, including the establishment of new policy making institutions. Particular
efforts have been made to strengthen DINASA, the new Directorate for Water and
Sanitation, and the DNETN, the National Directorate for Energy and Nuclear Technology,
notably through the World Bank's Public Services Modernization Technical Assistance
Project (TAL).

The SAL directly contributed to the achievement of these results by promoting and
supporting the development and publication of the government's Guidelines for an
Energy Strategy, as described below. In addition, the SAL contributed more broadly to
these results by raising national awareness of the existing shortcomings and providing
momentum for institutional strengthening.

The SAL also made significant contributions to the strengthened of institutions in the
transport and communications sectors. In the transport sector, the SAL supported the
reorganization of the sectors, particularly the railways sector, and supported the
launching of new schemes and companies as the Mega-concession and the CREMA in
the roads sector, and the CFU and the CCFU in the railways sector. In the


                                          51

communications sector, the SAL encouraged transferring the responsibility for
telecommunications to the MIEM from the Minister of Defense.

Specific achievements under the agreed loan condition established to help strengthen
infrastructure institutions can be summarized as follows:

Guidelines for the definition of a National Energy Policy have been issued and published
by the MIEM. Hence, Action 11 of the amended conditions for release of the second
tranche has been met. On August 18, 2006 the MIEM issued and posted in its web-page
the government's "Guidelines for an Energy Strategy - Uruguay 2006," which provides
the basic building blocks of a policy. The strategy took account of inputs from the
previous ESMAP-financed work. The key objectives visualized by the Government for
the energy sector are to (i) ensure cost-effective supply to satisfy domestic demand, with
a good quality of service under the aegis of the State, by maximizing the use of local,
regional and renewable energy resources; (ii) promote energy efficiency, diversify the
sources of supply promote clean energy, and (iii) expand the sector with public and
private participation, by adapting the legal and regulatory frameworks as necessary. The
guidelines address issues relating to: (a) a robust and cost effective electric energy supply
system; (b) improved access to fossil fuel resources; (c) inclusion of natural gas in the
energy matrix; (d) a greater use of renewables (particularly biofuels, windpower, and
biomass-based power generation); (e) policies for energy efficiency; (f) updating and
improving the regulatory framework; (g) making energy more accessible to the poor; and
(h) encouraging coordination between institutions and participants in the energy sector to
better formulate policies and plans and to build capacity within MIEM, particularly the
National Directorate of Energy and Technology (Dirección Nacional de Energía y
Tecnología Nuclear, DNETN).

                 Annex 8. Progress on Project Development Objectives


Reduced Prices

In most sectors, prices have declined during the loan period. The SAL contributed mostly
indirectly through strengthened regulation in the communications, water and energy
sectors (since regulators help set tariff structures); increased competitiveness, and greater
utility efficiency. Moreover, specific program conditions were targeted at increasing
petroleum prices to align them with market prices. This section reviews the evolution of
prices at the sector level.

Energy

Reforms in the power sector have been modest, yet progress has been made. The cost of
gas has decreased by 24% compared with 2003 (see Figure 3). Electricity prices have
been reduced by 15% compared with pre-crisis 2000 levels, although they are now 9%
higher that in 2003. Nevertheless, most of UTE's tariff blocks remain below the Regional
average tariffs in the power sector (see Figure 4).

In the petroleum sector, as discussed in section 2.1 and in annex 7, rather than reducing
prices, the aim was to close the gap between the ex-refinery prices and the estimated
import parity prices of petroleum derivatives. This objective was accomplished and the
gap for the main derivatives has been reduced significantly, except for LPG (supergas)
which is used widely by households in Uruguay for heating and cooking.

Telecommunications

The cost of communications has generally been falling, according to the latest figures
provided by URSEC. For example, the average cost of a long distance call fell by 33%
(in constant pesos) between January 2002 and January 2005 and appears correlated with
the entrance of new players in the communications market in mid-2002 (Figure 5). Figure
6 shows that prices of mobile communications (both pre-paid and post-paid) have been
evolving below the overall price index. Figure 7 shows a recent decline in mobile phone
prices.

Water and Sanitation

In the WSS sector, some modest reductions in tariffs have also been made. Although
tariffs have recovered from their post-crisis low in 2003, tariffs do remain almost 15%
lower than in 2000 (see Figure 8). Moreover, OSE should be commended for its careful
management of tariffs during the crisis and its ability to rapidly recover revenue
collection rates following the crisis (shown in Figure 28 below, under the efficiency
section), thereby achieving the twin objectives of maintaining affordability and
supporting a rapid economic recovery and financial sustainability of the utilities. OSE
restructured tariffs in January 2007 in efforts to rationalize and make tariffs more
transparent. This restructuring should further reduce average tariffs for 2007.

Figure 8 also illustrates the quick recovery of average water tariffs from the 2002
economic crisis. The effective handling of tariffs ensured that the crisis had only a
temporary impact on OSE's revenue. However, relative to other Latin American
countries, Uruguay's tariffs continue to be high, indicating there may be room for more
efficiency gains in the future

Transport

Uruguay has lower direct transport costs than Argentina or Mexico9 (Figure 9), although
it varies significantly according to the type of product (see Tables 2 and 3). Final
destination also affects transport costs (direct costs for export are typically two or three
times higher than domestic, when comparing Food and Other Manufactures in Tables 2
and 3).

The surveys conducted for the preparation of the Investment Climate Assessment also
indicated that transportation costs and losses from breakage and spoilage as a percentage
of shipment value are low in Uruguay compared with countries in the region (Figure 10).
This data can be considered as a proxy for indirect costs in the absence of a monetary
quantification. The low indirect costs are an indication of the good quality and relative
reliability of transport services and infrastructure in the country. As shown in table 4, the
average shipment time for exporting firms is 20 days to destination whereas at the local
level, the average delivery time is less than one day (this is a good value that indicates no
significant interruptions or unnecessary delays in domestic transportation adding to the
indirect costs).

Ports operations in Montevideo are competitive and have grown considerably since the
2002 reform. In 2005, the port of Montevideo handled 454,531 TEU (Twenty-foot
Equivalent Unit) (See Table 5). Overall, the number of TEUs has increased seven-fold
since the 2002 reform, which resulted in intra-port competition, a decline in port tariffs,
and significant new investments from the private sector. The average cost of container
transfer in Montevideo is substantially lower than non-concessioned ports in Peru,
Ecuador, and Central America. The port of Montevideo is fairly competitive relative to
other privately operated ports in Latin America. For instance, the cost per TEU in
Montevideo is less than in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Valparaiso (Chile) but slightly
more than in Cartagena (Colombia).10

Increased Quality and Coverage

High coverage rates of access to public services and infrastructure have been maintained
and the overall perceived quality of public services and infrastructure in Uruguay remains
good. The SAL program design widely recognized that Uruguay already enjoyed very
high coverage levels of public services and infrastructure in comparison with other Latin
American countries. Hence, the program objective was to ensure that the coverage rates
would be maintained, in spite of the crisis. No SAL conditions explicitly focused on
increasing coverage.

The overall perceived quality of public services and infrastructure in Uruguay remains
high, as noted in the World Bank's (2007) Investment Climate Survey and the World
Bank's (2007) Eficiencia en Infra-estructura Productiva y Provisión de Servicios en
Uruguay. The following paragraphs review the main achievements in each of the sectors
in terms of improved coverage and quality of the services and infrastructure.

Energy

Uruguay compares very well with other regional countries in losses due to power cuts as
declared by businesses (Figure 11). There has also been a positive evolution in the
reduction of the frequency of interruptions for consumers (Figure 12). Although,
coverage rates have remained above 90%, waiting times for access to the service still
ranks relatively poorly compared with other countries in the region (Figure 13).

Telecommunications

Uruguay has managed to develop the most extensive telecommunications sector in the
entire region and it now has the highest penetration rate in Latin America for fixed-line
subscribers. The fixed network is 100 percent digitalized and there is no waiting time to
acquire a fixed line. Fixed-line coverage and teledensity is very high compared to
regional averages (Figure 14) and Uruguay ranks amongst the first 10 in Latin-America
in terms of mobile teledensity (Figure 15). As discussed above, Uruguay remains well
ranked in the Americas in terms of digital opportunity access.

Competition in the mobile telephone industry began in 2004, leading to an explosion in
the number of mobile subscribers and teledensity (mobile phone subscribers per 100
inhabitants), especially in the last three years (see figures 16 and 17).

Internet access is also growing at a considerable rate, especially non-commuted services
through the different technologies offered by the operators. The current trends shows that
non commuted access is gradually substituting commuted services (figure 18). The
volume of data transmission services (national and international) is also showing a
growth trend in the last 2 years (figure 19).

Water and Sanitation

OSE's capacity to reduce its operating costs and maintain a sound operating margin
(discussed above) also enabled OSE to scale-up investments in WSS service expansion
during the crisis and its aftermath. Uruguay continues to enjoy some of the highest water
supply coverage levels for middle income countries. Access to safe water is universal and
96% of households are connected to the piped water supply network. As with most of the
region, access to sewerage is somewhat lower at around 48% nationally (see figure 20).

Since 2002, OSE has successfully provided an additional 81,000 new water supply
connections, including 5,400 individual household connections in informal settlements in
Montevideo which sprung up after the crisis. However, given already excellent water
coverage rates, and in the absence of detailed up-to-date data, these incremental
improvements in coverage have not been reflected in the national coverage data
available11. OSE gains in terms of improving sewerage coverage have been easier to
measure. Access to OSE sewerage services12 in the interior of Uruguay (excluding the
capital Montevideo) has increased from 26% in 2002 to 32% in 2006. OSE's capacity to



11According to the WHO-UNICEF JMP, household connection rates to the piped water network remained
constant between 2000 and 2004 (latest available data) at 96%. According to OSE own data, the proportion
of households in Uruguay with an OSE water connection has decreased very slightly from 92.3% in 2002
to 91.2% in 2006. However OSE data may not accurately reflect coverage trends for several reasons. First,
the financial crisis led to a sudden proliferation of underserved informal urban settlement particularly in
Montevideo. Although OSE has provided 5400 formal metered individual connections in Montevideo
settlements since the crisis, a large number of these connections are informal (i.e., connected to the OSE
network, but being measured as unaccounted for water) and are therefore not captured in the above
coverage rates. Second, the drop in 2005 coincides with the re-incorporation of Maldonado into OSE books
(since Maldonado, a seasonal costal resort area, had lower connection rates that overall OSE). Third, in-
between national censuses, coverage rates are based on total population estimates In sum, coverage rates
remain high, and may have even increased, in spite of the crisis.

treat sewage has also increased, with the construction of 3 new sewage treatment plants
in Minas, Treinta y Tres and Durazno, which can now serve up to 60,000 people. These
investments were partly financed by a World Bank loan ­ the OSE Modernization and
Systems Rehabilitation Project (APL-1).

OSE's provision of water supply and sanitation services has improved, both in terms of
consumer responsiveness, and quality of service. The role played by performance
benchmarking has been well documented and helped promote transparency; the
harmonization of systems and processes; efficiency improvements; improved
collaboration between traditional commercial and operational silos; and more results-
based decision-making. In particular, the simple act of measuring data (e.g. waiting
times) has led to some immediate improvements in OSE's attention to clients, and helped
remove glitches in existing operational processes (e.g., reducing the double counting of
customer complaints). Overall, OSE's quality of service index has been generally
improving, achieving its overall targets in 2 out of 3 cities. OSE's quality of service
indicators also indicate that the level of commercial and operational claims is
consistently rated excellent across all 5 Regions; the speed at which OSE is able to re-
establish water supply service is rated excellent in 4 out of 5 Regions; and the quality of
the water is rated good to excellent in all Regions. The 3 new sewage treatment plants not
only help increase sewage treatment coverage, but their effluent quality is now being
monitored on a monthly basis by new environmental monitoring systems established in
all three plants, to ensure appropriate environmental standards (set by decree 253/79) are
met. OSE also continues to benefit from very high levels of consumer satisfaction, with
more than 80% of Uruguayan consumers satisfied with OSE's water services.13

Transport

Access to transport infrastructure in Uruguay is high. The road and port sectors record
good levels of service quality and efficiency (although the railway sector is not as

competitive). Density and coverage indicators for the road and railway networks are the
highest in Latin America, with most of the country's population within a short distance of
transportation infrastructure. The road network provides good accessibility to practically
anywhere in the country. During the SAL period and as a result of improvements
mentioned below in the efficiency section, the roads sector's relative high levels of
coverage and quality have been kept unchanged, despite the pronounced reduction of
expenditures brought about by the 2001-2002 economic crisis. As shown in table 6,
Uruguay consistently rates highest in the region in terms of rail and road network
coverage and density.

Average delays in Uruguayan customs are low for Latin-American standards as shown in
figure 30, but are high in comparison to European and Asiatic comparable countries
(Figure 21). Only 4 percent of firms in the investment climate survey considered
transportation to be one of the top 3 obstacles to their business.

Improved Efficiency

Overall, this outcome has been largely achieved and efficiency indicators have generally
improved, mainly through progress in management and performance, increased
participation of the private sector, more competition, and strengthened regulation to
varying degrees in the different sectors.

The significant progress that has been made in the policy area of regulation has helped to
improve operators' efficiency and to strengthen sectors' institutions. The process of
strengthening and consolidating URSEA, the regulatory agency for energy and water and
URSEC, the regulatory agency for communications, is attested by the following results:

· Both agencies are now well established entities that have continuously improved their
    technical and managerial capacities.
· The presence, roles and responsibilities of both URSEA and URSEC are now
    acknowledged and recognized, and their reputation and standing with the companies
    they regulate and with the public at large are sound.
· Both agencies show a relatively high and increasing degree of compliance with
    existing legislation in the markets they regulate, regularly publish performance
    indicators, develop strategies to foster growth and competition, and help focus public
    scrutiny on both private and public utilities.
· Both URSEA and URSEC enjoy a large degree of autonomy. Both agencies have
    now their own autonomous budgets; have defined and approved their own
    organizational structures; most of the staff, who were previously working as short-
    term consultants, have been fully incorporated as public employees through a
    competitive process; and have put in place and are implementing ambitious training
    programs.

Increased private sector participation has also helped to improve efficiency and
competition, particularly in telecommunications were 18 new private companies began to
provide international long distance services during the SAL implementation period and
three new mobile companies began competing with ANCEL in the mobile phone market.
Uruguay's economic growth and competitiveness have also been boosted by extensive
private participation in the ports sector. As shown in table 7, 76 percent of the US$48.4
million invested in ports between 2003 and 2005 and 78 percent of the US$500 million
expected to be invested in 2006-2009 represents private capital. Particularly important are
those initiatives linked to the transport of forest related products, such as the ports of
Nueva Palmira and M'Bopicuá which are strong contributors to the export of forest
products.

As discussed earlier and in annex 7, private sector participation has also played a
significant role boosting efficiency and competition in airports and energy. In the energy
sector, new private operators have joined the distribution market of LPG in the last four
years, following URSEA's approval and implementation of regulation related to this fuel.
Additionally, eight new private power generators have joined the market as co-generators,
with a total generation capacity of 157.7 MW based in renewable sources (solid waste,
wind power and biomass).

The following paragraphs review the main achievements in efficiency and competition in
each of the sectors.

Energy

Before 2002, UTE had been gradually and consistently reducing its energy losses (both
technical and commercial) through improved commercial management and a
comprehensive network renovation and expansion plan. In year 2000 total losses were as
low as 13.5%. However, the 2002-2003 economic crisis caused this figure to rise,
reaching 19.5% in 2004. Both commercial and technical losses were affected by the
economic crisis. Customers first reduced consumption and later on stopped paying bills,
increasing bad debt and disconnection cases. Irregular connections and metering
tampering rose as users sought to avoid service interruption (in Montevideo's marginal
areas, illegal consumption reached 8.3%). Starting in July 2004, UTE launched a
campaign to identify cases of fraud and raise consumer awareness, leading to a reduction
in total losses from 19.5% in 2004 to 17.1% in 2006 (see figure 22). Total commercial
losses were reduced from 10% in January 2005 to 7.7% in 2006. Except in marginal areas,
commercial losses were further reduced to 3.3% in the same year. UTE is currently
testing a pilot project in five marginal neighborhoods of Montevideo with the
participation of public educators to work with the communities and promote an efficient
use of energy. If the pilot is successful, it will be replicated in other marginal areas where
losses are high.

As in other public utilities, UTE's labor productivity continued to improve in the last five
years as a result of a gradual reduction and a better use of its labor force. Total staffing

Telecommunications

The telecommunication sector has steadily increased its volume of activity and
contribution to the GDP which amounted to 3.81% in 2006 (the highest in 11 years).
Whilst the sector still maintains a monopoly in the provision of fixed lines telephony for
urban and national calls by ANTEL, competition has been introduced in the mobile
telephony, international fixed telephony, internet and data transmission and cable TV
markets. As well as a reduction in prices discussed in the next section, increased
competition has contributed towards an increase in efficiency, quality and coverage of the
services and overall sector performance.

Improvement in the overall performance of the sector can be measured by the evolution
of the Digital Opportunity Index (DOI)14 which is based upon different groups of
indicators and categories of targets/objectives. It is built upon three categories:



14The index was designed by the International Union of Telecommunications in June 2005.


                                               68

Opportunity (coverage and tariffs), Infrastructure and Utilization. Uruguay's DOI for
2006 was 0.52, one of the highest in the region. The index has positively evolved in the
period 2003-2006, mainly due to increases in the categories of Infrastructure and
Utilization. The first is driven by the increase in the volume of services of mobile
telephony whilst the growth of internet access would account for the rise in the
Utilization category, both correlated to increased competition.

Water and Sanitation

Improved regulation, performance benchmarking, along with the SAL's efforts at the
macro-economic level to support Uruguay's recovery, have contributed to OSE's
improved financial health and efficiency gains. The deep recession of 2001-2003
weakened OSE's financial situation. The steep depreciation of the Uruguayan Peso
increased the burden of OSE's debt and payment obligations. Its tariffs decreased in real
terms losing its margin to operating costs. The end result was deterioration in OSE's
financial and operational indicators. The stabilization of the economy after 2004
improved OSE's financial results: debt structure improved as well as operating cost to
revenue ratios.

OSE made some steady efficiency gains since 2002 and has fully recovered from the
financial crisis. Key commercial and operational efficiency indicators have improved (see
Table 8). Between 2002 and 2006, OSE successfully increased labor productivity from
5.4 employees/1000 connections to 4.3, decreased operating costs from US$ 0.98/m3 to
US$ 0.81/m3; and increased operating margins from 37% to 43%. Collection rates also
recovered rapidly, from a low of 87% in 2003 to 93% in 2006 (Figure 28). Revenues
increased 6% in real terms, given that a real loss of 4% in tariffs15 was offset by a 12%
increase of volume of water billed. Additionally operating costs decreased 3% in real
terms which helped to improve financial results (see Table 9).

Other important operational and commercial efficiency gains are directly attributable to
OSE's performance indicator benchmarking initiative. This initiative, supported by the
SAL, compares the utility's performance across regions based on 8 service quality
indicators and then disseminated the results both internally and publicly (including
directly to the regulator). This benchmarking exercise promoted efficiency gains, by
shifting a deeply entrenched public company culture and promoting transparency; the
harmonization of systems and processes (e.g. removed double counting of consumer
complaints); better consumer service (e.g. reduced waiting times); improved
collaboration between traditional commercial and operational silos (e.g. reduced average

re-connection time to the network); and more results-based decision-making. OSE has
also made efforts to prioritize investments more strategically and efficiently (e.g., OSE
commissioned a comparative feasibility analysis to prioritize sanitation works across the
75 Uruguayan cities).

OSE's operational efficiency remains hindered by high rates unaccounted for water
(UFW) ­ which increased from 52% to around 57% from 2002 to 2007. OSE's efforts to
award a performance based contract for reducing UFW in Montevideo, supported by the
SAL, were stalled following the 2004 Constitutional Amendment. Nevertheless, OSE's
new well functioning UFW unit has successfully helped reshape OSE's strategic
visioning of the issue, enabling OSE to tackle UFW more holistically, across the
traditional engineering/commercial institutional divide and to provide a hot-bed for
testing and rolling-out innovative approaches ­ including successful new financial
incentive systems (the meter replacement rate has now almost quadrupled since 2002). It
has been widely recognized that addressing UFW is a complex long-term issue, which
will be the focus of the second phase of the World Bank OSE Modernization and Systems
Rehabilitation APL, approved by the Board in June 2007.

The OSE APL2 Project envisages a total investment of US$ 68 million in the
rehabilitation and improvement of water treatment facilities, reduction of non-revenue
water and increased sewerage service coverage. With this significant investment and the
commitment to further reforms under the agreement with the Bank, OSE is undergoing
one of the countries' most drastic transformations in public utilities, as was recently
declared in the press by the Director of the Budgeting and Planning Office.16

Transport

Greater competition and outsourcing practices in road maintenance and management of
the road infrastructure has produced significant improvements in performance. In fact,
competition has introduced the concept of results-based performance for all public sector
and private activities. For example, MTOP's transfers to the Departments to maintain
their road networks are based on their performance and include incentives towards
achieving the targets. Although the roads sector was not explicitly included as part of
loan conditionality, it is also worth mentioning that MTOP has fully complied with the
Roads maintenance and rehabilitation plan and the sector allocation budget from 2002 to
2005. The number of DNV employees was reduced from 3,700 in 1995 to 1,800 in 2004,
which is an illustration of the shift in responsibilities of DNV, from carrying out
100 percent of road maintenance to one that formulates policy and regulates and controls
the private and public sector enterprises that provide these services today. Currently,
42 percent of the road network managed by the DNV is maintained through contracts
with the private sector under different modalities: performance-based contracts, micro
enterprises, Contracts for Rehabilitation and Maintenance (CREMA); and road
concessions. The concession of 1,200 km of the national roads to a special purpose

institution (Corporación Vial del Uruguay) has stood for 25 years and still continues,
allowing private sector financing to be raised for 1,200 km road network.

With regards to the railroad subsector, in spite of the absence of a regulatory framework,
AFE improved its efficiency between 2000 and 2005, and operating subsidies have
significantly decreased. As shown in Figure 29, operating subsidies to AFE (and DNV)
decreased by 66 percent from US$19.6 million in 2000 to US$6.6 million in 2005.
During the same period, the number of employees decreased from 1,677 to 1,128 through
a voluntary retirement scheme. This allowed AFE to improve its operating performance
and play a bigger role in 2005 than it did in 2002, when the labor reform took place and
railways operation was separated from infrastructure. Between 2002 and 2005, operating
expenses as a ratio of operating revenues decreased from 4.2 to 2.0. At the same time,
freight transportation increased by 60 percent from 822,700 tons to 1,318,000.

Reforms initiated in the late 1990s to improve the operational efficiency in ports were
continued during the SAL implementation period. Consequently, the sector has achieved
higher levels of operational efficiency. Cargo traffic and productivity has increased. Ship
turn-around and docking times have decreased, tariffs have been reduced, and investment
in port infrastructure and service provision has increased. Montevideo is again a preferred
port of call for mainline services.
