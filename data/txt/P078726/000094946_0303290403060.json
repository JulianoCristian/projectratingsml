support reforms to restore\n            economic growth, improve competitiveness of the Uruguayan\n            economy, and improve the population's welfare through\n            greater efficiency in the provision of public services and\n            infrastructure, which should include as well increased\n            impacts from public expenditures on education and health. As\n            a follow up on two previous SAL loans approved in August\n            2002 focused on fiscal, financial, and social protection\n            reforms, this adjustment operation is part of a concerted\n            effort by multilateral institutions, to help Uruguay\n            withstand the impact of strong external shocks, and set the\n            stage for recovery of sustained economic growth. Within the\n            energy, telecommunications, postal services, water and\n            sanitation, and transport sectors, the project will support\n            measures to reduce prices, increase quality and coverage,\n            and improve the efficiency of investment, production, and\n            distribution of services, and infrastructure, by: a)\n            liberalizing the wholesale power market, and restructuring\n            the petroleum, water and sanitation, and transport sectors;\n            b) strengthening regulatory frameworks, as well as\n            strengthening sector planning, management, and service\n            delivery; and, c) increasing transparency, and\n            accountability, and reducing tax distortions to improve\n            public expenditures. The project will also support\n            improvements in the education, and health sectors, by\n            restructuring national health funding instruments; reducing\n            cross subsidies in public hospitals; fostering priority\n            education programs; and, improving the education sector\n            management. Given the high macro, and debt sustainability\n            risks, close monitoring of macroeconomic aspects will be\n            performed; the reform consensus risk is seemingly under\n            considerable political commitment, and, the weak\n            institutional capacity risk, will be mitigated by the\n            support of the ongoing technical assistance loan to\n            strengthen technical, and human resources constraints."}, "docdt": "2003-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
