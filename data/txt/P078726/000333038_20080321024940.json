unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: The design of the Structural\n            Adjustment Loan (SAL) raises a fundamental question about\n            whether far-reaching structural reforms can best be achieved\n            at a time of deep crisis when conditionality can easily be\n            perceived as an attempt to use external financing as a way\n            to force through policy reforms without popular support.\n            This may be particularly true in consensus driven countries\n            like Uruguay. Sector reforms should be based on a realistic\n            assessment of the political and economic context and the\n            willingness of the people and the government to accept the\n            reform. Discussions with officials of the current and\n            previous administrations during program implementation\n            showed that a program involving policy changes with many\n            different objectives (increased competitiveness, improved\n            performance, reduced costs, increased competition, greater\n            private participation in many sectors, reduced vulnerability\n            to external changes) involves regulatory rules and an\n            institutional framework that can only work with popular\n            support. Tariff increases and other reforms are possible\n            without social upheaval if properly identified and smoothly\n            conducted. The Bank should understand and acknowledge\n            cultural realities and, if needed, accept slowing down some\n            reforms and relaxing some measures and controls."}, "docdt": "2007-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
