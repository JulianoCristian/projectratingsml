1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
This operation was designed in the context of the global economic crisis as well as changed
economic and political realities in Moldova. It replaced and scaled up the third annual PRSC
identified in the FY09-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy. It supported a reform-minded
Government as it started to implement measures to address a deep fiscal crisis brought on by the
global recession and pre-election spending. Under high political uncertainty, it was designed as a
one-year operation, with the potential to serve as a bridge to a longer-term program of annual
support.

Moldova was hit hard by the economic crisis. The global crisis undermined all of the main
sources of growth in previous years: remittances, private consumption, exports and private
investment, resulting in weaker domestic and external demand, fiscal imbalances and limited
financial intermediation. GDP growth dropped dramatically from 7.8 percent in 2008 to -6
percent in 2009, with FDI decreasing by 82 percent during the same period. Economic sectors
such as mining, agriculture and construction recorded large declines in output, ranging from 12 to
60 percent in 2009.

Fiscal imbalances grew. The crisis contributed to a fall in tax revenues by 8 percent. Meanwhile,
pre-election spending hikes in early 2009 increased spending by 5 percent (public wages by 22
percent), opening an unsustainable fiscal deficit that reached 6.3 percent of GDP in 2009.

The global crisis exposed the unsustainable nature of remittance-financed and import-
intensive economic growth. Prior to the crisis, economic growth in Moldova had averaged 6
percent between 2004 and 2008, on the back of strong domestic and external demand. The
remittance-financed consumption and investment widened the balance of trade. Remittances
drastically declined – by 37.4 percent (year on year) in 2009, to 20.8 percent of GDP (from about
30 percent of GDP in 2008), leading to a collapse in domestic demand. The slowdown in
investment, remittances and exports put pressure on the exchange rate and the National Bank of
Moldova lost a third of its international reserves in attempts to defend the currency. The banking
sector was strained. The quality of the banks’ loan portfolio deteriorated rapidly in 2009, with
non-performing loans (NPLs) reaching 16.3 percent of total loans (up from 4.6 percent in 2008).
The real cost of borrowing increased, making access to loans expensive for firms, thereby
compressing demand and prolonging the “credit crunch”.

The downturn in Moldova’s economy was expected to have a strong impact on poverty,
especially for rural households. Previously strong growth had reduced poverty in Moldova from
30.2 percent in 2006 to 26.4 percent in 2008. It was expected that the decline in consumption
induced by the downturn could increase the incidence of poverty significantly in 2009. The
introduction of new targeted social assistance and the gradual reform of the old schemes were
delayed, preventing improved targeting to those most in need.

Even with political uncertainty, the new Government began implementing comprehensive
reforms that entailed a shift in economic management and international development
relations. After two rounds of heavily contested elections, the Communist Party lost its majority
in Parliament and the four centrist parties in opposition to the Communists formed a majority
coalition, the Alliance for European Integration (AEI). However, the AEI had insufficient
parliamentary votes to elect a President (requiring a 60 percent majority under the Constitution).
Still, the new Government launched in October 2009 the ‘Economic Stabilization and Recovery


                                                1
Plan’ (ESRP). It built on the set of Policy Notes that the Bank, with other development partners,
had prepared on key economic and social challenges to address the impact of the crisis and build
the platform for post-crisis growth and improved competitiveness. The ESRP had three pillars: (i)
Stabilization and streamlining of public finance; (ii) Economic recovery; and (iii) Securing an
efficient and fair social protection. A 3-year Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility
program with the IMF was approved in January 2010. The World Bank team considered that this
program provided a credible medium-term macroeconomic framework. It focused primarily upon
reversing the fiscal deterioration that occurred in 2008-9 and restoring the fiscal deficit to a
sustainable level by 2012. Under the ESRP, Government began implementing a comprehensive
and detailed action plan of legal and administrative reforms to “de-regulate, liberalize and de-
monopolize” the economy. Government also began implementing an action plan for integration
with Europe, entitled “European Integration: Freedom, Democracy, Welfare 2009-2013”. The
ERSP provided the basis for the Consultative Group meeting that was jointly organized by the
EU and the World Bank in March 2010. Development partners pledged 2.6 billion to support
reforms during 2010-13.

The rationale for Bank assistance under a single tranche Economic Recovery DPO was to
support the Government’s ESRP. The Moldova Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)
programmatic series, which consisted of three operations of $10 million each, was discontinued
after PRSC2. In the run-up to two elections in April and July 2009, several actions proposed
under the planned PRSC3 had been delayed or partially implemented. The third operation was
cancelled. The new policy orientation after the elections and the anticipated impact of the global
economic crisis demanded that the Bank realign its support (to reflect Moldova’s new economic
and political priorities) and provide more significant financing for the ESRP than envisaged in the
initial PRSC series. A USD 25 million Economic Recovery DPO (including USD 11.2 million
from the IDA Crisis Response Window) was to provide much-needed budget support and focus
the reform agenda on laying the foundations for post-crisis recovery. It focused strongly on the
second and third pillars of the Government’s ESRP [(ii) Economic recovery and (iii) Ensuring an
efficient and fair social protection].

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objectives of the DPL were to support the Government’s efforts to adequately fund priority
expenditures for economic recovery and social protection during fiscal correction, while laying
the foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery through exports and private investment.

The operation was designed to realign World Bank policy support lending to reflect Moldova’s
changed economic and political realities. It replaced and scaled up the third annual PRSC
identified in the FY09-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy. The reform program supported by the
operation: (i) aligned behind the policy shift signaled by a new Government, and (ii) responded to
the new challenge of addressing the global crisis by complementing an IMF-supported program
for fiscal correction with measures to improve the composition of the budget and structural
measures to stimulate economic recovery. The increase in funding from $10 million to $25
million reflected the need for additional budgetary funding to smooth over fiscal correction of a
deficit of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2009.

The key Program Development Objectives were the following:
   i. Adequately fund priority expenditures for economic recovery and social protection
           during fiscal correction. The measures under the first pillar support efforts to better
           maintain roads, redirect the declining support for agriculture towards investment and
           better target social assistance.


                                                2
   ii. Lay foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery through exports and private
          investments. The measures under the second pillar support efforts to increase the
          profitability of traditional exports, make the energy sector more commercially viable
          while compensating poor people, remove barriers to private sector investment and
          FDI in telecoms and remove bureaucratic red tape.

The key outcome indicators were:
   (i) Better maintained roads
             a. Government Decision on 2010 Road Fund Budget shows planned increase in
                  road maintenance in line with recommendations agreed by road sector working
                  group.
   (ii) Declining support for agriculture redirected towards investment
             a. Investment subsidies as a share of total subsidies increased to 40% of total in
                  2010.
             b. Share of subsidies to individual farmers increases in 2010.
   (iii) Better targeted social assistance
             a. At least two thirds of eligible beneficiaries receive Targeted Social Assistance
                  (TSA) in 2010.
             b. Income threshold for TSA raised to 530 Lei in 2010.
             c. 2010 Budget allocations for nominal compensation (385.6m Lei), TSA (208.1m
                  Lei) and child allowance (0 Lei).
   (iv) Profitability of traditional exports increased
             a. Real domestic farm-gate prices for grapes increase in 2010.
             b. Volume of exports of “technical” grapes, bulk wine, bottled wine, distilled wine
                  products increases in 2010.
   (v) More commercially viable energy sector whilst compensating poor people
             a. Energy Efficiency Law submitted by April 2010.
             b. Heating tariff charged by Termocom is at cost recovery level as per ANRE
                  methodology by end of heating season 2009-2010.
             c. No further accumulation of arrears to Moldovagaz by CHPs and Termocom by
                  end 2010 heating season.
             d. Pensioners, low-paid workers and the poorest families receive compensation that
                  offsets their increased heating bills.
   (vi) Barriers to private sector investment and FDI in telecoms removed
             a. Increase the international connectivity of Moldova
             b. Number of permits issued to electronic communications service providers
                  (ECSPs) to construct and operate cross-border telecommunications cable
                  facilities.
   (vii)     Bureaucratic red tape removed
             a. Reduce time and cost to register a business to 10 days and 7.0% of income per
                  capita in 2010 (compared to 15 days and 8.9% of income per capita in 2011).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The operation supported short-term corrective policies in the new Government’s Economic
Stabilization and Recovery Program in two ways:




                                               3
   •   First, the operation aimed to protect priority expenditures for economic recovery
       and social protection during fiscal correction. It supported enhanced funding for
       targeted social assistance and road maintenance and a redirection of declining agricultural
       subsidies towards more efficient investment grants. Targeted social assistance was
       required to cushion the impact of the severe crisis-induced recession on poor people.
       Road maintenance and the redirection of agricultural subsidies were to enhance economic
       activity.
   •   Second, the operation aimed at laying the foundations for a sustained post-crisis
       recovery through exports and private investment. The policy objective in this area is
       to remove long-standing structural policy constraints and cumbersome regulations which
       retard improvements in Moldova’s productivity and competitiveness, restrain exports,
       limit foreign direct investment, and which have led to jobless growth in recent years. The
       removal of these constraints was expected to dampen the recession and place Moldova on
       firmer foundations for growth and job creation once export demand recovered. Since the
       impact of the crisis on poor people in Moldova was anticipated to be more acute in rural
       areas, emphasis was placed on measures which could stimulate traditional wine exports.
       Complementing these measures, the program sought to initiate reforms which first make
       the energy sector financially viable and which then pave the way for an injection of
       private investment in energy and telecommunications. The energy sector reforms
       supported under the program aimed at stemming the drain of subsidized heating on
       Moldova’s fiscal space, whilst protecting poor people from rising heating costs and
       providing a framework for cost-cutting energy efficiency measures in the future. The
       telecommunications sector reform focused on removing barriers to private sector
       investment and FDI by de-monopolizing cross-border telecommunications cable access.
       Last, reforming firm-registration regulations was an important step towards reducing
       bureaucratic red tape and improving the investment climate.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
Although continued political uncertainty had an impact on the pace of reforms, the
government showed increased ownership and commitment to implementing important reforms
in the economic and social sectors. After two failed attempts to elect a President, another early
parliamentary election took place in November 2010. The governing coalition, the Alliance for
European Integration, gained an increased majority but was still short of the number of seats to
elect a President. In spite of this political uncertainty, the population has high hopes for change
and the government has been implementing its Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program
2009-2011, which also provided the basis for the IMF’s 3-year Extended Credit Facility and
Extended Fund Facility Program.

The operation was underpinned by extensive economic and sector work, conducted over the
previous five years. The Economic and Sector Work was conducted over the previous five years



                                                  6
and summarized in the Policy Notes prepared for the new Government (in partnership with other
donors). The Policy Notes were instrumental to the formulation of the Government’s ESRP
(which in turn the DPO aimed to support). This ensured Government ownership and commitment
to the program. It also enabled rapid preparation of the operation.

The operation’s design was selective and realistic. It reflected well lessons learned from the
shortcomings of the previous PRSC series (by reducing the number of policy areas supported),
and took into account the constraints imposed by the capacity of the implementing agencies as
well as the political uncertainty at the time. It also adequately focused on mitigating social risks
that could affect poverty reduction objectives or lead to policy reversal. Selectivity was enabled
by strong complementarities with the IMF and other partners. Moldova now benefits from
considerable external support, especially from Europe. The Government’s pro-European
orientation accelerated progress in key areas of programmatic alignment between the Bank and
the EU (including social protection and energy).

Risks to development outcomes were well-identified at appraisal and effective mitigation
measures were put in place. Social risks were mitigated through the social assistance system.
Technical assistance complemented reform efforts in the energy and telecommunications sector.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
The main reform areas under the DPO were centered on two thematic pillars with well-
specified policy actions, measures, baseline values, target indicators and medium-term policies
and outcomes. Targets to be reached were properly quantified and were adequate measures of
progress. They were well-connected with policy actions, enabling attribution to the extent
possible. They were also realistic, with the exception of two energy-related medium-term
objectives to which short-term target dates were appended. Another shortcoming in the results
framework was the absence of a target for one indicator (share of social assistance benefits going
to the poorest 20% of population) but this omission was balanced by the inclusion of another
well-defined and relevant target (share of eligible beneficiaries receiving the TSA).

The State Chancellery played the primary role in coordinating monitoring and program
implementation. Data collection was appropriate and largely timely.

Beyond the operation’s implementation, it is worth noting the sustainability of M&E
arrangements with respect to targeted social assistance. As a result of the supported conversion
of nominal compensation into targeted social assistance, M&E arrangements have become
sounder, with higher quality, frequency and reliability of data used to measure coverage and
targeting of social assistance for the poorest. Indicators of targeting and coverage are regularly
monitored using administrative and household budget surveys. They are also incorporated in the
social assistance and insurance database maintained by the Bank’s Social Protection team.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:
The Government shows commitment to post-crisis structural reforms and the Bank expects to
continue its support in Moldova. Government has laid out a reform program in "European
Integration: Freedom, Democracy, Welfare, 2011-2014" and prepared an action plan for 2011-
2014. Under the Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY13, Bank support is to focus on three
pillars: (i) Improving economic competitiveness to support sustainable economic growth; (ii)
Minimizing social and environmental risks, building human capital, and promoting social
inclusion; and (iii) Improving Public sector governance. A Competitiveness DPO series is
envisioned, based on the in-depth diagnostic provided in the CEM and supporting the
Government’s competitiveness and private sector job creation agenda. The focus is expected to be


                                                 7
on the business climate, as well as sector policies in key areas (for e.g., agriculture, ICT, energy,
education) that would lift the current constraints to growth.

However, a follow-up operation will have to incorporate political realities and the risks to the
sustainability of reform posed by political uncertainty. Continued engagement and dialogue on
the main policy areas supported under the Economic Recovery DPO can contribute to sustaining
benefits, including through continued monitoring of the program’s targets and medium-term
outcomes.

As outlined in the updated CPS, the Bank will continue to be selective, to leverage strategic
partnerships with others, and to play an important advisory role in the design and
implementation of structural reforms. The on-going and planned Analytic and Advisory
Activities (AAA) and Technical Assistance (TA) activities for FY12-FY13 include:

    •   Follow-up work on Competitiveness and structural reform as well as continued
        programmatic fiscal work (including studies using the BOOST, an innovative tool for
        analyzing public expenditures);

    •   AAA and Technical assistance in critical sectors: finance (Financial sector monitoring,
        Credit Bureau, Risk Management , Financial Sector Assessment Program); private sector
        development (Investment Climate Reform), agriculture (Food security, Agricultural
        Competitiveness); energy efficiency; and education Rationalization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The Economic Recovery DPO supported Moldova through the financial and economic crisis,
and provided the opportunity to open a dialogue with the newly elected Government on a
longer-term reform agenda. The objectives of the DPL program were closely aligned with the
Government’s program. They were highly relevant when the operation was appraised and they
remain relevant to date. The reform program supported by the DPO was well-anchored into the
medium-term reform agenda of the Government and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy.

The design of the operation and the implementation arrangements were also highly relevant,
with a sound result framework (albeit with minor shortcomings). Logical links between policy
actions, indicators and medium-term policies and outcomes supported implementation monitoring
arrangements. Consistent with Moldova’s limited administrative capacity and lessons learned in
the previous PRSC series, the operation policy areas were selective.

The reforms supported by this operation were prioritized: they addressed key structural
rigidities and were implementable despite continued political uncertainty. The objectives of
critical and comprehensive structural reforms on business regulation, de-monopolization,
regulatory environment and improved competitiveness remain crucial to foster growth in
Moldova.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall, the Program Development Objectives were achieved with only minor shortcomings.
Development outcomes are summarized in Table 3.1.

Macroeconomic framework
The Government took actions to reduce the deficit, and with additional fiscal measures under
an IMF program and a faster than expected recovery, the deficit for 2010 is expected to be



                                                10
below 3 percent of GDP. After taking office in September 2010, the Alliance for European
Integration took immediate steps to address the impacts of the economic crisis and pre-election
spending hikes by the previous Government. Public sector pay increases were delayed, excise
taxes increased, 4,000 Government staff positions were eliminated, agricultural subsidies were
reduced and spending on goods and services was cut.

Macroeconomic trends started to improve by the end of 2009 and a strong recovery was
registered in 2010. Real GDP increased by 6.9 percent in 2010. Goods and services exports
increased by 12.8 percent and imports by 13.7 percent. However, this growth has not been
associated with corresponding increases in employment. It is expected that economic recovery
will continue, but this is essentially dependent upon political stability in Moldova, as well as
economic growth throughout the rest of Europe. With a big share of the workforce already
abroad, fast economic growth is unlikely to come only from an increase in remittances.


Pillar I: Adequately fund priority expenditures for economic recovery and social protection
during fiscal correction
    a) Better maintained roads

The 2010 budget allocation for road maintenance increased as required by the Law on the
Road Fund. The law required that not less than 50% of excise tax were directed to the Road Fund
in 2010 and that this share would increase to 65% in 2011 and 80% in 2012. Accordingly the
2010 allocation for road maintenance increased to MDL 582.9 million (from MDL 242 million in
2009) and will increase to 788 million Lei in 2011.

These increases are necessary to stem the deterioration of Moldova’s roads and can be
expected to help lower transport prices over time. Indeed, evidence from the Doing Business
Survey (2010) shows that nearly three-quarters of the total cost of exporting containerized freight
and general cargo by maritime transport is due to high land transport costs to the seaports. This is
compared to 39 percent in neighboring Romania, despite the relatively short transport distances
(within Moldova and to the nearest seaports in Ukraine and Romania). Serious efforts to improve
transport infrastructure started several years ago but are only now showing the first effects. It will
take many years of sustained investment and maintenance before clear results are visible on a
broad scale. There is currently no data available to track the evolution of transport prices.

Beside roads, more progress is required to increase the efficiency of railway transport and
customs clearance. Moldovan exporters typically spend 3 days clearing the border (compared to
2 days in Ukraine and 1 day in Romania), according to the Doing Business Survey for 2010.

    b) Declining support for agriculture redirected towards investment

The VAT subsidy on fertilizers and pesticides was abolished (in conformity with the related
DPO policy action) but another recurrent subsidy was introduced in July 2010 in a different
form and at a lower rate. The subsidy is no longer a VAT rebate (VAT of 20% was charged on
inputs). Instead a direct subsidy of 15% of the cost of fertilizers and pesticides was created. For
2011, the Ministry of Agriculture did not include the fertilizer subsidy in the version of the draft
regulation on the use of the subsidy fund that was discussed at the beginning of the year during
consultations with stakeholders and civil society. But on April 21, 2011, a Government decision
listed the fertilizer subsidy among the measures to be applied in 2011. The current version of the
draft regulation for the use of the subsidy fund (as of May 20, 2011) sets the 2011 fertilizer
subsidy rate at 10%.


                                                 11
Nevertheless, recurrent subsidies were reduced and there has been a redirection of agricultural
subsidies towards investment. Recurrent subsidies fell by 59% in 2010, to MDL 214 million
(including amounts not paid in 2010 and to be paid in 2011). Consequently, the share of
investment subsidies in total agricultural subsidies increased to 53% in 2010 (up from 36% in
2009 and exceeding the DPO’s 40% target). The reintroduction of input subsidies highlights a
lack of political consensus on reforms in this area. But the planned decrease in the subsidy rate
(for 2011) is another step towards the reduction of inefficient and inequitable subsidies.

The redirection of subsidies towards investment was not made at the cost of lower equity in the
distribution of budget resources. While corporate farms continued to receive the largest share of
agricultural subsidies, the share going to individual farmers increased to 24% in 2010, from 20%
in 2009. Small farmers benefited from the assistance of extension services in applying for
subsidies.

Low crop productivity, inadequate rural storage capacity, credit constraints and an inadequate
food safety system continue to limit agricultural growth. Modern post-harvest infrastructure that
provides for increased value-added in agriculture is largely missing. There is a critical need for
increasing storage capacity, particularly cold and controlled atmosphere storage, collection
points, field cooling facilities, packing houses for post-harvest treatment, grading, sorting and
handling of horticultural produce. Food quality and safety problems limit access to higher value
markets in the European Union and have increased the volatility of exports to the Russian market
on which Moldova remains heavily dependent.

    c) Better targeted social assistance

Under the reforms supported by this operation, there has been significant progress in gradually
converting the previous nominal compensation schemes (based on individual categories rather
than incomes) into the new targeted social assistance scheme (TSA). The two main nominative
schemes that were addressed through the program included the nominative compensation for
utilities, and child allowances. The Nominative Compensation for utilities was frozen for current
beneficiaries and no new beneficiary was allowed, resulting in a small decline in the number of
beneficiaries and expenditure on this type of social assistance. The budget execution for 2010
indicates MDL 354.4 million for nominative compensation, which is slightly lower than the level
in 2009 (MDL 369.8m) A more rapid pace of transition between the two generations of social
assistance would require additional measures. The child allowance with a threshold of MDL 54
per month per person was abolished in January 2010, which limited budgetary expenditure on this
item to MDL 4.1 million in 2010 (from MDL 46.8 million in 2009). Finally, the expansion of the
new TSA accelerated in 2010-2011, with expenditure increasing to MDL 282 million in 2010
(greater than the MDL 208.1 million initial allocation for 2010 and up from MDL 114.7 million
in 2009).

About two-thirds of eligible beneficiaries received the TSA in 2010 (not including the assistance
for the cold season). Household Budget Survey data indicates that 50,000 households were
eligible and that 54% of these received TSA benefits in the first three quarters of 2010.
Administrative data shows a monthly average of 32,000 recipients in 2010 (64% of the eligible
households). There was a large amount of turnover in the recipients (as most recipients have to
resubmit an application every six months) and large month-to-month variation in the number of
recipients (with a peak during the summer).

The new TSA program has been successful in improving targeting accuracy and the coverage
of the poor. This was achieved by revising the proxy system to improve targeting, ignoring


                                               12
cadastre income for certain households and reintroducing some income ‘disregard’ in the
calculation of household monthly income. The revision of the proxy system corrected the initial
regulation in order to account for special circumstances such as disability, remittances receipts or
informal sector work. The income disregard consisted in ignoring 60 lei of income for every
working household member and resulted in an increase in the share of TSA beneficiaries who
also receive a salary. The monthly income threshold for TSA was raised to 530 Lei in 2010 and
742 in the cold season (to account for higher expenditure on utilities). It is expected to be raised
again to 575 Lei in July 2011 and 805 lei in the cold period. Targeting accuracy of the TSA is by
construction superior to that of nominative compensations: 86% of TSA recipients were in the
bottom consumption quintile, versus only 27% for the nominative compensations system.
Nominative compensations remain the program with the second largest coverage ratio of the
poorest quintile (after old-age pensions): they are received by 24% of those in the lowest quintile.
Nevertheless, the coverage of the new TSA is expanding rapidly: already 14% of those in the
lowest quintile received it in 2010.

Pillar II: Lay foundations for a sustained post-crisis recovery through exports and private
investment
    a) Profitability of traditional exports increased
The liberalization of wine exports led to the expected increases in prices and export volumes.
Previous export bans, export restrictions and regulations had resulted in declines in farm-gate
prices and export volumes. The DPO supported the abolition of restrictions on the exports of bulk
wine, grapes for wine and distilled wine, as well as the elimination of certain certification
requirements and the dissolution of the independent agency Moldova Vin. Following these
measures, the average farm-gate price of grapes increased 29.4% in 2010 to 3200 Lei per ton
(USD 258 per ton), up from 1,500-2,000 lei/kg in 2009 (and similar to 2.8-3,600 lei/ton in 2006).
The volume of wine and wine products exports also rebounded to pre-2009 levels.

    b) More commercially viable energy sector whilst compensating poor people
The Energy Efficiency Law was adopted and an energy efficiency agency is being instituted
but the energy efficiency program has not been adopted yet (as of May 2011). Nevertheless, this
program (prepared in 2008 with the assistance of the World Bank), has been reviewed and the
action plans it called for have been prepared.

Although the heating tariffs set in 2010 were not fully compliant with ANRE’s methodology for
determining cost-recovery level, the regulator has shown commitment to the principle of cost
recovery and, in January 2011, a fully compliant tariff was set. In June 2010, the responsibility
of tariff setting was transferred from the Municipality of Chi in u to the National Energy
Regulatory Agency (ANRE), thus depoliticizing tariff setting in Chi in u. The agency is now
responsible to Parliament rather than Government, which strengthens its autonomy. The heating
tariff charged by Termocom was raised from 540 MDL/Gcal in 2009 to Lei 659 MDL/Gcal in
January 2010 and 821 MDL/Gcal in May 2010. The 2010 tariffs did not apply the methodology
in full, as the calculation notably reflected a transitory derogation from requirements for
depreciation and the rate of return on new assets in ANRE’s formal methodology. In January
2011, the tariff was raised again (to 898 MDL/Gcal), in full compliance with the methodology. It
is expected to be re-adjusted during the year as required by the methodology.

Some arrears to Moldovagaz were accumulated by CHPs and Termocom during the 2010
heating season, and the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding for repayment. These
arrears reflect two institutional factors: the two-week delay in adjusting gas tariffs (as per the
required procedure, which involves a consultation with ANRE, utilities, consumers and trade
unions) and the possibility that customers have to pay their bills in installments. Such arrears are


                                                13
recurrent under the current institutional setup and have accumulated again in the 2010-2011
season. Consequently, the target of no further accumulation of arrears to Moldovagaz by the end
of April 2010 was unrealistic. As of April 2010, CHPs and Termocom had accumulated 47.1
million lei in new debts to Moldovagaz. This increased the debt stock to 1.84 billion lei, in April
2010, from 1.79 billion lei in December 2009. Current debts have been managed through a
Memorandum of Understanding signed in May 2010 between the three main companies in the
heating sector (Termocom and the two CHPs), the main creditors (Moldovagaz and Chi in u-
Gaz) and the Chi in u Municipality. The Memorandum of Understanding provided for a process
of payment to ensure that current arrears are paid for on an ongoing basis. It also affirmed the
resolve of the parties to develop a solution to the non-current portion of the debt. A new
Memorandum of Understanding is in preparation following the 2010-2011 heating season.

Progress is needed to address the long-term debts, a critical concern for the reliability and
efficiency of district heat, electricity and gas supply in Moldova. In response to the accumulation
of these debts, Moldovagaz (the gas supplier) suspended gas supplies for two weeks in 2008,
during the winter, causing severe hardship to many of Chi in u’s residents. Despite pressure from
suppliers and technical assistance provided by the World Bank and other donors, a debt
restructuring program for the energy sector has yet to be prepared and agreed upon. Although
challenging, the resolution of the historical debt problem remains a crucial step for the viability of
the energy sector. With support from the World Bank, a “Chi in u heat and electricity supply
institutional and financial restructuring study” was completed in April 2011. It lays out options
for restructuring the sector, including financial, institutional and technical aspects. This study is a
significant contribution to the debt restructuring process, as well as planning for future
investments required to raise efficiency and modernize the sector.

The valuation of gas assets financed by Government, which should be an input into the
restructuring of the sector was not completed and will require more time and resources. A
more realistic short-term target would be to establish rapidly the valuation methodology and have
it agreed by Moldovagaz and all other stakeholders.

Considering the poverty and social impact of the proposed increases in tariffs, the DPO
supported compensations to protect poor people from higher heating prices through the social
assistance system. These compensations were implemented and received by the targeted
population. Already in 2009, the share of utility consumption in total household consumption had
risen to 22.5% for households in the lowest quintile (from 16.5% in 2008), raising concerns of
affordability for the poorest. The law for Social Compensations for the Cold Period of the Year
2010 provided temporary assistance to various categories of beneficiaries, including pensioners
earning less than MDL 700, public sector employees in certain categories, and families benefiting
from social assistance. In the last two months of 2010, the list of eligible categories was revised
to exclude public sector employees and raise the threshold for pensioners to MDL 900. About
177,000 beneficiaries received this assistance in March 2010 and 506,000 in December 2010.
Beginning in 2011, compensations for the Cold Period have been incorporated into the new
Targeted Social Assistance (based on an income assessment rather than categories). They were
received by over 540,000 recipients.

    c) Barriers to private sector investment and FDI in telecoms removed
The DPO-supported de-monopolization of cross-border telecommunications cable access
unleashed competition in the internet and mobile telecommunications sector. It led to the
connection of new high-capacity fiber optic cables into Romania, increased competition in the
international bandwidth market, brought down prices and improved the quality of Internet
services at the retail level. Following the revision of the policy framework and the simplification


                                                  14
of procedures by the regulator, two new operators were issued permits and established
connections (Orange de Moldova and Starnet in March 2010) and a third one did in July 2010
(Norma). Prior to that, no private investor was allowed to establish a cross-border cable
connection. There was a rapid development of the internet market (albeit from a small base, with
coverage at 7%) and in mobile telephone subscriptions, with both growing about 20 percent
Competition in the market increased; the incumbent broadband provider’s market share dropped
from 72 percent to 56 percent.
As a result of de-monopolization, the international connectivity of Moldova soared in 2010. It
increased from 12.8 gigabits per second in 2009 (Gbps), to 91.7 at the end of the year 2010. Of
this, Moldtelecom (the state-owned incumbent) accounted for 47.2Gbps. The new optic fiber
enables further increases in bandwidth. Although regulations on price and quality remain to be
developed, international bandwidth resale prices fell by over 80% between 2009 and 2010.
Moldtelecom has also begun to offer so-called ‘bitstream’ access, which can develop competition
by allowing other suppliers to access its infrastructure; however, an appropriate price needs to be
set for such services.
In the medium-term, competition remains imperfect for certain services or market. In
particular, the fixed telephone market remains dominated by Moldtelecom: it retains over 97% of
the subscriber base owing to its large existing network but also to its ability to provide below-cost
domestic telephone call service that undercuts competition. The company charges a quarter of its
fixed line telephone subscribers (including the majority of those living in rural areas) a low tariff
of MDL 6/month that does not cover variable costs and is implicitly cross-subsidized through
higher tariffs on international calls. Greater competition in the broadband and mobile markets
(and the associated erosion of Moldtelecom’s margins) have altered this equilibrium, thereby
facilitating a renewed dialogue on tariff rebalancing. Also, in April 2011, the regulator
(ANRCETI) gave Moldtelecom a “significant share operator” status (in the broadband,
‘bitstream’ and fixed telephone markets) and imposed an accounting separation requirement on
the company. IFC is currently providing strategic advisory support with respect to potential
private participation in Moldtelecom.

On the institutional front, the regulator ANRCETI is now operational and has been exercising
its regulatory functions in a much more active way. Ongoing technical assistance provided by
the EBRD has allowed ANRCETI to develop regulatory instruments to foster competition in
various telecommunications markets. Finally, the reform of tertiary training institutions for ICT
skills still has to come, although one operator describes staff retention as a greater problem than
their education.

    d) Bureaucratic red tape removed
The law enabling the Chamber of State Registration to become a one-stop shop for business
registration was adopted on June 18, 2010 but in its current application, it will not reduce time
to register a business to the expected extent. The Chamber of State Registration now cooperates
with public authorities in charge of health, statistical and social insurance registration and the
Chamber delivers registration numbers. Nevertheless further interactions between new
entrepreneurs and these various authorities continue to be necessary. This is due to incomplete
exchange of information between institutions, which can be overcome by connecting electronic
systems. Because the one-stop shop reform was adopted after the cutoff date for the 2011 Doing
Business report, it will be reflected in the 2012 report.

A previous reform creating an expedited company registration service reduced the time to
register a business to 10 days in 2010 (from 15 days in 2009). Although it is faster, the



                                                 15
expedited service involved an increase in costs, to10.9% of income per capita (from 8.9% of per
capita income in 2009).

The Government Action Plan for removing administrative barriers is being implemented.
Certification or authorization requirements for certain goods were eliminated, the number of
activities subject to licensing was reduced and licensing procedures were simplified, some
customs clearance procedures were simplified, as well as VAT refund procedures. Employer
contribution rates for social security were reduced. Other recent reforms that are expected to
reduce the cost of doing business in Moldova relate to contract enforcement and construction
permits (which nevertheless remain costly and cumbersome).

Although markets remain highly concentrated and anti-competitive practices persist, de-
monopolization and liberalization are in progress in a few sectors. These include the trade of
wastes of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, wine products and (edible) oil products.

The 2008 Competition Act was not ratified and a new draft Competition Law is being prepared.
The new law would replace the Competition Act (2000) and notably deal with measures taken by
associations of enterprises that have the effect of limiting competition, other anti-competitive
practices, the abuse of dominant position and unfair competition. It is also expected to define
more precisely the role of the competition agency and its means of action, as well as advance the
EU harmonization agenda.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall outcome for this DPO is rated as satisfactory. This reflects the operation’s high
relevance of objectives, design and implementation, and the achievement of the operation’s
objectives (with only minor shortcomings).


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The operation was successful in mitigating the effect of fiscal adjustment (by protecting the share
of agricultural subsidies going to individual farmers, improving the targeting, coverage and
generosity of social assistance for the poorest, and compensating them for heating tariff increases)
and in making the social assistance system more efficient and equitable. Micro-simulations based
on 2010 growth projections indicate that the poverty rate should fall to 24% in 2010. However,
due to the short period of implementation and data limitations, it is difficult to attribute any
specific impact on poverty to this operation.

The explicit objective of helping to mitigate the effect of fiscal correction on the most
vulnerable was met. The revision of eligibility rules for the new Targeted Social Assistance
improved both targeting accuracy and coverage: 86 percent of the new TSA recipients were in the
poorest consumption quintile, and the program expanded, covering 14% of those in the poorest
quintile in 2010. The generosity of social assistance also improved, with the new TSA accounting
for 30 percent of the consumption of those in the lowest quintile (compared to 7% for nominative
compensations). The implementation of the Law for Social Compensations for the Cold Period of
the Year 2010 helped protect poor people from higher heating prices: about 580,000 households
received heating compensation in 2010, ahead of the introduction of the targeted heating
compensation in 2011. Last, the protection of the share of subsidies going to individual farmers
was relevant to protecting the incomes of small farmers in a context of increasing poverty in rural
areas.


                                                16
Improvements to the targeting accuracy of the new Targeted Social Assistance (through the
revisions to the proxy system for targeting) improved Moldova’s capacity to protect its
population in a more fiscally sustainable and equitable way. This will be an asset in responding
to future crises. The various measures implemented by the previous Government in 2009
prevented poverty increases but they were fiscally unsustainable (costing close to 4.1% of GDP)
and did not guarantee equity among different population categories. These measures included
increases in pensions and wages, as well as social assistance benefits. The leakage of such
policies was significant, with social protection income increasing by 28 percent among the poor
and 36 percent among the non-poor. The 2009 Household Budget Survey data indicate national
poverty rates at 26.3 percent in 2009, slightly down from 26.4 percent in 2008. However, the
significant expansion of pensions could not offset the losses associated with declining remittances
and lower incomes for small farmers. Rural poverty increased. Also, the policies implemented in
2009 were more effective in reducing poverty among retirees and those with tertiary education.
Poverty increased among those with basic and secondary education, youth and the middle-age
groups.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The Development Policy Operation contributed to a number of institutional changes:
    • An institutional framework to improve the targeting accuracy of social assistance and its
        coverage of the poor is in place;
    • Important sectors were liberalized or de-monopolized (wine sector, cross-border
        telecommunications);
    • The capacity and autonomy of the energy and telecommunications regulators were raised,
        thus supporting the development of a competitive and sustainable environment for
        growth and investment in these sectors;
    • Regulations for registering businesses were streamlined;
    • The DPO strengthened the process of consultations with relevant stakeholders on
        Government’s reform programs by involving participatory consultations on the measures
        supported under the ESRP. At each stage of policy implementation under the DPO,
        Government has held press conferences to explain the measures being taken.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

The increase in heating tariffs to cost recovery is expected to foster energy efficiency. While the
measure was mandated by concerns over the unsustainable financial situation of energy utilities
(and the risk it posed to the stability of energy supply), it complemented the Energy Efficiency
agenda supported by the Bank.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Significant

Political uncertainty continues to pose a significant risk to development outcomes. The
stalemate over the election of a President could limit Government’s commitment to reforms. The
governing coalition is fragile, with differing views amongst coalition members over the pace and
depth of reforms. These differences reflect social and political rifts throughout the wider
population including concerns about the impact of a transition to a market economy on different
segments of the population. Although the Alliance partners are bound by their desire for
European integration, the difficult approval of the 2011 Budget Law in parliament has stirred
fresh hostilities between the partners. Given these uncertainties and the results of the June 2011




                                                17
local general elections (which showed increased support for the Communist Party), it remains to
be seen whether the Alliance can maintain support for its reform agenda.

Despite the strong performance under the DPL and the authorities’ commitment to its
objectives, the risks to development outcomes continue to be significant. The Project Appraisal
Document considered the various risks involved in the operation. These risks influenced the
decision to design the operation as a single-tranche DPO. In particular, political economy and
fiscal risk could undermine the structural sustainability of Moldova’s fiscal policy in the medium
term (if continued political uncertainty continues to delay sensitive reforms on civil service,
school consolidation and pensions). The pace of reform could slow down if there is another
change of Government and there is a risk of policy reversal (especially in agriculture and
deregulation). Moldova is also vulnerable to external shocks and balance of payments risks that
could threaten macroeconomic stability and raise poverty, for instance through a rise in energy
import prices or, with respect to exports, through any renewed tightening by Russia of license
requirements for the export of wine and alcoholic beverages. Given the continued uncertainty
over the future course of developments in Moldova, these risks remain.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory
The decision to cancel the planned PRSC3 and prepare a scaled-up and realigned operation
was appropriate in light of Moldova’s changed or economic conditions, challenges and high
political uncertainty. The DPO reoriented Bank support to align with the new Government’s
priorities. Through policy dialogue during preparation and implementation, it addressed
immediate concerns while laying the groundwork for recovery.

Early engagement with the Government in designing its ERSP ensured alignment between the
operation and the government program. This also allowed rapid preparation of the operation,
capitalizing on previous analytical work and participatory processes.

The DPO targeted key reform areas that were realistic and had immediate development
impacts. Risks were well identified and mitigation arrangements were adequate. In particular, the
reversibility risk was mitigated by focusing on policy actions that strengthened institutional
capacity, and had immediate benefits for the population (notably in telecoms and social
assistance). The results framework was sound (albeit with some shortcomings) and monitoring
arrangements adequate.

The design of the operation incorporated the lessons learned from the previous PRSC series.
In particular, the operation’s design was selective and well-adjusted to the country’s
administrative capacity, with fewer policy areas. This selectivity was enabled by good
collaboration with the IMF and other development partners.

(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory
The operation was well supervised, with adequate focus on development impact and
sustainability. The team monitored sector and macroeconomic developments It monitored risks
and continued its dialogue with Government on key policy issues based on its ongoing analytical
work.



                                               18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance was rated satisfactory on both dimensions.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government ownership of the reform program supported by this DPO and commitment to
achieving development objectives were strong overall. Commitment fell short, however, in the
agricultural sector, with the introduction of new recurrent subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides
soon after their abolition under the DPO program. Implementation arrangements (including
across ministries, agencies and the Bank) were adequate, as well as monitoring and evaluation
arrangements.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: The government and implementing agency are not to be distinguished.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The government and implementing agency are not to be distinguished.

6. Lessons Learned
Strategic and extensive analytical work can help with both program design and government
commitment. The Bank used its leading analytical expertise and investment in AAA to engage
early with the Government in outlining the Economic Stabilization and Recovery Program.
Together with the EC, UN, DFID, SIDA and IMF, the Bank prepared Policy Notes on key
economic and social challenges to address the impact of the crisis. The Notes were instrumental
in the preparation of the Government Plan (ESRP) for 2009-2011. As the DPO supported the
ESRP, this early engagement through analytical work ensured alignment and commitment.

Good coordination with other development partners can help advance reform. Coordination not
only helped produce high-impact policy advice, it also facilitated selectivity and helped leverage
Bank resources through the mobilization of donors’ support to Moldova’s reform agenda.

The choice of the number of policy areas supported must balance the gains from cross-sectoral
synergies with the burden of intersectoral coordination. Selectivity is important to achieve
results when institutional capacity is limited. Accordingly, this operation focused on only a few
policy areas. At the same time, this operation enhanced sustainability by linking protection
objectives to economic recovery and efficiency objectives (for example, by linking social
protection measures to energy reforms).

Reforms with a fragile and polarized support base can be achieved in an uncertain political
environment, but their sustainability is fragile. This was illustrated by the abolition of recurrent
subsidies for pesticides and fertilizers (under the DPO) through a government resolution,
followed by the creation of another recurrent subsidy at the initiative of the Parliament, and
Government’s subsequent plans to pursue this type of subsidies.

Opportunistic sequencing and an understanding of the political economy of reform are
required to foster progress under high political uncertainty. In this operation, sequencing was
facilitated by a range of analytical work that was reflected in the Policy Notes, and ongoing work
under the CEM. This work helped identify so-called “low-hanging fruit”, i.e. low-cost reforms


                                                19
that require limited action but would generate substantial gains. Also, the DPO policy actions
focused mostly on actions for which there was strong commitment among alliance members,
notably those related to its EU integration objectives. The focus on “low-hanging fruit” in a
single-tranche operation was appropriate given (i) the uncertain political dynamics and (ii) the
lack of in-depth knowledge about the political economy of some of the deeper reforms that could
affect vested interests. As shown by the slower pace of reforms in the business climate and
agriculture, such knowledge will be needed to promote reforms of the scale and scope required to
lift Moldova to a new growth path.
