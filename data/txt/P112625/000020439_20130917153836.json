for the Economic Recovery\n            Development Policy Credit Project for Moldova were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: Strategic and extensive analytical\n            work can help with both program design and government\n            commitment. Good coordination with other development\n            partners can help advance reform. The choice of the number\n            of policy areas supported must balance the gains from\n            cross-sectoral synergies with the burden of intersectoral\n            coordination. Reforms with a fragile and polarized support\n            base can be achieved in an uncertain political environment,\n            but their sustainability is fragile. Opportunistic\n            sequencing and an understanding of the political economy of\n            reform are required to foster progress under high political uncertainty."}, "docdt": "2011-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
