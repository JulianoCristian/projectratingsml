engineering phase of the\n            project involves the first stage design and basic\n            engineering work for a hydrocracker project, including: (a)\n            licensing agreements for provision of technical know-how;\n            (b) preparation of an engineering design specification\n            package; (c) preparation of capital cost estimates; (d)\n            prequalification of engineering firms and contractors for\n            implementation of the hydrocracker project; and (e) site\n            surveys. The energy conservation phase of the project\n            involves: (a) Institution-building measures to strengthen\n            the ability of ENAR to undertake industrial energy audits\n            and conservation studies, including staff training by\n            specialist consultants and acquisition of instrumentation\n            and equipment; (b) Energy conservation measures at the\n            existing facilities of NRL including: (i) an energy audit\n            and follow-up conservation studies; (ii) acquisition of\n            energy monitoring instrumentation; and (iii) investments to\n            improve fixed heater efficiencies and reduce evaporation\n            losses in crude oil storage."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
