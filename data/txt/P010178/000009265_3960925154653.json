Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, the project\n            experience highlights the potential risk of undertaking\n            projects for the secondary upgrading of refined products in\n            developing countries, which lack a rational ex-refinery\n            pricing policy. The absence of such a policy makes it\n            difficult to determine the economic viability of secondary\n            upgrading projects. Second, the slippage in disbursing only\n            37.5 percent of the original loan amount emphasizes the need\n            to establish a more realistic project schedule and to be\n            more cognizant of potential technical problems and schedule\n            delays during the early stages of a project. Third, the Bank\n            should be more prompt in responding to Borrower requests for\n            review of licensing and engineering agreements in the early\n            months of a project and the development of a more realistic\n            project schedule. Lastly, it would have been prudent to\n            utilize the technical capabilities of the Bank's\n            Resident Mission to more frequently monitor project\n            implementation and schedule changes."}, "docdt": "1991-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
