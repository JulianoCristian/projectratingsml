Tribal Development Strategy
3.1 Introduction
Chhattisgarh has a tribal population of 32.45 percent (Census, 1991). Tribals are
concentrated over nearly 65 percent of the states area, and this area covers seven districts
entirely and another six districts partly'. The state is home to several tribes - small, large
and even those nearing extinction in numbers - and it presents among the most
challenging scenario for human development anywhere in the country.
This strategy document broadly outlines the context of socio-economic and development
status of tribal groups in Chhattisgarh and presents a plan to address these within the
framework of the World Bank financed District Rural Poverty Project (DRPP). The
DRPP is a people centred, participatory, poverty alleviation programme that targets the
poor and disadvantaged section of the population in all 16 districts of Chhattisgarh. The
implementation of the project is based on an innovative approach that highlights demand-
sensitive development, promoting and supporting effective decentralised governance and
addressing obstacles to income security.
It is well established that the tribal communities as anywhere else in the country, are one
of the most vulnerable and marginalised group. They face social diversity, oppression and
economic hardships in various forms. They have to contend with unequal and insecure
access to productive resources and share poor participation in governance. Tribal areas
and communities largely remain underserved through public systems - both on account of
supply (resources fail to reach the target or programmes fail to bring long term change)
and demand (poor ability to demand and elicit resources and services) factors. Poor
educational achievements, vulnerable health status and insecure livelihood base have kept
these groups to the margins of development in Chhattisgarh. The number and status of
tribals, thus warrant specific attention to aspects of their participation and intended
benefits from DRPP.
Through this tribal development strategy the government makes an attempt to recognise
the fact that benefits from programmes and schemes intended for the tribals do not reach
them automatically and that deliberate and strategic measures and protective regimes
have to combine with relevant programmes in order to ensure that benefits actually accrue
to vulnerable sections such as tribals. Accordingly, this document sets out an agenda of
action for DRPP and identifies measures and provisions intended to protect and enhance
the participation of and benefit to the tribal communities in the selected DRPP districts.
This paper identifies broad principles and directions for institutional and programmatic
intervention with the tribals in DRPP.

3.2 The Context of Tribal Communities in Chhattisgarh and their status
in DRPP Districts
3.2.1 An Overview
The state of Chhattisgarh is home to a large tribal population, which is diverse in location,
origin, socio-cultural history, language, livelihood and level of development. With the
exception of some isolated tribes, which continue to be in the food gathering stage, settled
cultivation is the dominant mode of occupation for most of them. However, forests
continue to be significant source of livelihood. This is a result of the historical pattern of
settlement whereby the tribal communities reside in or near forested areas. The areas of
tribal concentration in Chhattisgarh can be classified as under:
North Eastern Zone: Comprises of Surguja, Raigarh, Bilaspur and areas of other
adjoining districts. The primary hilly north-eastern zone is the abode to the Oraons,
Kawar, Majhi, Bharia, Agaria, Nagasia, Khairwar, Dhanwar and Korwas. The area has a
number of primitive tribes such as Korwas and smaller groups of Baiga. In Chhattisgarh,
six agencies have been set up especially for development of these primitive tribes. These
six agencies are:
I. Kamar Vikas Abhikaran, Gariyaband (Kamar Development Authority,
Gariyaband)
2. Abhujmarh Vikas Abhikaran, Narayanpur (Abhujmarh Development Authority,
Narayanpur)
3. Baiga Pahadi Korba Vikas Abhikaran, Bilaspur (Baiga Pahari Korba Development
Authority, Bilaspur)
4. Pahadi Korba Vikas Abhikaran, Ambikapur (Pahari Korba Development
Authority, Ambikapur)
5. Baiga Vikas Abhikaran, Kawardha (Baiga Development Authority, Kawardha)
6. Pahadi Korba evam Birhor Vikas Abhikaran, Jashpur (Pahadi korba and Birhor
Development Authority, Jashpur)
These agencies work towards all round development of these tribes by making provisions
for drinking water sources, civil constructions, health facilities, schemes such as purchase
of land for landless primitive tribe people, etc., all with the objective of making them self-
reliant.
Southern Zone: Comprising of Bastar and other districts carved out of Bastar, this is a
large area with very high tribal concentration. This area is populated by various tribes like
Gond, Bhatra, Halba, Maria and Pardhi. Numerically, Gond is the largest tribe of
Chhattisgarh.
2 For notification as Primitive Tribes, four criteria have been laid down by Government of India - economy
based on extremely backward agricultural technology, very low literacy rates, isolated from mainstream
lifestyle due to geographical situation and less growth rate of population than expected for long period.

There are a few sections of tribes, who by virtue of their location and entitlement have
derived benefits of settled agriculture under favourable conditions and have also sought to
assert a higher social identity. However, for most tribals, settlements along the hilly
tracts, forests or marginalised lands; social status and economic endowment is low and
precarious. The large number of tribals present in the state pose a challenge for all
development and poverty reduction initiatives and programmes have to b sensitive to their
social, cultural and livelihood context.
A list of Scheduled Tribes in Chhattisgarh, numbering 42, is given in Annexure I and of
the seven Primitive Tribes in Annexure 2.
The following are the main development indicators that highlight the problems and
challenges faced by the tribal communities in the state:
3.2.2 Education
Education is one of the most powerful tools for socio-economic empowerment but the
tribal communities of the state have lagged behind, both in terms of access as well as
scholastic achievements. Although the state has invested considerably in infrastructure
development for universalising education, large proportions of tribals, particularly girls,
still remain outside the scope and reach of formal schooling. The 1991 census revealed
that the overall literacy rate among the tribals was 26.7 percent, male literacy was 39.7
percent and female literacy rate a mere 13.9 percent. We may assume that these rates
would have increased considerably over the last ten years, a period in which the literacy
rate of Chhattisgarh state progressed from 42.9 percent in 1991 to 65.2 percent in 2001.
48



There are of course spatial variations. Lack of social motivation, economic stress, limited
perceived relevance of schooling, poor teacher motivation and inadequate resources have
combined tojeopardise the tribals' access to education. These act even more aggressively
on the girl child. Hence, the gender gap in education remains persistent. A district wise
presentation of literacy rate amongst scheduled tribes is given in table 2.

Chhattisgarh has been a witness to a number of innovative government programs like
Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS), Alternative Schooling, District Primary Education
Project (DPEP) and initiatives by voluntary organisations in the field of education. The
initiatives have sought to fill the supply gap by offering more and better-equipped
facilities and also to improve effectiveness of public education system by focusing upon
pedagogy and aspects of teacher motivation. EGS ensures provision of a school within
one kilometre radius of a settlement from where the demand for the same has come and
where there are at least 40 children (25 for tribal areas) who do not have access to a
primary school. DPEP is a World Bank sponsored project, which works towards
universalising primary education through multiple interventions at programmatic and
institutional levels and which covers all aspects of education. Alternative Schooling was
introduced as an intervention under DPEP for education of children who are not able to
study in formal schools due to various socio-economic reasons.
3.2.3 Livelihood and Employment
Land, both private and public, is the main source of livelihood in rural areas, with
agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and allied activities the main sectors in which
tribals earn their living. These are carried on primarily for their own subsistence and
often under endemically adverse ecological and economic factors. The status of
49



agriculture and allied activities of the tribals is basically low technology low input, and
subsistence economy based. While there are segments amongst tribals who own large
tracts of land and have also taken to more productive and hence more remunerative
agricultural practices, they by and large revolve in low technology equilibrium. The major
constraint in enhancing agriculture returns among the tribal groups has been marginal
land ownership, feudal structures of production and low ability for investment.

In most of the districts, less number of tribal families own land. The size of these holdings
is smaller, when compared to those of the general population. The proportion of tribal
land holdings is also lower than their proportion in the total population. Further, their
share of cultivated land is smaller than their share in population in nearly all the districts.

Access of tribal population to land, remains highly unstable and insecure. Land alienation
and insecurity of tenure has been a regular cause of concern related to tribal land
ownership and this makes their stakes even more uncertain, amounting to virtual
landlessness. Wrongfiul dispossession, unfair tenancy arrangements and bondage are
common in these areas. In these situations, most of the tribal families exist on the margin
of an agrarian economy serving it with their cheap labour and skills. Till 315' March,
2002, 42687 cases of dispossession of tribal lands by non-tribal had been registered in the
competent courts, of which 41774 had been disposed off by then3.
The major problems that tribals face in securing access to land are described as under:
iii
> Access to Revenue Land: -
*  Scheduled Tribes are deprived of their land through illegal means and
extortion.
*  While the State has adopted a progressive policy of distributing government
revenue land to landless, incomplete land records and their unavailability
subvert this policy effectively. For example, the main field revenue official,
the patwari does not have a list of the landless.
*  The Land Ceiling Act provides for appropriation of surplus land by the state
and their distribution amongst the landless. However these provisions are not
enforced.
*  Questionable methods are employed to auction land of weaker sections by the
banks.
*  Development and conservation projects acquire land of the weaker sections.
*  Illegal sale of land owned by Scheduled Tribes continues despite restrictions.
*  Access to Forest Land: -
*  Forest Policies can on occasion, lead to the loss of land use and even eviction
from homestead areas of tribal people, if the policy declares that these as
protected areas.
*  The survey of encroachments prior to 1980 is not impartial. Encroachments on
forestlands and their subsequent regularisation used to be permanent feature in
forest areas. The Forest Conservation Act passed in 1980 puts a stop to this
practice. It imposed very stringent conditions for diversion of forestland for
non-forestry uses. However, following agitation by forest dwellers,
Government issued guidelines to regularise encroachments prior to 1980.
* Forest villages continue to remain outside the mainstream as the Forest Act of
1980 has hampered their conversion into revenue villages.
In most cases, the quality of land held and tilled by tribals, is least productive (this is the
result of the historical pattern of settlement where tribals have come to inhabit the
marginal land in hills around the cultivated tracts, where incidence of irrigation is also
low ). Often the best quality land is held either by non-tribals or influential sections of the
tribal population
Farming is further constrained by the predominance of rainfed conditions, lack of assured
protective irrigation, declining soil fertility, untimely and inadequate availability of inputs

such as seeds, power, and fertilisers, a generally low level of technological adoption
among small and marginal farmers.
Commercially oriented animal husbandry based on cattle rearing and dairying is again
limited both on account of paucity of feed base, low investment ability and poor
marketing options. However goat rearing, pig rearing and small-scale poultry are
common among many tribal groups. Its products are used for exchange, localised sale and
domestic consumption. Thus, these usually remain outside the scope of commercial
marketing.
3.2.4 Forestry
Forest and forest produce occupy an important place in the tribal economy and
employment. In the state, the richest forest reserves are found in the tribal homelands and
the access to and use of these has been the source of much contention between the tribals,
private interests and the state machinery for which the forests also represent an important
source of revenue.
The forests of the state are rich in timber and non-timber forest produce. These have been
traditionally collected, processed and sold by them and thus, form an important source of
cash income for them. Estimates indicate that nearly 91 million person days of
employment are generated in the forestry sector and the largest share (90 percent) of these
accrue to the tribal residents of the forest areas5. These days of work are generated quite
largely through the Forest departments managed and controlled works in Forests. Apart
from employment, tribal economy and life depends very largely on forests and its produce
- these include substantially fuelwood, minor forest produce that is used for personal
consumption and for sales, for nutritional purposes, for cultural and lifestyle usage, for
medicinal purposes, ad other myriad uses, much of which remains as a knowledge
resource within tribal communities. Yet the dependency on forests, often a resource that
sustains and re-inforces tribal life, is becoming unsure and unsustainable due to reducing
forests, stringent laws on use of forests, and increasing biotic and public pressure on
forests.
The most important employment generation in forestry takes place through collection and
sale of Non Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). The five most important NTFPs are
nationalised with the Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce Co-operative Federation,
which has monopoly rights of collection of these NTFPs. The federation undertakes the
collection of nationalised NTFPs through primary cooperative societies. The most
important NTFPs from livelihood generation point of view are nationalised NTFP like
tendu patta, sal seeds and harra. Around Rs. 200 crores were earned by tendu patta
collectors in 20016. This is significant supplementary income to agriculture that accrues
to tribal families in the lean agriculture season. But often due to adverse weather
conditions the quality and quantity of NTFPs are badly affected. Headloading of firewood
around towns is frequent and provides critical income to poor households.
The Chhattisgarh Government has accepted the responsibility of meeting the forest
produce requirements of the people living around the forest area, through 'Nistaar'. Under
sForest Dcpartment, Department Employment Report, 2001-2002
6 Forest Department, 2001-2002
52



Nistaar, the Forest Department supplies fuel and fodder to the villagers at,subsidised
rates. The latest forest policy of the Government restricts this facility to villages located
within five kilometres of the forest fringes. However, local residents do not have any
clain on commercial revenue from the forest.
Tribals have a close linkage with the Forest Department as they reside in and around
forest areas that are managed by the Department. The relationship has been problematic
to say the least. At the crux of myriad problems, lies the question of ownership - Who
owns the forest land? - the Forest Department or the tribals? The uneasy co-existence has
at times broken into open hostilities also. The new initiative of the Forest Department viz.
Joint Forest Management (JFM) seeks to resolve this crucial issue by offering tribal
communities a stake in the management of the forestland, whereby the Gram Sabha holds
the responsibility of coordinating the implementation of the project and also plays a role
in resolving issues. A total of 6412 JFM committees covering more than 33924 sq. km. of
7
forest have already been formed in the state7.
Under the DRPP project, the CIGs can take up the initiative of forming Forest Protection
Committees (FPCs) provided they have not been established till now in their respective
villages. A FPC is a higher order organisation compared to CIGs and might comprise of a
number of CIGs operational in the village. Initiatives such as strengthening of an existing
FPC can also be taken up. If physical activities are necessary to restore degraded land,
then funds for undertaking such measures should be accessed from other sources.
If JFM emerges as a priority intervention in an area, it will be necessary to train members
of DRPP field teams in the subject. The project will have to closely liaison with the
Forest Department in order to gain sanction and registration of FPCs.
3.2.5 Labour and Employment
Tribals are predominantly engaged in primary sector - agriculture, animal husbandry and
forestry related activities, their low asset base in terms of land and livestock and few
options for self-employment, usually makes wage labour an important component of
tribal's economy in the state. The overwhelming source of wage labour for tribals is
agriculture operations. In addition to this, forestry, mining and quarrying, and
construction work are the other important employment sectors for them.
Labour arrangements and practices vary across the state but are uniformly pitted against
the poor. In most cases, these are governed by traditional exchange relations dominated
by the upper caste landholding elite and the merchant classes. Economic relations based
on social control are highly exploitative and have sustained in the light of credit
dependence of the tribal poor on the peasant castes, forcing them into virtual bondage in
many places.
The quest for wage labour has guided the tribal poor to urban centres and regions of high
agriculture production, where employment is usually available in areas of agriculture,
public works and construction. Young women also migrate (though in lesser numbers)
alongside adult men leaving behind elderly and children in homesteads. The wage labour
is casual and completely determined by vagaries of market forces and none of the
numerous labour laws are applied to this mode of employment. Labourers have to depend
7Forest Department
53



upon their employers for basic needs such as shelter, food, etc. This vast casual workforce
has been described as 'footloose people' by researchers studying their conditions.
Active participation by women in manual labour is a feature of rural societies
everywhere. This is even more so for tribal society, which is unhindered by caste taboos
that place restrictions on women's mobility for wage labour. It is common to find tribal
women going out on their own for wage labour on public works and to towns. While men
folk cut and gather fuelwood, it is often the women who bring it into urban centres for
sale.
Finally, children enter the workforce early in tribal society. Low average years of
schooling, high dropouts and establishment of nuclear family after marriages means that
young tribal adults have to be independent very soon. Children work as construction
labour and in quarries and also provide critical labour at home and in agriculture.
3.2.6 Poverty and Deprivation
Given the adverse social and economic relations governing their lives, the tribals of
Chhattisgarh are among the poorest and most vulnerable group in the state. The recent
poverty surveys8 show that 5,89,363 tribal families live below poverty line. They
comprise 41 percent of all families below poverty line in the state. This is much higher
than their proportion in the total population, which is 32.45 percent.

different areas though there does exist some overlap also9. There are also some
considerable differences between them, which will require different approach by PFTs
towards these groups even in the same area. Hence, it is important that the members of
the PFTs have an understanding of the characteristics, needs and approaches of these
tribes. While many of them own some land, they also depend on wage labour and often
face extreme exploitation and forced bondage. Hence, the PFTs must be prepared for a
spectrum of activities from amongst the tribal population.
3.2.7 Legal and Policy Framework for Tribal Communities in Chlhattisgarlh
The Constitution of India makes special provision for tribals. It lists out predominantly
tribal areas in Section I of Schedule 244 that are referred to as Scheduled Areas. The
Schedule gives state-wise list of communities to be designated as Scheduled Tribes.
Following widespread cases of atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes and
Tribes, the centre has passed Prevention of Atrocities (SC and ST) Act, which stipulates
stringent punishment to those who commit atrocities against any tribal.
The strict hierarchical caste divisions in the Indian society place the tribals at the very
bottom of the social ladder even though they are strictly not part of the caste system.
Social discrimination is widespread and it takes numerous forms like denial of public
facilities to members of SC/ ST, derogatory forms of address, forced show of
subservience in the presence of upper caste people, and segregatory practices. Violence is
often resorted to for enforcing the norms. While legislation existed earlier also against
these practices, the new powerful act provides for strong punitive action in these cases. It
makes commitment of atrocities against SC/ ST a non-bailable offence.
In addition to the above significant act, the main State Acts that intend to protect the
interests of the tribals in Chhattisgarh are as follows:
Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code: This Act governs tenancy regulation in
Chhattisgarh. Section 170 (A) and (B) of this code place restrictions on transfer of
agriculture land owned by a tribal to a non-tribal. The transfer is completely prohibited in
Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) areas. In non TSP areas, transfer is possible only with the
permission of the Collector.
Chhattisgarh Money Lending Act: This Act regulates activities of moneylenders with a
view to protect the interest of the weaker sections of the society. It puts a limit on interest
rate that can be charged and the total interest that can be charged. It makes registration
obligatory and also limits the power of the civil court to issue decree in money lending
cases and thus, provides relief for the debtors.
Panchayat Act (Extension to Scheduled Areas) 1996: The legal framework for
Panchayati Raj governed by the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution was not applicable
to Scheduled areas as it was thought that Panchayati Raj bodies in tribal areas should be
formed in keeping with the existing social organisation in these areas. Considering the
need and demand for extending the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution to the
Scheduled Areas, a high level committee, called the Bhuria Committee was set up under
the chairmanship of Shri D.S. Bhuria, in 1994. This committee was expected to examine
9 Refer Table I
55



all related issues and make recommendations on the salient features of the law for
extending the provisions of the 73rd Amendment to the Scheduled Areas. The committee
submitted its report in January 1995, and after thorough examination of the
recommendations made by the committee, a bill was introduced in the Parliament in Dec.
1996. This was subsequently passed and was made into an Act namely, The Provisions of
the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (Act no. 40 of 1996). The
objective of this Act are as following:-
> To extend the Provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to the Panchayats to
the Scheduled areas with certain modifications.
> To provide self-rule for the bulk of the tribal population
> To have village governance with participatory democracy and to make the gram sabha
a nucleus of all activities.
> To evolve a suitable administrative framework consistent with traditional practises.
> To safeguard and preserve the traditions and customs of tribal communities
> To empower Panchayats at the appropriate levels with specific powers conducive to
tribal requirements.
> To prevent panchayats at the higher level from assuming the powers and authority of
panchayats at the lower level of the gram sabha.
This act is applicable to the scheduled areas mentioned in Clause (1) of Article 244 of the
Constitution. As a sequel, all existing laws relating to Panchayats in the fifth schedule
area had to be amended as per the provision of this act with one year time period. The
other Acts that have been amended are Chhattisgarh Land Revenue Code and
Chhattisgarh Excise Act. Amendments in Chhattisgarh Money Lending Act and
Chhattisgarh Village Court Act are under process.
Designation of Tribal Areas as TSP, MADA and Clusters: An important policy that
has governed tribal development administration is the designation of Tribal Sub Plan
areas in the fifth five-year plan (1974-79). TSP areas include Scheduled areas and those
tehsils in which tribal population exceeds 50 percent of the total. In order to cover
villages that could not be included in TSP areas as per their definition, the concept of
MADA was introduced in the Sixth plan (1980-85). Under this, those cluster of villages
have been identified as MADA (Modified Area Development Approach) pockets, which
have an aggregate population of 10,000 and where 50 percent of the population belongs
to tribal communities. Finally, steps were taken in Seventh five-year plan (1985-90) to
cover isolated and scattered pockets of STs in the state through the identification of more
pockets with tribal population of 50 percent in clusters of 5000 population. In all,
Chhattisgarh now has 18 ITDPs (Integrated Tribal development Plan), 9 MADA pockets,
6 Special Most Backward Tribal Development Authorities and 2 Clusters. Each of these
has a specific project and fund allocation handled and coordinated by the department of
Tribal Development and SC welfare. DRPP and ITDP areas will overlap, but ITDP funds
will not be used to duplicate DRPP works as rules governing ITDP forbids it. However,
dovetailing of funds can be done for an objective common to both the projects.

3.2.8 Government Structures, Services and NGOs for Tribal Development in
Chihattisgarh
Government Agencies
Department of Tribal and Scheduled Caste Welfare: Department of Tribal and Scheduled
Caste Welfare is the prominent agency designated for development of tribal areas and
communities in the state. The department has the following main functions:
' To promote and protect the rights of the tribal communities in accordance with the
spirit of the Constitution.
' To implement programs for the educational and economic development among tribals
of the state.
> To act as a channelising agency of funds to various line departments and agencies for
tribal development interventions.
> To coordinate and monitor funds application by various line departments in tribal
areas.
The department is headed by the Minister of Tribal Welfare, who is assisted by a
Secretary. The Commissioner of Tribal Welfare is the State level executive in-charge of
the department.

The Department has district level offices in all 16 districts of the state. In TSP areas (12
districts out of 16) they are headed by the Assistant Commissioner whereas in non-TSP
areas (4 districts), District Organisers are in charge of district level departmental
activities. Block level offices of the department have been established in the 85 tribal
blocks of the state and these have been placed under the Zila Panchayat under the three-
tier Panchayati Raj institutional arrangement.
Creation and maintenance of educational infrastructure and services in tribal areas form
an overwhelming part of the Department's work. It invests in construction of school
buildings, recruitment and administration of teachers, management of hostels,
scholarships and other incentives for improving access to schooling in tribal areas. Nearly
8545 primary schools, 1914 middle schools, 332 High Schools, 293 Higher Secondary
Schools, 5 model schools, 3 Girl Education Complexes, II Sports Schools, 76 Post
Metric Hostels, 597 Ashram Schools and 1030 Pre-Metric Schools are run directly by the
Department in 85 tribal blocks all over the statelo.
In addition to education, the Department is the principal planning and coordination body
for the Tribal Sub Plan through the Integrated Tribal Development Plan (ITDP) and
MADA projects in tribal areas and clusters. Through its district level offices, the
department monitors the flow and utilization of TSP/ MADA funds that are allocated to
the various line departments.
Chhattisgarh Scheduled Tribe Commission: The ST Commission was set up by the
Government to monitor the application of the state policy for STs. It is headed by a non-
government representative and is located in Raipur. The main role of the Commission is
that of a "watchdog", protecting legal, development and human rights of tribal
communities and its principal functions include:
> Protecting constitutional and legal rights of STs.
> Monitoring and vigilance of development programs for tribals and providing feedback
for their improved implementation.
> Making recommendations on reservation policy for public services and educational
institutions.
The Commission has been accorded judicial powers of a civil court and it can initiate
legal action  accordingly through  summons, investigations, and  demand  for
documentation. Since its inception, the Commission has responded to a number of cases
of atrocities against tribals and has been instrumental in bringing justice to aggrieved
families. As an independent Commission it has a vital role to play in protecting the rights
and dignity of tribals. A copy of the annual report of this project will be forwarded to the
Commission for information and perusal.
Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce Cooperative Federation: The Raipur based
Federation was set up to free the tribals from exploitative practices of middlemen in the
trade of Non Timber Forest Produce (mainly tendu patta) and ensure that the tribal
collectors get a fair price. It is the apex body of the three tier structure comprising of
Primary Societies and District Unions that undertake the procurement of tendu patta and
now other minor forest produce also, such as Sal seeds, harra and gum. The Federation is
'0 Department of Education, Department of T ribal Welfare, 2001-2002
58



also diversifying to other high value forest based produce such as honey, aonla, inll,
chironji, niahla and lac.
The interventions of the Federation have been instrumental in ensuring a fair return from
tendiu patta collection, a large-scale seasonal forestry activity in the state. The Federation
is poised for an expansion in its trade in other forest-based commodities. They are
spatially well dispersed and have very large membership especially in villages bordering
the forest area. Most members are from poorer section. The Primary Societies usually
have substantial funds of their own and will probably be a major source of funds for the
beneficiaries' contribution in this project.
Non- Government Organisations: Chhattisgarh, in comparison to other states, has a
smaller presence and tradition of NGOs working in the field of rural development. The
growing NGO sector now has a range of agencies/ groups working for tribal welfare. The
non-government organisational sphere ranges from mainstream NGOs working with the
state at one end to extremist groups committed to overthrow the state apparatus at the
other.
The following three broad categories describe the range of non-government action among
tribal communities of the state:
> NGOs: This category comprises of mainstream development and service delivery
NGOs that access state and private funds for implementation of development
programs and services. Such NGOs now exist in all the districts of the state; the recent
encouragement of NGOs to participate in watershed management prompted many to
set up new agencies. As most districts of Chhattisgarh have some tribal population
and these groups are generally poor and deprived, NGOs work considerably with
tribal constituents. However good NGOs with a proven track record and demonstrated
capacity to work with the community are scarce. Attempts will be made in areas
where good NGOs are available and are working and residing permanently in that
area, to link them with the project by using their expertise for training and capacity
building and also maybe by giving them membership in PFTs.
> Activist Organisations: Activist groups including mass tribal organizations focus on
awareness generation amongst tribals regarding issues related to their rights and
entitlements. These groups are guided by the conception that awareness and
mobilisation of tribals is critical to their struggle for development, dignity and justice.
Activist groups are promoted and led by people with very similar social profile to
NGO leaders and in sense can be considered offshoots of the mainstream NGO sector.
Chhattisgarh by now has some activist organizations. These activist groups display
considerable ideological diversity- from Gandhian to Marxist. By and large, they
believe that project based development work will not be effective unless the poor are
empowered and the power based equations change. They are also generally opposed
to foreign aid and as such are likely to oppose projects like DRPP. They however do
engage in lobbying with the government and demanding responsive action and policy
to benefit tribals. In case of issues of co-operation, co-ordination or clarity regarding
the project and its implementation, the Gram sabha will be responsible for taking
decisions and resolving such issues.
59



Political Groups: Extreme leftist (Naxalite) groups committed to the overthrow of the
state, have made inroads to some tribal pockets of Chhattisgarh viz. Dantewada,
Bastar and other districts bordering Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra and Surguja
bordering Jharkhand. The Gram Sabha will be responsible for clarifying any doubts or
confusions that may be raised by any such group regarding the DRPP project and its
implementation.
3.3 Tribal Development Strategy for DRPP
As an identified poor and vulnerable group in all the districts under DRPP, the
interventions with the tribal communities will bear both strategic and practical
considerations in mind. The following are the goals of the strategy for tribal development
within the project that hold good over and above the fundamental strategies of DRPP
(participation, equity and decentralisation):
> Fair participation and representation at all levels of the project with a view to
influence its decisions and outcomes for the tribal constituents
> Ensuring protection of social, economic and cultural interest of tribal communities in
project interventions among both the tribal and the non-tribal groups
> Overcoming structural constraints to poverty and deprivation among tribals through
direct socio-economic interventions of the project as well as induced actions under
other available public resources and legal provisions of the Government
> Optimising productivity of community and privately held land, water, forest and
livestock resources among tribal with a view to primarily ensure food security and
generate sustainable surplus.
> Enhancing options for labour and improving conditions surrounding returns from
labour as a growing basis for livelihood activity for largest number of tribal families
in the region.
> Rigorous capacity building of tribals' village level organisations and its leadership to
plan, prioritise and place demands on the project services and resources.
Thus the tribal development strategy paper covers two inter-related aspects:
1. Institutional relating to participation, representation, decision-making and resource-
allocation to tribal development.
2. Sectoral issues relating to project activities, interventions and investments relevant to
tribal development within DRPP.
3.3.1 Institutional and Sectoral Interventions
Coverage, Participation and Representation:
Recognising that STs as a group run the risk of marginalisation and invisibility from
project govemance, the following is proposed:
At the village level, the tribal strategy will ensure that:
60



I . DRPP will attempt to cover and facilitate the participation of all the tribal BPL
families in a settlement.
2. In those villages where the ST population is above 30 percent, the tribal
women living in that area will be encouraged to form the first CIG. This will
demonstrate the priority of the DRPP and establish clearly the section with
which it is most concerned.
3. Number of proposals approved, investments made in tribal CIGs, and the
quality of performance and participation of tribal CIGs will count as key
indicators of a village's performance and will influence the decisions related
to future allocations in that village. There will be an annual plan, which will
affect future allocations. Target area will get less money if the number of
proposals, investments made and participation quality fall below a minimum
threshold. This annual review will be done in a humane manner, so that the
community is not penalised for bad performance for reasons beyond its control
like natural disasters. This will be the thumb rule for deciding on the minimum
threshold.
At the district level, it is envisaged that:
4. Coverage of tribal population, investments in tribal CIGs and performance
will be monitored and reported and form part of staff/ PFT performance
appraisals and reward systems.
5. An annual meeting of all tribal CIG representatives from within the district
will be organised by the project office in order to collectively review the
progress and problems faced by the project and its tribal partners. Separate
budget provision of about Rs. 2,500/- per meeting will be made under the
project for this.
6. The project office will remain alert to moves to subvert equal participation of
tribal CIGs in DRPP. This will be carried out through extensive review with
PFTs and the monitoring of norms specified under village level measures
above.
7. In order to ensure adequate pooling of experience and formulation of shared
strategies to work with tribal communities, it will be useful for the project
teams to selectively function and interact at the regional level as well. Though
there are no regional level structures envisaged in DRPP, project teams from
five districts can be formed into one regional cluster on the basis of the
homogeneity of tribal's socio-economic profile. There will be three such
clusters two with five districts and one with six districts (Since there are 16
districts in the state). CIGs that perform well will be selected for cross visits so
that healthy exchange of ideas can take place. Separate budget provision
within the project will be made for cross visits. One cross visit within each
regional cluster will be organised every year. Cross visits will begin from the
second year of the project.
The DRPP State Unit will convene a six monthly regional meeting of district officers
responsible for overseeing and monitoring tribal development activities. These meetings
will be used to review the progress with tribal CIGs, exchange experiences and share
strategies relevant to tribal development. There will be six meetings of this kind every
year and separate budget provision has been made for each meeting.
61



At the state level, the DRPP State Unit will:
8. Monitor the project's tribal development strategy and programs in and across
various districts.
9. Produce an annual public report, together with comparative expenditure, on
the impact of DRPP on tribal people's lives and livelihood in the DRPP
districts. The cost implication for the same will be minimal for such a report
and these can be edjusted in the miscellaneous costs of the project.
3.3.2 Identification of specific activities
Tasks that relate with the tribal strategy need to be built into the fabric of DRPP
operations and work strategies. Tribals constitute a vast number of the poor in the state
and the areas they reside in also form the poorer areas in the state. However, unlike the
general perception of tribals in India, in Chhattisgarh they are not marginalized or
voiceless of powerless, and they are recognised both for their poverty and for their
strengths and potential and political and social voice. The set of strategies and activities
that would ensure that the project is sensitive to tribals would need to be a part of the
overall approach and strategy of the entire project itself and not a separate set of
interventions. However caveats and implementation operation guidelines must ensure that
project is aware that although tribals are a large section, they need specific and more
focussed effort.
There are a fair number of activities specifically identified with promoting development
of tribals such as mentioned in the box below. But these will need to be in consonance
with the overall implementation schedule and framework of DRPP, to ensure that (which
maybe necessary in other states), tribals are not addressed as a minority group with
problems of lack of voice and representation.
Some Identified Activities Identified
X As part of baseline study, set realistic minimum ST thresholds.
*  Identify key indicators for
> Number of proposals approved
> Investments made by CIG
> Quality of participation of tribals.
> Quality of performance of tribal ClGs
* Set the minimum participation and performance threshold based on the above
indicators (These may be different for different areas and groups).
* Monitor performance of CIGs based on the minimum threshold
* Annual review of performance and participation of CIGs
* Design an annual allocation pattern sensitive to the performance of the CIGs.
* Monitor participation results for CIGs and PFT staff.
* Organise cross visits between CIGs within a regional cluster.
* Biannual staff meeting to review progress and exchange experience
* Annual tribal CIG representative meeting in each district to review draft report
monitoring results and identify obstacles to tribal participation.
* Annual Tribal Strategy Progress Report on impact on tribals with comparative
expenditures by district and block.
* Training and Capacity building of CIGs and PFTs.

3.3.3 Cost estimates andfinancing plan
I. Annual meetings of CIG representatives:- Annual meetings of the Tribal CIGs have
been planned in order to ensure that sharing of information takes place amongst such
groups. The cost for these meetings have been integrated to the total capacity building
cost of the project. The cost for these are based on the following assumptions:-
Assumptions:-
> Total no. of CIGs = 24500
> 60 % of CIGs are tribal = 14700
> Cost per person per meeting will be Rs. 50.
> The total cost for these meetings in the project period should not exceed Rs.
36,75,000 (14700 x 50)
Note.- the cost of these meetings per year however, wvill depend on the number of ClGs formed each
year.
2. Six monthly meeting of District Tribal Development Officers
Assumptions:-
> Total no. of CIGs = 24500
>  60 percent of the CIGs are Tribal = 14700
>  No. of participants per meeting is 60
>  Total number of people attending the meetings per year 320
>  The unit cost per person per day will be Rs. 150
>  Total cost for these meetings for five years will be 2,40,000 (320 x 150 x 5)
3. Cost Estimates for Cross Visits between successful tribal CIGs: The cost of cross visit
has been included in the Training and Capacity building paper.
4. The project shall sponser studies on the following issues
> Land and livlihood of the forest poor for which budget provision to the tune of
Rs.20 lac.
> Traditional systems of governance of tribal people for which budget provision
of Rs. 20 lac has been made.
3.3.4 Human Resource and Capacity Development
Capacity building at various levels is an integral part of DRPP. However, the special
development predicament of tribals in DRPP districts will call for special efforts to ensure
that tribal community benefits fully from the project. Training and Skill Building Needs
for tribal development exist at all levels of the project and these have been identified as
under:
Level       HRD Needs                   Potential Sources
CIG         Land Issues                 PFT Team (after it has been trained by officials
of the Revenue Department)
Forest Issues / JFM        PFT (after it has been trained by officials from
Forest Department)
PFTs        Context of tribals in DRPP  Government   Department   for   tribal
districts                  development.

3.3.5 Programme and Sectoral Interventions
The District Level Social Assessments will be done to illustrate the social and economic
constraints faced by the vulnerable groups that the project will target. Given the present
socio-economic set up, it is expected that DRPP's main interventions will target the
following sectors.
> NRM based livelihood development through agriculture, livestock, and forestry
resources
> Wage and Employment
> Savings and Credit
> Human Resource Development through training, awareness and skill building
activities
Specific district level interventions in these will be designed keeping in mind the broad
principles and pointers which are illustrated in Annexure 3.
3.3.6 Consultation
Due to the demand driven (all investments must be chosen by the CIG members and not
by outsiders) approach in the project, the DRPP design itself meets the Bank policy
requirement of ensuring plans, which gives "full consideration to the option preferred by
the indigenous people affected by the project". However, where STs are a minority in a
district or village, their views may not always be effectively heard in decision-making.
Such concerns have been addressed before finalising the strategy paper. The Government
held public consultations to ensure that the draft of the tribal strategy paper is both
feasible and acceptable to indigenous people.
Before the consultations, advance notice or advertisement (giving people a convenient
location where they can read the draft paper in an appropriate language) were given to
ensure that people are aware of the opportunity to learn about the tribal development
strategy and comments are forwarded on the project. The public consultation were held in
3 phases with phase I restricted to Govt officials, NGOs. And the phase 2 and 3 involved
direct interaction with the beneficiaries viz. villagers.
> Phase 1 from March 19-20
The invitee included Mr. Amitesh Shukla Hon. Minister of Panchayat & Rural
Development, Mr. Tuleshwar Singh Hon. Minister of state and Mr. Ramdayal Uike Hon.
Member, S.C.S.T. Commission.
The M. P. DPIP team including project co-ordinator, Smt. Gauri Singh, Finance
Controller Mr. Jitendra Singh & PFT,Co-ordinator Shri G. S. Tekam.
64



The participants included members from PRIs, Government Officers, NGO personnel and
people's representatives from various districts.
The CG team included Secretary, Panchayat & Rural Development Mr. M. K. Raut,
Deputy Secretary finance, CEOs of Zila Panchayats and block Panchayats.
The official raised issue as how the programme shall bring about upliftment and
empowerment of disadvantage section along with ensuring transparency in execution with
peoples participations and involvement of PRI, to which the Secretary P&RD and Project
Director MPDPIP informed the house that the project will institutionalized the core value
of peoples participation empowerment, decentralization, leaving through experience and
transparency with collaboration and co-ordination, further as the funds are placed directly
with the poor especially tribal, women threby providing them ample opportunity for
development.
) Phase 2 and3 from 25-26Augutst & 16-18 November
Villagers of Kanchanpur, Semraha, Andhiyaar Kho Panchayat, Gorella Block.
Attendees: Govt officials, NGO representative, World Bank representative. In this phase
the main concern of the villagers were, by when the project shall be operationalised and
what kind of activities can be taken up under the programme. Further as they were poor
they had difficulty in raising 5% initial amount.
Their concerns were adequately answered by the state represewntative that under this
programme any trade / activities can be undertaken to their convenience and where
training is required, the programme has ample provision for it. Further 5% initial amount,
can be raised as there is still 5 to 6 month for the programme. To start, Hon. Minister,
S.C.S.T. Commission and the villagers can save by working in programme like Food for
Work initiated by the State Govt. Apart from which, all the villagers can pool in money
so that one or two CIG can be formed, which can return the money back to the villagers
subsequently.
The advertisement, minutes of the consultations and the feedback generated by the same
done in the pilot project district, Bilaspur are appended in Annexure 4.

Expected District Level Interventions
3.1 Agriculture and Allied Activities
Investments in sustainable land and water resources development: Tribal farmers
practice cultivation under adverse and uncertain conditions. The small land holdings are
poor quality, marginal and rainfed. There is poor potential to invest in the improvement of
land productivity thus returns are low and unassured. In order to close the investment gap
and contribute to long term, sustainable improvement in productivity activities, the
following may be considered as priority CIG activities:
> Land levelling, reclamation, bunding and fertility management of private holdings.
> Common and/or individual farm family level water resource development through
wells, harvesting structures and creation of additional provision for localized
protective irrigation.
CIGs will be encouraged to access technical guidance from within the project or
externally for the planning and implementation of these proposals.
Improving Extension Services and Input Provision: Agriculture extension services are
rather underdeveloped in Chhattisgarh and these are at their thinnest in locations where
tribal cultivate their marginal lands. There is little technology dissemination and adoption
by farmers and basic provisioning of seeds and inputs is absent. DRPP will support
proposals from CIGs of tribal resource poor farmers interested in undertaking any of the
following or allied activities, if received.
>  Identification and hiring in of village based Para-Extension Workers (PEWs) by ClGs
for providing counselling and technical guidance to tribal farmers. These PEWs will
need to be equipped with basic technical information and will serve as a link between
farmers and sources of inputs and technology. Para Extension Workers may also be
identified by more than one CIG in order to ensure more efficient and cost effective
coverage. The DRPP project team will help in building the capacities of such village
based workers identified and/or recruited by CIGs through linking with sources of
training, technology and inputs.
> CIGs may formulate proposals for group-based provision of draught power and
agriculture implements, which may be supported by DRPP.
> CIG may also take up the management of decentralized seeds and fertilizer retail and
distribution outlets undertaking collective procurement and timely distribution and
will hence, overcome cost disadvantages.
Promoting diversification to horticulture and livestock: Agriculture change strategies
among small, marginal and resource poor farmers cannot rest alone on improving crop
production. The limits to land holdings make it difficult to stretch crop husbandry beyond
a level and hence, diversification becomes imperative. Inability to invest and lack of
access to technology hampers the move on small farmers' part to diversify their land-
based production. DRPP will assist in closing this gap if proposals are received from
CIGs of tribal farm families for horticulture and livestock development.
There are well-established experiments in maximizing returns from limited land, water
and livestock resources and these need to be adapted at least on a pilot basis in the DRPP
69



districts. The strategy focused on pooling together resources for inputs, diversifying to
horticulture and livestock rearing and ensuring on-farm value addition to production. It
combined private initiative with collective decision making in order to optimise use of
resources, maximize group returns and derive benefits from scale. Elements of this
initiative may be studied further by cross visits by interested and willing CIGs.
3.2 Food Security
Maximizing food security among tribal families will receive encouragement from the
project on receipt of such proposals and will form the core of its support to agriculture
and allied interventions by the farmers organized as CIGs. In order to protect the tribal
population from food shortage and hence turning to "distress" purchases in the lean
seasons, the DRPP will respond favourably to CIG proposals and actions in the following
direction:
> Revitalizing PDS in tribal villages. This will entail liaisoning by the DRPP project
teams together with, lobbying by CIGs with local administration.
' Establishment of community managed grain banks also to be used for purposes of
seed supply.
> Bulk purchase and stocking of food grain through the use of gram kosh generated by
CIGs.
3.4 Forestry
A large number of Non Timber Forest Produce (NTFPs) are collected by tribals across the
state as in the DRPP districts. The most important of the NTFPs are nationalized and
these include tendu patta, sal seeds, gum and harra. Collection and marketing of
nationalised products is carried out by the Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce
Cooperative Federation. The important non nationalized forest products include imll,
kasa, awla, kusum, lac, honey, chiraunji, mahua flower, bahera and safed musli, all of
which are found in the DRPP areas of tribal concentration. Typically, the market rates for
these products come down at the time of collection and increase immediately after it.
DRPP will be willing to extend the support to tribal CIGs for enhancing returns from
forestry activities on receipt of such proposals through the following kind of
interventions:
> Advancing capital to CIGs who wish to stock and store local NTFPs at the time of
collection. This will ensure that the collectors are able to release their produce at a
more favourable time and gain better prices.
> Making linkages for technical advice and providing financial support for value
addition of NTFPs through simple processing.
> Ascertaining market linkages for NTFPs.
Market interventions surrounding NTFPs inherently carry some risk and to minimize this,
it is proposed that NTFP based proposals are encouraged selectively and appraised
70



carefully by the project for their viability. The project may make pilot grants to CIGs in
the initial year with a clear emphasis on improving learning and experience building in
NTFP operations both at the project and CIG level.
3.5 Land alienation, security of tenure and ownership
All land based interventions such as proposed in DRPP assume that the tribal families
have secure access and entitlement to land. This is not true in many cases and the tribals
(together with other vulnerable groups such as SCs) operate land under persistent threat
of dispossession from powerful landed upper class elite, insecure tenure arrangements,
unfair share cropping systems pitted against the tenants. These unlawful practices are a
manifestation of the social inequities and they serve to keep the rural poor in chronic
poverty and deprivation. Further, these erode the stakes that the poor have in
improvement of their land resources and present the biggest challenge to long-term
change in their status.
Yet there are issues that can be addressed by a sympathetic and sensitive DRPP project
staff. Access to Government revenue records can be made easy by a process of awareness
raising and training of social animators in revenue record keeping. Action on these fronts
is possible without any serious intra community conflict. It will help in building the
credibility of DRPP in its target segment and will establish it as different from other
programmes.
It is therefore proposed that:
> DRPP project teams will be sensitised to land issues in their respective regions.
Residential trainings focusing specifically on land issues will be organized. An
agency with a good record of working on land issues will be invited to provide
resource support. If any field team has the inclination to take up more intensive work
on land issues, it will be supported by the top management. Work on these issues will
be counted as legitimate project work.
> The PFTs will be required to survey instances of land alienation and exploitative
tenurial practices pitted against tribal farmers in their clusters. This data may be used
in formulating realistic plans for investments under DRPP and for any long-term
action by the project for working on these issues. PFT members may be sensitised to
reporting exploitative practices.
> The project teams may liaison with local administration for land allotment to landless
labourers and assist CIGs in making representations for the same.
3.6 Wage labour and Employment
The analysis of occupational classifications of tribal population in the state as a whole and
for DRPP districts in particular, clearly demonstrates that wage labour is a major
component of livelihood for tribals. Limited land resources and virtual landlessness
among large sections makes it imperative for them to seek wage labour on farms in cities
71



and industrial areas further afield. Reports indicate that while Gond and Kanwar tribes
own some land, others are largely landless.
Deep-rooted social inequities and political realities work towards extensive exploitation
of tribal labour. Wage rates are low and differentiated between men and women. Even in
agriculturally advanced areas, immigration keeps the wage rates depressed. Widespread
incidence of bonded labour has been reported both from Janjgir-Champa and Raipur
districts. This is an area in which Government poverty alleviation programmes do not
normally intervene.
Migration is a common strategy for survival. Migrant workers toil under harsh and
difficult conditions. While there exists Government legislation to ensure minimum rights
of this category of workers, this is observed more after it is breached.
It is hence, recommended that: -
> Project teams of DRPP are sensitised to labour issues through training programmes
and resource material on the subject. Special programmes should be organized for
providing training in identification of bondage and minimum wage issues so that the
project teams are equipped to respond to situations that will need action at the CIG
level.
> Survey and identification of tribal families in virtual bondage or indentured labour
will be made by the PFTs. Incidence of labour among children will be particularly
identified and acted upon.
> Careful costing of labour component in CIG proposals will be ensured such that
labour is not under priced and reflects appropriate returns. Proposals from tribal CIGs,
which entail a labour component and seek to improve productive assets of the
members through the use of own labour, will be particularly encouraged.
> The provision of contribution in development projects is often misused to pay lower
than official minimum wages to labourers. DRPP should develop a contribution
policy that does not leave any scope for this practice. It is recommended that there
should be no contribution in kind for public works. All contribution should be in cash
prior to start of work. For individual works also a policy should be devised which
does not allow owners to pay lower than the minimum wages to outside labourers.
> Pilot studies will be undertaken in selected blocks to understand the movement of
labour and to identify possible strategy for pushing up wage rates.
e In clusters where there is significant migration for wage labour, options to alleviate
the hardships associated with migration will be considered. Thus, if children are also
migrating and therefore not able to access a school, a mobile school may be
supported. Similarly, if any special support is needed for the children and women who
are left behind, this may be provided.
72



3.6 Education and Health
Education and health are priority areas of social development for tribal communities and
gains in these will result in long-term socio-economic change. There are other significant
initiatives in these sectors such as DPEP in education and RCH- in public health and
DRPP will not duplicate efforts or investments made under these programmes.
As a general principal, such proposals from CIGs that seek funds for education and health
related activities would be justified if they represent a genuine gap in the available
services and resources. However, as an area programme with a wide village level
institutional base, DRPP will also be in a good position to contribute to the effectiveness
of the existing programmes in the following manner:
> Project teams will assist in dissemination of information on these programmes to
CIGs through meetings. Plans developed by these programmes that relate to the
DRPP villages will be collected by the DRPP project teams in order to be informed
and identify opportunities for linkages and collaboration.
> As a critical contribution in the health sector, DRPP will respond favourably to CIG
proposals for provision of safe drinking water in tribal settlements. Project teams can
assist CIGs to source other existing schemes for provision of safe drinking water.
Similar support may be made available by the project teams in linking up with safe
motherhood services being provided by existing departmental and /or special projects
in the DRPP areas.
DRPP will invite and encourage NGOs to initiate innovative, need-based activities to
close the gap in educational and health services in tribal areas. DRPP may help the NGOs
access funds and help them to link up with CIGs as the village institutional base for their
work.

Presentations, Village Consultations and Workshops Held On DRPP
4.1 Advertisements sent and Presentations made for Village Consultations
Before the consultations, advance notices/advertisements were given to provide adequate
information and opportunity to the people to learn about the tribal development strategy
and comment on the project. The advertisements were sent earlier and the same presented
again at the Village Consultations. Enclosed below are the summaries of the tribal
development strategy and Environment Management Framework presented to villagers
for the village consultations.
Note: Please find presentations and advertisements in Hindi appended in Appendix 4a
and 4b.
4.1.1 Tribal Development Strategy -A Suntmary for Village Consultations
District Rural Poverty Project (DRPP) - An Introduction
The DRPP is a people centred, participatory, poverty alleviation programme that targets
the poor and disadvantaged section of the population in all 16 districts of Chhattisgarh.
The implementation of the project is based on an innovative approach that highlights
demand-sensitive development, promoting and supporting effective decentralised
governance and addressing obstacles to income security.
The salient features of the project are:
> Members will be selected for the project through a process of wealth ranking done by
the villagers in the Gram Sabha assisted by the Project Facilitation Teams.
> Formation of Common Interest Groups (CIGs) : A minimum of five members will
form a Common Interest Group (CIG). Tribal and women will be encourgaed to form
CIG.
> A provision of Rs. 30,000 for every selected family has been made for the total
project period of five years.
> The PFTs will also assist the CIGs in conceptualizing the Sub projects.
> There is no set scheme. But priority will be given to such Sub-projects which can
improve the economic status of Common Interest Groups. The CIGs benefiting from
the Sub-project have to contribute to over 15% of the investment cost, out of which
the CIG must deposit 5 % of the total cost of the project in cash in the starting of the
project. The CIG has to give another 10 % of the total cost of the project for village
development plan. This money goes into Apna Kosh. This amount is to be paid ones
the sub project ends. This 10 % can also be paid in the form of labour. The amount
deposited in the Apna Kosh will not be used in the project period (DRPP). In fact they
will be put into fixed deposit for future village development work.
> Projects like tobacco growing or liquor making etc. will not be supported by the
project.
> Every project has to go through an Environment Impact Assessment.
> The Gram Sabha is the final body for sanctioning the Sub-projects.
> The project will make funds available for investment in the village, based on the
standard end impact of the work done.
74



Significance, Role and Participation of Tribals
Chhattisgarh has a tribal population of 32.45 percent (Census, 1991). Tribals are
concentrated over nearly 65 percent of the states area. The state is home to several tribes
- small, large and even those nearing extinction in numbers - and it presents among the
most challenging scenario for human development anywhere in the country.
Tribal communities are one of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups. They face
social diversity, oppression and economic hardships in various forms. They have to
contend with unequal and insecure access to productive resources and share poor
participation in governance. Tribal areas and communities largely remain underserved
through public systems - both on account of supply (resources fail to reach the target or
programmes fail to bring long term change) and demand (poor ability to demand and
elicit resources and services) factors. Poor educational achievements, vulnerable health
status and insecure livelihood base have further contributed to their precarious existence
in Chhattisgarh. The number and status of tribals, thus warrant specific attention to
aspects of their participation and intended benefits from DRPP.
As an identified poor and vulnerable group in all the districts under DRPP, the
interventions with the tribal communities will bear both strategic and practical
considerations in mind. The following are the goals of the strategy for tribal development
within the project that hold good over and above the fundamental strategies of DRPP
(participation, equity and decentralisation):
> Fair participation and representation at all levels of the project with a view to
influence its decisions and outcomes for the tribal constituents
>  Ensuring protection of social, economic and cultural interest of tribal communities in
project interventions among both the tribal and the non-tribal groups
> Overcoming structural constraints to poverty and deprivation among tribals through
direct socio-economic interventions of the project as well as induced actions under
other available public resources and legal provisions of the Government
>  Optimising productivity of community and privately held land, water, forest and
livestock resources among tribal with a view to primarily ensure food security and
generate sustainable surplus.
> Enhancing options for labour and improving conditions surrounding returns from
labour as a growing basis for livelihood activity for largest number of tribal families
in the region.
>  Rigorous capacity building of tribals, their organisations and leadership will be
concentrated on to plan, prioritise and place demands on the project services and
resources.
At the village level, the tribal strategy will ensure that:
> DRPP will attempt to cover and facilitate the participation of all the tribal BPL
families in a settlement.
75



> In those villages where the ST population is above 30 percent, the tribal women living
in that area will be encouraged to form the first CIG. This will demonstrate the
priority of the DRPP and establish clearly the section with which it is most concerned.
> Number of proposals approved, investments made in tribal ClGs, and the quality of
performance and participation of tribal CIGs will count as key indicators of a village's
performance and will influence the decisions related to future allocations in that
village. It is crucial to include tribal families in the CIGs and the project.
> There will be an annual plan, which will affect ftiture allocations. Target area will get
less money if the number of proposals, investments made and participation quality fall
below a minimum threshold. This annual review will be done in a humane manner, so
that the community is not penalised for bad performance for reasons beyond its
control like natural disasters. This will be the thumb rule for deciding on the
minimum threshold.
4.1.2 EnvironmentManagement Framework -A Summaryfor Village Consultations
The project's development objective is to improve opportunities for the poor and
vulnerable, especially women and tribals, to meet their own social and economic
development objectives. To achieve this objective the project would: (i) create
infrastructure and income opportunities for the rural poor; and (ii) empower active groups
of disadvantaged people and support village governments in becoming more responsive
and effective in assisting them.
The project has two components: (1) Community Investments and (2) Institutional and
Human Capacity Building. The project would provide matching grants to groups of
disadvantaged people to finance priority, small-scale, investments identified by the
groups themselves.
Groups would be composed of people who come together around a common need
(Common Interest Groups (CIG)), and could be as small as five people or as large as the
entire population of several villages (for larger multi-village projects).
Environment Management Framework
As part of the process of project formulation, an Environmental Management Framework
is required by The World Bank to be prepared to address any environmental issues that
may arise during implementation of the DRPP project.
The purpose of the Environmental Management Framework (EMF) is to ensure that
neither the livelihoods of the poor nor the environment are compromised. It is to explore
possibilities of making the efforts to improve livelihoods as well as conservation of the
environment complementary so that there are sustained benefits from the developmental
activities initiated.
Based on experiences elsewhere in similar projects in India it can be expected that the
sub-projects that would emerge in the DRPP would be in the areas of livestock
development, minor irrigation, agriculture development, forest products value addition,
construction and micro enterprises.
76



The physical, biological and social impacts of the probable sub-projects have been
predicted and their mitigative measures have been recommended in this report.
The scope of this report is as follows:
> To provide an overview of the possible environmental impacts and mitigation
measures for sub-projects that could emerge from the DRPP
> To design an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) for the project that will
include details of the environmental assessment procedures and tools, the capacity
building requirements and the institutional arrangements.
Environmental Assessment of Sub-projects
Based on the scale and nature of sub-projects currently emerging from DRPP projects
elsewhere in the country, the screening procedure for the DRPP has been designed. Four
categories of screening are suggested:
>  Category D: A detailed environmental assessment is not required for sub-projects.
For example a sub project which involves skill development on tailoring is a
programme component focussing only on training which involves no use of natural
resources.
> Category C: The proposed sub-project has either marginal or short-term impact on the
natural resources or environment (such as a small scale cooking operation that
consumes fuel wood).Environmental Review is suggested. This will be done by the
Project Facilitation Team (PFT).
>  Category B: If the proposed project has a significant or irreversible or long-term
negative impact (such as bore well leading to depletion of ground water), Limited
Environmental Assessment (LEA) is suggested. This will be done by the District
Environment Team (DET).
> Category A: If the proposed sub-project has a severe adverse environmental impact,
that cannot be mitigated within a feasible timeframe and budget, Environmental
Impact Assessment is suggested. This will be commissioned by the State Project Unit
in consultation with the State Environment Agency.
There is also a Negative list of Projects. If the proposed subproject falls in this list, it will
be rejected. For example, a dam (old or new), of lOm or more in height will not be
permitted.
Training
Training will be given at various levels in using the environmental assessment tools. The
training will involve an initial orientation workshop, a main training programme and
refresher-training programmes. A session on the EMF will be part of the induction
training for the CIGs. Each PFT will organize environmental awareness programmes for
the communities at least once every year.
Institutional Arrangements
77



At the State Level the Project Unit will be overall responsible for implementation of all
project components. At the district level the District Project Support Unit will be in-
charge of implementation. The District Environment Team (DET) will be drawn from the
PFTs and a nominee of the Panchayats. This DET will undergo intensive training from
the state Environment Agency. The PFTs will be responsible to ensure collection of
information for environmental screening during subproject preparation by the CIGs.
Where sub-projects may require Limited Environmental Assessment or ELIA, the PFT will
refer the matter to the DET and ZP and further to the state Environment Agency.
Environmental Suipervision and Monitoring
Environmental supervision would be carried out at two levels.
At the district level, the ZP staff would be required to verify that PFTs are correctly using
EMF guidelines and outputs, and the environment mitigation measures prescribed in the
approved sub-project are implemented.
At the state level, the Environment Agency will conduct six-monthly supervision of the
EMF, selecting a sample of subprojects from different categories of environmental
assessment.
A full presentation and discussion will be held regarding this project with the gram sabha.
Kindly be present to share your queries, clarifications and opinions regarding this project
and its approach.

The participants included members from PRIs, Government Officers, NGO personnel and
people's representatives from various districts.
The CG team included Secretary, Panchayat & Rural Development Mr. M. K. Raut,
Deputy Secretary finance, CEOs of Zila Panchayats and block Panchayats.
Issues of concern
> Prior efforts in similar programmes : In the inaugural speech, the Secretary, P&RD
said that so far, the programmes implemented previously have had limited success in
reducing poverty because of paucity of funds through DPIP with assistance from the
World Bank an effort has to be made to attack poverty.
> Hon. Minister of state, P&RD in his speech said that the programme being
implemented for the upliftment and empowerment of poor tribal should address the
following aspects during the implementation of the programme:
V Transparency in planning and execution
/ Ensure people's participation
/ Involvement of Panchayati Raj Institutions.
> The programme coordinator of MP DPIP, Mrs. Gauri Singh gave the guidelines
information on implementation and objectives and approach of the programme. The
project will institutionalize the core values, which are:
V  Peoples' participation
/ Empowerment
/ Process orientation
/ Decentralization
/ Learning through experiences
/ Transparency and collaboration/cooperation
About the project approach.
In order to achieve its objectives the project has adopted the following approach:
> Empower disadvantaged groups by putting funds under their direct control group
bank accounts.
> Ensure that groups, in view of their need, can select and develop Sub-projects by
taking various possibilities into consideration. They will not be restricted to use
project funds for some specific activities only. However, the activities on which funds
are utilized must fulfill the objectives of the project. Community will be free to seek
technical support from government and non-government persons & organizations.
> Support and strengthen groups having common needs and problems.
> To ensure group participation, the decision making process will be closely monitored
and approval to Sub-projects will be given only when decision-making process is
democratic, healthy and participatory in nature.
> To develop participation and feeling of ownership, create credibility and foster a
culture of local financing, cost recovery and user charges by requiring community
cash contributions for Sub-projects and creation of Group and village funds;
>  Strengthen local governments at the district and village levels by giving them
responsibility for the budgeting, its disbursement and monitoring of group activities.
79



Ensure transparency, widespread information, and communication and learning about
the project and groups' performance, successes and failures through formal and
informal mechanisms created by the project.
Feedbackfrom NGO representatives
Smt. Hemlata Sahu, Mahila Shiksha Kalyan Evam Prashikshan Parishad
For selection of beneficiaries a baseline study and wealth ranking is being done in the
Gram Sabha. This could be done on the basis of the IDEP implementation
and evaluation parameters, IDEP being mainly based on economic development.
>  Participation of women in the project should be ascertained.
> The implementation of the project should be done through public participation.
> The process of approval by the Gram Sabha is important.
> The income generating schemes should be on the basis of the demands of the people.
Smt. Satya Bhama Awasthi, Vasudha Mahila Manch
> People from similar socio economic situations should be brought together in the CIG.
>  Selection cannot be made on the basis of the BPL list since many a time it does not
cover the people who may be in actual need. A special list of actual people in need,
needs to be made.
> Need to clarify the conditions under which a grant of Rs. 30, 000 is given, and the 5
percent advance is not justified for a poor person. It could be given in the form of
labour, materials etc. that could be used by the beneficiary.
> Apna Kosh needs specific descriptions on how and when it will be utilised.
> It is essential to mention how many minimum or maximum members could form a
group.
> In a tribal area the project must be sensitive to the basic needs and the culture of the
area.
>  Further clarification is needed on the role of PRIs in the project, the process of
monitoring and evaluation of the same.
> It has been seen in all govemment projects that no social and cultural aspects have
been considered while launching the project, especially for women. These aspects
need to be taken into consideration.
> The out line of the project seems promising but in the later stage much government
interference might discourage the beneficiary. More public participation and less
government interference needs to be ensured.
> Over and above economic planning, planning specially on education, health, social
crime, torture against women and children, clean environments, prohibition against
drugs etc. needs to be looked at along with economic development to achieve the
goal.
Shri Vijay Tiwari, Gram Sewa Sansthan
> Sending a notice to the Sarpanch/Secretary of the Gram Panchayat and displaying it at
public places is an option. But one cannot be sure that everyone will be aware of it,
there fore a communication strategy is a must.
> The process and the means of communication adopted must be in response to the
reality of the area, as this will determine the success or failure of the project.
> The implementers of the project must have a complete understanding of the project.
It must be ensured that the implementers carry out the baseline survey and the
consequent categorization and finalization of the beneficiaries.
80



> It must be ensured that the project process is bottom up i.e. from the beneficiary to the
state level.
>  It must be ensured that people from similar economic situations and with similar
interests come together.
> After the groups are formed, they must be adequately trained and empowered,
according to their needs and understanding.
> It is proposed that a separate team for the project is instituted.
20th March 2002
Initial discussion started with "Criteria for selection of Block". Major suggestion from
the participants were as follows:
> Priority to Tribal Blocks.
> Focus on backward classes and literacy level.
> Priority to unreachable forest areas.
> Priority to poor rather than particular caste/class.
> In line with the MP DPIP.
> Develop one model village.
Further four groups were formed among the participants to discuss four major issues for
successful implementation of the programme:
> On Tribal strategy. The group focussed on the relevance of entry-point activities
especially for the tribal dominated areas as:
/ Tribals have a rich culture and heritage
$ The tribes have different style of working
/ The local dialect varies from non - tribal areas
v/ The tribals have a strong social structure but lack in economic
advancement.
The discussions led to the conclusion that there is a need to address the tribals first but at
the same time other poor people should also benefit from the DRPP programme. Hence
each of the CIG members should be made aware of the programme and related activities
so that the group becomes self-sufficient.
> Role of NGOs This group suggested that among the three members of PFT if two are
from G.O. then third one should be NGO personnel.. During the discussion the
following points were highlighted:
/ Good NGOs should be given opportunity
/ Regular training of the PFT members should be conducted.
/  PFT while working at the district level has major responsibility of
monitoring.
/  Women members from NGO should be given preference
> Gender strategy: The group came out with the following suggestions:
/  80% of the groups (CIG) formed should be of women.
81



V Priority should be given to the widow, divorcee, dependent, landless, and
physically handicapped persons.
V While selecting the activities stress should be on women - oriented
activities that will lead to their empowerment.
/ There should be no compulsion on women for 10% contribution.
> Comniunication: According to this group, the local people should be considered as
primary source and the data needs to be collected through:
V PRA technique
/ House to House visit
V Group - meetings of men & women (combined as well as separate)
V Wealth - ranking
V Training of the CIG (common interest group) as well as PFT (project
facilitation team) members along with the people's representatives.
V Continuous interaction between the PFT & CIG members.

4.2.2 PHASE 2 - August 25-26, 2002: Consultations With Gram Panchayats In
Bilaspur With Selected Villages Under DRPP Pilots.
4 2 2a Notice and information circulated in villages before the meeting
All the villages are hereby informed that Chhattisgarh Government has proposed to
launch the DPIP Programme with the help of the World Bank. The main features of this
programme are as under:-
I. This is an effort of the government to reduce the poverty of villages, in
accordance with the needs of the people.
2. The main target group of the project is the poorest of the poor, especially tribal
and women.
3. The main aim of this project is to provide them with opportunities of self-
progress, which will lead to income enhancement and improve their social status.
4. The process employed in this project will include, establishing a dialogue with the
village people, forming groups, enhancing the capacities of and strengthening the
groups, preparation, implementation and evaluation of sub-projects including
budget preparation and allotments. The project will emphasise on learning by
experience.
5. A process of wealth ranking will be followed among the families in the village
and 70%   of the poorest families will be selected as beneficiaries. In a
predominantly tribal or schedule caste village, all the families will be selected in
the project.
6. Through the project, every poor family will be entitled to get a maximum of Rs.
30000.
7. Beneficiaries of this project, will form groups of five or more people, and jointly
select the economic activity they want to carry out. The maximum membership of
the group is not restricted.
8. The economic activity/project selected by the group will have to be sanctioned by
the Gram Sabha.
9. Every group will have to contribute 5% of the demanded grant, for their sub-
project.
I0. On completion of the sub-project, the group will deposit 10% of the income into
the Apna Kosh account, for use in village development.
11. To ensure transparency in implementation of the group's activities, every group
will maintain a cashbook and a register, and will have to present their expenditure
details to the Gram Sabha from time to time.

Sanket Development Group.
Major issues raised and addressed during the meeting:
After giving a brief introduction to the project, one of the issues that were raised by Mr.
Raut was that of skill development and of realising the skills that already exist with
people. A number of skills were identified by the gram sabha as skills that already exist
amorigst people. Some of them were:-
-    Fishery
-    Goatery
-    Forest related skills
-    Poultry
-    Construction of Stop dams
-    Construction of Water pond
-    Construction of roads
A point was, thus, put up by Mr. Raut that those projects should be identified of which
people already have some knowledge and skill. He also added that projects which are
viable in nature should be given priority. However, the decision related to the project lies
completely with the people and members of the CIG and all sub projects are approved by
the gram sabha.
2. August 26th 2002 Village - Harradi, Gram Panchayat - Harratola, Block - Gorella

Major issues raised and addressed during the meeting:
People from II villages had gathered to welcome the World Bank team. Out of these I I
villages, only 3 come under the pilot project.
84



54 CIGs had already been formed in the gram panchayat and 31 had already
opened their accounts. Some of the groups have already deposited the whole of 5
% that they are supposed to contribute towards the sub project.
/ Some people had taken loans on interest from other villagers for depositing this
amount. They were advised by Mr. Rai, CEO Zila Panchayat to return the money
to their creditors as soon as possible and to deposit money only when they have
their own.
V There was a lot of anxiety amongst people regarding when the project is going to
start. Mr. Rai advised people that they should be patient as the project may take 4-
5 month in reaching the implementation period.
v  Most of the groups had taken up Animal husbandry esp. goatery as their project
activity. Some other sub projects that the CIGs had decided were brick kiln,
vegetable shop, kirana / ration shop, poultry, thread making, auto rickshaw, tube
wells, Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, etc.
V Some people also expressed desire to get the money on an individual basis. They
were advised by Mr. Anil Rai that they can take money under some other scheme.
Mr. Rai also gave information regarding how the common land can be used for
growing fodder in case many groups are taking up activities such as goatery,
dairy, etc.
4.2.3 PHASE 3-November 16-18, 2002: Hamlet and village consultations in Pendra
(villages Jumdi khurd, Amadand, Navagaon and Jliabar) and Gorella blocks (village
Andliyaar Kho), Bilaspur
No. of villages covered 5 (Jumdi Khurd, Amadand, Navagaon, Jhabar, Andhiyaar Kho)
1. 16'h November, 2002 Village: Semraha, Andhiyaar Kho Panchayat, Gorella Block.
People:                30-40 men and women of the Baiga community, dominant
in the pada, and some men from the Rathaur community.
Govt. Functionaries:   Accountant from Janpad Panchayat, Gorella.
Facilitators:          Sanket Development Group
No major issues of concern were raised the people felt that they needed time to
understand the programme and give their feedback at the consultation meeting scheduled
on 18'h November 2002. An introduction to the programme was given to the people and
the facilitators informed them that in case they had any issues of concern they must raise
them in the meeting.
Semaraha being a pada far from the main centre of the Gram Panchayat, Andhyar Kho,
there was some cynicism about whether the scheme would percolate down to all these
scattered hamlets, which are independent by virtue of the different communities living
there.

2. 17th November, 2002, Village:Meeting at para of Jumdi Khurd, Lata Panchayat,
Pendra.
People:                 10 men of the Oraon tribe, which is the dominant group in
the said pada.
Govt. Functionaries:    Mr. Thakur Singh, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Mr. Dau, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:           Sanket Development Group
Major issues of concern raised and addressed at the meeting:
Different livelihood options (subprojects), which can be undertaken under the DRPP,
were discussed in terms of their possibility and viability:
V Improvement in their current agricultural activities - the group felt that help from
DRPP could be put effectively to improve their current agricultural activities.
These could be related to providing infrastructure such as irrigation facilities
(canals, wells, pumpsets), and in training the community to enhance present
agriculture skills since the same has been imbibed and not inherited. Upon further
inquiry, the members pointed out that since they do not use 'modem' agriculture
practices such as use of fertilisers, this pointed to the need for agriculture
extension in this field.
/ Animal husbandry-most of the Oraons are not experienced in animal husbandry;
it was felt by them that it would be easier to rear small animals like goats, pigs,
and poultry which are easier and less expensive to rear in comparison to stall fed
cattle. According to the group, the forest departments had already indicated that
they could provide land for pastureland development.
/ Oraons, traditionally forest dwellers, are very knowledgeable about local forest
produce and its usage, and use of forest products is an integral part of their daily
lives. In the discussion it was brought out that their knowledge of existence,
ability to locate, identify and collect forest produce and to make it into usable
products could be supported by sensitive marketing support, and this could lead to
sustaining their livelihoods. The Oraons felt that this support is required both for
increasing their own procurement capacities and to market within the existing
local markets.
V Many of the Oraons today are labourers working in the neighbouring stone cutting
quarries, which provide gitti (gravel) for road construction. The trading of this
gitti is done at different levels, before it reaches the final contractor of the road
construction. There was a discussion in the group on whether a CIG could get
involved in this process of trading, though most were unclear on the marketing
channels and abilities needed for the same.
/ It is clear from these discussions that the local economy is still largely a fairly
closed economy and its interface with externalities are more in terms of trade and
relations of exchange. The Oraons will require substantial managerial and skill
support in organised livelihoods systems and marketing and financial support to
increase their capacities to earn better from their traditional livelihood sources.
86



Forming CIGs
v There was some discussion on the difficulty of coming together and forming a
group due to differences in economic conditions. This could give rise to conflicts,
based on resources contributed by CIG members. An example given by one
member of the community was that on building a common well there could be
different individual needs for water on land holdings, which may create conflict
between members. The facilitators informed them that efforts should be made to
take up sub projects which would not create conflicts but would instead help to
work together in a group.
3. 17th November, 2002
Village:         Meeting at pada of Jumdi Khurd, Lata Panchayat, Pendra.
People:          8-10 men and women of the Dhanuar tribe, who reside in the pada.
Govt. Functionaries:Mr. Thakur Singh, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra Mr. Dau, Janpad
Panchayat, Pendra
Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:    Sanket Development Group
Note:
The residents of this hhmlet have received some information on this programme.
However they are still in the process of understanding this project and hence have not
been able to see themselves as a part of this project. Therefore this meeting was used to
understand the economic situation and livelihood options available to this community in
the light of the project.
Observations based on the discussions held
This is a hamlet of the main village Jumdi Khurd. The total area of the hamlet is about 15
acres including farmlands. It consists of a community of 1 I families of the Dhanuhaar
tribe. This tribe was originally a hunting tribe, deriving its name from the 'dhanush' or
bow (made of bamboo) and hence the community's inherent association with Bamboo.
Today the members of the community have shifted to making of bamboo articles,
agricultural labour and procurement and sale of forest produce.
Most of the bamboo work however is restricted in its variety. The articles are made for
sale in the 'haat' or market and in the nearby villages where there is a demand for the
same. When the articles are sold in the village 'haat', the maker often gets a very low
price for them. While both men and women are engaged in the making of the articles, it is
the men who do the marketing and trading. The bamboo used is procured by the maker or
supplied by the buyer.
Labour is another source of livelihood for both men and women. This could be in the
form of agricultural labour, cow herding.
87



They are also engaged in collecting forest produce for self-consumption and for sale. This
includes a fruit called 'Bhakranda', a weed called 'Charauta' and leaves of the Sarai tree.
This fetches them a nominal amount. They also have very small 'badis', on which they
grow mostly 'jowar' for self-consumption.
Most of these transactions for labour and goods are made in kind, the return for which is
usually husked rice or poor quality grain.
Based on the above observation some important issues of concern while implementing the
programme in this area would be:
/ The community has developed a specific skill related to bamboo work over the
years. Enhancing this skill, formalising procurement systems for raw material and
encouraging further expansion and introduction of variety in this activity will help
the community in developing this activity into a viable livelihood option.
/ The traditional market system of the community is a barter system, and usually
much of the exchange takes place with neighbouring communities who the
Dhanuars are familiar with. As interactions with a larger market economy increase
the channels, expertise awareness and communication systems need to be
developed in the community.
V Most importantly there are very few available resources with this community to
start an enterprise. Existing resources thus need to be understood and tapped to
their fullest potential in order to ensure sustained livelihood options.
4. 17th November, 2002, Village: Meeting at Dongrapara, Village Amadand, Amadand
Panchayat, Pendra.
People:          Sarpanch of Amadand and a few villagers belonging to  the
Kanwar from Dongrapada
Govt. Functionaries:   Mr. Thakur Singh, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra Mr. Dau,
Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:    Sanket Development Group
There could not be a full meeting in Amadand since many of the villagers were out on
work and due to a lack of time the team had to go further on to the neighbouring villages.
However discussions with the Sarpanch and villagers revealed that the CIGs had been
formed in the village for the last six months and the people were still waiting for the
initiation of the programme. There is great enthusiasm to start with the same soon.
5. 17th November, 2002, Village:Meeting at Village Navagaon, Navagaon Panchayat,
Pendra.
People:          Embroidery workers of Navagaon belonging to the Muslim
community.

Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:    Sanket Development Group
The group present consisted of embroidery workers who have recently become trainers,
trained women in different villages to embroider on intricate designs on silk. This has
been initiated and supported by local leaders and the govemment to train women to work
at home. The effort however is at its initial phase, the market for the same still needs to be
explored and there is a great degree of talent, skill and quality required for the production
of this embroidered cloth. It definitely came across as an option for those talented in
embroidery, but the certainty of market and sustenance of the same as a livelihood option
seems to be questionable till one sees the project move further.
Though there was less knowledge on the programme itself, experiences showed that the
community present at the meeting seemed enterprising and open to venturing out to
newer options related to livelihoods.
6. 17th November, 2002, Village: Meeting at Harijanpara of Village Jhabar, Lata
Panchayat, Pendra.
No. of Villages covered  2
People:                 40-50 men and women of the Chamar community, who
reside in the pada.
Govt. Functionaries:    Mr. Thakur Singh, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Mr. Dau, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:           Sanket Development Group
Major issues raised and addressed in the meeting with the men's group in Harijanpara
v' Most of them own little land (less than one acre) and are not able to meet
subsistence needs through farming on the lands - it is not clear whether they own
the land or are sharecroppers.
/  An effort was made to look at occupations which are not land based. Currently the
community is involved in activities like goat rearing, pisciculture, carpentry and
shoe making. The community discussed the viability of expanding these activities
in terms of skills, market facilities and existing resources.
v  The members also shared the concern that there might be a danger if all the CIGs
take up the same activity. For example if all of them take up carpentry then where
would they market the goods? Hence a variety of activities need to be initiated.
/  Some new options for subprojects, which the CIGs can take up, were suggested.
This included trading in buffalo bulls, activities related to transportation and
minor irrigation work.
89



Major issues raised and addressed in the meeting with the women's group in Harijanpara
v The women in Harijanpara would prefer to work in a large group of over five
members
The main activity pursued by women at present besides agricultural labour was
trading vegetables between markets and households, of which the profits made are
minimal. The women discussed a scope of expanding this activity to a larger
trading activity, exploring better markets where the same could be sold for higher
prices. They also discussed that they could diversify and trade other goods like
grain, goats, vessels, etc.
Observation
V  Processing of leather and using it for shoe making is the traditional skill of the
community. While the older generation is aware of the various processes and
techniques involved, they emphasised that the younger generation has not learnt
this skill. This may be attributed to the social stigma attached to this activity and
hence the community historically. The community has picked up new skills like
goat rearing, carpentry, etc and is willing to enterprise on the same.
7. 1i7th November, 2002, Village:Meeting at Village Jhabar, Lata Panchayat, Pendra.
People:                 20-25 men of the Gond tribe and Chamar community, who
reside in the village.
Govt. Functionaries:    Mr. Thakur Singh, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Mr. Dau, Janpad Panchayat, Pendra
Dr. Vishwakarma, PFT member, DPIP-MP, Rewa District.
Facilitators:           Sanket Development Group
Major issues of concern raised and addressed at the meeting:
/ Can the DRPP funds be used as a common fund resource from which individuals
can draw money to start their own enterprises?
V Another major concern was that the groups have been formed and been involved
in saving activities for the last six months, and have been waiting for the funds to
initiate their sub projects.
V The money that is given for village development by the CIG should not be
exhausted in one time. What are the ways in which this could be kept alive and
floating?
V Will the number of CIGs remain the same as they are today? There are many
people who have lost faith and disbanded from the CIGs. It was clarified that once
a few CIGs start their work and are successful others would and could also form
more CIGs later. There is scope for linking with financial institutions, which will
help in strengthening and expansion of the CIG and its activities.
V Has it been successful in other villages?

/ The success of this programme requires the cooperation and the assistance of the
people in the village. Hence, one will need to ensure effective participation and
involvement of the Gram Sabha.
Most of the issues were related to the implementation and feasibility of the programme
itself. Dr.Vishwakarma and Dr. Pradeep Bose shared their experiences related to the
project in MP and rendered information on the project relevant to the issues raised.

The details of the scheme were explained by the government functionaries and then issues
raised by the people were addressed.
Major issues of concem raised and addressed at the meeting:
91



/  The absence of a lump sum of money, which is, required as initial contribution of
each member of the CIG.
This issue was raised by a woman belonging to the Rathaur community first, and
then later by a man from the Rathaur community.
The Government response to the same was that since the project is yet to start,
there is time to save and build the lump sum required for the initial contribution to
the CIG. If a group of very poor men or women do not have this money even then,
the village can decide to loan them the money, which they can pay back within a
year or so, when the sub-project initiated by them brings its returns.
The people of the village have very small land holdings (The largest holding is
that of 8-9 acres) if at all. There are many landless labourers also. What can be
done by them and where?
The Baiga men and women raised the issue.
V  The Government response to the same was that an enterprise, which can be done
on a small piece of land and once they, start getting their returns, they can take
larger pieces of land on lease.
It is difficult to meet subsistence needs and family members are constantly
engaged in labour in other farms or in government programmes. They get paid in
grain for the same.
V  This issue was raised by members of the Baiga community.
V There is no electricity and this worsens the water problem in the village.
v  This issue was raised by many members of the group present.
The government response to the same was that to make provisions for electricity
is something which will take a long time. Hence, the people can use alternatives
like diesel pumps to draw water for irrigation. They can come together as CIGs in
the village, pool their resources together and take up minor irrigation projects like
lift irrigation to address the water problem in the village.
Is there a minimum number of CIGs that need to be formed in the selected village
before an interested and ready group can get the money to initiate the sub-project?
This question was raised by the Sarpanch.
The response from the government functionary was that there are no such criteria.
A group of interested 5 people have to come together, make the initial
contribution and prepare a proposal for the sub-project 'they want to initiate. The
money will then be sanctioned to them. After a period of time, someone from the
block or district level will come and see the sub-project being managed and then
more money will be sanctioned. The Gram Sabha would have to be informed of
the sub-project and its management, all through the process also.
The process of this scheme has to implemented and managed by the people
themselves. The final say will be that of the Gram Sabha and the CIG will have to
be working with the Panchayat. The returns will also have to be managed so that
they raise the income of the CIG members as well as feed back into the sub-
project initiated.
This point was made by the government functionary.
Some people responded by saying that they will be able to manage the sub-
project.
Livelihood options like rearing goats or pigs, minor irrigation programmes like
digging of wells, procurement of pumps, and construction of tanks (which can be
used for pisciculture also) were demanded and suggested by the people.
These demands and suggestions were made by the people.
92



v  The government response to the same was that such projects could be taken up by
the members of the CIGs by pooling in their resources and using the project
money. Some details of these livelihoods were discussed.
-' Proforma currently being used for collection of baseline data (see Appendix 4c)
was explained to Mr.Warren. All the data collected by the PFTs during this
exercise will be analysed at district and state level. This data will help in framing,
monitoring and learning indicators.
