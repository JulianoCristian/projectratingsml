environmental assessment for the\n            Chhattisgarh District Rural Poverty Project comprises both\n            the environmental management framework, and the report on\n            public consultations, and examines how the project might\n            affect human resource, and stocks of natural resources, to\n            then identify mitigation measures that minimize the negative\n            environmental impacts of the project. Through a screening\n            process, four categories of subprojects will be identified,\n            suggesting the appropriate environmental mitigation.\n            Overall, mitigation stipulates the following: to control\n            soil erosion, protective barriers will be installed,\n            including gravel exposure, while laboratory tests will be\n            conducted to identify the presence of toxic chemicals, to\n            prevent soil pollution; groundwater depletion will be\n            controlled through the installation of bore wells, allowing\n            the measurement of water levels, and, laboratory analysis\n            will be conducted to prevent water pollution, and control\n            bacteria that may affect health, while water logging will be\n            surveyed; deforestation, and loss of biodiversity,\n            particularly medicinal plants, will be surveyed, in order to\n            be re-planted following project implementation. Construction\n            designs will determine adequate spillways, and downstream\n            slopes to prevent soil erosion, as well as dam safety\n            measures, which will be supervised by qualified engineers."}, "docdt": "2003-01-13T00:00:00Z"}
