    address these within the framework of the project. It\n            presents an overview of tribal communities in the area, the\n            legal and policy framework regarding tribal issues in\n            Chhattisgarh, and the major problems, and concerns tribal\n            people face in securing access to revenue land, and to\n            forests. Fundamental strategies stipulate: fair\n            participation, and representation at all levels of the\n            project, with a view to influence its decisions, and\n            outcomes for the tribal constituents; ensured protection of\n            social, economic, and cultural interest of tribal\n            communities in project interventions, among both the tribal,\n            and the non-tribal groups; overcome structural constraints\n            to poverty, and deprivation among tribal people, through\n            direct socioeconomic interventions, as well as induced\n            actions under other available public resources, and legal\n            provisions of the Government; optimize community\n            productivity, and that of privately held land, forest, and\n            livestock resources among tribal people, with a view to\n            primarily ensure food security, and generate sustainable\n            surplus; enhance options for labor, and for improved returns\n            from labor, as a growing basis for livelihood activity for\n            largest number of tribal families in the region; and,\n            rigorous capacity building of tribal people at the\n            village-level organizations, and at its leadership level, to\n            be able to plan, prioritize, and place appropriate demands\n            on project services, and resources."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
