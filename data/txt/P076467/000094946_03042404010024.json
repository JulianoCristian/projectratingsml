especially women\n            and tribals, to meet their own social and economic\n            development objectives. To achive this, the project creates\n            infrastructure and income opportunities for the rural poor;\n            empowers active groups of disadavanteged people; and\n            supports village governments in becoming more responsive and\n            effective in assisting them. There are two main project\n            components. Component 1 focuses on six main activities: 1)\n            human resource development for project stakeholders to build\n            skills and change behavior through orientation, reward, and\n            performance appraisal, and supply-driven and demand-driven\n            training; 2) strengthening of \"panchayats\" to\n            develop training programs; 3) formation and strengthening of\n            organizations to recruit and build the capacity of\n            nongovernmental organizations and project facilitation\n            teams; 4) communication and information to ensure that the\n            project and its rules are disseminated to all target\n            beneficiaries appropriately; 5) monitoring and learning and\n            special studies to support information gathering; and 6)\n            project administration. Component 2 comprises community\n            investments, including matching grants for community\n            invrstments, matching grants for \"panchayat plans,\n            village funds that are entirely financed by community\n            contributions and that finance operation and maintenance of\n            village infrastructure, and innovation funds."}, "docdt": "2003-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
