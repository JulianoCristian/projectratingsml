The groundwork will\n            also be laid for eventually extending SRDP management and\n            financial control to all rubber-producing provinces.  To\n            increase rubber production, the proposed project will\n            establish about 76,000 ha of rubber, provide planting\n            materials for an additional 19,500 ha to be established by\n            partially-assisted farmers, and maintain about 57,000 ha of\n            previously established rubber.  To promote institution\n            building, the project will emphasize manpower training and\n            help develop the institutional and financial arrangements\n            required for successful PMU rubber establishment."}, "docdt": "1985-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
