The loan was disbursed in two tranches, to\n            finance general imports of goods to meet part of external\n            financing requirements at a time when foreign resources had\n            been drained by the needs of a second phase debt, and debt\n            service reduction operation and when an investment recovery\n            was anticipated. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the Department of Finance (DOF) suggested that the Bank look\n            into the creation of greater flexibility on disbursement ;\n            (ii) the government also suggested that the Bank reconsider\n            its audit requirements for adjustment loans; and (iii) the\n            Government also noted that this program would have been more\n            efficient if it had been a single tranche."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
