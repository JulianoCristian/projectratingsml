The program\n            addresses those areas which are considered essential for\n            integrating all regions of the Philippine economy with the\n            rest of the world. These include: (a) macroeconomic\n            management through improvement of Central Bank finances and\n            appropriate energy pricing policies; (b) promotion of\n            investment through implementation of a new foreign\n            investment act, privatization and encouragement of private\n            participation in infrastructure projects; (c)\n            rationalization of the tariff regime and removal of\n            quantitative restrictions on imports; (d) introduction of\n            greater competition into land and sea transport; and (e)\n            removal of restrictions on foreign exchange transactions on\n            both the current and capital accounts.
