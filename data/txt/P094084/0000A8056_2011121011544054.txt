                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate and disseminate improved technologies in the
                         participating countries' top priority areas, as identified by CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's
                         consumers, particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP. Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of
                         the improved technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and
                         universities (in adhering to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that
                         is directly supported by the program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The mission confirmed that overall WAAPP-1A is continuing satisfactorily to progress towards achieving its development objectives: (i) target PDO indicators for 2011 are likely to be
                         met - the project activities have reached 85000 beneficiaries out of 80000 targeted at end of year 4 and 275000 at the end of the project; the centers of specialization have released
                         17 technologies all of which are showing potential improvement in yields/performances ranging from 20% to 40% , around 22000 ha are being covered by improved technologies

                         disseminated by the project (ii) regional integration activities are taking off - researchers exchange program involved around 21 persons and several technologies have crossed the
                         borders and are being tested and demonstrated in the non-originated countries; iii) Each country has achieved the triggers for phase two as specified in the PAD - All three countries
                         have ratified the common regulations for the registration of genetic materials and pesticides adopted at ECOWAS level and have established/strengthened national registration
                         systems for planting materials and pesticides which are functioning quite well (in Mali where the registration committee is still weak); the three National Centers of Specialization
                         (NCOS) have been established and are operating satisfactorily and each National Center of Specialization (NCOS) has involved several researchers from other participating
                         countries under the visiting scientists program and; iii) Competitive research grant schemes are satisfactorily operating in the three countries- About

                         The overall project disbursement rate had reached 50% in June as targeted. It was around 60% end of October and is likely to reach 75% to 80% in December 2011.

                         Senegal. The first technology being rapidly disseminated through WAAPP is the composite Cereal/wheat flour bread (with 15% local cereals. Dissemination started in Senegal with
                         the training of 30 bakeries. Successful results are being scaled up to 200 bakeries. The new bread technology reduces the cost of the product by at least 30%. Based results
                         achieved in Senegal dissemination of the technology started in Mali with composite Wheat/cereal flour and in Ghana with composite cassava/Wheat flour (20% cassava flour). In
                         Ghana the Food crop institute is conducting a dissemination program on three districts where 60 bakers are being trained and supported to adopt the technology. The Senegal team
                         successfully addressed key issues including staffing, improvement of the M&E system, better planning and focus on result. The joint mission therefore considered that the rating of
                         Senegal WAAPP can be upgraded from MS to S.

                         Ghana- 4 improved varieties of cassava with the potential to increase productivity by 30 to 40% have been released in Ghana are currently being disseminated to farmers by
                         extension services and IFAD funded Roots and Tuber projects. Seedlings have been distributed to farmers in 10 districts for seed multiplication in 2010 and an action plan to scale up
                         dissemination is underway. In addition two new varieties of cocoyam and 1 variety of sweet potatoes are being processed for released by the end of this year. A comprehensive
                         strategy for scaling up on-farm demonstration activities and seed multiplication has been implemented by the national extension services in the areas where the root and tuber
                         projects from IFAD RTIMP and CAVA are not operating, the construction of the Biotechnology Laboratory is progressing satisfactorily, the M&E system has been significantly
                         improved and should led to a better tracking of results. About 75% of the recommendations of the last supervision mission were implemented and the disbursement level was about
                         60% in September. The supervision mission evaluates that the overall progress towards the achievement of the PDO is satisfactory (S) and the implementation of the project is also
                         satisfactory (S). However, efforts towards tracking and document results from other national partners involved in scaling-up the dissemination of developed improved technologies
                         and regional networking need to be further strengthened.

                         Mali- 2 improved varieties of nerica rice and 2 hybrids rice varieties with yield potential of 8 to 10 tons per ha have been developed in Mali. Seed multiplication and dissemination of
                         these nerica varieties to farmers are underway. Farmers using these varieties have obtained an average yield of 9 ton per ha. An action plan to scale up diss emination next cropping
                         season has been prepared by the country. The project progress towards achieving its objectives is satisfactory: overall, all PDO targets for 2011 have been achieved and 3 second
                         phase triggers out of 4 are already fulfilled. The current spending level is 72% and regional cooperation activities have been strengthened through mutual researcher exchange visits

                         and germplasm/seed exchange with other WAAPP countries as well as stronger synergies with AfricaRice. The main challenge is to speed the scaling-up adoption of the released
                         technologies. The mission judged progress of implementation satisfactory.

                         Overall CORAF has improved its performance, especially by procuring studies and organizing regional workshops which yielded harmonized visions, development of several common
                         strategies and priority action plans at national and regional levels. An important workshop organized in July allowed for promoting researcher mobility and technology sharing. Priority
                         R&D thematic areas were determined and a first call for proposals of the regional competitive fund was launched in August through the ILWAC trust fund on climate change. Around
                         30 multi-country research proposals were received and are being reviewed. The disbursement level of funds allocated to CORAF/WECARD was about 70% at the end of September
                         2011. Overall the mission considered that the implementation of the regional coordination by CORAF remains satisfactory.
