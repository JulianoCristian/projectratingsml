                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate and disseminate improved technologies in the participating
                         countries' top priority areas, as identified by CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's consumers,
                         particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP. Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved
                         technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and universities (in adhering
                         to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the
                         program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of end of January 2012, the project has made a tremendous progress toward meeting its development objectives: (i) project beneficiaries is at 65 percent (180,000 beneficiaries
                         out of 275,000 targeted at the end of the project; (ii) a total of 17 technologies have been released by the project in all three countries and are being tested for dissemination from the
                         originating country to the others; iii) around 100,000 ha are under new technologies. Seed multiplication activities have been scaled up under irrigation during this period which will

                         allow to get enough seeds to achieve the project targets during the next cropping season. In addition the recent extension of project closing date to the end of 2012 and the
                         intensification of project activities during the next raining season are two factors which will help achieve the end project target.

                          Each country has achieved the triggers for phase two as specified in the PAD: (i) all three countries have ratified the common regulations for the registration of genetic materials and
                         pesticides adopted at ECOWAS level and have established/strengthened national registration systems for planting materials and pesticides which are functioning quite well; (ii) the
                         three National Centers of Specialization (NCOS) have been established and are operating satisfactorily and each National Center of Specialization (NCOS) has involved several
                         researchers from other participating countries under the visiting scientists program ; and (iii) competitive research grant schemes are satisfactorily operating in the three countries-

                         The overall project disbursement rate had reached 75% as as of end January 2012.

                         The second phase of the Program preparation is on schedule and it is likely that WAAPP 2A will be submitted for approval to the Board in May 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is performing well and satisfactorily progressing towards achieving its targets and development objective. The number of beneficiaries has increased to 180,000 as of end
                         January 2012. With the extension of project closing date by 6 months, the increased of seed availability due to the seed multiplication program under irrigation in the dry season, it is
                         likely that the PDO indicators will be met at the end of the project. The preparation of the second phase is on track and it is likely that it will be approved by the Board in May 2010.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
