                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate and disseminate improved technologies in the participating
                         countries' top priority areas, as identified by CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's consumers,
                         particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP. Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved
                         technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and universities (in adhering
                         to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the
                         program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Phase 1 for Senegal and Ghana closed in December 31, 2012. But the project still continue to be implemented in Mali following the extension of the closing date to June 30,2013.

                         All three countries have achieved various and important results including: i) Institutional achievements- each country has developed a functional National Center of Specialization

                         (NCoS) with strengthened capacities, opened to other participating countries; each country has also a functional competitive agricultural research grant scheme with strengthened
                         governing bodies; CORAF has acquired a strong capacity in coordinating regional activities, in project preparation and supervision and is currently recognized by all stakeholders for
                         its increased efficiency; ii) achievement of PDO indicators- Aggregated data of the three countries indicates that the project reached about 254000 beneficiaries out of 275000
                         targeted including 25% women in Mali and Senegal and 38% women in Ghana; 37 technologies have been developed/released in the NCoS, each of them providing a potential
                         increase of yield ranging from 20% to 60%; 13 of these technologies have crossed the boarders and are under adaptation/ dissemination in the sub-region; about 90000 ha are
                         covered with improved technologies and about 127000 producers/processors equivalent to around 50% of beneficiaries have adopted the improved technologies disseminated by the
                         project, mainly the improved varieties. The impact evaluation underway will provide more details on the impact of the project on revenues and livelihood; iii) achievement in the
                         domain of regional integration- the exchange of researcher and exchange of technologies which started slowly have been intensified due to the tools and mechanisms developed by
                         the project including the innovation market scheme.

                         An impact evaluation is being conducted by IFPRI. A survey is underway. In addition CORAF and each country are processing the preparation of their implementation completion
                         reports.

                         Other output and outcome of the project:

                         1- Efficacity/efficiency- WAAPP has demonstrated its strong capacity to achieve its triggers and PDO indicators through the development of a series of tools/ mechanisms: i) the
                         regular regional workshops and the bi-annual wrap up meetings as well as the public rating process after each implementation support mission led to a benchmarking and emulation
                         between countries- This was key to bridge the performance gap among countries and focus project staff on getting results on the ground; ii) the strategy to develop NCoS have
                         rationalized the use of human and financial resources for the generation and technology in the sub region and demonstrated its capacity to boost regional integration. Around 37
                         technologies have been generated and are available for the benefit of all participating countries; iii) the use of CARGs allowed the broadening of all competencies involved in the
                         research, dissemination and extension areas. This has brought value chain stakeholders together, and facilitated pooling of efforts and competencies in addressing technology
                         challenges and taking advantage of market opportunities (e.g. composite flour in Senegal and Ghana, rice seeder in Mali, solar dryer in Ghana...); iii) the introduction of E-extension
                         through a pilot in Ghana to be scaled up in all countries and the up scaling of the Innovation platform are key elements which are boosting the technology transfer mechanism and
                         extension service providers capacities which were weakened after the end of the Training & Visit system promoted by the Bank during the 90's.

                         2- Regional integration- At the beginning of the project each country had the tendency to work in its boundaries. But after the mid-term review the project developed several
                         mechanisms and tools which strengthened the regional integration aspects including: i) the revision of the result framework with the introduction of specific indicators to measure the
                         regionality of the program; ii) implementation of the research exchange program which further became the mobility of stakeholder program - which resulted in a high increase in the
                         number of study tours and visiting scientists and therefore exchange of knowledge and best practices and iii) a workshop on exchange of technology which resulted in the
                         development of a technology market place and 17 technologies being adapted/disseminated in the sub-region. In addition CORAF - which had limited capacities at the start up of the

                         project in 2007- has grown, matured and recognized as a strong and high performing institution by all development partners and its key role in boosting regional integration by
                         participating countries.

                         3- Relevance- WAAPP is a unique program which is supporting the implementation of CAADAP pillar 4 at the sub regional level. Its PDO is relevant for Africa as the technologies
                         developed have all the potential to increase yields by 20% to 60 % and the project developed tools to speed the adoption at the sub regional level. Experience developed matured
                         other the course of the implementation of the project and served as best practices in other regions in Africa.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is moving smoothly towards its closing for Senegal and Ghana. An extension of closing date is being processed for Mali where the project was suspended for almost 6
                         months due to the political situation. The project has achieved a lot of results. An impact evaluation is being conducted by IFPRI to document project results and immediate impact.
