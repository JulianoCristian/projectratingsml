                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate and disseminate improved technologies in the participating
                         countries' top priority areas, as identified by CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's consumers,
                         particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP. Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved
                         technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and universities (in adhering
                         to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the
                         program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is still progressing satisfactorily toward meeting its development objectives despite the political situation in Mali where the Bank portfolio has been suspended. Results
                         reported in the last ISR have not changed significantly since this was the end of season report. With the current beginning of cropping season, project activities are going to be scaled
                         up. So far the results achieved are as follows: (i) project beneficiaries have reached 65 percent of target (180,000 beneficiaries out of 275,000 targeted at the end of the project; (ii) a

                         total of 17 technologies released by the project are under dissemination in the originated countries and several of these technologies have already crossed the borders to be tested
                         for adaptation and dissemination from the originating country to the others; iii) all these technologies are showing a potential increase of yield over the control ranging from 20 to
                         40%; iv) around 100,000 ha are under new technologies.

                         Following the elaborate seed multiplication and dissemination plans prepared by each of the countries where project teams are more result focused, it is highly likely that the project
                         will reach at least 80% of its PDO targets. The main risk to achieve the 100% target will be the unstable political situation in Mali. In addition the reduced availability of improved
                         seeds to farmers as a result of the 2011 drought that hit the Sahelian countries could have an effect on achievement of target.

                         Ghana. Project disbursement has improved significantly and more likely to hit 88% by end of June when all outstanding commitments are expected to have been processed. The
                         major ticket item is the construction and furnishing of a biotech laboratory at the National Center of Specialization which is planned for completion by end of June. The project has
                         made significant progress in implementation and is more likely to achieve its development objectives by the end of the calendar year. Under component 1, the country has
                         harmonized its regulations with ECOWAS level regulations with the passage of plant, pesticide and fertilizer Acts. The country has develop an elaborate seed multiplication and
                         technology dissemination plans to enhance adoption. Prominent measures include the deployment of e-extension and establishment of innovation platforms underway. Under
                         components 2&3 the national Center of specialization and the CARGS are fully operational and have being churning out results such as the release of improved technologies
                         (including new crop varieties, good agricultural practices, postharvest handling and processing, etc). The M&E system however have been weakened with the resignation of the PCU
                         M&E officer who has been just replaced.

                         Senegal: Disbursement has reached 82% as of June 1st 2012 and is likely to reach 100% before the end December 2012. The last investment activities related to the construction of
                         the training center which started in April after a long procurement process are on track and should be completed before the end of the year. The project is likely to achieve its PDO
                         targets with the smooth implementation of the activities planned for the current agricultural season. Under component 1: i) Senegal is satisfactorily implementing ECOWAS common
                         regulations on seeds and pesticides; ii) the country is also implementing an ambitious seed multiplication plan which will led to a higher availability of improved seeds to farmers next
                         year. However, the country needs to prepare and adopt a sustainable seed multiplication policy; iii) there is a lot of progress in the implementation of the communication plan with the
                         Use of FIDAFRIQUE channel, the upgrading of the WAAPP website and the contracting of AFRAO, a specialized communication institution. Under component 2 and 3, the NCOs
                         and the CARGS are continuing to operate satisfactorily and will likely generate additional technologies before the end of the year. A dissemination action plan for the improved
                         technologies is under implementation to boost achievement of PDO.

                         Mali had made significant progress towards achievement of end of project targets. Project disbursement current stands at 82%. However, project implementation in that country has
                         stalled since March 2012 due to the political instability. No mission was fielded to Mali as results of the suspension of Bank activities in that country following the coup d’état. Mali has
                         already achieved significant results in implementing the project; i) the country has complied with the ECOWAS common regulations which are being widely disseminated; ii) it
                         developed a communication plan which implementation started before the coup d’etat; iii) the NCoS and the CARGS are fully functional and generated several technologies being

                         disseminated in Mali and in the sub region including new high yielding improved varieties of rice, the rice seeder adapted from Philippines which increases yield by 30% compared to
                         the nursery system. But the suspension of Bank activities and the lack of resources for this main agricultural season will surely impact the full achievement of end of project PDO
                         targets.

                         CORAF capacity to coordinate the project and to provide on demand support to implementation in the countries continue to improve. Countries are requesting more and more
                         involvement of CORAF in technical support including for the identification of suitable experts, for facilitating connection with CGIAR centers and advanced research centers and also
                         direct support from CORAF own experts. With the additional financing to CORAF provided by WAAPP-1B and 1C countries and a grant provided to WAAPP by Netherlands, CORAF
                         regional CARGS launched two calls for proposals in August and September 2011. The selection process is at the end and it is likely that the awarded teams will start implementation
                         by mid-July.

                         M&E- The project M&E has improved since the last SPN mission. Progress include: i) The appointment of new M&E officers to replace the retired Mali M&E specialist and the
                         dismissed Ghana M&E specialist; ii) the set up in each country of an M&E team comprising the PCU, the CARGs, the NCOS and the Ministry of Agriculture (Extension) M&E officers

                         the timetable with the countries, and the survey is about to start in June.

                         Preparation of the second phase of the project is on track. The Board approved the financing for Senegal and Ghana on May 22. Mali was removed after negotiations due to the

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project continue to perform well and is likely to achieve at least 80% of its targets and development objectives. The major issue is the suspension of Bank portfolio in Mali due to
                         the political situation in the country.
