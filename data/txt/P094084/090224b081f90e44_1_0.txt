                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate and disseminate improved technologies in the participating
                         countries' top priority areas, as identified by CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's consumers,
                         particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP. Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved
                         technology, are the primary beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension agencies and universities (in adhering
                         to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the
                         program.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been definitely closed in June 2013 following the extension of closing date for Mali. Completion Report (ICR) for WAAPP-1A has been prepared confirming the overall
                         satisfactory rating of the project, which has also received the 2013 AFR VPU Award for its achievement in the generation and adoption of cross-country agricultural innovations. The
                         draft ICRs have been issued by each country and by the Bank following an impact evaluation conducted with the support of IFPRI. A series of stakeholder meeting are scheduled in

                         September 2013 in each of the countries to discuss the draft ICR. The Bank ICR review meeting is scheduled in October 2013.

                         The project has yielding a lot of results: i) elaboration of regional strategies – The project elaborated in a participatory manner several regional strategies that are being implemented
                         by each country including communication, gender, exchange of researchers strategies; ii) improvement of the enabling environment for technology sharing- The project facilitated
                         the adoption of ECOWAS common regulations on seed and pesticides; dissemination and implementation are underway in each country; iii) creation of a regional technology space-
                         more than 120 research sub projects responding to clients demands have been financed which are being implemented across the countries; 13 new technologies have been released
                         so far and made available to all countries; iii) capacity building and pooling of competencies: Under the research exchange program countries have either sent or are hosting
                         several researchers from other participating countries facilitating knowledge sharing and capacity building.

                         All three countries have achieved various and important results including: i) Institutional achievements- each country has developed a functional National Center of Specialization
                         (NCoS) with strengthened capacities, opened to other participating countries; each country has also a functional competitive agricultural research grant scheme with strengthened
                         governing bodies; CORAF has acquired a strong capacity in coordinating regional activities, in project preparation and supervision and is currently recognized by all stakeholders for
                         its increased efficiency; ii) achievement of PDO indicators- Aggregated data of the three countries indicates that the project reached about 297000 beneficiaries out of 275000
                         targeted including 25% women in Mali and Senegal and 38% women in Ghana; 37 technologies have been developed/released in the NCoS, each of them providing a potential
                         increase of yield ranging from 20% to 60%; 13 of these technologies have crossed the boarders and are under adaptation/ dissemination in the sub-region; about 135000 ha are
                         covered with improved technologies and about 127000 producers/processors equivalent to around 50% of beneficiaries have adopted the improved technologies disseminated by the
                         project, mainly the improved varieties. The impact evaluation underway will provide more details on the impact of the project on revenues and livelihood; iii) achievement in the
                         domain of regional integration- the exchange of researcher and exchange of technologies which started slowly have been intensified due to the tools and mechanisms developed by
                         the project including the innovation market scheme.

                         Other output and outcome of the project:

                         1- Efficacity/efficiency- WAAPP has demonstrated its strong capacity to achieve its triggers and PDO indicators through the development of a series of tools/ mechanisms: i) the
                         regular regional workshops and the bi-annual wrap up meetings as well as the public rating process after each implementation support mission led to a benchmarking and emulation
                         between countries- This was key to bridge the performance gap among countries and focus project staff on getting results on the ground; ii) the strategy to develop NCoS have
                         rationalized the use of human and financial resources for the generation and technology in the sub region and demonstrated its capacity to boost regional integration. Around 37
                         technologies have been generated and are available for the benefit of all participating countries; iii) the use of CARGs allowed the broadening of all competencies involved in the
                         research, dissemination and extension areas. This has brought value chain stakeholders together, and facilitated pooling of efforts and competencies in addressing technology
                         challenges and taking advantage of market opportunities (e.g. composite flour in Senegal and Ghana, rice seeder in Mali, solar dryer in Ghana...); iii) the introduction of E-extension
                         through a pilot in Ghana to be scaled up in all countries and the up scaling of the Innovation platform are key elements which are boosting the technology transfer mechanism and

                         extension service providers capacities which were weakened after the end of the Training & Visit system promoted by the Bank during the 90's.

                         2- Regional integration- At the beginning of the project each country had the tendency to work in its boundaries. But after the mid-term review the project developed several
                         mechanisms and tools which strengthened the regional integration aspects including: i) the revision of the result framework with the introduction of specific indicators to measure the
                         regionality of the program; ii) implementation of the research exchange program which further became the mobility of stakeholder program - which resulted in a high increase in the
                         number of study tours and visiting scientists and therefore exchange of knowledge and best practices and iii) a workshop on exchange of technology which resulted in the
                         development of a technology market place and 17 technologies being adapted/disseminated in the sub-region. In addition CORAF - which had limited capacities at the start up of the
                         project in 2007- has grown, matured and recognized as a strong and high performing institution by all development partners and its key role in boosting regional integration by
                         participating countries. WAAPP is fast tracking regional integration efforts in West Africa breaking the Anglophone francophone barrier, is becoming the rallying point for the scientific
                         community to collectively develop and share scientific knowledge for development and as a means of accelerating the adoption of technologies in the sub region. Base on the initial
                         results and the potential to fast track agricultural development, WAAPP is being replicated in East Africa (EAPP), Southern Africa (SAAPP) and shortly in the Central Africa Region
                         (request has been sent to the Bank).

                         3- Relevance- WAAPP is a unique program which is supporting the implementation of CAADAP pillar 4 at the sub regional level. Its PDO is relevant for Africa as the technologies
                         developed have all the potential to increase yields by 20% to 60 % and the project developed tools to speed the adoption at the sub regional level. Experience developed matured
                         other the course of the implementation of the project and served as best practices in other regions in Africa.

                         4- Innovative preparation process- innovative, experiential and participatory process- WAAPP-1A took over two years to prepare, but based on lessons learned, WAAPP-1B and 1C
                         were prepared in record time ( 6 to 8 months each) with strong participation and ownership of country teams; Lessons learned from earlier series were systematically incorporated in
                         the design of the later series. Back up support from earlier series country teams were essential to speed preparation in weaker countries.

                         5- Innovative supervision arrangements- allows strong team work within the Bank- the preparation and implementation support set-up is a team-up between a regional TTL and
                         country based TTLs, ensuring strong ownership of the project by the CMU, smooth project implementation; Regular interactions at country and regional levels between Bank and
                         project management teams have created enormous team spirit, enthusiasm, commitment to achieve common goal and get quick results. This account for the satisfactory rating of the
                         project. Bi-annual supervision missions ending with regional wrap up meetings to discuss implementation progress and joint ratings of countries performance create benchmark for
                         countries to assess each other and bring about competition among countries to improve performance.

                         6- Client focus and responsiveness- The project has developed specific tools to ensure client responsiveness of the project: i) the research extension liaison committees have been
                         set up to ensure that research and extension respond adequately to producers and agribusinesses constraints; ii) the set up/strengthening of the competitive research grant schemes
                         at country and regional level ensures that competencies (National research institutes, Universities, NGOs, etc…) are pooled to deal with specific constraints identified by
                         beneficiaries; iii) the introduction of Innovation Platforms scheme has facilitated interaction between producers and other relevant stakeholders to scale up adoption; iv the
                         preparation of a regional gender strategy and national gender action p lans have made project staff gender sensitive and helped mainstream gender issues into project activities.

                         7- Leveraging partner ship- WAAPP is the first mobilizing program for the implementation of ECOWAP. It contributed to the preparation of National Investment plans under the
                         CAADAP process in West Africa. It has attracted funding from several donors including Spain, Japan, Netherland, AGRA, CIDA, FAO as well as several private sector operatives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been definitely closed in June 2013 following the extension of closing date for Mali. Completion Report (ICR) for WAAPP-1A has been prepared confirming the overall
                         satisfactory rating of the project, which has also received the 2013 AFR VPU Award for its achievement in the generation and adoption of cross-country agricultural innovations. The
                         draft ICRs have been issued by each country and by the Bank following an impact evaluation conducted with the support of IFPRI. A series of stakeholder meeting are scheduled in
                         September 2013 in each of the countries to discuss the draft ICR.
