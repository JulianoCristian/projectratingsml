7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The development objective of the project (first phase of the support program to the WAAPP) is to generate
and disseminate improved technologies in the participating countries' top priority areas, as identified by
CORAF. These include roots and tubers in Ghana; rice in Mali; and cereals in Senegal. The region's
consumers, particularly those affected by extreme poverty, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the WAAPP.
Agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as users of the improved technology, are the primary
beneficiaries of the program. These are also the key participants, along with researchers, extension
agencies and universities (in adhering to the agricultural knowledge information system (AKIS) conceptual
framework), in the generation and dissemination of technology that is directly supported by the program.
