                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY
1.    This restructuring is for a second extension of the closing date of the IDA credit
4287-ML (WAAPP – 1A Mali) and the reallocation of credit proceeds.
2.      Following the political unrest of March 2012, the Bank suspended its operations
in Mali for about 6 months. Since then there has been a partial lifting of the suspension as
of September 12, 2012, resulting in resumption of very limited emergency activities.
These mainly consisted of the diffusion of technologies, seed production, and conducting
field demonstrations.
3.      The purpose of this second extension is to enable the Project make up for the
delays and complete the remaining activities and also assure the smooth and
uninterrupted transition to the second phase of the Program.
4.     The proposed changes consist of: (i) extending the closing date from December
31, 2012 to June 30, 2013; and (ii) do a reallocation of credit proceeds.
B. PROJECT STATUS
5.      Despite the 6-months delays due to the March 2012 political unrest, the Project is
progressing satisfactorily towards achievement of its PDO. During the recently concluded
supervision mission of October 2012, 1 it was possible to see that 4 out of the 5 PDO
level indicators and all 3 triggers for the 2nd phase have already been met. With respect to
the 5th PDO level indicator, the number of women beneficiary is 26 percent versus the
40% target.
C. PROPOSED CHANGES
         Financing
               o Reallocations
6.      The purpose of the proposed reallocation is to adjust some categories in order to
meet the respective Governments’ ongoing and planned commitments focusing on
priority actions as set in their revised work plan. The changes requested will not affect the
PDO and with the reallocation the objectives pursued through activities under the various
categories will be fully achieved.
7.    The project has disbursed, as of December 3, 2012, about 93.8 percent of the total
amount. The proposed reallocation of the credits proceeds is shown in Annex 1.

      Closing date
8.      The credit of US$15 million of the project to Mali (WAAPP-1A Mali) was
approved by the Board on March 2, 2007, with an original closing date of June 30, 2012
and a revised closing date of December 31, 2012 following a first request for 6-months
extension of the closing date. The recipient has sent a letter dated November 26, 2012 to
the Bank for a second extension of the credit by 6-months, with a new proposed closing
date of June 30, 2013. This will enable the recipient not only to catch up on the delay due
to the suspension of Bank intervention and thus complete the remaining activities, but
also to assure the smooth and uninterrupted transition to the second phase of the Program.
