She spent many of\n            those years working under the health care system in the\n            former Yugoslavia. Now she works at a primary care center in\n            Podgorica, Montenegro, under an entirely new kind of system.\n            She says that reform is the best thing that could have\n            happened to health care in Montenegro. Looking back at the\n            days when the government introduced the new health care\n            system, she says, \u2018at first it seemed like a huge amount of\n            work, and it was, since it is not easy to take\n            responsibility for 2000 people. That's the average\n            number of patients that a chosen doctor has.\u2019 But now, she\n            says, even though there are many of them, she alone is\n            responsible for organizing her patients' care, and that\n            makes all the difference. The new system also allows doctors\n            more control over their patients' medicines. Because\n            patients generally see only one doctor, they can't go\n            from office to office asking for more of the same\n            medications. And having one doctor in charge means that that\n            doctor can monitor medicine intake, and make sure a patient\n            doesn't take too much of any one prescription. Under\n            the old system, Montenegro lacked a national drugs policy,\n            and lax record-keeping meant that keeping track of medicines\n            and dosing was often difficult, if not impossible."}, "docdt": "2012-07-17T04:57:05Z"}
