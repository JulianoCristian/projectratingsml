                         The project is making continuous progress towards achieving its Project Development Objective, however, with 12 months remaining for implementation, it is critical that

                         least 82 percent. Most project activities have now started or are making progress: The Institute of Public Health (IPH) has begun preparatory work on developing the basic benefit
                         package, the other hospital reform working groups (Diagnosis Related Groups, Quality and Clinical Guidelines, Public Private Partnership, Drugs Agency, Public Relations) have all
                         been working towards their deliverables, cancer prevention programs have been developed for colorectal and cervical cancer, the final 11th round of the chosen doctor retraining
