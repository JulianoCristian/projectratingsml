Health Care System Improvement Project for Montenegro\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            need for quick project preparation must be balanced with the\n            quality of project at entry. The project was prepared quite\n            rapidly, with only nine months from concept review to Board\n            approval. Additionally, the country situation at preparation\n            stage was still fluid, coming out of a turbulent phase of\n            its history. Agreed institutional arrangements, government\n            commitment and a viable single agency are basic\n            prerequisites for a successful project implementation. Both\n            the Bank and the government need to involve proper expertise\n            in different areas, to ensure a smooth implementation of\n            project activities. Lack of a proper Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) design raises questions on the overall\n            quality of project design. Close coordination with other\n            development partners is very important. Health sector\n            reforms are long-term and quite complex."}, "docdt": "2013-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
