                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Client and the Bank have been closely following an Action Plan developed during the May implementation support mission to help speed up implementation. Since April 2011,
                         the Disbursement Rate has increased from 14.3% to 21.3%. More importantly, commitments have increased from 28% to 44%. While positive progress has been made, urgency is
                         still needed since only 16 months remain for project implementation. The key activities in the process of being contracted are: i) Development of information system components of
                         the Drugs Agency, the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Public Health (13% of loan funds), and ii) hospital information system hardware and primary health care (PHC) medical
                         equipment (20%). Due to the lengthy tender processes, particularly for information systems, these activities may not be committed until the end of the calendar year. Out of the eight

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         - During the May implementation support mission, an Action Plan was discussed and agreed upon between the counterparts and the Bank team. There has been weekly or bi-weekly
                         follow-up of the Action Plan since then.
                         - The environmental assessment of the Bijelo Polje PHC facility was satisfactory, and the Client, Contractor, and Supervising Firm are to be commended for their compliance with
                         environmental mitigation and protection measures. The Bank team recommends exploring simple treatment options of wastewater being discharged from the facility.
                         - The team plans to visit Montenegro in September to clarify assistance for hospital provider planning and HR planning.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
