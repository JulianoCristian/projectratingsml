ratings for the HIV/AIDS, Malaria,\n            STD and Tuberculosis (HAMSET) Control Project of Eritrea\n            were as follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned included the following:\n            (1) HAMSET provides several important lessons regarding the\n            Bank's Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) projects. The\n            lessons are particularly important since HAMSET is one of\n            the first MAP projects that has closed and been immediately\n            followed by a second one. In addition, HAMSET design, with\n            its multi-disease approach, was different from most MAP\n            projects which focus only on HIV/AIDS. The lessons, varying\n            from stewardship of MAP projects to their sustainability,\n            have relevance beyond Eritrea to other countries. The\n            lessons learned included the following: (1) Project design\n            should be flexible and tailored for the country; (2)\n            Mobilizing communities and relevant sectors are keys; (3)\n            Effectively integrate activities of vertical disease\n            programs, reproductive health and support health systems;\n            (4) Clarify policy on the use of DDT as the environmental\n            aspect of Malaria control has been complicated by the mixed\n            messages over the use of DDT among international\n            organizations and governments; (5) Build local capacity for\n            planning and budgeting; (6) Procurement can be facilitated\n            by innovative thinking; (7) Give monitoring and evaluation\n            higher priority in design and prepare early for collection\n            of data for analysis of cost effectiveness; (8) Address the\n            discordance between knowledge, attitude and practice on\n            HAMSET diseases; (9) Address the challenges of\n            sustainability, starting with integration and community\n            ownership; (10) Address the shortage of human resources for\n            health; and (11) The report-based disbursement system (which\n            was adopted in the second half of the project) allowed more\n            predictable cash flow, more flexibility and facilitated\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "2006-10-06T00:00:00Z"}
