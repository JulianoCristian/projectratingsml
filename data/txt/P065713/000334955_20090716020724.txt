      IEGWBMission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence inevaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Bank's lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex: those that are
relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized).Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Health Project andthe
HIV/AIDS,Malaria, STDs and Tuberculosis (HAMSeT) Control Project. The HealthProject
(FY1998-2005), the first World Bank supported project inthe country's health sector, was
financed through IDA Credit No. 3023 inthe amount o f $18.3 million (SDR 13.4 million), a
grant fromNorway of $2.7 million (NOK25.0 million) and planned government contribution o f
$3.5 million. The credit was approved on December 16, 1997, became effective on May 28,
1998, and was 96 percent disbursed when it closed on December 31,2004, 18 months after the
original closing date. The HAMSeT Control Project (2001-2006) was financed through IDA
Credit No. 3444 inthe amount o f $40.0 million (SDR 31.4 million), with planned government
contributions of $10.0 million. The credit was approved on December 18,2000, became
effective on March 1,2001, and closed as plannedinMarch 2006. A follow-on project, the
HAMSeT I1Project financed by an IDA credit o f $24.0 million, i s currently being implemented.

This PPAR was prepared by an IEGteam consisting o f Gayle H.Martin(Senior Evaluator and
Task Manager) and assisted by Martha Ainsworth (HumanDevelopment Cluster Coordinator),
who visited Eritrea inJanuary/February 2008. The mission met with representatives from the
MinistryofHealth(MOH) and five other ministries, donors, non-governmental entities, faith-
based organizations as well as people with HIV/AIDS. The mission visited four of Eritrea's six
regions (zobas) and visited community-based HAMSeT sub-projects and health facilities
(including the two hospitals built under the Health Project). Other sources o f evidence consulted
include: (a) interviews with relevant World Bank staff, (b) World Bank project files, (c) project-
related reports, (d) economic and epidemiological data, studies, surveys and research, and (e)
primary analysis o f the community-managed sub-project data for the HAMSeT Control Project
(see Annex E).

This PPAR will contribute to a forthcoming evaluationby IEGo fthe World Bank's support to
health, nutrition and population outcomes. As such, more material has beenpresented inthis
"enhanced" PPAR than is the IEGstandard.

The IEGteam gratefully acknowledges all those who made time for interviews and provided        '
documents and information. Following standard IEGreview procedures, copies o f the draft
PPAR were sent to the relevant government officials and agencies for their review and feedback.
However, no comments were received.

Summary

This Project Performance Assessment Report assesses the development effectiveness oftwo
projects-the   Health Project and the HIV/AIDS, Malaria, STDs and Tuberculosis (HAMSeT)
Control Project-in     the context ofthe World Bank's overall support to Eritrea's healthsector
duringthe period 1997-2006, as well as other Bank-financed products such as economic and
sector work.

When Eritreajoined the Bank in 1995 the country was emerging from three decades o f war.
Eritrea is one o f the poorest countries inthe world with an estimated per capita GDP o f $200.
Throughout project implementationEritrea was either under conflict or simultaneously a post-
conflict and fragile state. Following strong growth performance inthe early 1 9 9 0 the~ ~
macroeconomic situation progressively worsened after border hostilities resumedin 1998. O f
the country's 3.24.9 millionpeople, two thirds live inpoverty. Healthexpenditureis low
(between $8 and $13 per capita) and highly donor dependent with external assistance accounting
for more than two thirds o f total public sector health spending. Furthermore, the health sector
faces serious human resources constraints. Over the past decade malaria, HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis have ranked among the top causes o f mortality and morbidity.

The objective o f the Health Project (FY1998-FY2005) was to improve the health status o f
Eritreans, and it mainly financed: (i) the construction o ftwo hospitals, (ii) refurbishmento f
                                                                              the
30 clinics, drugs and medical supplies, (iii) theNational Malaria Control Program, and (iv) the
establishment o f the National Blood Transfusion Service. The HAMSeT Control Project
(FY200 1-FY2006) objective was to reduce mortality and morbidity from the HAMSeT diseases.
The project mainly supported the HAMSeT disease control programs inthe Ministry o fHealth,
disease control efforts in selected non-health sectors, and community-based disease control
efforts. A follow-on project, the HAMSeT-I1Project, i s currently beingimplemented.

The Health Project had mixedresults. Project implementation coincided with significant
improvements inthe health indicators (e.g., infant and child mortality). Many o f these
improvements could be linked to project-financed outputs such as clinic refurbishmentand the
provision o f drugs and medical supplies. There were, however, other indicators that the project
sought to influence but was less successful (e.g., malnutrition). The hospital investment
expanded the sector's physical infrastructure-through     the construction o f the Barentu and
Mendefera Hospitals-but      the returns to the investment havenot yet beenfully realized because
the expanded capacity i s under-utilized. In2007, a year after their opening, the two hospitals
had among the lowest bed occupancy ratios inthe country.

Both projects financed malaria control activities and substantially contributed to the reduction in
malaria morbidity inexcess o fthe target o f "80 percent reduction" set by the Minister o f Health
in 1999. The interventions-prompt      diagnosis and treatment o f malaria cases, insecticidetreated
bed-net distribution and re-impregnation, indoor residual spraying, larvaciding and source
reduction-were     significantly associated with lower malaria incidence, even after controlling for
fluctuations inrainfall. Eritrea was the first country inAfrica to achieve the Abuja targets for
Roll Back Malaria. The MOH's evidence-based planning and performance monitoring i s best
practice inmalaria control. The Bank was the largest single source o f fundingto the malaria

                                                  xii


control program, although other important sources o f funding for malaria were: USAID and the
Italian Cooperation, and inrecent years, the Global Fundto fight AIDS, Malaria and
Tuberculosis.

Inthe area oftuberculosis control, the HAMSeTControl Projectfinancedtuberculosis drugs,
information dissemination, capacity building for the National Tuberculosis Control Program,
health worker training, procurement o f diagnostic microscopes and related medical supplies in
support o f the expansion o f the directly observed treatment-short course (DOTS) program.
Information dissemination had limited success, and in2005 a tenth o f women did not know any
tuberculosis symptoms, and knowledge o f the most distinguishingfeatures o f tuberculosis was
extremely low. Case detectionrates continued to leave room for improvement, but there was
greater success at expansion o f the DOTS program and treatment o f identified tuberculosis cases.
There has been a downward trend intuberculosis morbidity inrecent years largely thanks to the
zoba-level services. At the national level, there were staffing problems and lagging performance
o f the tuberculosis control program. It i s a missedopportunity that there has not been greater
learning, sharing and adoption o f practices betweenthe malaria and tuberculosis control
programs inthe areas o fplanning, monitoring and evaluation.

The HAMSeT Control Project financed a range o f HIV prevention activities including: extensive
awareness-raising among the general populationand among key risk groups, HIV/AIDSand life-
skills education inthe schools, blood safety and encouraging voluntary counseling and testing
among the general population as well as highrisk groups. Implementationwas through seven
ministriesincluding the defense force, non-governmental entities and community structures
through the Community-managed HAMSeT Response component. The extent o f coverage o f
risk groups (other than the military) was hard to ascertain, and information on behavior change
was limitedand particularly challenging to interpret inthe context o f a general population that
already had relatively low HIV risk. The almost universal coverage o f HIV prevention inthe
military was an important success given that nearly every young adult spends some time inthe
military (because o f the national conscriptionpolicy) and the fact that the demobilized military
was the most important source o f HIV risk at appraisal. Interventions targeting sex workers were
implementedinall major urbanareas. Despite limitedbehavioral data, the declining trendin
HIV prevalence among 15-24year olds as well as declining STI prevalence suggests important
successes inHIV prevention. The project was also successful at extending care and support for
people with HIV/AIDS,support to orphans and vulnerable children, and stigma reduction.

IEGrates the outcome of the HealthProject as moderately unsatisfactory. The objective to
improve the health status o f Eritreans was consistent with the post-conflict situation, and remains
relevant giventhe country's prioritization o f human development investments. The contribution
o fthe investmentsto the project objective i s constrained by under-utilization o fthe project
hospitals which accounted for about two thirds o f the total project costs. It is, however, possible
to make strong links between some of the other project investmentsand health outcomes, notably
inthe areao fmalariacontrol andimprovements inblood safety. Bank and borrower
performance are rated moderately satisfactory. There were weaknesses inquality-at-entry on the
Bank's side, and on the borrower side, the numeroushospital designchanges well into hospital
construction and some initial weaknesses inoverseeing construction caused substantial delays.
There were also other factors-economic and security-related-that       were beyond the Bank and
borrower's control.

The overall outcome ofthe HAMSeT Control Project is ratedmoderately satisfactory based on
the following disease-specific ratings. Malariacontrol is ratedhighly satisfactory becausethe
sustained and targeted malaria control efforts resulted incontinued declines inmalaria morbidity
even inthe face o f increases inaverage rainfall, as in2004. HIV/AIDS/STIs control is rated
moderately satisfactory because o f near universal coverage o f the militarywith HIV prevention
interventions, the country's most important HIV risk group, targeting o f other risk groups such as
sex workers, expandedvoluntary counseling and testing, coupled with evidence o f declining HIV
trends inyoung adults and declining STItrends. There was some inefficiency inthe
implementation o f the community-managed program, due to some weaknesses incoordination
with sectoral interventions. This component did however substantially contribute to reducing
stigma and extendingcare and support to orphans and people with HIV/AIDS. Tuberculosis
control i s rated moderately unsatisfactory largely due to continued low case detectionrates and
because the persistent programmatic weaknesses raised doubts about attribution o f the downward
trends intuberculosis morbidity to the project. The sectoral participation inthe HAMSeT
Control Project was prioritized based on sectors' comparative and strategic advantage in
HAMSeTdisease control, andbenefited from strong leadership by MOH. The designofthe
community-managed program, however, lacked detail and caused implementation to suffer early
intheproject, althoughafter the mid-ternreviewmanyweaknesses were addressed. Against the
backdrop o fpersistent security challenges, worsening economic conditions and continued human
resource constraints, Bank and borrower performance are rated satisfactory.

While several factors bode well for the sustainability o fthe two projects' achievements (e.g., the
highlevel of government commitment andownership, increasingutilizationofhealth facilities
and the highly successful malaria program and strong reliance on community involvement) the
persistent "no war no peace" situation continues to pose economic and security risks. Inthe face
o fthe food and fuel crisis, the government's difficult fiscal position will likely constrainthe
sector's future resources. The risk to development outcome for bothprojects i s therefore rated
moderate.

The most important lessons are:

        In post-conflictsettings engagement is a means to an end, and needs to be
        accompaniedby a sustainedpolicy dialogueto ensure that developmentgains are
        realizedinthe mediumterm. Inthe late 1990sthe Bank's dialogue with Eritrea's
        health sector was highly contentious, but despite the initial technical disagreements the
        Bank engaged the sector. While the Health Project was not fully successful, it i s unlikely
        that the development gains inthe decade that followed under the HAMSeTprojects
        would have been realized inthe absence o f the early engagement inthe sector. The
        content o f the sectoral dialogue that followed the initial engagement was able to steer the
        sector from the post-conflict "reconstruction mode" to a "development mode." The
        reorientation o f the sectoral priorities was only possible with sustained and sometimes
        challenging dialogue underpinned by analytical work.
        Inthe area of HIV/AIDS a demand-drivenmodelof communitysub-projectsis
        moreappropriatefor service deliveryinterventionsthat are responsiveto local
        communityneeds (such as home-basedcare, supportto orphans andvulnerable
        children)than for preventiveinterventionstargetingstigmatizedrisk groups or
        stigmatizedbehavior. The community component was based on a demand-driven

                                         xiv


model that i s a part o f many HIV/AIDS projects. Inthe HAMSeT Control Project the
community component financed a combination o f HIV/AIDS prevention, care and
support activities. The project experience demonstrated that community demand(on
which the demand-driven approach i s based) i s sub-optimal as a basis for allocation for
programs aimed at stigmatized risk groups or behavior.
Community activities that are strategically planned and coordinated with the local
health authorities can provide an important complement to health facility-based
disease control efforts. Community outreach and community-based activities proved to
be key elements o fthe highly successful malaria control efforts. Incontrast, the strong
reliance on facility-based interventions was a key factor underpinningthe low case
detectionrate inthe less successful tuberculosis control program.
Disease control projects can be complementary to-and          need not undermine-
cross-cutting health system functions. Inthe HAMSeT Control Project various cross-
cutting functions and systems were strengthened(e.g., health promotion, disease
surveillance, laboratory service, drug distribution) because the sector's leadership sought
to achieve programmatic efficiencies across individual disease control programs instead
o f duplicating these systems for each disease control program. This experience i s
particularly important giventhe debates inthe internationalhealth community about the
negative impacts o f disease-specific projects on health systems.
Multi-sector projects, such as HIV/AIDS projects, achieve better results if the
sectors involved are strategically chosen according to their comparative advantage
indisease preventionand control. The HAMSeT Control Project prioritized the
participation o f sectors based on the comparative advantage o f each sector inHAMSeT
disease control, allowing the country's disease control efforts to balance
comprehensiveness with selectivity inorder to achieve maximal disease impact.

 1.Introduction

Backgroundand Context

 1.1      Eritrea i s one o fthe poorest countries inthe world with an estimated per capita gross
domestic product (GDP) o f $200 in2006.' Two-thirds o f the population live inpoverty2and in
2007 the country ranked 157thamong 177 countries inthe HumanDevelopment IndexV3After
three decades o f war and defacto independence in 1991, the country inheriteda shattered
economy, devastated infrastructure, and neglected social sectors. A third o f the population was
displaced. By the late 1990s the country appeared on the way to economic recovery--evidenced
by 10.9 percent average annual (nominal) growth rate4-and extensive reconstructionand
rehabilitation. However, the 1998-2002 border hostilities with Ethiopia, and the consequent and
on-going `no war no peace' situation have marredeconomic performance. Ayerage annual
growth slowed to 3.6 percent for 2003-2005 and in2007 the economy contracted. Throughout
project implementation Eritrea was either under conflict or was simultaneously a post-conflict
and fragile state. The country currently faces unsustainable fiscal deficits and precariously low
foreign exchange reserves. The timeline inAnnex D summarizes some o fthe key events inthe
country and the health sector's history.

 1.2      Trends in HNP indicators. Since the 1990s the improvements ininfantand child
mortality have exceeded the pace o f improvement inother countries inSub-Saharan Africa
(Figure l-l).5 these gains, some indicators continue to lag (e.g., maternal mortality
                  Despite
ratio)6 and the improvement inhealth status has been uneven, especially among the poor (Figure
F- 1 inAnnex F). Infectious andparasitic diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis andHIV/AIDS
accounted for the single largest source o f death inEritrea (44 percent). Other important causes
o f mortality were: respiratory infections (16 percent) and non-communicable diseases (22
percent) (Table F-2 inAnnex F). Eritrea has the full range o f malaria endemnicity-from                     Gash-
Barka and Debubzobas with hyper-endemic transmissionto the plateau (including Asmara) that
has much lower levels o f transmission, to the South Red Sea zoba that has very few cases. The
country experienced an'exceptionalincrease inmalaria morbidity and mortality in 1997-1 998
due to unusually highrainfalls (Figure 1-2 inBox 1-1). Tuberculosis, an air-borne disease, is

purchasingpower parity (PPP) terms, GNI dropped from $1,220 to $1,O 10 over the same period (World Bank
2008a).
2. World Bank (1996a). The country has never had apopulation census since independence. The Ministryof
Development Planning maintains that the population size is about 3.2 millionwhile accordingto other sources,
includingthe international community, it as high as 4.9 million-a   difference ofmore than athird. This uncertainty
influences the sampling of demographic, economic as well as health surveys, the estimation ofpopulation-based
indicators and the interpretation of any change inindicators over time.

found throughout the country, with the highest morbidity and mortality rates in Southern Red
Sea (SRS), Maekel and Gash Barka. The first AIDS case was reported in 1988 inthe southern
port, Assab. The AIDS epidemic can be characterized as a low prevalence epidemic that i s
concentrated inspecific risk groups (sex workers, active and demobilized military conscripts,
truckers, as well as the sexual partners o f these groups). National sentinel surveillance in2001
revealedan HIV prevalence rate o f 2.8 percent among antenatal clinic attendees, butwithhigher
infection rates among specific groups-female          bar workers (22.8 percent) and military personnel
(4.6 percent) (Table 3-4). Heterosexual contact is the main form o f HIV transmission. InEritrea

1.3      Health Expenditure. Health expenditure is low and highly donor dependent. Per capita
total public (government and donor) health expenditure in2005 was between $8 and $13 and
external assistance accounted for more than two thirds o f total public sector health spending
(Table F-3 inAnnex F).' The country's difficult economic and fiscal position will likely
constrain future increases ingovernment health spending. Cost recovery through user fees has
been an important source o f funding to complement the relatively modest government health
spendingo f about $3 per capita (between 1996 and 2006; see Table F-3 inAnnex F).9
Consequently household spendingon health care i s high; in2000 poor households spent more
thanatenth ofhouseholdconsumptionexpenditure onhealthcare.

Box 1-1.Malaria inEritrea
The distribution ofmalaria risk acrossthe country is strongly influenced by climatic, altitude and rainfall differences
(see map).a Malaria transmission is highly seasonal and mainly inthe south and western parts o fthe country during
September-November, while the eastern coastal zones have highest transmission between January and April. There
are, however, some areas where malaria risk persists throughout the year, mainly linkedto the existence o f man-
made water sources. In2006 Gash Barka accounted for three quarters o fthe country's malaria morbidity and more
than half of the country's malaria mortality. While Debubhad the second highest number o f malaria cases, it has
the second lowest malaria mortality (most likely due to better access to health services).b According to a prevalence
survey in2000/01, houses with mudwalls were associated with higher malaria risk (after adjusting for rainfall and
altitude). Chloroquine resistance is widespread inEritrea.

Duringthe epidemic outbreak between 1997 and 1998 the number of malaria cases increased from 171,200 to
254,100. InAnseba the caseload increased by 94 percent and inNorthernRed Sea (NRS) by 105 percent. In Gash
Barka and Debubthe reported cases increased by a third and a half, respectively.

Government Health Strategy

1.5        Eritrea has few natural resources and shortly after independence the country's approach
to development strongly emphasized human resource development, as reflected inthe
Government o f Eritrea's (GOE) macroeconomic policy and development strategy released in
November 1994, just before joining the Bank in 1995." The objectives o f the health sector are
to reduce and eventually eliminate death from easily preventable diseases, and to enhance
awareness o f good health practices inorder to improve the productivity o f the work force. This
i s to be achieved by: giving priority to primary health care in controlling major health hazards,
encouragingprivate sector participation, community and beneficiary contribution inhealth
finance, and promotion o f healthy practices.

1.6        The MOHwas initially focused on rebuildingthe health infrastructureinthe 1990s; the
next five years was characterized by a focus on communicable disease control and child health;
and inrecent years on addressing the sector's human resource shortages andmaternal health.
Since 1991 13 hospitals, 19 health centers and 112 health stations have beenconstructed. l2A
substantial part o fthe M O H expertise was derived from experience with runningthe military
health services duringthe war o f independence. For this reason, the health sector benefited from
a small but experienced cadre o f health professionals andpara-professionals to provide
leadership to the development o f the sector. Nonetheless, humanresources were a key constraint
facing the health system-in 1999 the ratio o fphysicians per 1,000 people was 0.02, well below
the regional average o f 0.17 per 1,000. l3The humanresource shortages continue to be one o fthe
most important challenges facing the Eritreanhealth system.

1.7        Giventhe low level o fhealth expenditure, therehas beenan emphasis onthe most cost-
effective disease control andpublic health interventions, underthe leadership o fnational disease
control programs and implementedthrough a decentralized primary health system at the zoba level,

World Bank and other External Support to HNP: 1994-present

1.8      Between 1997 andthe present the World Bank committed approximately $82.3 million in
IDA credits and grants to support three health sector operations inEritrea (Table 1-1). The
Bank's support to the sector was informed by an Information Sheet on HealthNutrition,
Population and Poverty (1999) and a Health Sector Report in2003/04. Inaddition, IDA
financing has beenmade available through two multisectoral operations: (i) Integrated Early the
Childhood Education Project which financed clinic- and school-based delivery o f child health
and nutrition services; and (ii) Community Development Project which financed the
                                      the

2. Health Project

Objectives and Design

2.1      The health sector dialogue formally started shortly after Eritreajoined the Bank in 1995.
There was post-independence euphoria throughout the country, and a "can do" attitude
permeated the agencies o f government. The President o f Eritrea made the political commitment
to deliver a hospital ineachzoba, and the support o fthe Bank was sought specifically to finance




15. Shililu2001a,b; Sintasath 2004; and Graves 2004.

                                                            7


"two 200-bed, two-storey hospitals." The objective stated inthe Development Credit Agreement
was "to contribute to the improvement o f health care delivery services and health status."'6

2.2       Therewas disagreement between the Bank andthe GOE as to how best to achieve this
objective. The GOE made a legitimate argument that referral hospitals are an integral part o f the
primary health care system interms o f their referral function, and the technical support and
oversight they provide to lower level health facilities. The government, through the Eritrean
Liberation Front, had gained considerable experience with runningbasic health services during
the war and needed assistance with the hospital sub-sector. Furthermore, at the time the M O H
was receiving substantial external support and technical assistance for clinic services from
bilateral donors and UNagencies, and the sector had benefitted from clinic reconstruction and
renovation implementedunder the Bank-financed Community Development FundProject during
1992-1997.     l7

2.3       The two proposedhospitals were to replace a 102-bed hospital inMendefera(inzoba
Debub) and a 41-bed hospital inBarentu (inzoba Gash Barka). The Bank correctly questioned
the size of the two proposed hospitals, their affordability, and their impact on the already
constrained human resource situation. Eritrea's bed capacity was withinthe ran e o f other low
income countries inthe region, and utilization o fthe existing hospitals was low.                     F*   Itwas
estimated that the two hospitals alone would imply additional per capita recurrent expenditure o f
between $1.O and $1.5 annually. l9A further concern was the displacement o f staff from basic
health services inorder to staff the referral hospitals. Inanticipation o f future economic growth
and associated government revenues, the government argued that the recurrent costs were within
affordable limits. To address the human resource concerns the M O H agreed to develop a human
resource plan for the hospitals.

2.4       Inadditionto financing hospitalinfrastructure, the project financed clinic refurbishment,
drugs and medical supplies, blood safety, and capacity building. The components andactivities,
as anticipated inthe project appraisal document, are summarized inBox 2-1. These activities
address some o f the challenges facing the sector-lack               o f physical access to health services of
acceptable quality, particularly by the poor and rural population, weak institutional capacity at
the national and zonal levels-although            the financial barriers to health care access was not
addressed.




16. According to the project appraisal document the objective o f the HealthProject was: "to improve the health
status o fthe people of Eritrea thereby enhancing quality o f life and the ability o f Eritreans to participate inthe
country's socio-economic development."
17. The project built23 health stations, 1 health post and 7 health centers (World Bank 2002).
18. Eritrea's bed capacity was within the range o f other low income countries in the region: bedpopulation ratio for
Eritrea was 0.76 beds per 1,000; low income countries in SSA region: inter-quartile range for the period 1995-2000
was 0.71 to 1.49 (World Bank 2007a). At the time of project preparation, the bed occupancy rate nationally was
48.1 percent; 32.2 percent in Mendefera hospital, and 52.9 percent inBarentu hospital (World Bank 2004a,b).

2.5        The project rationale included reference to the lack o f health service access particularly                       ,
among the poor.20 The project designindirectly sought to address the needs o fthe poor by the
choice o f health centers and health stations for refurbishment and the choice o f hospitals for

coordination mechanisms, and implementationwas coordinated with the relevant divisions and
national programs inthe MOH, the zonal health offices, and other pertinent structures (e.g.,
Pharmecor, the parastatal pharmaceutical manufacturer).

2.8      Risks. The project appraisal document identifiedriskspertaining to utilization,
implementation capacity, and the appropriateness and maintenance o f facilities and equipment.
Riskmitigation measures were identifiedbutit is unclear who was responsible for their
implementation. For example, poor utilization due to, amongst others, financial barriers to
access was identified, but no specific remedyor assignment o f responsibility was proposed.
Giventhe Bank's valid concerns at appraisal about the affordability o fthe hospitals' recurrent
costs (as raised inthe economic and financial analysis), it i s surprisingthat these issues did not
feature more prominently inthe risk assessment.

2.9      M&E design. While the links between the outcome and impacts identified inthe
logframe were plausible, there was a disconnect with the project outputs for selected indicators
(e.g., total fertility rate, prevalence o f female genital mutilation, and malnutrition as mentioned in
paragraph 2.6). The indicators were all national inscope, while a large share o f the interventions
was regionally focused. No targets were set for the key performance indicators (KPI). A
combination o f sector-level and project-level indicators were proposed, with the health
management information system (HMIS) beingresponsible for collecting the former and the
P M U beingresponsible for the latter. Very little detail was provided inthe project appraisal
document and the project implementationplan on how project data (as opposed to sector data
routinely collected through the HMIS) would be collected at the zoba level. A householdhealth
utilization and expenditure survey (EHHUES) was to be expanded from the existing two zobas to
include all six zobas inthe country to provide baseline data.

monthsafter the original closing date. The reasonfor the extension was the substantial delays inthe
hospital construction. The actual project cost was $22.6 million, 107 percent o fthe cost estimated at
appraisal. Uponproject closingthe credit was 99 percent disbursedand SDR 3,405 was cancelled.
Borrower contributionwas 68 percent o fthe appraisal estimate. The actual project cost included a
grant from Norway o f $2.8 millionfor hospital construction that was notplannedat appraisal.

2.1 1    Followinga malaria outbreak and inresponse to humanitarian needs following border
hostilities-both     occurring in 1998 shortly after effectiveness-the   Bankagreed to reallocate
$2.8 million from the training and study budgetto the malaria control program and $1.2 million
to supportpost-conflict emergency programs. The Bank also agreed to reallocate funds to nurse
training institutions under Component 2 (Capacity Building) inorder to support the country's
strategy to train additional health staff. The latter was justified by the severe human resource
constraints heightenedby the post-conflict situation. There were no revisions to the project
objectives or key performance indicators. The mid-termreview missed the opportunity to fix the
disconnect between the project outputs and the KPIs.

a. Not reflected inthe project costs is the cost overrun of $5.3 million for the two referral hospitals that was
reallocated from and accounted for underthe HAMSeT Control Project.

2.12     Constructiono f the hospitals started three years into the project's lifespan and was not
completed by the delayed closing date. Although the hospitals were said to be 95 percent
completed at project closure, the two referral hospitals became operational several years later in
2006, following an additional allocation o f $5.3 million from the HAMSeT Control Project.
Taking into account this outlay, the total construction costs for the two hospitals came to $18.4
million, 145 percent o fthe appraisal estimate. Constructionwas plagued by cost overruns and
substantial delays, due to: (i)     under-estimationo f construction costs at appraisal;23 (ii) in           delay
finalization o f design and designalterations well into construction;              24 (iii) shortagesafter
                                                                                            labor
adults were re-mobilized to the war front in 1998; (iv) shortages o f goods and supplies; (v)
foreign currency restrictions causing delays inpayment o f suppliers; (vi) bureaucratic delays in
getting approval from the maritime, customs and port authorities at Massawaport; and (vii)
damage to the Barentu Hospital duringthe border hostilities. Many o f these factors were beyond
the control o fthe ministry andthe Bank. Initiallythe PMUlackedexperience with managing
civil works and with Bank procedures in general, although this improved over time. According
to the ICR, an independent assessment o f procurement inprojects inEritrea rated the
procurement performance o f the HealthProject as satisfactory.

2.13     Implementation o f activities by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and the
National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) progressed well. The reallocationsmentioned
earlier detracted from funds for capacity buildingand institution-strengthening. Furthermore,
civil works was the largest expenditure category, accounting for half o f total project costs. An
additional nine percent o f project cost was devoted to hospital equipment. Duringproject
supervision the project team expressed concern about the imbalance between investments in
hardware and software. The dominance of the project by the construction o f the two hospitals,
offered the team limitedroom to introduce sectoral and policy dialogue. The team utilized the


23. The issue o f cost overruns was raised as early as the project's launch mission.
24. Examples o f design alternations include: expanding scope o f medical gas to all wards; adding elevators;
changing the layout o fnurses' stations in wards to accommodate an electronic nurse call system.

opportunity ofproject supervision to engage the MOH leadership inpolicy dialogue on broader
sectoral issues-for   example the country was encouragedto develop aNational Health Strategy.
Policy dialogue regarding management and improvement of the efficiency of the hospital sub-
sector was, however, largely limitedto requiring the MOH to develop a hospital staffing plan.

2.14    The reallocation for malariameantthat the NationalMalaria Control Program also
became a key part of the project's implementation arrangements. The project procured malaria
control drugs and supplies, and training and workshops. The project-financed inputs accounted
for the largest share of external funding to the NationalMalaria Control Program over the period
1998-200 1.25 In 1999the MOH convenedthe first NationalMalaria Conference, andthrough
the Mendefera Declaration on Malaria Control in Eritrea committed the country to reducing
malaria morbidity andmortality by 80 percent from the 1999 levels.

2.15    Safeguards. The project was subject to an environmental assessment becauseof hospital
medical waste. An environmental assessment was not completed at appraisal and the medical
waste planwas only drafted inMay 2003, nearly five years after project effectiveness. Although
the supportto the NationalMalariaControlProgram was added after appraisal, the same
safeguardrequirementshad to be met for the procurement of insecticides, inparticular dichloro-
diphenyl-trichloroethane(DDT). No evidenceof measures taken to comply with safeguard
policies could be found.

2.16    M&E implementation and utilization of data. The preliminary results ofthe household
health and expenditure survey for selectedzobas were available in 1997andthe full survey was
completedinSeptember 2002, four and a halfyears after effectiveness and undermining the
intention that it would serve as abaseline survey. The delay was mainly due to border hostilities
in 1998-2000 causing substantialdelays inthe fieldwork. There was no follow-up survey and
hence no trends could be assessed. There is, furthermore, only limitedindicationthat the survey
data were usedto inform project-level implementation or sectoral decision-making. The project
benefitedgreatly from the HMIS, although very few ofthe HMISinputswere financedby the
project. Supervision missions repeatedly stressed the importance of strengthening the project's
M&E systemandthe appointment of anM&E specialist inthe MOH. Constrainedby human
resource availability an M&Eunitwas establishedinthe MOH only in2007.

Achievement of Objectives

2.17    The assessment of the achievementof the project objective-to   improve health care
delivery services andhealth status-is   divided into two parts: (i)
                                                                  improvement inthe delivery of
health care services; and (ii)improvement inhealth status. The outputs by component are
summarized inAnnex A.

OBJECTIVE:   IMPROVEMENT CARESERVICES
                               IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH
2.18    While service delivery has improved following the opening o f the 144-bedBarentu
Hospital and the 168-bedMendefera Hospitalin2006, bothhospitals were functioning belowthe
capacity intendedat appraisal. More than a year after the opening of the hospitals the bed

occupancy rate was 27 percent for Mendefera hospital and for Barentu it i s estimated by IEG at
about 30 percent.26 InBarentuHospital (inzoba Gash Barka) there has only been a small
increase inutilization since opening (Figure 2-1a) while in-and out-patient data for Mendefera
Hospital show an increasing trend inutilization (Figure 2-lb).

2.19      The two hospitals were builtas referralhospitals, providing specialist services, for example
surgical services, and receiving referrals from health centers and other hospitals inthe zoba. The
numberofsurgical procedures inMendeferaHospitalhas nearlytripled-from                        780 in2005 to
2,834 in2007. Referrals from health centers to Mendefera Hospital nearly doubled between 2005
and2007 (Table F-1inAnnex F), andreferrals from other hospitals increasedfrom 109to 238
between2004 and 2007. For BarentuHospitalthe picture is slightly different. While referrals to
Barentu Hospital from health centers inthe zoba increased substantially between 2005 and 2007,
referrals from other hospitals inthe zoba declined (Table F-1inAnnex F). Barentu Hospital
essentially h c t i o n s as a zoba hospital serving the healthcenters inthe sub-zobas inits catchment
area, and not as a referral hospitalto the zoba hospitals. The under-utilization o fboth hospitals and
the lack ofprovision ofsome specialist services inBarentuhospital contribute to the overall
inefficiency o fthe hospital investment. A mitigating factor i s the re-use o fthe replaced hospital
facilities as nursetraining facilities, meeting an important need inthe country.

2.20      Utilization o f health centers and health stations i s assessedusingtwo examples-
immunization and antenatal services-with               due recognitionthat these are not the only services
provided by these facilities, and that not all the improvements can be attributed to Bank-financed
 input^.^' There have been significant increases inimmunization coverage: full immunization
coverage expanding from 41 percent in 1995 to 76 percent in2002 (Table 2-2). Despite some
improvement inantenatal clinic service access, the share o f deliveries attended by a health
worker has not shown similar increases. The share o fpregnant women visiting a healthfacility
for at least one antenatal visit increased from 44 percent in 1998 to 64 percent in2005.28 Of
those who attended at least one antenatal clinic visit, a tenth failed to complete the required
number of antenatal clinic visits.29In 1999 delivery service coverage was 17 percent with only a
modest increase by the end o f the project (Table 2-2).




26. MOH2007a. Bedoccupancy rate for Barentu Hospital was reported at 70 percent, the highest inthe country.
But, this basedon a60-bedhospital, the same as the hospital that was replaced.
27. Data on the indicators o f health facility access and utilization proposedinthe PAD (World Bank 1997, Annex 1
p2) were not available, and alternate measuresor slightly modified indicators that could be obtained from the HMIS
have beenused instead.

a. The factors that contribute to the low utilization are: Design.While there were several positive aspects to the hospitaldesign,30
some design features constrainedutilization: e.g., the porous floor material intheaters and some wards made sterilization
impossible, and mosquito nets were not fixed to the beds inBarentu hospital, inthe zoba with the highest malaria prevalence.
Many of the design alterations that resulted in considerabledelays are still not functional-zg., the central medical gas supply to
all wards is currently not operational; the ward layout was changed in order to install a nurse calling system that is still not
functional; an elevator was added to the Mendefera hospital for better access to the second storey with administrative offices, is
not utilized. Energy supply. InBarentu Hospital there are 3 hours of electricity inthe day and 3 hours at night." Solar power
seems to be the only plausible solution, but was consideredtoo costly.




30. Air-conditioning was limitedto the operatingtheaters and the pharmacy; the extensive use ofnatural light; the
use of natural water collection through construction of boreholes, water towers and undergroundwater run-offto
ensure water self-sufficiency of the facilities; landscapingwas designedto facilitate natural cooling; design allowed
for revenuegenerationthrough rental of conferencefacilities and other hospital facilities.

to Ethiopia and Sudan. Energy supply was always constrainedbut the current situation is particularly acute due to
diesel shortages and high gasoline costs.

2.23     A substantial share of the reduction inincidence canbe ascribedto the NationalMalaria
Control Program's programmatic achievements. While the trends inmalaria interventions and
malaria incidence are high1 suggestive of a programmatic success inthe country's malaria
control efforts (Figure 2-3) a key question is: how muchofthis success can be ascribedto the
                                   l 3
varying rainfall pattern? In 1997/98the rainy season lastedfour months insteadof the usual two
                                                            `'
months. Between 1999 and 2003, more than half of the variance inmalaria incidence can be
explained by variance inrainfall.34Furthermore, in2001 rainfallexceededthe level in 1998,yet
mortality and morbidity in2001 was betweenathird and a quarter of the 1998 level.

 PROJECT       RATINGS

 2.26     The outcome o f the HealthProject i s rated moderately unsatisfactory, and i s based on the
 ratings for relevance, efficacy and efficiency as they apply to the two parts o f the objective
 (summarized inTable 2-5 and discussed below).

 2.27     The overall relevance of the project objective and design for the first and second sub-
 objectives is modest and substantial, respectively. The relevance o f the objective to improve

health care delivery services and health status o f Eritreanswas consistent with the post-conflict
situation, and remains consistent with the priority placed on human development by the GOE
and the MOH. The establishment o fthe blood bank was also an important priority. The
relevance o fthe project design had some shortcomings. While respondingto the dire need for
reconstruction, the design failed to account for the results chain ensuringthat the project outputs
(especially the construction o f two hospitals) are linkedto all o fthe intended impacts as reflected
inthe performance indicators (e.g., total fertility rate, prevalence offemale genital mutilationand
malnutrition). While the hospitals'had several positive design features, the designhas to be
criticized for the excessive size o fthe Barentu hospital. The addition o f the malaria sub-
component enhanced the relevance o f the design, especially o f the second part o fthe objective-
to improve health status-as     the project outputs could be directly linked to a major source o f
morbidity and mortality among adults as well as infants and children.

2.28     The efficacy o f the first sub-objective, to improve the delivery o f health services, i s
substantial. While the contribution o fthe hospital constructionto the project objective is
constrained by the under-utilization o f specialist services inBarentuhospital, the HMIS data
suggest increasingtrends inservice delivery. Furthermore, the establishment o f the blood bank
was an important achievement. The efficacy o f the second sub-objective, to improve health
status, i s substantial. The investments inclinic services contributed to improvements inclinic
utilization and health outcomes. It is also possible to make stronger links between some o f the
other project investments and outcomes, e.g., investments inthe blood bank and the successful
malaria control program. Some performance indicators that the project sought to influence did
not improve substantially: malnutrition andprevalence o f female genital mutilation.

2.29     Project efficiency i s modest. The investments inmalaria control and inPHC services
were highly efficient as it focused on low cost and highly efficacious interventions. Onthe other
hand, the under-utilization o f the two hospitals (interms o f bed occupancy and out-patient
utilization) and the large share o f specialized equipment that was not operational, especially at
BarentuHospital, detracted from overall project efficiency.

2.30     The project's risk to development outcome i s moderate. Several factors bode well for
sustainability: the highlevel o f government commitment and ownership; the highutilization o f
clinic services; the reasonable likelihood o f increasing utilization o f MendeferaHospital; and the
highly successful malaria program with its strongreliance on community involvement that has
proven to be sustainable. However, the government's difficult fiscal position may constrain the
sector's future resources, and border hostilities continue to pose some level o f risk to the
economy.

2.3 1    As mentioned, the project's duration coincided with the start of border hostilities andthe
country effectively moved from a post-conflict situation to a country inconflict, creating many
implementation challenges facing the Bank and the borrower.

2.32    BankPerformance. The Bank's overall performanceis moderately satisfactory. Pre-
project dialogue was characterized by disagreement betweenthe Bank and the borrower
regarding the need for and affordability o f two 200-bed hospitals. Some interviewees
commentedthat at the very beginningo f the dialogue the Bank did not fully appreciate the
political economy o f the post-conflict situation, and initially adopted an overly technocratic

                                                           18


approach. Eritrea was said to be ina "reconstruction mode" whereas the Bank was inits usual
"development mode." The GOE felt the Bank was "too ideological" at the time o f project
preparation, and the notion o f doing a hospital project was going against the "received doctrine"
o f supporting primary health care. The GOE contended that it fully appreciated the highreturns
to investments inprimary health care, but that they were adopting a much longer term
perspective and was "building a country for the future." After a protracted project preparation
the Bank agreed to finance the project. Ifone takes a long-term view and considers the sectoral
engagement inthe decade that followed under the HAMSeT projects, the Bank was correct to
engage the sector eventhough there were technical disagreements.

2.33     Quality-at-entry was, however, moderately unsatisfactory for the following reasons: (i)
excess capacity inhospital designs; (ii) human resource planningdespite very detailed
                                               no
analysis o f financial sustainability during appraisal, and (iii)   failure to complete the
environmental assessment for medical waste. Shortly after the start o f the project, support for
malaria control was added, but no evidence o f any measures taken to comply with safeguard
policies regarding DDT procurement could be found.

2.34
continuity inproject oversight was maintained despite some turnover intask team leader^.^'
         Quality o f supervision was satisfactory. Supervision missions were regular and

Early supervisionwas not sufficiently results-oriented, although the project team did well to
engage the government through ESW (that was formally publishedinthe Health Sector Note in
2003); a health expenditure and utilization survey (Phase Iin 1997 and Phase I1in2002) and
informal analytical work during ~upervision.~~ Bank was successful inmoving the sector
                                                          The
dialogue from a "reconstruction mode" to a "development mode." There could, however, have
been greater engagement with the sector on hospital management to increase the effectiveness o f
hospital investments.

2.35     Borrower's performance was moderately satisfactory overall. Government
performance was moderately satisfactory despite the country being a new member o fthe World
Bank and the difficult security conditions. The performance o fthe MOH, the implementing
agency, was moderately satisfactory. There were numerous and considerable delays inhospital
design and construction. Most contributing factors mentioned inparagraph2.12 were beyond
the control o f the borrower. However, a key factor was-numerous            design changes that were
introduced by the ministry well into the hospital construction and resulted indelays in
construction and installation o f equipment that i s currently not beingutilized, contributing to
hospital inefficiency. Implementation o f other aspects o f the project, notably the Malaria
Control Program and the Blood Bank, was highly successful. While initially inexperienced, the
P M U steadily gained experience and successfully managed fiduciary matters. The P M U had
very little staffturnover thereby maintaining the capacity for the project that followed.

2.36     Monitoring and evaluation was modest. The M&E design included sector-level and
project-level indicators, and a baseline household health utilization and expenditure survey. The

project's indicators were all national, while a large share o f the interventions was regional in
scope. The implementation o f the second phase household survey was delayed due to border
hostilities, and underminingits purpose as a baseline survey. It i s unclear to what extent data
from this costly undertaking was usedto informproject-level implementation or sectoral
decision-making. The appointment o f an M&E specialist inthe M O H was delayed and only in
2007 was an M&E unit established inthe MOH.

3. HAMSeT Control Project

3.1      At the time o fproject preparationEritreawas emerging from another period ofwar
(1998-2000). While health and other socio-economic indicators continued to improve over that
period (refer back to Figure 1      -l),communicable diseases accounted for a significant share o fthe
disease burden. Malaria incidence had declined following the 1998 outbreak, but malaria
remained a significant source o f morbidity andmortality. The threat o f HIV/AIDS was an
emerging area o f concern.

Objectivesand Design

3.2      The objectives, as stated inthe project appraisal document, were: "to reduce the mortality
and morbidity ofthe Eritreanpopulation due to HIV/AIDS,malaria, sexually transmitted
diseases and tuberculosis (HAMSeT) through an increase inutilization o f quality, effective and
efficient health services for HAMSeT prevention, diagnosis and treatment, supported by healthy
 practice^."^^ The choice o f diseases was drivenby the disease burdenand the large positive
externalities associated with controlling these communicable diseases. The malaria interventions
were intendedto build on the early achievements o fthe Health Project by financing malaria
control activities inother sectors (e.g., the Ministry o f Defense) and by greater emphasis on the
role o f community outreach and involvement, facilitated by the malaria workers already                     inplace.
The rationale for the emphasis on HIV/AIDS was that, while Eritrea's HIV prevalence was
relatively low, early intervention would avert future disease burden. There was also a concern
that the demobilized defense force and the large post-war displacedpopulation could exacerbate
the spread of HIV. Tuberculosis was not only a significant communicable disease, butalso a
major AIDS opportunistic infection. The emphasis on communicable diseases remains
justified-in 2005 HIV/AIDS,tuberculosis and malaria were among the five most important




39. The objective, as statedinthe credit agreement has a bit more detail: "to assist the borrower in: (a) increasing
knowledge and awareness of HIV/AIDS, malaria, STIs andtuberculosis(HAMSeT) amongthe populationofthe
Borrower's territory; and(b) providingthe saidpopulationwith increasedaccess to preventionmeasuresandbasic
early treatment, through: (i)increasingthe effectivenessandefficiency of the Borrower's policies and interventions
aimedat the reductionofthe spreadofHAMSeTdiseases; (ii)        enablingcommunities, households,and individuals
to: (A) learn more about the practicesthat facilitate or minimizethe spread ofHAMSeTdiseases, and(B) have
access to affordable preventivemeasuresand early treatment services; (iii)  improvingthe quality of basichealthcare
by providingdrugs andmedicalmaterials; (iv) reducingenvironmentalimpact ofvector control activities; and(v)
identifyingaffordable community-managedhome-basedcare for AIDS patients."

causes o f m~rtality.~'Furthermore, a disproportionate burden o f malaria and tuberculosis
continued to fall on the poor.

3.3      A multiple disease project design was chosen because o fthe country's extremely limited
financial and human resource base, and inanticipation o f efficiency gains from elements that
disease control programs have incommon: (i)            healthpromotion, (ii)       surveillance, (iii)  logistics,
and (iv) zonal-level service delivery. Improving the institutional infrastructure to perform these
functions for the chosen diseases would, furthermore, serve many other disease control efforts.

3.4       The credit was approved inDecember 2000. The project had five components,
summarized inBox 3-1. A fifth o f project cost at appraisal was for HAMSeT prevention and
control activities implementedby non-health sectors. 41 The rationale for the involvement o f
these sectors was that the HAMSeT diseases arise from the interactiono f health and non-health
factors, and that addressing these factors required action inmultiple sectors. The sectors were
prioritized based on their strategic and comparative advantage indisease control. The
multisectoral collaboration betweenthe M O H and other ministriesbuilt on past, less formal
collaboration. For example, there were links between the National Malaria Control Program and
the MinistryofTransport and Communication around the rainfall data from the meteorological
sites; there were links between the Ministryo f Education (MOE) and M O H around school health
and the life skills program; and the Ministry o f Defense and M O H collaborated inthe area o f
military health services. With the HAMSeT fundingthe M O H was able to strengthen the
coordination and provide stronger motivation for action from other sectors.

3.5       The rationale for the community-managed component was to increase community
awareness o f the HAMSeT diseases andto mobilize communities for prevention through
affordable mechanisms and drawing strongly on the community structures. The component had
a demand-driven designwhereby communities would identify disease control activities to be
implementedas sub-projects to be implemented by the community. The design was particularly
appropriate for awareness raising and stigma reduction as well as community-based care and
support services for people with HIV/AIDS and orphans. The demand-driven design had
 limitation^^^ for prevention interventions targeting risk groups or behavior that are highly
stigmatized and the interventions targeting these groups were implementedmainly through the
multisectoral interventions and the HealthPromotion Unit.

3.6       The HAMSeTControl Project was part o f the Multi-country AIDS Program (MAP).43
The project design and implementation structure had some similarities with other MAP projects,
for example, a community-managed component and a multisectoral component. There were also
some differences. The project was managed by the MOH, not by a National AIDS Commission
located outside the health sector. This was a source o f debate at the time o f project preparation,
but the Minister ofHealth insistedthat the coordination structure be located withinthe MOH.
This project was also one o fthe first M A P projects to finance the control o fmultiplediseases.

3.7       Implementation arrangements. The MOHwas the lead implementing agency, andthe
project benefited from the project management skills accumulated under the HealthProject. The


41. For example, the Ministry of Health; Education;Labor andHumanWelfare; the Ministry ofTransport and
Communication;the Ministry o fTourism; the Ministry ofInformation; andthe Ministry o fLocalGovernment.
42. Communitydemand for a preventionprogramtargeting for example, sex workers, their clients and others with
multipleconcurrentpartnerswill likely to be sub-optimalbecauselocaldemand is less likely to internalize all the
benefitsofHIV preventionamongthis risk group.
43. The eligibility criteria for the MAP projects are: (i)
                                                         Evidenceof a strategic approachto HIV/AIDS, developedin
a participatory manner, or a participatory strategicplanningprocess underway,with a clear roadmapandtimetable;
(ii)Existenceofahigh-levelHIV/AIDScoordinatingbody,withbroadrepresentationofkeystakeholdersfromall
sectors, includingpeople livingwith HIV/AIDS; (iii)    Governmentcommitmentto quick implementation
arrangements, includingchannelinggrant funds directlyto communities, civil society, andthe private sector; (iv)
Agreementby the governmentto use multipleimplementationagencies, especiallyNGOs andCBOs.

                                                          22


implementationstructure was, however, more complex than the precedingproject. It included
seven ministries at national and regional levels, several non-governmental entities,44and civil
society structures. A National HAMSeT Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister o f Health,
had responsibility for strategic direction and policy guidance. The committee included
representation from ministries involved with implementation as well as the six zoba governors.
Additional project implementation and coordination structures included: the National HAMSeT
Technical Committee and six Zoba HAMSeT Technical Committees. At the cabinet level the
Ministero fDevelopment Planningheldthe ministersaccountable for their contribution to the
project objectives.

3.8       Risks.The project appraisal document identifiedanumber o frisks, for example, poor
coordination o f external actors, lack o f coordination among implementingagencies leading to slow
disbursements, poor implementation, andpossible lack o f efficacy of some interventions. All o f
these risks were rated as "modest.'y However, the complexity o fthe project design(withmultiple
components, sub-components, and implementers at different levels o f government and civil society),
particularly giventhe relatively weak implementation experience under the previous project, risked
slowing implementation andposed complex monitoringissues. The mitigationmethod(by
strengthening the PMU) was insufficient. The risk o fduplication, andthe weak coordination
betweenthe activities implemented by the national andzoba-level structures o fthe line ministries
andnon-governmental entities andthe CMHRP was not addressed, nor was the risko flow capacity
at the community level for identifying, implementingand evaluating CMHRP activities.

3.9       M&E design.According to the project appraisal document, the M&Eplanwas supposed
to put a strong evaluation framework inplace early inproject implementation, but the provisions
for carrying out this planwere not clearly specified. The proposed M&E mechanisms identified
inthe project appraisal document didnot go beyondthe usualrequirements for project
~upervision,~~    andthe design ofthe M&Eplanwas deferred to after project appraisal. While
K P I s were identified inthe project appraisal document, no targets for the impact indicators were
set. 46 Some o f the KPIs could have beenmore specific-for                 example, HIV/AIDS and STI
interventions were to target high-riskgroups, but the indicators didnot reflect these risk groups.
Given the limitations o f adult HIV prevalence as a measure o fprevention impact, indicators o f
behavior change among high-riskgroups could have assisted with the interpretation o f HIV
prevalence data. Lastly, the project was implementedas a "process project" and a "learning-by-
.doingproject" but there was insufficient allowance indesign for: on what basis learning would



44. Three non-governmentalentities, largely government funded, were involved: the NationalUnion of Youth and
Students (NUEYS), National Union of Eritrean Women (NUEW) and the NationalConfederation of Eritrean
Workers (NCEW).
45. ProposedM&E included: (i)    supervisionmissionsand annual progressreviews; (ii)     regular quarterly meetingsof
the Project Central SteeringCommittee; (iii)   semi-annualprogressreports based on implementation targets defined
inthe Annual Work Planand Budget; (iv) mid-termreview ofthe project no laterthan 30 monthsafter effectiveness
to identify project successes and issues to be addressed; and (v) baseline and follow-up surveys of beneficiaries.
46. Key performanceindicators identifiedinthe PAD: stabilization of HIV sero-prevalenceamong adults aged 15-
24 years; reduction in malaria death rate among children under 5 years and pregnant women; increase inthe
proportion of diagnosedand successfullytreatednew smear-positiveTB patients; andreduction inthe prevalenceof
severe anemia inwomen of child-bearing age (World Bank 2000a, p34).

take place; what type o f information would be collected to specifically inform learning; and how

Implementation

3.10      The HAMSeT Control Project became effective on March 1,2001, andclosed as planned
inMarch2006. Actual project cost was $51.4 million, 103 percent ofthe cost estimated at
appraisal. A mid-termreview was done inNovember 2004, rather late inthe project's life (after
47 months out o f the 63 months) and consequently some o f the important changes implemented
thereafter were sub-optimal intheir impact. Uponproject closing the credit was fully disbursed
and the borrower's contribution was 68 percent o f the appraisal estimate.

3.11     Plannedand actual expenditure by component.The components were not revised
although there was substantial reallocation across components (Table 3-1). The CMHRP
accounted for a third o f actual project costs (as opposed to the intended 20 percent at appraisal),
while only about 60 percent ofthe planned expenditure on collection of data andthe
multisectoral activities (components 1 and 2) was actually expended. In2001 $5.3 million was
reallocated from goods and consultant services to civil works to fund the cost overrun o f the
hospital construction under the Health Project.

3.13     Multisectoral control o f HAMSeT transmission (Component 2):47

     a) Promote healthy behaviors through multi-level communication. The behavior change
         communications were guided by a Communications Strategy. The activities included:
         development o f materials for behavior change communications, training o f outreach
         workers inbehavior change communications (including development training materials),


47. See Annex B for more detail on the interventions implemented by the multisectoral implementing agencies:
Ministry o fLabor and HumanWelfare, MinistryofDefense, Ministry o fEducation, religious institutions, non-
governmental entities etc.

         audiovisual equipment, and implementation o f communications activities including
         procurement o f airtime and newspaper space. The MOH's Health Promotion Unit
         provided support to the various sectors to ensure technical accuracy o f the information
         being disseminated. The interventions targeted specific risk groups, and there was
         evidence o f division o f responsibility based on the particular ministryor non-government
         entity in~olved.~'However, the division o fresponsibilities between the nationaland
         zoba-level structures-especially         inthe case ofthe non-government entities-was              not
         always clear. The mid-term review reiteratedthe need to refocus the HIV/AIDS
         activities on highrisk groups (e.g., sex workers), and to conduct mapping o f other high
         risk groups, but the mapping was not completed by project closing. The team
         discouraged allocations for income-generating activities among sex workers following
         doubts about their effectiveness as an HIV prevention strategy.
     b) Promote healthy lifestyles through the education system.A school-based health
         curriculum (including life-skills education) was developed and, although with some
         delay, was implemented injunior and secondary schools. The curriculum development
         was complemented by investment inteacher training and associated materials, reading
         materials etc. Materials were also developed for adults, and media was developed to
         target adult education students.
     c) Enhance access to preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services for conscripts. The
         program targeted the army hierarchy, all conscripts as well as the families o f army
         personnel. The interventions included: behavior change communications, promotion o f
         VCT and investment inVCT facilities and equipment, promoting condom use, the
         innovative incorporationo f a `condom pouch' inthe military uniforms (for storage and
         easy condom access), and promotion o f insecticide-treated bed-netuse. The M O H
         provided training programs for the military health staff inVCT, diagnosis andtreatment
         o f the HAMSeT diseases, including TB case detection and treatment. As mentioned in
         Annex Bythe project procured equipment, drugs and suppliesfor prophylaxis, diagnosis
         and treatment of HAMSeTdiseases.
     d) Promote environmentally sound andcost-effective techniques for malariavector control. The
         HAMSeT Control Project built on and expandedthe earlier successes o fthe NMCP. A key
         addition was the implementation o f a Pesticide Management Plan, which includedprudent
         use o fDDTfor indoor residual spraying. This was part o fa very detailed Environmental
         Assessment prepared for the project, as discussedinparagraph 3.17 under Safeguards.
3.14     Strengthen HAMSeT diagnostic healthcare and counseling services (Component 3):

     a) Establish safe blood banks inzoba hospitals. The plan to establish zoba-level regional
         blood banks was constrained by human resource limitations. Instead zoba hospitals were
         provided with facilities for storage o f blood units supplied by the Central Blood Bank in



48. For example, the Ministry o f Education and the National Union o f Eritrean Youth and Students targeted the
youth, respectively focusing on in- and out-of-school youth; the NationalUnion o fEritrean Women targeted women
and the Ministryo f Labor and HumanWelfare and the MOH's HealthPromotion Unitfocused specifically on sex
workers; the Federation o f Eritrean Workers targeted workers and the Ministryo f Transport targeted truckers in
particular.

         Asmara. Thanks to project financing, the latter i s well-equipped, with well-trained staff
         and applying with up to date quality control mechanisms. The acute resource constraints
         facing the health system will pose important challenges especially inthe more remote
         zobas facing highdistribution costs and electricity outages.
     b) Improve diagnostic, treatment and counseling o f HAMSeT. The project financedtraining
         inHAMSeTprevention, casedetection, syndromic and laboratory diagnosis andVCT. It
         was not practicalto integrate all the training for the HAMSeT diseases, although there
         were instances where integrationcould have been better. Training was also provided for
         clinicians inthe treatment o fpeople with HIV/AIDS. The project procured equipment,
         medical supplies (including diagnostic tests) and drugs associated with prophylaxis,
         diagnosis and treatment and HAMSeT diseases.
3.15     Community-managed HAMSeT Response Program (Component 4). The implementation
o f the CMHRP was substantially delayed; the first sub-projects were implemented only in
December 2002,22 months after the project became effective. The delays were inpart due to
the lack of detailed planningwhen the project was approvedand late completion ofthe
Operational Manual.49 The project overestimated the ability o f communities to assess needs,
design, implement and evaluate sub-projects. Inorder to expedite implementation, the project
team launched the Rapid Results Initiative (RRI), which implementedresults-oriented projects
over a period o f 100 days, and the Community Capacity Enhancement Process (CCEP) which
provided training inproposal development, pro'ect management, and reporting to help
communities define their needs and pri~rities.'~         The overall implementation experience
(particularly inthe first half o f the project) revealed substantial confusion, and lack o f
coordinationbetween activities implemented by the line ministries and non-governmental
entities at the national andzoba levels and the CMHRP sub-projects. Despite the early
implementationweaknesses, the result was an extensive network o f peer-educators and peer-
facilitators that reached down to the village level. The opportunity o fthe mid-termreview in
November 2004 was usedto address some o f the implementation challenges:

     a) The low capacity o f communities often ledto reliance on zoba-level line ministriesand
         non-governmental entities as implementers. At the mid-term review there was concern
         that sub-projects were not sufficiently community-driven. It was agreed that only sub-
         projects actually managed by the community would be funded.
     b) A tentho fthe approved CMHRP sub-projects andnearly a quarter o fapproved grantfunds
         (roughly $1.8 million) were for activities like renovationo f sports fields, construction o f
         community buildings, and libraries(Table 3- 2 and Table E-3inAnnex E). These activities
         hadbeenjustifiedby the notionthat by providing alternate activities (sport and libraries)



49. This was inpart due to the unfortunatedeath of the consultantwhile on mission.
50. The RRIis an implementationandmanagementtool that was introducedto enhance the implementationof
CMHRP sub-projects(as well as other aspects ofthe project). The CCEP was implementedto increase the ability of
communitiesto successfully develop and implementCMHRP sub-projects. Out ofthe 8,283 individuals receiving
CCEP training, 5,908 were community facilitators and2,375 were community management team members.
According to the independentevaluation 50 sub-projectshadbeengeneratedthroughthe CCEPtool (Kerouedan and
Appaix 2006 inMOH2006f).

a. Inthese cases, there was an intervention, like"sensitization" or "training", but it was impossibleto determine
which of the diseases it pertainedto, from the list.
b. This is the total amount approvedfor CMHRP grantsfor the 844 projectsreviewedby IEG. Accordingto the
PMU, a total of 98,822,995 Nakfawas actuallydisbursedfor the 908 projectsthat were completed.
c. The distribution of approvedsub-projectsby disease differs considerablyfrom the distribution reported inthe ICR,
which attributedall approvedprojectsto one ofthe three main diseases (HIV/AIDS,tuberculosis, malaria)and did
not show any sub-projects attributableto the HAMSeT diseasescollectively.

     c) At the mid-termreview the team expressed concern that too many sub-projects were not
           directly linked to HAMSeTdisease control. The team recommended that only activities
          that could be directly linked to the HAMSeTdiseases be funded, andthat the maximum
           amount per sub-project be reduced from $30,000 to $5,000. Inthe last year o f the project
          the size and orientation o fthe CMHRP sub-projects reflected these changes.

3.16       Financial managementandprocurement. The project was relatively complex-with
numerous implementing partners at various levels o f government (national andzoba-level) as
well as at the community level. Nonetheless, the project finances were well managed, thanks to
experience gained duringthe implementationo fthe previous project, development o f financial
management manuals (for the national and zoba-levels), recruitment o f accountants for zonal
PMUs, training and a computer-based accounting systemfinanced by the project. All annual
audit reports were submittedas required and on time, and the external audits provided
unqualified opinions on the annual financial statements for the project's entire duration. While
there were some problems with delays inprocurement, all procurements were carried out in
accordance with the Development Credit Agreement. As remarkedinthe ICR, the Bank shares
credit for this achievement because o f a realistic procurement implementationplan and close
supervision.

3.17      Safeguards. The Programhad a category B rating for environmental safeguard purposes.
An environmental assessment was conducted to assess the impact o fthe malaria control
interventions, the main focus beingthe use o f DDT for indoor residual spraying. The assessment
concluded that only a small share o f houses at risk would be sprayed with DDT; that the method
o f spraying was consistent with WHO guidelines and the POPs e~ernption;~`                              and recommended
that malaria surveillance should be improved andthat DDT should gradually be replaced by


5 1. The "POPs (persistent organic pollutants) exemption" restricts DDT use andproduction to disease vector control
only (not agriculture) and requirescountriesusingDDT to follow WHO guidelines for disease vector control.

alternatives. A Pesticide Management Plan (PMP) was prepared following the recommendations
o f the environmental assessment.

3.18     M&E implementation.The M&Eplan was not approveduntillate inthe life o fthe
project and consequently the project lacked an M&Eframework and M&E plan for most o f its
duration. The intention to collect baseline indicators by the end o f FY02 was not fully
accomplished. Untilvery late inthe project there were no staff inthe PMUwith dedicated
responsibility for M&E. The analysis o fthe CMHRP sub-projects by IEGrevealed many
inconsistencies and inaccuracies raising questions about the detail and quality o f monitoring and
supervision o f sub-projects at zoba-level as well as at the central level.

3.19     A number of surveys were conducted and while they generated important information,
there were some weaknesses. Several surveys were only single cross-sectional surveys with no
baseline for com arison (the TB prevalence survey, the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling
(LQAS) Survey ), and some variables across multiple surveys had only limited comparability
                    pz
                                                                                           '
(e.g., malaria data inthe DHS in 1995 and 2002, the Bed-net survey in2003, and the LQAS
Survey in2006; see Table 3-6 and Table F-5 inAnnex F). The education sector conducted a
needs assessment at the start and toward the end o f the project, but the Sam ling for the two
surveys was not comparable so the impact could not be formally assessed.                       The tuberculosis
prevalence survey provided some information on the disease's geographic distribution, but there
were methodological concerns and disagreements on the findings (Box 3-3).

3.20     Repeated HIV sentinel surveillance surveys were conducted among women attending
antenatal clinics, an important achievement (Table 3-4).54 However, monitoring o f HIV/AIDS
interventions and outcomes among highrisk groups had important limitations. There was no
tracking o f coverage o f risk groups, and the recommendedmapping o f high-riskgroups and hot
spots for targeted interventions was not implemented. Behavioral surveys were conducted
among high-riskgroups such as sex workers and truck drivers although, there were some
methodological weaknesses constraining their use intracking behavior change.

3.21 M&E data utilization. The collection o fproject data from the zonal health offices
remained weak for a large part o fthe project and consequently the use o f the data to inform
planning and implementation suffered. Health facility-based morbidity and mortality data were
collected through the HMIS at the zoba-level and was sent to national disease control programs
for analysis. The development o f the HMIS-an                important achievement by the MOH-




52. Basedon the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) methodology the country was divided into supervision
areas which roughly coincided sub-zobas. Sub-zobas consist of large communities called kebabis, and basedon the
total population of each kebabi, 19 intervieweesper supervision areas were randomly selected taking a probability
sample proportional to the population size. The total sample size was 854 women 15-49years. There were some
differences inthe phrasing of the questions complicating comparability with the DHS findings.
53. Ministry of Education and Partnershipfor Child Development undated; Ministry of Education and others 2007.
54. Inaddition, an extensive databaseon HIV surveillance (conducted every second year) exists inthe Ministry o f
Defense, but this was not available for analysis or use. This i s unfortunate becausethe prevalence data, especially
amongthe new conscripts, is likely the best approximation of incidence inEritrea.

generally occurred independently o f the project M&Emeasures envisaged inthe project
appraisal document.

3.22     The use o f data to guide implementationwas particularly strong inthe malaria control
program. The program had a detailed data collection system which involved malaria agents,
health stations, health centers, zoba-level andnational HMIS offices and malaria control program
offices. This data was usednot only to track outputs, but to track program effectiveness and
inform programming decisions. Inthe other disease control programs (HIV/AIDS, STI and
tuberculosis) there was only limited evidence that data were used to assess efficacy, program
effectiveness or impact. Nevertheless, the opportunity o fthe mid-termreview was used to
institute important changes (see paragraph 3-15),

Achievement of Objectives

3.23     The achievement o fthe objective o fthe HAMSeTControl Project-to                    reduce mortality
and morbidity due to the HAMSeTdiseases-is                  discussed separately for each disease. Table B-
3 inAnnex B provides greater detail on the outputs o f the ministries participating inthe
multisectoral component and the health promotion activities implemented by the MOH.

OBJECTIVE: REDUCETHE MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY DUE TO HIV/AIDS AND STIS55
3.24     The IDA credit was a major source of fundingfor the country's HIV/AIDS interventions
and accounted for 60 percent o f the country's total spending ($33.8 million) on HIV/AIDSover
the period 2001-2005. Jointly IDA and GOE accounted for two thirds (67 percent) o f the
country's HIV/AIDS spending. Starting in2005, a major new source o f funding-the Global
Fund-committed $3.6 million for HIV/AIDSwith a major commitment to funding AIDS care
and treatment.56

outputs
3.25     HIV preventive interventions included: extensive awareness-raising among the general
population and among key risk groups; encouraging and expanding voluntary counseling and
testing (VCT); behavior change activities targeting pupils and their parents;57condom-use and
behavior change campaigns and encouraging VCT among sex workers and truckers; condom
distribution; blood safety; and vocational and income-generating activities among sex workers.58



55. STIs are not discussed separatelyfromHIV/AIDS becausethe rationale for public intervention in STI control i s
integrallyrelatedto the fact that ulcerative STIs increase the risk ofHIVtransmission. Furthermore, the HIV/AIDS
and STIbehavioralinterventionsandrisk groups targetedendeavor to achievesimilar outcomes:deferredsexual
debut amongthe youth, partnerreductionand condomuse amonghighrisk groups.

O f the community-based sub-projects, the majority (58 percent) was for HIV/AIDS/STIs inthe

3.26      Successive National HIV/AIDS/STI Strategic Plans identified risk groups.                       59Coverage
o f behavior change interventions and condom distribution among the military appears to have
been universal, butfor security reasons data access was limited. In2006, the Ministry o f Labor
and Human Welfare estimated that there were 3,500 sex workers nationwide, and that the
project-financed interventions reached about 1,000 sex workers. Interventions were also
implemented by the MOHHealth Promotion Unit. It i s unfortunate that coverage data was not
collected.60 According to interviews duringthe IEGmission three-quarters o f all truck drivers
had been reached through awareness campaigns, but again no coverage data were available for
verification. Under the CMHRP component a tenth of interventions specifically targeted high-
risk groups andmore than halfof sub-projects were targeted at low-risk groups (Table 3-3).

3.27      Publicly distributed and socially marketed condoms increased by 62 percent between
2000 and 2003, after which total condom distribution declined-primarily                          due to a two-thirds
reduction incondoms distributed by the M O H (Figure 3-1). The reasons for the reduction in
condom distribution by M O H were two-fold: to reduce wastage, and to encourage private
purchase o f condoms. No information on private condom sales was available to assess the
responsiveness o f private condom demand. An additional source o f condoms was the Ministry
o f Defense; cumulatively 12 million condoms were distributed by the military over the project's
duration. The EritreanDefence Force distributed 'condom pouches' as part o fthe military




59. Youth were identifiedas an important risk group, yet surveys show low average levels of sexualactivity and the
lowest HIV prevalence. Medianage at first sex is between 17 and 18 years. In 1995,99.4 percentof women aged
15-19 years reported having no sexual partners and in2002 67.6 percenthad never had sexual intercourse(Macro
International 1995,2002).
60. The estimationof coveragehas many methodological challenges, as coverageis a function ofprogramreach as
well as intensity of exposure. While these challenges are recognized, even imperfect coveragedata couldhave
provided a startingpoint for future improvementsand couldhave assistedwith the construction of aresults chain
linking inputs and intermediate outcomes.

uniform to 90,000 members o f the armed forces. This sent a powerful (and visible) message
regardingthe military's commitment to HIV/AIDS prevention.

 3.28 Establishing new VCT centers, purchasing HIV tests, and information campaigns
 emphasizing the importance o f getting tested were major project outputs. At the start o fthe
 project VCT was available only ina few large towns, andby 2005 the number o f V C T centers
 had increased to 17. The number o f VCT clients progressively increased over the life o f the
 project, from roughly 2,000 in2001 to over 75,000 in2006 an important achievement (Table F-
 4 inAnnex F). Contributing to the increase indemand for VCT services was a socially
 enforced practice o f pre-marital HIV testing encouraged by all the religious bodies.61 Box 3-2
 points to some o fthe continuing controversies that exist inthe literature regardingthe
 effectiveness o f VCT. However, duringproject implementation the expansion o f V C T access
 was inline with the international best practice at the time. There i s still no consensus on this
 issue from HIV/AIDS authorities such as UNAIDS and WHO.

Box 3-2. Efficacy of voluntary counseling and testing
Voluntary counseling and testingfeaturedprominentlyinthe HIViAIDS response inEritrea. The benefitsof
counseling andtesting are saidto be: (i)an entry point for care, support andtreatment services for a personwho
tests positiveand to learn how to live positively by avoiding infection of other individuals; and (ii) the people
                                                                                                     for
who test negative-the overwhelmingmajority inEritrea-counseling andtesting i s saidto offer the opportunity for
the personto "plan one's future" and "commit to avoid risky behaviors." While HIV/AIDS experts, including
UNAIDS, havepromoted VCT as a key HIV preventionintervention,the more recent literaturesuggests that its
benefits for preventingthe spread ofHIV remain ambiguous.
The findings from a systematic reviewby Denisonet al. (2006) ofthe effect o f VCT on risk behavior found 14
studiesthat met the quality controlcriteria and concludedthe following: (i)one randomized controlledtrial showed
a significantly greater decrease inunprotectedsex with non-primarypartners among individualsinthe clients

61. The surge indemand for pre-maritaltestinghas resultedinsendingrelatively younger and lower-prevalence
adults to VCT centers, contributingto the drop inHIV prevalence among clients. Thus, HIV prevalencetrends in
VCT centers shouldbe interpretedwith great caution.

3.29       The project supported training o f healthworkers inthe syndromic management o f STIs,
especially at health stations and health centers, and training o f health professionals within the
MinistryofDefense.62 Itis well knowninthe literaturethat care for a significant share of STIs
i s sought inprivate facilities (private practitioners, pharmacists and other drug vendors),63 and
this is likely to be the case also inthe urban centers o f Eritrea. It is, therefore, unfortunate that
private entities were not more explicitly targeted with STItraining.

Outcomesand Impacts
3.30       Blood safety. The support to the National Blood Transfusion Service was initiated under
the Health Project (Table 2-4), and has beencontinued under the HAMSeT Control Project. The
National Blood Transfusion Service screens all donated blood and maintains rigorous quality
assurance standards, subjecting 1 in20 o f blood units tested (positive or negative) to testing at
the National Health Laboratory for externalquality assurance. Over the years the transfusion
service's capacity has expanded to meet the country's increasingblood supply needs-in                              2006
nearly six thousand blood units were screened, which i s 41 percent more than in2003.

3.3 1      STIpreventionand control. Knowledge of STIs other than HIV/AIDSwas low at the
start o f the project-in       2002 some 58 percent o f women of reproductive age reportedno
knowledge o f STI symptoms.64 Among high-riskgroups knowledge was better-in                                 the 2001
RGBIS survey, about 60 percent o f respondents from highrisk groups had correct knowledge o f
STIs other than HIV.65Duringfield visits, IEGfound that youth, factory workers, and sex
workers were generally able to spontaneously mention the major STIs.

3.32       Prior to 2001, there was a downward trend inSTIs treated inpublic health centers and
hospitals (Figure 3-2). Over the period 2001-2006, the downward trend slowed, while STI cases
diagnosed syndromically inhealth stations steadily increased.66 According to the HAMSeT
Final Report, at project closing a large share o f healthworkers was not able to manage STIs
using the syndromic approach.67 The only source o f population-based trend data on STIs i s the
HIV sentinel surveillance survey among antenatal clinic attendees, which also collects data on
syphilis prevalence. The syphilisprevalence rate among A N C attendees decreased by a third
from 1.7 percent in2003 to 1.1 percent in2007.




62. 1,486 doctors, nurses, battalion health officers were also trained insyndromic STI management.

65. MOH2001 (p. 6).
66. It is unclear from the HMIS data what share o f these cases were referred to the health centers and for this reason
the STIs cases from the two sources have not beenadded to arrive at atotal numberof STIs casestreated at
hospitals, health centers and health stations. The increasing trend at health stations could reflect better detection o f
STIs inhealth stations (conceivably associated with the project-financed training) or a real increase in STI incidence
(which would reflect a failure o f prevention).
67. I t is worth noting that the number o f pharmacies, drug shops and drug vendors-all      sources o f alternative STI
treatment-increased     between 2000 and 2006. This potentially could have drawn patients away from the public
sector, but statistics on private treatment o f STIs are not available for verification.

'3.33     HIV awareness, knowledge andriskperception. The level ofAIDS awareness and
 knowledge o f HIV/AIDS preventionwas already relatively highat the start o fthe project. In
 2002 96 percent o f women aged 15-49 years had heardo f AIDS, 88 percent thought that AIDS
 was preventable, and 76 percent knewthat a healthy-looking person could have AIDS.68More
 thanthree quarters ofthe youth (aged 15-1 9 years) correctly identifiedcondom use as a
 prevention method and more thanninety percent identified partner reduction as a prevention
 method (Table F-5 inAnnex F). Among sex workers perception o f no HIV risk decreased from
 83 percent to 5 1percent between2001 and 2004.69 Self-perception o f HIV risk among sex
 workers thus increased substantially between 2001 and 2004, but it i s worth noting that half of
 sex workers still perceive themselves to be at no risk for HIV.

 3.34     Behavior change. There were no baseline or trend data on consistent condom use with
 non-regular partners, the number o f non-regular partnersor participation in commercial sex, in
 general or among high-riskgroups. Data from two cross-sectional behavioral surveys reported
 that the number o f women inbarsreporting condom ever-use increased from 63 percent in2001
 to 84 percent in2004.70 However, ina 2007 survey half o f sex workers reported having steady
 boyfriends or `mini-husbands' and o f these only 13 percent reported condom use. Among &my
 conscripts there seems to be a highlevel o f awareness and condom use. For example, in2001
 the HIV/AIDS Risk Groups and Risk Behavior Identification Survey (RGBIS) showed the
 smallest difference betweenage at first sex and age o f first condom use among army
 conscripts-for      the other risk groups the difference was between 2 to 8 years compared to no

 69. In2001,nearlythree quarters (72 percent) ofrespondentsdid notperceive themselves at any risk of HIV
 infection, comparedto 47 percent in2006. For a country with a low-level epidemic concentrated inhigh-risk groups
 it may not surprisingthat halfof adults perceivethemselves at no risk for HIV. Of greater importance is the
 perceptionof risk among high-risk groups. The differences inrisk perceptionamong sex workers between2001 and
 2004 have to be interpretedwith cautionbecause of differences inthe definition of sex workers across the two
 surveys.
 70. Quoted from ESMG/FHIbehavior study (2004) inMOH(20060. Over the years there has beenemerging
 consensus inthe HIV.prevention literaturethat this variable somewhat flawed that what matters is `consistent
 condomuse' or `condom use at last sex act' not `ever condomuse.'

difference for army conscript^.^^ Given the gaps inthe evidence base on partnerreduction or
consistent condom use caution i s needed as one makes inferences about the impacts o f the
prevention interventions on behavior change. Similar reservations were expressed inthe
independent evaluation commissionedby the MOHq7*

3.35      Up until2005 the country appeared to havebeenable to maintaina low-level epidemic
(Table 3-4 and Figure 3-3). The new evidence from the 2007 HIV sentinel surveillance survey
shows a decrease innew HIV infections and i s indicative o f important successesinHIV
prevention. Trends inHIV prevalence among 15-24 year olds are less likely to suffer from the
limitations o f HIV prevalence data as an indicator o f impact o f prevention interventions than
HIV prevalence among 15-49 year olds (because infections among 15-24 year olds are more
likely to be new HIV infections). Between 2003 and 2007 there was a steady downward trendin
HIV prevalence among 15-24 year old antenatal clinic attendees, representing a 57 percent
reduction inHIV prevalence inthis age group (Figure 3-3). These findings are furthermore
supported by the 32 percent decrease in syphilis prevalence among antenatal clinic attendees
between 2003 and 2007.

3.36    Care and Stigma reduction. The project made major inroads inexpanding home-based
care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and orphans, and inreducing
stigma. The project was directly responsible for funding the creation of Bidho, the Eritrean
organization of PLWHA, inJanuary 2002. This achievement is not trivial giventhe conservative
andrelatively closed community structure. As ofNovember 2005, Bidho membershiphad
reachednearly 6,000 PLWHA and their relatives. According to the National HIV/AIDS/STI and
Tuberculosis Control Division (NATCoD), by the end of the project 3,000 people living with
HIV/AIDS were getting support through home-basedcare.73The project providedabout $0.4
million ingrants for training, care, financial support and counseling for PLWHA. According to a
MOLHW survey there were 2,800 AIDS orphans in2005, andunder the project each orphan
received 200 Nakfaper month.74 The 27 CMHRP sub-projects for the care and support of
orphans accountedfor 15 percent of all CMHRP grant funds allocated to HIV/AIDS.

laboratory technicians, communicabledisease control (CDC) coordinatorsand 70 percent of health workers at the
toba-level.

training o f nursingstaff and technicians in support o f DOTS expansion. For a large part o fthe
project tuberculosis control efforts were lagging, largely due to staffing problems. After'the mid-
term review some o f the staffing problems were addressed through additional training and
procurement of long-term technical assistance. Drugprocurement that was started under
PHARPE was extended under the HAMSeT project. DOTS i s available in70 percent o f
facilities where smear microscopy i s available, but it i s unclear inwhat share o f facilities smear
microscopy (including reagents) i s available.

3.38       The Tuberculosis PrevaZence,Surveywas conducted in2005. This was the first
tuberculosis survey conducted inthe Africa region. However, there were some design, quality
and technical limitations (Box 3-3). Some o f the disagreements on tuberculosis epidemiology
persistedwell after the survey was completed. Furthermore, the prevalence survey was not able
to assess the reasons for the country's low case detectionrates, one o f its objectives.

Box 3-3. The epidemiologyof TuberculosisinEritrea-some lingeringquestions
There is substantialdisagreementonthe epidemiologyoftuberculosisinEritrea-in particular, onthe tuberculosis
prevalenceandcase detectionrate-to           the extent that it has hamperedimplementation.* The first tuberculosis survey
conductedinEritreain 2005 among individuals 15 year olds andolder, as is standardpractice for tuberculosis
surveys. It estimateda prevalenceof 90 new smear positive cases per 100,OOObinindividuals aged 15years and
older. Total populationprevalencewas estimatedat 50 per 100,000,assumingthat 44 percentof the Eritrean
populationwas under-15years of age andzero tuberculosisprevalenceamongthis age group.'

These resultsare muchlower than the World HealthOrganization's (WHO) prevalenceestimate of250 per 100,000,
which is basedona widely usedrule ofthumb intuberculosis epidemiology and informedby data fromneighboring
countries. A further source of disagreementis the populationestimateusedas the denominator. WHO uses 4.1
million andNATCoDuses 3.2 million, Le., the populationestimateusedby WHO is 29 percenthigherthanthe
estimateusedbyNATCoD. Usingthe approachdescribedabove WHO estimatedcase detectionrate at between 13.2
and 19.4 percent for 2006. The NTCP estimatedtuberculosis case detectionrate at 43 percentfor the same year.

a. The survey was conductedamong 38,047 individuals. Halfof this sample was under-15 years old and, as is standard in TB
surveys, these respondents were not part ofthe sputumsurvey. Basedon the study's case definition, 15 new smear positive cases
were detected in the survey. The prevalenceestimate,corrected for under-samplingof men and other design effects, yielded a
smear positiveprevalenceestimateof 90 per 100,000 for adults. The survey hadsome limitations:(i) the large share of individuals
who providedsalivasamples instead of sputumsamples; and (ii) the loss of 1,378 samplesfor testing. Some of the possible
explanation citedfor the latter are: handlingin of empty sputumcups by includedindividualsto the field teams; contaminationof
sputumcup so that the sputumsample couldnot be examined, loss of sputumcups by the field or laboratory teams, incorrect
recordingby field team, or incorrectrecordingof laboratory resultby laboratory team. Finally, although the study had intendedto
assess the reasons for low case detection in additionto prevalenceestimation, it did not shed much light on case detectionwhich is
particularlyvexing in the Eritreancontext.
b. Confidence interval(95 percent): 35-145 per 100,000.
c. Nojustification of this assumption is provided. This assumption is questionablebasedon the following: Tuberculosiswas one
o f the leading causes o f death among childrenunder 5 years (MOH 2006a). In 2006 children under-5years accounted for 7
percent of out-patienttuberculosis cases, 12percent of in-patienttuberculosis cases and 7 percent of tuberculosis mortality.

3.39       There were few CMHRP sub-projects on tuberculosis and their distribution by zoba was
poorly correlated with the distribution o f tuberculosis inthe country. Only 8.2 percent o f
CMHRP sub-projects were specifically devoted to tuberculosis (Table E-2c inAnnex E). It is,
however, conceivable that 7.9 percent o fjoint HAMSeT sub-projects could have contributed to
raisingtuberculosis awareness, sensitization, and training. Over half o f the tuberculosis sub-
projects financed nutrition for tuberculosis patients, DOTS, and outreach; the extent to which

                                                           36


these activities were linked to the National Tuberculosis Program i s unclear, and there i s no
information on their effecti~eness.~~

3.40       The weaknesses inthe tuberculosis program caused the project team to prioritize and
emphasize tuberculosis inthe project oversight andtechnical support. Some o f the most
important deficiencies o f tuberculosis control during the course o f the project were: (i)
organizational and planningweaknesses inthe National Tuberculosis Control Program, including
human resource constraint^;^^ (ii)        while passive case detectioncorrectly remains the core method
o f tuberculosis case detection, only recently has there been moves to use active case detectionto
complement passive case dete~tion;~'(iii)            low level o f community participationto complement
facility-based disease control efforts; and (iv) continued disagreements on tuberculosis
epidemiology betweenthe M O H and the international community (Box 3-3).

Outcomesand Impacts
3.41       Aside from knowledge o fpersistentcoughing, awareness o f other tuberculosis symptoms
was generally modest. Householddata from 2005 found that about 80 percent o f menand
women reported knowledge o fpersistent coughing as a tuberculosis symptom.80 However,
knowledge o f the most distinguishingfeature o f tuberculosis, night sweats, was reportedamong
less than 10 percent o f respondents. A tenth o f women did not know any tuberculosis symptoms.

3.42       Performance relative to the lobal "Stop TB" targets for tuberculosis control has been
mixed, as illustrated inFigure 3-4.8K Case detection increased from 35 percent in 1999 to 43
percent for 2006, well below the Stop TB target o f 70 percent.82 There has been greater success
intuberculosis treatment-cure rate increased from 73 percent in2003 to 81percent in2006, just
short o f the Stop TB target o f 85 percent. Morbidity data show downward trends inthe latter
half o f the project's life from a highof 4,200 in2003 to 2,900 in2006.83 This has largely been


77. Another 39 percent oftuberculosis sub-projects were labeledas non-specific "tuberculosis prevention & control"
or "outreach" or simply "tuberculosis project," so it is impossible to know what was actually financed. A
tuberculosis discussionguide for the CMHRP activities was completed only in2008, under the HAMSeT-I1Project.
78. According to the independentevaluationofthe HAMSeT ControlProject: "The NationalTB Control
Programme is probably still struggling to assert itselfinthe context ofthe NATCoD. Particularly, it suffers from a
lack of anumber of qualified human resources, and has no dedicatedrepresentativeat the zoba level, since the CDC
shares its activities betweenHIV/AIDS, STIs and TB. There are no real epidemiologists at the decentralizedlevels,
and TB promoters, even if very usehl inorder to bringup awareness aboutthe disease and building up community
responses, are not enoughfor the implementation of a solid and sustainableDOTS-oriented strategy." (Kerouedan
and Appaix (2006, p80) inMOH2006f).
79. A feature ofthe plan for 2008 is to include active case detection, including among PLWHA.
80. MOH2006d.
81. The targets of the Stop TB initiative are: case detectionrate o f 70 percent and cure rate of 85 percent.
82. According to NATCoD data case detectionwas 69 percentin2003 (just underthe global target of 70 percent),
but this figure seems questionable given the more recent estimate of43 percent for 2006 (MOH 2008b).
83. Two sources shown inTable 3-5 are from NATCoD Annual Report for 2007 and HIMS data for 2005 and
2006. The NATCoD data shows a downward trend after 2003, while the HMIS data suggest a decreaseof 14.2
percentbetween2005 and 2006. Note, the HMIS estimates are 40-50 percenthigher than the NATCoD data for the
same years.

Bed-netdistribution peakedat 220,000 in2004, then steadily declinedto 81,000 in2006.
Initially, eachhousehold inmalarious areas received one free bed-net,andthis was subsequently
increasedto two bed-netsper household, or more for large households. Annual bed-net
impregnation sharply increased from less than 10,000 in2000 to 660,000 in2006. Between
2001 and 2005 the bed-netre-impregnation rate increasedfrom 53 to 93 percent. Indoor residual
spraying (IRS) peakedat 97,000 households in2003 IRS, declining to 69,000 householdsin
2006 as selectivity improved.84The use of DDT gradually decreased over the project lifespan
and other insecticides less toxic to humansincreased(e.g., malathi~n).~~Households insub-

3.44     The project also financed substantial training o fhealthworkers, community health
workers and community members inmalaria detection and treatment. Joint HAMSeT training
workshops for health workers, HAMSeT control guidelines and policies were developed and
implemented. Topics specific to malaria included rapid detection and treatment, as well as the
treatment o f severe malaria inhospitals. Stronger links with health center and health station staff
were forged with the view to improve quality o f malaria clinical management. Beyond this, the
project financed eight additional meteorological stations, which became operational in2002,
bringingthe country's total to 11stations.

Outcomesand Impacts
3.45      Knowledge and behavior. There were high levels o f knowledge and awareness o f malaria
risks, symptoms andcontrol measures. Bed-net ownership increased substantially between 2002
and2006, butbed-net use data are harder to interpret. In2006 more than ninetypercent o f
respondents identified bed-netsas the best malaria preventive method, and more than 80 percent
knew at least three malaria symptoms and at least two ways to prevent malariaag8Between 2002
and 2006 bed-netownership increased from 34 percent to three quarterso frespondents, and
about 90 percent inmalarious zobas (Table 3-6). Insecticide-treated bed-net utilization i s
confounded by seasonal effects and the regional distribution o fthe disease.

3.47      Incidence, morbidity and mortality. There were substantial decreases inmalaria
morbidity and mortality and over time, a larger share o fthe improvement inincidence can be
ascribed to malaria control interventions. Between2001 and 2006 malaria morbidity decreased
by 85 percent (Figure 3-5).93 As mentioned inparagraph 2.23, between 1999 and 2003, halfo f
the variance inmalaria incidence could be explained by variance inrainfall pattern. However,
after 2004 there was a divergence inthe trend inmalaria incidence and rainfall trends (Figure
2-3). After 2003 the share o f the variance inmalaria incidence explained by rainfall trends drops
to a third, suggesting that malaria control interventions increasingly account for a larger share o f
the reduction inmalaria morbidity and mortality.

start o fthe project there was already a significant decline inmalaria incidence after the peak
reached duringthe 1998 outbreak. Under HAMSeT, the Bank financed 38 percent o f the NMCP
expenditure and attribution for the success is clearly shared.94 This share may appear modest,
butthe Bank was able to finance expenditures that could not be financed from other sources.
According to interviewees, the Bank-financing was instrumental infunding community-based
vector control and the malaria agents, thought to be critical to the overall success o f Eritrea's
malaria control efforts. Infact, Eritrea was the first country inAfrica to achieve the Abuja
targets for malaria control.

Project Ratings

,3.49    The outcome ofthe HAMSeTProject is ratedmoderately satisfactory. This outcome
rating i s derived from the ratings (relevance, efficacy and efficiency) as they apply to the
diseases addressed inthe project: malaria, HIV/AIDS and STIs, and tuberculosis (Table 3-7).

3.50     Relevance. Overall relevance i s rated highfor malaria, and substantial for
HIV/AIDS/STIs andtuberculosis.
3.5 1    Relevance of objective. The objective was to reduce morbidity andmortality from the
HAMSeTdiseases. The project objectives focused on the maincauses o fthe country's disease
burden, andwere consistent with the Bank's past and current strategic documents which stressed
the development o f Eritrea's human resource base, the support o f sustainable investments inthe
health sector andmitigating the socio-economic and disease burdenfrom malaria and
HIV/AIDS.95
3.52     Relevance of project design. One o f the most important strengths o f the project design
was that it addressed multiplediseases under one project, taking into account the country's
human resource constraints, and successfully complementing cross-cutting health system
functions such as health promotion, surveillance, laboratory services, drug distribution and
logistics. The project was also multisectoral innature and the sectors were chosen on the basis
o f their comparative advantage indisease control. The design did not include a National AIDS
Council, which did not appear to compromise the program's success. Inaddition, the emphasis
on software investments complementedthe hardware focus o fthe HealthProject that was still
underway at the time o f project appraisal. There were, however, a few areas o f concern
regarding the project design: (i)   the complexity o f the project relative to the country capacity
evident especially early inthe project, and (ii)        the complementarity betweenthe government- and
community implementedactivities could have beenimproved.

Efficacy

3.53     Malaria. Although malaria incidence was already starting to decline at the start o f the
HAMSeT Control Project, by all measures the continued malaria control efforts inEritrea have
been highly successful, evidenced by the 85 percent decline inmalaria morbidity between2001
and 2006 even inthe face o f increases inaverage rainfall, as in2004 (Figure 2-3). Efficacy i s
therefore rated high.
3.54     HIV/AIDS and STIs. Efficacy i s rated substantial. While the evidence o fbehavior
change i s limited there are several factors, including proxies o f HIV incidence, which point to
important successes. There was explicit targetingby risk category, and almost universal
coverage o f HIV prevention inthe militarywas an important success given that nearly every
young adult spends some time inthe military (because o fthe national conscription policy).
Other notable achievements are improvements inblood safety, and expanded uptake o f VCT.
Most importantly, the declining trends inHIV prevalence among 15-24 year old antenatal clinic
attendees together with the declining rates o f syphilis are suggestive o f successful HIV
prevention. The project was also successful at stigma reduction, extending care and support for
PLWHA, and support to orphans and vulnerable children.
3.55     Tuberculosis. While there has been a downward trend intuberculosis morbidity inrecent
years, the case detection rate has showed modest improvements, and the staffing problems and
lagging performance o f the tuberculosis control program leads one to question whether the
downward trend could be fully attributed to the project. Efficacy o f i s rated modest.
Efficiency

3.56     The overall designwas efficient inthat it combinedmultiple diseasesinthe same project.
3.57     Malaria. The efficiency o f malaria interventions i s substantial. The implementation o f
malaria control interventions was specifically targeted at areas with highmalaria risk, informed
by the malaria control program's early warning system and threshold analysis. The targeting
strategy was constantly updated as the disease was controlled insome areas and other challenges
remain. As recommendedby Graves (2004) a remaining challenge targeting less accessible but
highincidence sub-zobas inGash Barka.

                                                        42


3.58     HIVIAIDS and STIs. Efficiency i s ratedmodest for HIV/AIDS and STIs. The project
was efficient inthe way it targeted highrisk groups, selectively involved relevant ministriesin
HIV prevention and care activities, andthe fact that the project usedexisting structures to
coordinate the government's HIV response from within the MOH. The implementationo f the
CMHRP was, however, characterized by coordination weaknesses and some o f the community
projects did not have a direct links with HAMSeTdisease control. The challenges especially
affected HIV/AIDS activities (as these accounted for 60 percent o f CMHRP sub-projects).
3.59     Tuberculosis. Efficiency is ratedmodest because it failed to complement facility-based
disease control interventions with community-basedapproaches such as active case-finding and
outreach to communities, as was adopted under the HAMSeT-I1Project.
3.60     The project's riskto developmentoutcome is moderate. There is ahighlevel of
government ownership and many o f the project investments, especially those inthe MOH, have
been institutionalized. The community-baseddisease control efforts are relatively sustainable
giventhe reliance on volunteer inputs. However, the healthfacility-based inputsare at some risk
inthe face o f likely fiscal constraints facingthe healthsystem given the challenging economic
outlook and the on-going "no war no peace" situation.

3.61     BankPerformance. Overall Bankperformance is ratedsatisfactory. Quality-at-entry
was satisfactory. The design was highly selective inthe sectoral involvement and prioritized
participation based on sectors' comparative and strategic advantage o f specific sectors in
HAMSeTdisease control, and keptthe number of new structures to a minimum. The multiple
disease designtook into account the humanresource constraints. The design o fthe CMHRP
lacked detail and could have done a betterjob at ensuring complementarity between the
community-managed activities and MOH's and other sectors' disease control efforts.

3.62     Insupervisingthe projectthe Bank providedcapable resource people-either                    directly
from the Bank or, as commented by some interviewees, through referral to consultants with
relevantexperience, an important resource for a country that is isolated as Eritrea. The borrower
perceivedthe Bank to be extremely responsive, while sometimes being constructively critical.
The Bank was also complementedfor the problem solving and flexibility it demonstrated.
Despite the dominance o f the Bank as one o f the few remaining donors inthe sector, the Bank
involved other donor partners on field visits and inreview meetings.

3.63     Annex B lists the frequency o f missions and their composition. On average, missions
were conducted six monthly, coupled with technical support and targeted consultancies. Table 3-
8 shows a comparison o f the average annual resources for supervision relative to other projects
managed by the HNP sector board. The average annual supervision budgets were a fifthless
than the average for other HNP project^.'^ Giventhe complexity o f the project-reflected                    inthe

average for HNP projects inthe Africa region (Table 3.8).

constrained but creatively usedto good effectg7 There were, however, some weaknesses, for
example, the supervision o f the CMHRP component could have been ingreater detail, although
remedies for some o f the shortcomings inCMHRP were implementedat mid-term review.
Because o f the low supervision resources and less so because of the performance o f the project
team, supervision i s rated moderately satisfactory.

 a. 7.2 years reflects the duration from the date of Board approval (December 1997) to the projectclosingdate (December2004). It can be
 arguedthat for the last two years of the HealthProject there was overlap with the HAMSeT Control Project and that this implied some cost
 savings.
 b.The durationof supervision is estimatedfrom the date of Boardapproval (March2001) to the projectclosing date (March 2006).

3.64      Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory overall. Government performance is rated
satisfactory despitethe challenging macroeconomic context and the ongoing "no war, no peace"
situation. The leadership o fthe Minister o f Planning at the cabinet level contributed to the
success o f the multisectoral collaboration, ensuring that the contribution o f the various sectors
was acknowledged (or criticized when inputs were deficient-something                                        that the Minister o f
Health i s less able to do with fellow ministers). While the M O H performed particularly well in
the area o f malaria control, and reasonably well inHIV/AIDS control, there were some
weaknesses inoverseeing and implementing the CMHRP. However, the PMUhas to be
complemented for fiduciary compliance-during the project's duration there were no fiduciary
irregularities or audit objections. Infact, ininstances where sub-project funds were usedfor
unintended purposes the amounts were retrievedfrom the awardees. Implementingagency
performance i s rated satisfactory.

3.65      Monitoring and evaluation is rated modest. The M&E designhad important limitations,
most notably the absence o f an M&E plan at appraisal and lack o ftargets for the KPIs. M&E
implementation and utilization was weakened by the late preparation o f the M&E planand the
absence o f baseline data. The NMCP benefitted from a detailed information system to detect
new outbreaks, and evidence-based planningand program management to target highrisk areas
and prioritize resource allocation. For the other diseases, monitoring o f coverage among risk
groups and evaluation of efficacy o f interventions was lacking. The Ministry shouldbe
complemented for commissioning M O H an independent evaluation o f the HAMSeT Project.



97. For example, given the constrainedsupervision resources occasionally supervisionwas conductedthrough a
series of video-conferencesover a period of aweek involving the various counterparts ingovernment and outside of
government involvedwith implementation.

The evaluation was candid and o f highquality, and it i s unfortunate that M&E during the project
lifespan did not benefit from this level o f quality inorder to inform implementation.

4. Conclusion

4.1     Over the period 1998-2006 the Bank contributed $63.1 millionto the financing o fthe
sector, and this assessment has documented evidence o f outcomes and impacts associated with
this financing. There havebeenmany successesbutalso some missedopportunities. Several
lessons emerge from the experience of implementing the two projects and insights into the
Bank's value addedthat may inform future Bank operations inEritrea or elsewhere.

Lessons

4.2     Inpost-conflictsettings engagement is a means to an end, and needsto be
accompaniedby a sustainedpolicydialogueto ensure that developmentgains are realized
inthe mediumterm. The experience of Eritrea confirms one o fthe lessons from IEG's 2006
evaluation, Engagingwith Fragile States.98Inthe late 1990s the Bank's dialogue with Eritrea's
health was highly contentious, but despite the initial technical disagreements the Bank engaged
the sector. While the HealthProject was not fully successful, itis unlikely that the development
gains inthe decade that followed under the HAMSeTprojects would have been realized inthe
absence o f the early engagement inthe sector. The content o f the sectoral dialogue that followed
the initial engagement was able to steer the sector from the post-conflict "reconstruction mode''
to a "development mode.'' The reorientation o f the sectoral priorities was only possible with
sustained and sometimes challenging dialogue underpinnedby analytical work.

4.3     Inthe area of HIV/AIDS a demand-drivenmodelof community sub-projectsis
moreappropriatefor service deliveryinterventionsthat are responsiveto localcommunity
needs (such as home-basedcare, support to orphansandvulnerablechildren)than for
preventiveinterventionstargetingstigmatizedriskgroups or stigmatizedbehavior. The
community component was based on a demand-driven model that i s implemented inmany AIDS
projects. Inthe HAMSeT Control Project the community component financed a combination o f
HIV/AIDSprevention, care andsupport activities. The project experience demonstrated that
community demand (on which the demand-driven approach i s based) i s sub-optimal as a basis
for allocation for programs aimed at stigmatized risk groups or behavior.

4.4     Community activitiesthat are strategicallyplannedand coordinatedwith the local
healthauthoritiescan providean importantcomplementto healthfacility-baseddisease
controlefforts. Community outreach and community-basedactivities proved to be key
elements o f the highly successful malaria control efforts. Malaria agents (specialized community
health workers) were trained by the malaria control program and served as health educators,
assisted with bed-netdistribution, bed-net re-impregnation, liaison with community leaders and
coordinating o f community source reduction efforts. Inaddition, they provided a link between
communities and the health systems, referring complicated cases to health facilities and

participating incase reporting for M&E. Incontrast, some o f the deficiencies o f the tuberculosis
control efforts can be linkedto the limitedcommunity involvement. The NTCP was based on a
health facility-centered model o f disease control and strongly relied on passive case detectionfor
tuberculosis control. There was only limitedoutreach to communities causing case detectionto
be one o fthe weakest aspects o f the NTCP. It is a missed opportunity that there has not been
greater learning and sharingo f practices across these two disease control programs.

4.5     Disease control projects can be complementary to-and           need not u n d e r m i n e
cross-cutting health system functions. Inthe HAMSeT Control Project various cross-cutting
functions and systems were strengthened (e.g., healthpromotion, disease surveillance, laboratory
service, drug distribution) because the sector's leadership sought to achieve programmatic
efficiencies across individual disease control programs instead o f duplicating these systems for
each disease control program. This experience i s particularly important giventhe debates inthe
international health community about the negative impacts o f disease-specific projects on health
systems.

4.6     Multi-sector projects, such as A I D S projects, achieve better results if the sectors
involved are strategically chosen according to their comparative advantage in disease
prevention and control. The HAMSeT Control Project prioritized the participation o f sectors
based on the comparative advantage o f each sector inHAMSeT disease control, allowing the
country's disease control efforts to balance comprehensiveness with selectivity inorder to
achieve maximal disease impact.

Value-added

4.7     The most important areas o fvalue-added o fthe Bank can be dividedinto the following
areas:

    a) Scale. Against the counterfactual o f no Bank support, all officials felt that the
       interventions under the HealthProject as well as under the HAMSeT Control Project
       would have been implemented but at a smaller scale and with fewer resources.

    b) Community-based approach. A key contribution o fthe Bank was stressingthe
       importance o f community action to complement the increase inservice delivery offered
       by the MOH. According to interviewees, without the Bankthe M O Hwould have
       focused mainly on the supply-side (i.e., service delivery), but not on the demand-side
       (raising community awareness or generating demand for services). An important caveat
       is that community involvement has to be strategically plannedand coordinated with the
       local disease health authorities inorder to complement health facility-based disease
       control efforts.

    c) Bank involvement brings credibility and international approval. The Bank was, and
       continues to be, a respected partner. Both projects were o f a large scale and relatively
       complex. Particularly with the first project the government needed the Bank's support
       and impliedapproval because o f the weight it carries interms o f getting support and
       approval o f the rest o f the multilateral and bilateral donors.

                                                     46


        Imulementation support andtechnical advice. The achievements under the two projects
        strongly benefitedfrom the Bank's technical advice and implementation support. These
        were particularly important inan isolated country such as Eritrea. While not uncritical o f
        the Bank,various M O H staff as well as donor partners acknowledgedthe Bank's support
        inthese two areas. This value addedwas particularly noticeablewith the initiationo fthe
        GFATM activities-which           occur largely inthe absence o f the implementation support
        and technical advice.

        Readiness to accept GFATM assistance. The foundation laid by the HAMSeT Control
        Project and its successor was a key contributor to the country's ability to qualify for and
        successfully utilize the Global Fundresources. This i s not a trivial achievement giventhe
        country's isolation and dire economic situation.

        The Bank's value-added has evolved over time. Inthe 1990sthe Bankwas primarily
viewed as a source o f financing for infrastructure improvements. This evolved over time, as
discussed earlier, to a partnershipthat spans hardware and software interventions. A trusted
relationship has evolved over time that has formed the basis o f a strong sectoral dialogue,
although this does not imply that the M O H or the GOE agrees with all the Bank's policy
recommendations. With the increase inGlobal Fundfunding, the importance o f the Bank's
financing for disease control has reduced, and the Bank i s increasingly focusing on under-funded
priority areas such as human resource strengtheningand reproductive health.

RemainingChallenges

4.9     The Eritreanhealthsector has experienced significant changes since independence,
startingwith reconstructiono fdevastated healthfacilities, expansion of disease control efforts
focusing especially on the HAMSeTdiseases, and now a strong focus on reproductive health and
humanresources. There are several challenges remaining, andtwo are highlightedhere.

4.10    Improving sectoral efficiency. Hospitals account for half o fthe MOH's total
expenditure yet hospitals operate at very low levels o f efficiency, evidenced by the low bed
occupancy rates.99 The challenging economic environment will continue to place pressure on the
MOH's resources, and heightenthe need to ensure optimal returns to existing health expenditure,
especially hospital spending. A candid assessment i s needed by the M O H to explore ways to
improve the efficiency o f hospital service delivery-for      example, through outsourcing o f excess
hospital capacity inurban centers where appropriate, reduction o f untapped capital investments
through selling o f new and unusedhospital equipment especially inthe new hospitals,
management training for hospital superintendants, and establishing hospital performancetargets
and monitoring hospital management performance.

4.11    Getting the most out of disease-specific development assistance.The HAMSeT
experience has demonstrated that disease-specific resources can contribute to improving various
systems inthe sector (for example, disease surveillance, laboratory services, and drug



99. In2005 hospitalsaccountedfor 47 percent o f MOH expenditure(2005 World Bank 2008b). The median bed
occupancy rate for the country was 42 percentbasedon 2006 HMIS data (MOH 2007a).

                                                47


distribution) without losingthe focus and outcome orientation of diseasecontrol programs. The
availability of large amounts of development assistancethrough the Global Fundprovides
another opportunity to improve health outcomes among the poor while strengthening the systems
necessary for the sustainability of the diseasecontrol efforts. Indoing so the Eritreanhealth
sector will move beyond the vertical versus horizontal debates, and give practical meaningto the
call for synergy betweendisease control and systems strengtheninginthe Bank's new 2007 HNP
Strategy.

101,Nonetheless, GashBarka is the zoba that has shown the largest increase inthe number of beds between2000
and2006. The largest source of the increase was Tessenei Hospital(adding 34 beds; from 84 beds in2000 to 118 in
2005/06 comparedto the addition of 19 beds from BarentuHospitalover the same period). It is worth notingthat
Gash Barka currently has the highest bedto population ratio: 3.59 per 1,000 versus a national average of 0.65 per
1,000. (MOH 2007a). This is basedon the population estimates usedby the HMIS.
102.In 1998, at the start ofthe project, there were 49 health centers and 149 health stations.
103.The equipment and furniture included: delivery beds, hospital beds, examination couch, baby cribs, medication
cabinets, drug dispensingtables, office tables, and chairs.

105.Kebabi administration offices maintain records of all the householdsundertheirjurisdiction. Basedon kebabi
householdregistration datanets are issuedand re-impregnatedby malaria agents with the cooperation of health
facility staff.
106. The NMCP, with the help o f kebabi leaders, distinguishesbetweenmalarious andnon-malarious villages based
on recentmalaria cases or overall malaria risk.Classification as amalarious village is accompaniedby free bed-nets.
Despite the incentive for over-classification of malarious villages bed-netdistribution is tightly controlled by the
kebabi administration.
107.Vector control is hardto quantify becausebreeding sites may vary from a small pool to ariver, andthe outputs
should be interpreted with this caveat inmind.

     Annex E.Analysis of approvedCMHRP sub-projects

             This annex presents detailed tabulations o fthe approved sub-projects financed through the
   Community-Managed HAMSeT Response Program (CMHRP). According to the PMU, as o f the
   project's closing, a total o f 941 sub-projects had been approved and 908 had been completed. The 33
   projects that had been approved but not launchedwere financed out o f HAMSeT 11.

             The documentation o fthe sub-projects by the central PMUwas generally weak, as most o f the
   control o fthese funds was at the zoba level. However, the P M U facilitated IEG in obtaining the complete
   list o f approved sub-projects for zobas Anseba, Maekel, Northern Red Sea, and Southern Red Sea, and
   partial lists for Debub (71 percent o f approved sub-projects) and Gash Barka (89 percent o f approved sub-
   projects, see Table D-1). Thus, IEGwas able to analyze 844, or 90 percent, o f the 939 approved sub-
   projects."'   However, this analysis was limited exclusively to the sub-project approvals; no information
   was available on the efficacy o f any o f the sub-projects.

             There was no standard reporting format for sub-projects across the zobas, particularly prior to the
   mid-term review. The disease to be addressed, the specific activities to be implemented, the responsible
   agency for implementation(for example, the community, a line ministry, a non-government entity), the
   target group for the intervention, and the dates o f approval, implementation, and completion, were not
   consistently reported across zobas. IEG also found many inconsistencies in summingthe total grant
   amounts and the total number o f sub-projects. Additional tables are available from IEGwith more
   detailed disaggregated data.
