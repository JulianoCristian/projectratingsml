side-effects,\n            unless properly planned, and managed. The continued use of\n            the insecticide DDT is a major concern, and this evaluation\n            finds that, consistent with the World Health\n            Organization's guidelines, its use is effective, when\n            used in high risk areas to prevent epidemic conditions.\n            However, plans to phase out DDT should be developed, and\n            alternate replacement insecticides tested. Recommendations,\n            and mitigating measures include: 1) annual testing - for a\n            period of five years - of the susceptibility of vectors in\n            the field of DDT. In addition, pyrethroids, and other\n            formulations, should be tested to select the most suitable,\n            based on efficacy, safety, and economic value, and be\n            pilot-tested against DDT during the third to fifth year,\n            when DDT should begin phasing-out; 2) capacity building, and\n            strengthening the infrastructure of the National Malaria\n            Control Program, focusing on entomology training, and\n            collection of baseline biological data, to support\n            monitoring of vector control components; 3) develop a\n            strategy for community-based implementation, and maintenance\n            of insecticide impregnated bed nets; and, 4) improve the\n            collection, and analysis of data leading to\n            cost-effectiveness information on different methods of\n            malaria vector control."}, "docdt": "2000-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
