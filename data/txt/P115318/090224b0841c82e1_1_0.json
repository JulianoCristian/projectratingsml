development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: establish strategic partnerships\n            to capitalize on learning and strengthen government\n            response. Investing in street children prevention should\n            include linkages to economic interventions. One of the few\n            intermediary indicator targets that the project did not meet\n            was the number of children who benefited from participation\n            in a vocational training program. This was largely because\n            the age requirement to participate in vocational training is\n            15 years and very few of the children living in the street\n            were 15 years and above. The project implementation unit\n            (PIU) expanded its monitoring and evaluation (M and E)\n            capacity by involving social assistants already trained by\n            ministry of social affairs, humanitarian action, and\n            national solidarity (MINAS) to work with street children.\n            These seconded staff improved the PIU\u2019s capacity to verify\n            the quality of data its sub grantees were reporting in their\n            quarterly reports. Long-term sustainability of results\n            depends upon government prioritizing investments in social protection."}, "docdt": "2016-02-29T00:36:02Z"}
