Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Overall project performance continues to be satisfactory. As of June 1st, 2015 the disbursement rate is 92.22%, and the remaining funds are projected
 to be completely disbursed by project closing date of August 31, 2015. Performance indicators have continued to progress regularly and have reached
 or surpassed projections (see results framework). Over 15,524 children have benefited from project activities, and efforts at family reunification continue
 to yield very encouraging results with 4426 children (48 percent of them girls) having re-established links with their families.
 The latest implementation support mission have confirmed that the PIU has adopted the following recommendations to contribute to project
 sustainability:
 1.         building the capacity of its partners: in April 2015 the PIU organized a workshop for all project stakeholders to reflect on ways to make project
            results sustainable. In response to the main concern expressed with funding, in May 2015 the PIU hosted a five-day training to develop the
            capacity of both government and NGOs to raise funds. The training was very well received.
 2.         contracting a consultant to produce a practitioner guide for family reunification on the basis of best practices and lessons learned during
            project implementation. The guide, expected by June 30, 2015, should be disseminated country-wide. As funds and time constraints will not
            permit the thorough dissemination process carried out for the Norms and Standards to Care for Children in Difficult Circumstances, it was
            agreed that the PIU would explore opportunities for collaboration with other projects including the USAID-financed 4Children Program.
 3.         signing an agreement with the National Institute of Statistics to carry out the third and last round of an impact evaluation of the project’s
            preventive activities. Data collection was completed on schedule and statistical analysis is ongoing with assistance from the
            UNICEF/ILO/World Bank “Understanding Children’s Work Project”. A report is expected by mid-July and should be widely disseminated as it
            represents a unique opportunity to learn about prevention (there are very few evaluations of prevention services worldwide).
 In anticipation of project closing, both the project implementation unit and the World Bank will start elaborating an implementation completion report.
 This document reflects on project performance and impact, and provides lessons learned to all parties involved.
