                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Both prevention and assistance components are now on track in all targeted municipalities (communes) and the project made significant progress toward the achievement of its
                         development objectives over the past six months. The mid-term review took place on February 21-22, 2014. The main conclusions of the review were that (a) the number of
                         beneficiaries is higher than expected and results are encouraging, but (b) the quality and efficiency of interventions vary greatly among partner NGOs, and (c) efforts are needed to
                         improve the quality of services offered in some of the communes, particularly for the assistance component. Therefore the PIU should identify best/good practices and facilitate their
                         diffusion among partner NGOs. A set of actions to improve the quality of service delivery to children and the quality of project management have been agreed with the Government
                         and PIU (see below).

                         So far, close to 9000 children (8,616 as of end December 2013) have benefited from project activities and most of the result indicators expected in 2013 have been achieved. In
                         particular, results presented at the mid-term review were as follows:

                         Prevention: (i) 89 neighborhood Child Protection Committees have been set-up or revamped and all are operational, e.g., they support the organization of periodical sensitization
                         activities and intervened in 305 cases of child abuse; (ii) 383 sensitization meetings have been organized for parents; (iii) 156 radio programs and about 113 sketches have been
                         produced. Concerning the project partnership with the Ministry of Education to exempt children at risk from schools fees to keep them away from the streets, 2,516 children have
                         been enrolled and are attending classes. An additional 723 children were selected for free enrollment but are not attending classes either because their name was communicated to
                         the school too late in the year or because NGOs had no money for school kits and uniforms; it is expected that these children will attend school next year.

                         A baseline survey for the impact evaluation of preventive activities was conducted in February 2013 and results were available in November 2013. This baseline updates the
                         previous survey conducted in 2011 (both surveys were financed by a TFESSD grant). Results show that, between 2011 and 2013 (in the absence of project activities), knowledge of
                         children rights and witchcraft beliefs did not change among households living in targeted communes and actually deteriorated in some cases (e.g., in Kimbanseke). In addition,
                         exposure to prevention programs before the beginning of the project decreased sharply (-11% overall, and up to -22% in Kimbanseke). The follow-up survey is presently in the field
                         and results will be available by June.

                         Assistance: 14 centers financed by the project (some of them sub-contracted by partner NGOs) are providing day or night shelter, psychological care, food, health and education
                         services to street children. Medical care was offered to almost 5,000 children, and 3,706 children (42% girls) are attending school or literacy sessions. Most importantly, about 1,540
                         street children (including 656 girls) have already been reunified with their families and an additional 1,786 are in the process of being reunified.

                         Capacity Building: an organizational audit of the Ministry of Social Affairs was conducted in 2013 and various activities have then been financed by the project to increase the Ministry
                         capacity: purchase of equipment (cars and computers), training, and technical assistance for the elaboration of national guidelines for vulnerable children. In 2014 the project will
                         focus on increasing the implication of ministry staff in project activities; this should be done in each municipality in an effort to transfer competencies on project man agement and
                         child protection issues.

                         M&E: The M&E system has improved since the recruitment of a new M&E expert in May 2013. A more systematic approach to data collection and analysis has been developed, and
                         data provided by partner NGOs are verified by the PIU before being sent to the Bank. Data are therefore more reliable than before, but some issues and minor inconsistencies
                         persist. The M&E specialist will work over the coming months to further strengthen the system and ensure data comparability among NGOs.

                         Project Management: Project management has improved but still suffers from some weaknesses: (a) delays in sending progress reports to the Bank and in preparing procurement
                         and work plans, (b) fiduciary problems linked to poor organization and lack of a procurement specialist, (c) financial data not recorded in TOMPRO. It has also to be noted that
                         corrective measures have not yet been taken against PIU staff that were accused of funds misappropriation in June 2013 (funds were reimbursed). The fiduciary arrangements for
                         the project were revised during the mid-term review and a procurement specialist has been hired (see below).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key Decisions for Disclosure
                         1 To address the persistent fiduciary problems, it was agreed that (a) the PIU will hire a part-time procurement specialist (done) and a part-time internal auditor, (b) logistics will be
                         managed by the driver trained for this purpose.

                         2 The Financing Agreement will be amended to reflect the new fiduciary arrangement. The administrative portion of the Project Implementation Manual will also be updated.
                         3. To contain operating expenses, the present arrangement that has one technical expert and one M&E specialist work together on both prevention and assistance will be maintained.
                         A social worker from the Ministry of Social Affairs should be integrated into this team to encourage the transfer of competences.
                         4. Unit costs for prevention and assistance components will be harmonized among partner NGOs based on best/good practices, and a minimum package of prevention and
                         assistance activities for each municipality will be defined.
                         5. New contracts with partner NGOs will be signed (most of them in July 2104) on that basis of performance evaluations carried out by the PIU and reflect the newly elaborated
                         norms&standards, unit costs and minimum package.

                         Restructuring History
