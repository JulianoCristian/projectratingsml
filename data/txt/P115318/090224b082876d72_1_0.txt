                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the mid-term review (February 2014), the project has been officially restructured to reflect changes in fiduciary arrangements. All fiduciary functions are now exclusively
                         under PIU responsibility, to which a full-time internal auditor and part-time procurement specialist have been added; the internal auditor is regularly visiting and auditing partner
                         NGOs. Also, as part of the project sustainability plan, two social assistants from the Ministry of Social Affairs (MINAS) were seconded to the project in July so as to facilitate skills
                         transfer. Their work has greatly improved monitoring and it is expected that this arrangement will hold until the end of the project, changing social assistants every three-four months.

                         As planned during the mid-term review, the project financed the rehabilitation/extension of a Ministry building to be used as a shelter for street children. The center has been made

                         The disbursement rate is 75 percent and the implementation rate of the 2014 budget was 60.28 percent on August 31, 2014. The fluctuation of the DTS exchange rate is having a

                         negative impact on the project budget, which is now US$ 238,468 US$ lower. The PIU, therefore, will have to review its plans for the remainder of the project time and make the
                         necessary adjustments.

                         Performance indicators have continued to progress regularly and have reached or surpassed projections (see results framework). Over 9700 children have benefited from project
                         activities and efforts at family reunification continue to yield very encouraging results with more than 2500 children having re-established links with their families. A workshop was
                         organized to share best practices on family reunification and the PIU has been encouraged to produce a practitioner guide that would supplement the practitioner guide for the N&E.
