Under the policy\n            package supported by the proposed loan, the Government\n            would:  (a) reduce export taxes on agricultural products;\n            (b) undertake fiscal measures designed to maintain the\n            overall fiscal deficit at satisfactory levels, including the\n            introduction of a federal land tax; and (c) rationalize\n            import tariffs and regulations on agricultural inputs.\n            Complementary studies and institutional support would also\n            be financed.  The policy reforms would stimulate increases\n            in agricultural production and exports by:  (a) increasing\n            domestic producer prices, bringing them closer to\n            international prices and improving benefit-cost ratios for\n            investment and production inputs; and (b) reducing the\n            subsidy from producers to consumers."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
