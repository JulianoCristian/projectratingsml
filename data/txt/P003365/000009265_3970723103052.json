movement of timber in particular, are deteriorating at a\n            juncture when Burmese exports are facing a major setback.\n            Since teak is one of the principal export commodities, the\n            project is designed to address the unique and immediate\n            transport problems pertaining to timber distribution. The\n            project would include improvements in specific roads and\n            rail lines, provision and rehabilitation of rolling stock,\n            and consolidation and upgrading of log depots and loading\n            stations. Innovative cost-effective measures include\n            containerization of forestry products, use of push tug and\n            barges in river systems and more efficient shipside loading\n            of lumber. In addition to technical assistance and training,\n            a Comprehensive Study would be undertaken to identify and\n            address long-term issues of timber distribution in Burma."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
