MEMORANDUM TO THE E7LUlIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Union of Myarmar
Timber Distribution Pro1eegt (Credit 1615-BA-
Attached is the report entitled "Project Completion Report on the
TUnior. of Myanmar - Timber Diszribution Project (Credit 1615-BA)", prepared by the
last Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The report includes borrower information
(from government records and project progress reports) and a formeal borrower
contribution to the P'R (Part II).
The project aimed at improving timber transport through a combination
of sector policy, institutional and physical components. Implementation suffered
substantial delays due to fuel shortages, government inexperience and procurement
difficulties. Planning of timber transport was improved, infrastructure was
enhanced and a timber distribution study was carried out. A training program was
partially implemented.  The project economic return appears to be le: the
sustainability of timber extraction in the project-related areas is doubtful;
timber is directed away from the project infrastructure; and there has been a
major and unexpected decline in log movements from the central corridor regions.
On balance, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory.   Severe
economic distortions, security problems and poor financial status and prospects
of the Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE) have undermined achievements of
institutional  goals  as  well  as  sustainability  prospects.    Therefore,
institutional development is rated as partial, and sustainability as uncertain.
PCR quality is satisfactory.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPOLw
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Timber
Distribution Project in Myanmar (formerly the Socialist Republic of the Union of
Burma), for which Credit 1615-BA in the amount of SDR18.0 million (equivalent to
approximately US$17.75 million at appraisal) was approved on Ju.ae 20, 1985. The
credit was closed, after being granted an extension of two years, on March 31,
1992. Disbursements under the credit amounted to SDR16.593 million (equivalent
to US$21.834 million). SDR 1.407 (US$1.388 million was canceled from the credit,
effective August 3, 1992. Lhe final disbursement from the credit was made on
August 3, 199'.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations
Division, Country Department I of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office
(EAIIN), the Infrastructure Division of the Asia Technical Department (ASTIN)
(Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III) and the Borrower, (Part II) and
is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR); the Credit Agreement;
supervision reports; the Borrower's own records and monthly progress reports;
correspondence between the International Development Association (IDA) and the
Borrower; and internal IDA memoranda.

TIMBER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT - CREDIT 1615-BA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPOR1-
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Ob jectiyes
i.           The aim  of the Timber Distribution Project was to assist the
Government in overcoming bottlenecks in the distribution of timber, and to raise the
foreign exchange earnings from teak, .which is one of Myanmrar's main exports. The main
objectives were to:
(a)   achieve significant improvements in the planning and allocation of
transport services concerned with the movement of timber;
(b)   arrest further deterioration of the existing timber transport/distribution
capacity, with a subsequent improvement in timber quality, quantity, and
reliability of supply and export;
(c)  reduce timber transport, handling, and storage costs; and
(d)  test new timber transport systems.
To accomplish these objectives the project components included:
(a)  cr ation of a Project Coordination Grouo (PCG) - to plan and coordinate
activities related to the movement of timber;
(b)   a comprehensive Study - to analyze and make recommendations concerning
the major issues affecting the transport/distribution of timber;
(c)   Training and Techi.ical Assistance on: - Mi) strengthening the PCG; (ii)
testin§ of new transport systems under the project; and (iii) providing
specialized operator training;
(d)  improvements in the Myitkyina .Qrrido:
(i)  NLabaKatha - rail and road Improvements for inc.reased log traffic by
provision of additional railway Infrastructure and rehabilitation of
rolling stock for log transport, introduction of new fastener
techniques for prevention of pilferage of critical railway wagon
brake components, Katha log depot improvements, provision of
loading and unloading equipment, and improvements of the Naba-
Katha road;
(ii) Wuntho-irrawaddy River Road Connection - upgrading of existing
roads to all-weather transport and provision of additional
construction equipment capacity; and



- iv -
(iii) Sagalnog Lng Deeot - redesign of rail yard, improvements to depot
yard, and provision of additional log loading and unloading
equipment;
(e)   Prome Pall Line - provision of additional rolling stock for log transport;
(f)   Pyinmaana Pail Line - rehabilitation of rolling stock for log transport;
(g)  Trans[ort of Public Works (PW) Sawn Timber - provision of additional
railway rolling stock;
(h)   Containerization and Ship l oading - improvements in the efficiency of
forest products container loading and ship loading of logs;
(1)   Barge Sgstem - provisions for trials of barge transport of logs on the
Irrawaddy/Chindwin river systems; and
(j)   Yagon Harbor - tug and barges for transport of timber products to ship
side in Yangon and yard improvements at Okkyin Log Depots.
Imnlementatio Exoerience
i,.        The Timber Distribution Project was appraised in February 1984, the
Credit was approved on June 20, 1985 and became effective on December 5, 1985. The
IDA Credit (1615-BA) for the project amounted to SDR18.0 million (equivalent to
approximately US$17.75 million at appraisal). The Credit was fully disbursed, except
for SDR 1.407 (US$1.388 million equivalent) which was cancelled from the Credit
effective August 3,1992.
iii.       The project made a slow start because of inexperience on the part of the
Governrrent of Myanmar (GOM) and because the Project Coordination Group (PCG) was
not fully formed until September 1987. While the Timber Distribution Study got off to
a good start and was completed in October 1987, civil works, being done by force
account, were held uP because of a shortage of fuel. This was overcome by allocating a
portion of the credit for the purchase of petroleum products and work accelerated
during 1988/89. Fuel again became a problem and work was slowed for the remainder
of the project. The recommendations of the Study cannot be iriplemented until lending
resumes.
iv.        Procurement action for equipment, spare parts and materials for
rehabilitating old equipment and constructing new equipment, was slow because of
internal government procedu, es. As a result, the needed equipment did not come on
stream until 1 89 or later.
Pro,)ecl Besults
v.         The project broadly achieved its objectives and stocks of logs in up-
country storage depots have been reduced to low levels. However, this reduction has
been achieved against the background of an apparent change in the pattern of logging
from the traditional one of extraction from forests around the central corrider and



v~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
export of the timber through Yangon, to one of wholesale exploitation of the forests
near the Thai border and export aci oss the border into Thai land.
vi.        Deterioration of the existing timber transport and distributicn capacity
has been arrested, witn Myanmz Railways (MR), in particular, showing improved
performance and reliability. Myanma Timber Enterprise (MTE) has a greater choice of
transport methods, but the distortions produced by the unrealistic official exchange
rate, result in it being much more profitable for transport agencies to deal with the
private sector.
vii.       Transport, handling and storage costs have been reduced by the newv
equipment purchased for and the improvements made to log depots, roads, railways and
inland water transport. The two pusher barge trains have been successful, despite only
two barges being handled normally, instead of the four proposed.
viii.      When the additional transport capacity acquired under the project is
evaluate', comparing 1984  Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) targets against actual
1991/92 volumes, .-n Edonomic Rate of Return (EPR) of 7 to 10 percent Is obtained for
the overall project. Using the the more ambitious projected volumes given in the
1992/93 Transportation Plan as a reference, a more encourag'ng ERR of 16 to 21
percent results.
ix.        Costs remained within appraisal estimates, but because of the
appreciation of the SDR, additional US$ funds were available to procure additional
spare parts and materials.
Sustainabl ity
x.         The decline in the movement of logs from the central corrldor regions in
recent years has been attributed by MTE to security problems, shortages r' fuel, and
transport constraints. Capacity appears to have been diverted from MTE to the private
sector, but this is probably caused by the better rates paid by private shippers. ThfeF
factors will persist until the economy is on a firmer footina and the exchange rate
anomaly has been corrected. The 1992/93 Transportation Plan developed by the PCG is
optimistic about the increased volumes to be moved, but the deeper, longer range
question of availability and economic access to the remaining timber stocks, remains
unanswered. Forest inventories and allowable annual cut (AAC) for commercial species
have not been updated and there is little reason to believe the AAC represents a
sustainable harvest.
xi.        The tangible benefits generated by the project could well be lost because
of the current freeze on lending to Myanmar. The recommendations of the Timber
Distribut.on Study cannot be implemented until lending resumes. The benefits arising
out of the new equipment will continue as long as it can be maintained in serviceable
condition. How long this takes will depend on the development of the economy.



-vi -
Findings and Lessons LeaCnpd
xii.       The future financial position of MTE looks bleak. While the SAR reported a
1981/82 net contribution to the government of Ky 600 million in royalties, taxes and
operating surplus,, it paid Ky 53.2 million in royalties and taxes in 1991/92 and alsoj
incurred an operatirrg loss of Ky 52.6 million. With the increased border trade in logs
and decline in exports through Yangon the average financial yield has fallen,
part'cuiarly since 1988/89. The decline In the financial operating results of MTE Is
due tO the decline in the amount of timber exported, and the fact that MTE receives Its
revenue at the official exchange rates and incurs its labor and domestic expenses at
the parallel market rate In addition, MTE has not been able to obtain sufficient fuel
and spare parts to support its operations.
xiii.      The main lessons learned by the Bank are: (a) it is important that cost
estimates be carefully checked and agreed to with the Borrow"ver; and (b) that
reorganizations in the Bank result in disruptions in t'ie relationship with the Borrower.
ixv.       The main lessons learned by the Borrower are that: (a) internal procedures
for procurement must be streamsined for any future project; and (b) unrealistic foreign
exchange rates produce distort,ons within the economy that result in unfavorable
outcomes for projects that would otherwise have had much better returns.

2.01      Myanmar covers an irea of about 262,000 sq mi and consists of
lowlands in the basins of the four major rivers, the Irrawaddy, Chindwin, Sittang,
and Salween, surrounded by more mountainov s terrain to the east, north, and west,
and divided by a range of hills running north to south in central Myanmar. The
country is well endowed with natural resources of which forests, which cover
about 50% of the land area, form a major part. Teak and other valuable hardwoods
have historically formed the major part of forest output, and are the second largest
foreign exchange earner. About 35% of the forest resources nave been inaccessible
to government personnel, for security reasons, and planned forestry operations in
these areas are not possible.
2.02       Because of damage suffered during World War 11, Internal unrest and a
decade of economic stagnation- during a period of social restructuring from the
mid-60's to the mid-70's, Myanmar's economy was in a poor state by 1976. In the
late 1970's, the Government of Myanmar (GOM) initiated a series of reforms which
aimed to expand the output of major commodities and increase export earnings.
During the late 70's GDP rose to 6.5% p.a. against 2.9% p.a. in the early 70's and the
transport sector grew by 7.3% p.a. against a contraction of 0.4% p.a. GOM's main
economic goals during the 1980's were to maintain overall economic growth and to
realize a surplus in the balance of payments, while avoiding undesirable
Inflationary pressures. Such a program required, inter alia: (a) recovery and
maintenance of forestry and agricultural production; (b) further improvements in
capacity utilization and productivity, especially in transport and industry; (c) a
more selective approach to public investment projects; and (d) sufficient
resources, both foreign and domestic, to carry out the investment program.

2.03       Forestry operations have been extensively supported by IDA, ADB and
UNDP/FAO through the Forest Department (FD) which is responsible for the
management of all forests, and Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE), which is
responsible for extraction, milling and marketing. Extraction had increased to 1.4
million Ht of teak and hardwoods in 1981/82 after a decline in the mid-70's.
;deally most of Athe teak should be exported, but If there is a decline in the
extraction of hardwood for local consumption, a greater proportion of the teak is
used locally, thereby depriving the country of foreign earnings.
2.04       The movement of timber for export and domestic use is heavily reliant
Qn the transport system-railways, rivers, roads and ports-which have been
supported by a number of IDA prc. acts. Most of the teak is transported to Yangon by
floating It in large rafts down the rivers, buJt this method takes a long time and
gives rise to losses and quality deterioration.  Increased use of railway
transportation has been constrained by the poor condition of the rolling stock and
track. Roads are generally of poor quality and useable only during the dry season.

4.   Project Design and Organization 
4.01       Although the Bank had been involved In several Forestry and Transport
projects, this was the first that dealt with the several modes of transport that are
used for moving the timber from the forest, to Yangon, from where it can be
exported. It was recognized that timber had its own unique distribution problems
and was suffering from severe bottlenecks that were adversely affecting exports.
4.02       The project was designed to be experimental in nature in that it wV.dd:
(a)  improve the management of timber transportation within the cor,text
of the existing institutional framework;
(b)  introduce the possibility  of employing different modes of
transportation to meet the logistic requirements of a changing timber
market; and
(c)  improve transport to inaccessible areas, permitting better utilization
of forestry resources.
4.03       One fundamental component of the project was the creation of a
Project Coordination Group (PCG), in which user agencies would participate, with
specific responsibility to plan and coordinate activities related to the movement of
timber. It was intended that the interaction of this group would have an impact
which woluld result In an overall improvement in the distribution of timber. It was
envisaged that further Bank involvement in the timber transportation subsector
would develop from the positive demonstration of the effects accruing from the
planned approach. The project was designed to address the immediate need to
Timber Distrtbutton ProJect PCR



-4-
arrest further deterioration in transport capacity, while the overall institutional
and financial aspects of the agencies involved In the distribution and transport of
timber would be analysed in a comprehensive study with the ultimate aim of
strengthening the system.
4.04       Primary responsibility for implementation was vested in the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (MOTC), acting through the PCG, with day-to-day
implementation being carried out by MOTC's various agencies (Myanma Railways
(MR) and Inland Water Transport (IWT)) and by Public Works (PW) and Myanma
Timber Enterprise (MTE). MIOTC V. .ld be the recipient of credit funds and would
also provide the local funds. For ease of administration, new assets and those to be
rehabilitated under the project were to be placed under the ownership of MOTC,
which would pay a nominal sum for those items being transferred from other
agencies. Assets would be transferred back to agencies in accordance with the
recommendations of the comprehensive study. The issue of cost recovery caused
some delays to the preparation of the project, but It was finally established that
this was basically an experimental project and the matter of cost recovery was not
important, and that the study would decide how cost recovery would be
implemented.
405        The PCG was made responsible for the medium- and long-term planning
of timber transport, as well as for solving the day-to-day problems affecting the
system. The PCG was to clearly identify timber transport demands In quantity,
location and time, define priorities and the most economic way of satisfying the
demand and manage the adequate functioning of the system. The purpose in creating
the PCG was to establish a means of interaction between the transport agencies
and the user agency at a technical working level to deal specifically with timber
distribution problems, an interaction that was previously lacking. This important
experimental aspect of the project was to be the forerunner of other similar groups
within the Transport and Communications Planning and Operation Department
(TCPOD) of MOTC, which would plan and manage the movement of other key
commodities, and demonstrate that such groups would be effective in solving
transport problems given the proper backing. The PCG was given direct access to
the Deputy Minister of MOTC and was assured that it would function independently
of the Central Movement Coordination Committee (CMCC). The PCG was to be
staffed with two permanent staff members of sufficiently high rank from MOTC, as
well as support staff. Technical assistance to further strengthen the PCG was
included in the project.
4.06       The comprehensive study to be Included in the project was to:
(a)   examine the medium- and long-term  constraints affecting the
distrioution of timber;
(b)  review relevant completed studies;
(c)  recommend improvements in the general transport management of
timber;
(d)   make specific recommendations on measures to be taken by GOM to
Improve the coordination among the different agencies responsible for

(e)  recommend an indicative time-phased and prior ty-ranked investment
program to relieve current transport bottlenecks and economically
improve the distribution of timber.
The study, which was to involve about 50 man-months of consultant services, was
not to be restricted to transport aspects, but would encompass all the elements
needed to improv4 the efficiency of the timber distribution system. The study was
to be financed by UNOP.
407       The project was prepared after extensive discussions between GOM,
the agencies which would be involved in the project, and the Bank. The timing was
appropriate because of the huge backlog of timber accumulating In the log depots
up-country and the rapidly deteriorating condition of the equipment, roads, railway
track etc used by the various agencies, and the unsatisfactory results of floating
logs down the rivers. The project was innovative in that it was experimental in
nature and aimed to test and evaluate the different transport modes and to
Introduce some new concepts.
408       The cost of the project was estimated to be US$29 million of which
IDA would finance $16.5 million, UNDP $0.5 million and GOM $12 million. IDACredit
1615-BA was approved on June 20, 1985 in the amount of SDR18 million, which
was equivalent to approximately $17.75 million at the time.
5. Projeclt Imnlementation
5.01      The credit was signed on October 1, 1985 and became effective on
December 5, 1985. Initial progress was very slow, however, and it was not until
September 1987 that the staffing of the PCG was completed. There was also a long
delay in starting the construction of the barges for the experimental pusher barge
train. The SAR had clearly specified SOOT barges and this was agreed during
negotiations, but it later emerged that the cost estimates that had been prepared
by the government agencies had been based on 250T barges. As there was
insufficient provision in the budget for the construction of 5OOT barges, it was
finally agreed that the smaller barges should be built. This controversy also
contributed to the implementation delays
5.02      The consultancy agreement for the Timber Distribution Study, to be
carried out by international consultants, was signed in November 1985 and work
started soon ifter. The recommendations arising out of the Study have not yet been
implemented because of the suspension of investment lending to GOMI. The Study
reccinmended spending about $22 million on equipment and other works for the
various agencies involved In the transport and distribution of timber and GOMI has
formally requested an IDA credit for this amount.
5.03      During the early part of the project, civil works contracts were held up
for a lack of fuel, so, in November 1987, the credit agreement was amended and
SDRO.8 million of the credit funds were reallocated for petroleum products. As a
result, in 1988/89, there was a marked acceleration in the rate of implementation.
However, by the time of the approval of the first extension of the credit in
December 1989, when the credit was extended until March 31, 1991, the project
was barely 40% complete. The implementation pase was not maintained, and by

1990 turther delays were occurring because of fuel shortages on the various
contracts, despite previous undertakings made by GOM at the time of the
reallocation. The second extension until March 31, 1992, granted in March 1991,
cited the provision of adequate fuel as a condition for the extension. This
undertaking was given by GOM and the contracts were finally completed.
5.04      The procurement and delivery of new equipment, spare parts and
materials for the'refurbishing of worn-out rolling stock and track, were delayed by
slow bureaucratic procedures. Final deliveries were not made until 1991. The
'rnprovements enabled MTE to transport increased quantities of 'ogs from the up-
country storage depots, to Yangon.
6.   ProJect Results
6.01      The project broadly achieved its objectives and stocks of logs in up-
country storage depots have been reduced to low levels. It must be said, however,
that this reduction has been achieved against the background of an apparent change
in the pattern of logging from the traditional one of extraction from forests around
the central corridor and export of the timber through Yangon, to one of wholesale
exploitation of the forests near the Thai border and export across the border Into
Thailand. This new pattern is reflected in the low annual cuts recently being
reported from the traditional areas of the country and the correspondingly low
numbers of logs being transported from these areas to Yangon. The volume of teak
logs transported by MTE to Yangon has dropped from a 1985/86 peak of 331,600 Ht
to 239,500 Ht in 1991/92.
6.02      The establishment of the PCG has demonstrated the usefulness of such
a group, as it has greatly improved inter-agency communication and cooperation.
Planning and allocation of transport services concerned with the movement of
timber have been improved. It ts to be hoped that this is the first in a series of
similar organizations devoted to different aspects of the transport sector.
6.03      Deterioration of the existing timber transport 'and distribution
capacity has been arrested, with MR, in particular, showing improved performance
and reliability. MTE has a greater choice of transport methods, but the distortions
produced by the unrealistic official exchange rate, result In It being much more
profitable for transport agencies to deal with the private sector which is able to
retain the hard currency earned. Carriage of MTE teak logs by rail peaked in
1988/89 at 1 1 1,800 Ht, whereas by 1991/92, when locomotives and rolling stock
rebuilt or procured under the project were in operation, the volume had declined to
65,000 Ht. Similarly, in the Myitkyina corridor, deliveries to storage depots as
well as rail movements to Sagaing had fallen to less than half the 1984 levels.
6.04      Transport, handling and storage costs have been reduced by the new
equipment purchased for and the improvements made to log depots, roads, railways
and inland water transport. The two pusher barge trains have been successful,
despite only two barges being handled normally, Instead of the four proposed. MITE
still complains of a lack of barge and rail-car capacity, but it would appear that
private sector shippers, paying higher rates to MR and IWT are obtaining the most
use from the equipment provided under the project. Shippers outside the forest
sector are also using the new high-sided open rail wagons for sugar cane during

half thie year and timber wagons are used for about one-third of the time for ocher,
more remunerative rail freight. Similarly, while tonnage of logs moved on the
roads upgraded under the project seem unlikely to meet forecasts, other traffic,
such as new bus services and increased bicycle traffic, has been generated and
derives benefit from the improvements. On the other hand, the containerization of
timber has been less than successful. MTE is having problems loading the
containers to capacity and Is seeking an opportunity to learn from foreign operators
and to purchase forklift trucks of the correct type to work with containers.
Although short sawn timber pieces, teak mosaic and parquet can be successfully
containerized, longer lengths pose a problem with end-loading containers. Some
private shippers are stuffing containers outside the Myanma Port Authority, but
MTE has difficulty in offering adequate inducements to customs inspectors to clear
containers at mill sites.
6.05       When the additional transport capacity acquired under the project Is
evaluated, comparing 1984 SAR targets against actual 1991/92 volumes, an ERR of
7 to 10 percent is obtained for the overall project. Using the the more ambitious
projected volumes given in the 1992/93 Transportation Plan as a reference, a more
encouraging ERR of 16 to 21 percent results.
6.06      The training program was not fully implemented, as the rMiOTC did not
approve the training planned for the TCPOD because of a change of policy within
MOTC prohibiting all overseas training programs. However, the IWT staff attended
courses relevant to their work which proved beneficial.
6.07       Costs remained within appraisal estimates, but because of the
appreciation of the SDR, additional US dollar funds were available to procure
additional spare parts and materials.
7.   Project Sustainability
7.01      The decline in the movement of logs from the central corridor regions
in recent years has been attributed by MTE to security problems, shortages of fuel,
and transport constraints. Capacity appears to have been diverted from MTE to the
private sector, but this is probably caused by the better rates paid by private
shippers. These factors will persist until the economy is on a firmer footing and
the exchange rate anomaly has been corrected. The 1992/93 Transportation Plan
developed by the PCG is optimistic about the increased volumes to be moved, but
the deeper, longer range question of availabflity and economic access to the
remaining timber stocks, remains unanswered. Forest inventories and allowable
annual cut (AAC) for commercial species have not been updated and there Is little
reason to believe that the AAC represents a sustainable harvest. In the case of
teak, 1991/92 extraction amounted to 355,600 Ht compared with the AAC of about
300,000 Ht. In border logging, teak exports Increased from 13,500 Ht In 1988/89
to 88,400 Ht in 1991/92, compared with a border area AAC of 40,000 Ht. This
over-extraction cannot but have detrimental results.
7.02      The future financial position of MTE looks bleak. While the SAR
reported a 1981/82 net contribution to the government of Ky 600 million in
royalties, taxes and an operating surplus, it paid Ky 53.2 million in royalties and
taxes in 1991/92 and also incurred an operating loss of Ky 52.6 million. With the
Tlmwe Distribution ProJect PCR



-8-
lncreased border trade In logs and the decline in exports through Yangon, the
average financial yield has fallen, particularly since 1988/89. The decline in the
financial results of MTE is due to the decline in the quantity of timber exported,
and the fact that MTE receives its revenve at the off iclal exchange rate and Incurs
its expenses for labor and domestic costs at the parallet market rate. In addition,
they have not been able to obtain sufficient fuel and spare parts to support the
operations.
7.03       The tangible benefits generated by the project could well be lost
because of the current freeze on lending to Myanmar. MR is possibly the agency that
will continue to benefit, because contact has been maintained through various UNDP
projects and the management is open to new Ideas for improvement of the system
in ways that do not involve foreign exchange. The recommendations of the Timber
Distribution Study cannot be implemented until lending resumes.
7.04       Certainty the benefits arising out of the new equipment will continue
as long as it can be maintained in serviceable condition. How long this is will
depend on the development of the economy.
8.   lQA Ptrformanre
8.01       The project was well prepared and regularly supervised, although,
because of the 1987 reorganization of the Bank, there were several changes in
personnel going on the supervision missions. This lack of continuity is generally
not well received by Borrowers. The Bank displayed flexibility in the treatment of
issues that arose during preparation and implementation.
8.02       The main lessons learned by the Bank have been: (a) that it is important
that cost estimates be carefully checked and agreed to with the Borrower as to
content; and (b) that reorganizations in the Bank result in disruptions in the
relationship with the Borrower.
9.   Borwr Perormance
9.01       The Borrower generally performed very well in the field of project
administration, bearing In mind the fact that there were a number of agencies
involved and communication was Important. To this end, the PCG served a very
useful purpose, but it was unable to speed up the slow internal procurement
procedures that caused some of the delays In the project. However GOM's
performance was not so good in making available fuel supplies for the civil works
contracts. This caused major delays despite special provisions being put In place
to allow for the import of fuel for the project.
1,.02     The main lessons learned by the Borrower have been: (a) that Internal
procedures for procurement must be streamlined for any future project; and (b) that
the unrealistic exchange rate produces distortions within the economy that result
in unfavorable outcomes for projects that would otherwise have much better
returns.

10.  Project Relationship
10.01     A feature of the project was the good relationships that were built up
during preparation and implementation of the project, despite frequent changes in
the personnel sent by the Bank during the supervision phase. Mission staff were
always well recqived and their comments were respected and acted upon by their
Myanma colleagues, who were very receptive to suggestions.
II.  Consulting Services. ContCactors and Sunoliers
11.01     Foreign consultants were employed to carry out the Timber
Distribution Study, which was successfully completed.
11.02     All civil works contracts were carried out by either PW or MTE units.
Their performances varied, but all were acceptable.
11.03     A large number of suppliers were used for the procurement of
equipment, spare parts and materials. They all performed satisfactorily.
12.  Project Documentation and Data
12.01     The SAR was clearly written and provided a useful framework for all
parties during project implementation.
12.02     The Credit Agreement was well prepared and served its purpose
adequately. All covenants were appropriate.
12.03     Information for the PCR was provided by the PCG, MR, MTE and PW. The
PCR mission of June 1992, held discussions with all the agencies Involved and
visited some of the areas where work was carried out.

TIMBER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT - 1615 -BA
PRWSECT gO2VIETIo REPoRT
PART IIS R         RER     OP SRE5 PROJECT
A. Evaluation of the Bank's performance and lessons learned
' 1.     The Bank's performance during the evolution and implementaLion
of the project was found to be satisfactory except a delay of 5
months in approving the construction of five barges of 25C ton
capacity for IWT instead of 500 ton capacity which was due ti a
wrong capacity mentioned in the Staff Appraisal Report.
2.       The major lesson learned was that both the Bank and Borrower
should discuss the description of the project component thoroughly
during the credit negotiationi.
3.       it was found that the Bank missions' visit during the eourse
of project implementatiori was helpful to all agencies concertied to
solve the problems encountered during the implementation of the
project.
B. Evaluation of Borrower's own performance and lessons learned
1.     Weak performances in issuing tender documents were folnd mostly
at the beginning or the project implementation. The source of this
should be Lraced back to Ba11k's side arnd Borrower's side.. zt. the
case of this project Development Credit Agreement was svgredl on
October 1, 1983, and the earliest tender was issued on Mari- 1,2,
1987.
Implementing Agency             The earliest Tender
issue date
Myanma Railways                   Mtarch 12, 1087

Myanma Tiuiber Enterprise         October l:, 1987
Public Works                      October 15, 1987
2.       Such a delay of about 2 years was due to the fact that bliddirg
documents prepared by the implementing agencies - MR, MTE, PV - were
not in accordance with the sample Bidding Documents contained in the
Procurement Guidelines prescribed by the Bank. In case of IWT, delay
in approving the constructiou of five 250 ton barges by the B:Ra:k
was one of the main reasons for such a delay.



-12 -
3.       XTE's progress report showed that a project sub-component of
Sagaing loading site (i.e. construction of a ramp for loading to
barges at Sagaing) was started in April 1990 and completed by March
1992. Unfortunately it was found that no ramp had been constructed
at Sagaing when the project has been closed on schedule.
4.       The major lessons learned were
a)   the implementing agencies of the Borrower shouldexpedite the
implementation of the project in accordance with the Guidelines
prescribed by the Bank.
b)   the responsible officials of the implementing agencies should
closely supervise and make inspection of the actual
implementation of the project components instead of just
relying on the reports.
(c)   the training programme financed under the credit was not fulls
implemented. It should be seriously considered by the Bank in
future to provide assistance available from multilateral or
bilateral source on a grant element.
C. Relationship between the Bank and the Aorrower
There was a good relationship between the Bank and the Borrower
during the evolution and implementation of the project. The
understandable working relation will play an important role in the
successful outcome for future development projects.

Except for fte IWT and MTE barge operations, actual movements of tmber from central and inteior
Myanmar have dedined since 1989/90; major volumes are increasingly through border areas to Thailand.
(1) Project Appraisal assumed Myltkyina Corridor improvements would increase capacity from 41,000 Ht (rail)
to 72000 Ht (annual production + 10% of backlog).
(2) Project Appraisal assumed rail improvements would boost capacity from 50,000 Ht to 60000 HT,
but volume has steadily declned from 1987/88 high of 43519 HT.
(3) 4000Ht estimate for 1992, potentially 5000Ht for MTE and 70001t private logs.
(4) Tractors and trailers acquired under project currently used by MME in central interior,
only a limited number of containers used for lumber and these mostly stuffed at port

Comments-
MTE logs and sawn timber movements have fallen from their mid-1980 levels; however volumes of private hardwood,
both for logs anm  awn timber on IWT barge and Pylnmma rail routes appear stronger.
