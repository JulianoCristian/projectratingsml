Preparedness and Response Project for\n            Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: while it is always a good practice to keep\n            the project design simple and its scope commensurate with\n            implementation capacity, this is critical in post-conflict\n            countries where capacity is low not only within governments\n            but also outside of the government. There is competition\n            among projects/program for a limited number of qualified and\n            experienced staff. In Afghanistan, several donors execute\n            projects directly because of weak capacity of implementing\n            agencies, unlike the Bank which channels financing through\n            the government budget and systems. While the Bank's\n            approach is no doubt critical for long term capacity\n            building, the direct execution approach has a comparative\n            advantage in terms of timely execution. This option needs to\n            be considered in designing emergency projects, where: (i)\n            timely action is critical; and (ii) co-financing or parallel\n            financing by other donors to directly execute projects is a\n            possibility. The new Bank policy that allows potential\n            reallocation of cancelled International Development\n            Association (IDA) funds within the country provides an\n            incentive to both governments and Bank teams to identify\n            surplus funds that would remain unutilized and lapse at the\n            end of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
