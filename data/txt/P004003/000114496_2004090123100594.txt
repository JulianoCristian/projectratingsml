Dear Mr. Minister:
Re:
Loan Number 3979-IND
(Secondary School Teacher Development Project)
Amendments to the Loan Agreement
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Secondary School Teacher Development Project) 
between the Republic of Indonesia (the Borrower) and the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), dated March 29, 1996, as amended. We also 
refer to the Ministry of Finance’s letter dated March 30,2001, requesting an extension 
of the closing date and reallocation of Loan funds.
The Bank is pleased to inform you that, after due consideration, it has agreed 
to your request and has established December 31, 2001, as the new date for purposes of 
Section 2.03 of the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the Bank.  
The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement is amended as 
follows:

Referring to the request that the closing date for Category (3) (a) be extended 
to December 31, 2002, please note that the Loan can only have one closing date. The 
Bank would, however, consider favorably a further extension of the closing date for 
such Category. I would like, therefore, to suggest that prior to the closing date of 
December 31, 2001, your Ministry request the Bank for a further extension of the 
closing date for such Category.     
Yours sincerely,
