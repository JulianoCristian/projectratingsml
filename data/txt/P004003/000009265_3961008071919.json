Development Project is to enhance\n            teaching-learning processes in secondary schools through the\n            improvement of teacher education in 31 public teacher\n            training institutions (LPTKs). The project will support\n            activities in these institutions that promote quality and\n            efficiency in the preservice and inservice programs; build\n            educational research capacity; and enhance effective\n            management. Further, the project will support activities to\n            establish sustainable linkages between LTPKs and secondary\n            schools and to define a wider mandate, toward conversion to\n            university status for selected LTPKs. To achieve the above,\n            the project will have the following components: 1) improving\n            preservice and inservice teacher education; 2) strengthening\n            linkages to secondary schools; 3) raising the qualifications\n            of teacher educators; 4) building educational research\n            capacity; and 5) preparing for a wider mandate."}, "docdt": "1996-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
