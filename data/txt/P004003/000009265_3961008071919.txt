MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$60.4 million to help
finance a Secondary School Teacher Development Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with maturity of 20 years, including five years of
grace.
2.    Country and Sector Background. To improve its competitiveness in selective
international markets, Indonesia must be able to draw upon an easily trainable work
force, especially in the field of technology. Over the last 25 years, Indonesia achieved a
remarkable near-universal enrollment in six-year primary schools. However, secondary
school enrollments still represent only 54 percent of all 13-18 year olds. In 1994, the
Government began implementing an obligatory basic education of nine years, including
junior secondary education for 13-15 year olds, and raising educational levels of quality
to meet the demands of the high growth economy. The Government has set an ambitious
target of universalizing expanded basic education by the year 2010.
3.    The expansion would raise student enrollments and the demand for high quality
teachers. In addition, it would call for delivering junior secondary education in
innovative ways, ranging from establishing small rural schools with fewer teachers but
flexible teaching assignments to transmitting secondary education lessons to working
people in widely dispersed locations through forms of distance education. These new
delivery modes require skilled and better-trained teachers, ready to adapt to different
educational environments.
4.   In quantitative terms, the teacher training system, consisting of 31 public and 211
private training institutions (LPTKs), has the capacity to produce the teachers needed by
the expanded program. However, the system is inefficient. Many institutions are
overstaffed, and inservice training for secondary school teachers is not easily accessible.
Further, the training institutions suffer from quality deficiencies. The teaching staff is
underqualified, teaching programs are rigid, and teaching practice is deficient. Offices,
science equipment and books are out of date, and a healthy academic life is nearly absent
-- research, evaluation, accreditation, career planning and student services are poor.
5.    Public institutions account for a larger share of teachers appointed to public
secondary schools, although private institutions produce more graduates. Moreover,
public institutions are superior to their private counterparts in staffing, funding, facilities,



2              Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project
and quality of output. Considering this as well as the urgent goal of achieving universal
enrollment in basic education, the Government's strategy of improving the efficiency and
quality of the 31 public institutions is the preferred alternative in the near term. Other
interventions in higher education, which would also extend to the private teacher training
institutions, are being developed for the medium term (see below).
6.    A well-trained teacher is a cost-effective investment in education because he or
she can maximize the potential of other inputs (facilities, textbooks, materials) and
motivate student achievement. Several options for project interventions in teacher
education were examined for cost-effectiveness in the light of international and
Indonesian research evidence. The option of raising faculty salaries was not taken
because it is impractical: LPTK salaries are inextricably integrated with those of the
larger, national civil service. The option of raising admission standards to improve
quality was not taken, either, because this would eliminate potential school teachers who
happen to perform poorly on admission tests, not because they did not have the aptitude
but because they were poorly taught in secondary school (a general instructional quality
issue to be addressed in the secondary projects under preparation). Two other options
were chosen: (i) improving inservice and preservice training, because investing in both
forms of training is sustainable over the long term; and (ii) linking training with
classroom experience, because research shows that this form of training makes for
relevance and quality.
7.     Lessons Learned from  Previous Bank Involvement. The Implementation
Completion Reports and Project Performance Audit Reports of Bank-wide education
projects with significant teacher education activities note the difficulties encountered in
coordinating project implementation among various govermnental units, the inadequacy
of English-language competency of teachers (which minimizes the impact of project-
procured books and references in that language), and the lack of systematic mechanism
for the selection, monitoring, reentry, and utilization of project fellowship awardees.
These lessons have been considered in the design of the project. Coordination among
units implementing parts of the project would be assured by a Coordination Forum
established by the Government for teacher education and employment. Predeparture
training in foreign languages and translation to Bahasa Indonesia of foreign books are
integral parts of the project. Staffing plans would be required to justify recommendations
for fellowships to ensure that returnees would be deployed optimally. The Borrower and
the Bank have designed a project launch workshop, annual planning discussions, and a
midterm review to complement the Bank's regular supervision.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia which was presented to the Board on March 21,
1995. The Bank's unique comparative advantage is its having assisted in the formulation,
implementation, and evaluation of education projects throughout the developing world
and in Indonesia for over two decades. The Bank is a trusted partner in education
development in Indonesia and is being called upon to intensify assistance in strategic
national initiatives. In basic education, the expansion of secondary education and the
provision of teachers benefit from the ongoing projects in secondary education and



Memorandum of the President                       3
primary teacher education; a series of secondary education projects is also being prepared
for Bank financing. In higher education, projects are being developed to improve the
quality of undergraduate education as well as to support an accreditation process that
would improve the quality of private tertiary institutions.
9.    Project Objectives. The primary objective of the project is to enhance the quality
of teaching-learning processes in secondary schools through improvements in teacher
education in 31 public LPTKs. The project would support activities that: (i) promote
quality and efficiency in preservice and inservice programs; (ii) establish and maintain
strong linkages to secondary schools; (iii) raise qualifications of teacher educators,
including a number of female educators; (iv) build educational research capacity; and (v)
help LPTKs define a wider mandate.
10.      Project Description. LPTK preservice and inservice programs would be
improved with new curriculum, learning materials, science and math equipment, and
selected library books. Student assessment and support services would be provided to
help raise student achievement. Laboratories, faculty offices and conference rooms
would be renovated to improve student-faculty and interfaculty interaction. Linkages
between LPTKs and secondary schools would be strengthened through revised teacher
practicum programs, other joint activities, and exchanges with foreign institutions.
National and international fellowships for masters and doctorate studies as well as
refresher courses would upgrade the qualifications of LPTK faculty, and care would be
taken to assign returning fellows to positions matching the training they received.
Improved research capacity and a stronger research culture would be built in the LPTKs
and secondary schools through joint research activities, a more systematic assessment of
the students, and publication in scholarly journals. During the life of the project, LPTKs
would conduct institutional planning and self-assessment for accreditation, to improve
management practices and to assist selected IKIPs to prepare for conversion to full
university status after the project.
11.      Project Implementation. A central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would
be established in the Directorate-General of Higher Education (DGHE), under the
existing project office for teacher education development. The PIU would have a full-
time project manager would be assisted by project development and management
consultants. A subunit of the PIU would monitor project performance and conduct data
collection to assess project impact and cost-effectiveness for a further economic analysis
based on the agreed performance indicators. Local implementation teams would be
organized at the public LPTKs. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 15028-IND
dated January 26, 1996, is being distributed separately.



4             Indonesia Secondary School Teacher Development Project
12.     Agreed Actions. The Government would: (i) prepare and carry out action
plans for the effective deployment of excess LPTK teaching staff, maintaining zero
growth in staffing, raising student-teacher ratios, raising admission standards at selected
LPTKs, and selecting two IKIPs for conversion to university; (ii) establish and maintain
project curriculum, teaching practicum, and accreditation teams; (iii) maintain project
quality control through assessment of teacher candidates, monitoring of project costs and
benefits, and midterm progress review; and (iv) maintain sound management practices in
the central and local PIUs and in fellowship and grant administration, budget provision,
and audit and report preparation.
13.      Poverty Category. Demographic data show that most out of school youth
belong in the four lowest income deciles and live in rural areas. The Government's
strategy for expanding basic education aims at those segments of the population. The
project supports that equity strategy by improving the quality of the training of those
teachers who will be posted to rural schools (preservice training) or who are already
teaching in rural schools (inservice training). Further, since the LPTKs are spread
throughout the archipelago, with the 12 IKIPs-STKIPs located in provincial capitals, the
project would have a regional development dimension.
14.   Impact on  Women. The proposed project actively encourages greater
participation of women in education. Qualified female teachers would be given priority
in the scholarship awards for upgrading teachers to bachelor's degree level. Women
would particularly benefit from in-country fellowships since this is viewed as a more
favorable environment for Indonesian women and their families. Project fellowships for
short-term refresher courses and doctorate studies would set aside awards proportionate
to the number of women in the teacher education faculties (about 33 percent). Priority in
the award of research grants would also be given to female teacher proponents, and
women would be appointed to the project's management and monitoring units.
15.    Environmental Aspects. The proposed project is rated under environment
category "C": no project activity is expected to have adverse effects on the environment.
Environmental consciousness would be part of science and social studies curriculum
content which would be improved under the project.
16.    Participatory Approach. The Bank's dialogue with the Borrower was conducted
widely, with contributions from the key Government agencies: the National Development
Planning Board (BAPPENAS), DGHE, the advisory Consortium for Education, and
rectors, deans, and faculty of various LPTKs. The project preparation team, guided by
the Consortium, included educators from central MOEC in Jakarta as well as from
provincial MOEC offices and from LPTKs; the development of three progressive
versions of the project preparation document was undertaken by a joint team of
Indonesians and international consultants supported by the Japan Grant Fund (JGF).
17.    Project Benefits. About two million secondary school students per year would
benefit from the proposed project. The 31 public LPTKs and about 25,000 new
secondary school teachers per year would be the direct beneficia-ies. The internal



Memorandum of the President                      S
efficiency of LPTKs would improve with more flexible curricula, linkages with schools,
staff development, facilities, and research capacity. Systems of monitoring and
evaluation would ensure that the project interventions translate into the LPTK graduates'
increased competence to teach secondary school students. In addition, increasing the
student-teacher ratio of the LPTKs and reassigning excess teachers on a rotational basis
to the secondary schools and the Open University would introduce cost-effectiveness and
increase the external efficiency of the LPTK.
18.    Risks. There are risks related to the complex institutional environment of the
project. Effective coordination among numerous Government institutions would be
required for optimal project implementation, including supportive efforts by the Ministry
of Finance and BAPPENAS, the State Ministry for Administrative Reform, Directorate-
General of Primary and Secondary Education (DGPSE), and DGHE. The Coordination
Forum which includes representation from the above agencies would be revitalized to
enhance coordination. There is also a risk that the attention to project targets would
overshadow quality improvement objectives. Monitoring and review mechanisms would
focus attention on the quality improvement features.
19.    Project Sustainability. The Government's commitment to the nine-year basic
education program ensures necessary support to teacher education so that project
activities and their impact can be sustained. A successfully implemented project would
not only strengthen the quality of teacher education but also increase its cost-
effectiveness by improving the institutional capacity of the LPTKs. The student
assessment and accreditation mechanisms would enhance the LPTKs' ability to conduct
self-assessment and sustain their improvement. The increase in annual recurrent
expenditure, for maintaining equipment and facilities, support linkages to secondary
schools, and salary increases to upgraded staff, is estimated at US$2.3 million. At 3.5
percent of the recurrent expenditure of a typical LPTK, the expenditure would not be a
financial burden to the Government and would be more than offset by the savings
realized when institutions raise the student-teacher ratio from 10:1 to 12:1
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
