SCHOOL TEACHER DEV.,TF032654-INDONESIA - EDUCATION,TF038672-INDONESIA:  SECONDARY SCHOOL\n            TEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "3979", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            and sustainability is likely. The overall performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory as\n            well. Some of the many lessons learned include the\n            following:1) This project demonstrates how a relatively\n            small investment (50 percent less than originally allocated)\n            can generate useful breakthroughs and innovations in teacher\n            education, a field generally considered to be conservative\n            and resistant to change. The project's model of using\n            centers of innovation to create and try out, on a limited\n            scale, new curricula, student screening and enrichment\n            programs, stronger linkages to secondary schools, improved\n            student teaching approaches, action research related to\n            instructional improvement, and in-service teaching turned\n            out to be a cost effective way to stimulate new ways of\n            doing things. 2) Although the main development objective of\n            the project was to enhance the teaching learning processes\n            in secondary schools through the improvement of teacher\n            education, the project never clearly demonstrated where\n            teacher education fits within a larger model of change\n            (improvement) in teaching and learning. Future projects\n            would do well to describe such a model of change and\n            describe how the other crucial determinants are also\n            supported. 3) A major design weakness in the project -- one\n            to be avoided in any further teacher training projects -- is\n            its failure to effectively use outcome measures to document\n            and assure project impact. Ultimately, efforts to improve\n            teacher education should be judged in terms of improved\n            knowledge and skills of training program graduates. Tracking\n            these throughout a change program is means of quality\n            assurance. The current project, with its \"entry level\n            assessment\" laid down an important baseline for student\n            change, but failed to use it effectively to demonstrate the\n            impact of remediation and the overall impact of the teacher\n            training through exit level testing. For practicing\n            teachers, the in-service training that was offered, and the\n            partnering with lecturers for action research and other\n            professional growth opportunities, were never assessed in\n            terms of observed changes in teacher performance; similarly\n            those university lecturers who completed masters or doctors\n            degrees were never called upon to demonstrate objectively\n            improvements in their own instruction. In the future,\n            teacher training programs need to have built-in mechanisms\n            for tracking and assuring changes in valued outcomes. 4)\n            Curricular revision of the kind envisioned in the Project --\n            geared to vertical, horizontal and external flexibility\n            allowing graduates to teach at both secondary levels (lower\n            and upper), to teach comfortably in more than one subject\n            area, and to compete for jobs outside the field of education\n            is a heavy and difficult task, more like structural reform\n            than curricular revision. The project's efforts created\n            some useful curricular materials but fell short of\n            establishing such reforms, largely because they were focused\n            too narrowly."}, "docdt": "2003-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
