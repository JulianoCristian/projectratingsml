1.  Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement 
 
Vietnam weathered two crises in 2008, first, one of domestic macro instability, then the ripple effects of 
the global financial crisis.  It is now looking to navigate 2009, which promises to be challenging, with its 
characteristic resilience and increasing skillfulness.  This is a critically important time for engagement 
by the international community.  Vietnam’s ability to withstand the global financial crisis so as to 
resume its growth trajectory and continued fight against poverty may be determined during this period.  
Active engagement should contribute to improving the content and coherence of such reforms. 
 
Vietnam has been implementing its Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-10, which was 
presented to the Board in 2006 as Vietnam’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.  In it, Vietnam expresses its 
ambition to become a middle-income country by 2010.  The reform actions to be supported under the 
SEDP fall under four broad heads: (a) the promotion of growth and transition to a middle-income market 
economy, (b) reducing poverty and ensuring social inclusion, (c) managing environmental and natural 
resources in a sustainable manner, and (d) building institutions to support the above actions and promote 
modern governance. 
 
The cross-cutting nature of the policy dialogue PRSCs support strengthens coordination among line 
ministries and government agencies.  Their emphasis on a selected number of policy actions facilitates 
an in-depth discussion of their content.  Their demanding annual sequence, combined with the forward-
looking nature of the triggers used to launch the preparation of the next operation in the cycle, helps 
keep the pace of reform.  Progress made on public financial management over the last decade mitigates 
the risks associated with direct budget support.  In addition to providing resources to the budget, PRSC 
operations serves as an effective donor coordination device, supported by an increasingly large number 
of development partners.  PRSCs have been co-financed by bilateral and multilateral agencies, either 
through grants or through parallel lending   
2. Proposed objective(s) 
 
The proposed credit is the third in a five-year cycle aimed at supporting the implementation of the 
SEDP.  PRSCs are well-suited to address the challenges Vietnam currently faces.  This operation aims to 
maintain the momentum for the reforms needed to transform Vietnam from a transition to a middle-
Page  2
income country.  Through policy dialogues it aims to share which the knowledge the World Bank and 
participating development partners collectively possess with the Vietnamese authorities, and to improve 
coherence among government agencies, and hence, policies through coordination and improving 
communication. 
3. Preliminary description 
 
PRSC 8 has 11 triggers, negotiated with the government under PRSC7, in the areas of (a) state sector, 
(b) financial sector, (c) energy, (d) education, (e) health, (f) social protection, (g) forests, (h) 
environment, (i) public financial management, (j) legal development, and (k) anti-corruption.  Sufficient 
progress towards achieving them will form the basis for proceeding with the operation.  In addition to 
the 11 triggers, there are benchmarks that guide the policy dialogues, which are classified under four 
pillars: (i) business development, (ii) social inclusion, (iii) natural resources, and (iv) modern 
governance.  The benchmarks are determined in consultation with the government and participating 
development partners. 
 
4. Environment Aspects 
 
The rapid growth and structural transformation associated with Vietnam’s transition to a market 
economy does raise issues of environmental sustainability. To address these concerns PRSC operations 
have contained policy actions aimed at strengthening environmental management and encouraging the 
sustainable use of natural resources.  In the proposed operation, following the SEDP, environmental and 
natural resource management is viewed as a key pillar of the reform agenda. Supporting analytical work 
by the Bank, including the Country Environmental Assessment, as well as analyses of Poverty-
Environment Nexus and biodiversity, are employed to better understand environmental impacts, 
identifying gaps in the existing institutional arrangements and incentives necessary for improved 
environmental governance.  The government has developed a regulatory framework for environmental 
impact assessments, standards and compliance monitoring with the overall responsibility under the 
Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment.  Though its present field level capacity is limited, the 
government appears committed to undertaking a substantive program of environmental capacity 
building, institutional strengthening, environmental and land use planning as well as physical investment 
projects addressing environmental issues.  Donor support for national environmental programs is strong 
and covers a diverse range of initiatives across many sectors.
