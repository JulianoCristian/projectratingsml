Implementation Status Overview
The Project, approved June 5, 2007, became effective on January 11, 2008. There was a first restructuring of July 29, 2011 (approved October 31, 2012) undertaken to refine the
scope of the Project in order to improve project performance towards its development objectives. The components and subcomponents remained unchanged but the restructuring
narrowed the range of activities that were included in some subcomponents. The restructuring extended project closure from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013. A second
o   level 2 restructuring of November 7, 2013 (approved November 14, 2013) granted an extension in project close of 10 months. This is the last ISR as the Project closes October 31,
2014.
o   The Project performance has been rated MS for PDO achievement and Implementation Progress.
r   As of October 6, 2014, more than 99.06% of the grant had been disbursed, amounting to 98,268,919.7SDR (out of 99,2M SDR). Most of the non-disbursed funds were related to
O   construction activities.
0- Many planned activities were implemented satisfactorily, including:
*      1467 classrooms, 187 offices for school directors, and 167 sanitary facilities were rehabilitated or rebuilt;
*      Rehabilitation and equipping of the National Pedagogical University;
*      Acquisition of 18 million textbooks, all of which have been delivered to the provincial levels and with the majority of the books delivered to the schools;
*      Training of 53,230 teachers and inspectors on the national curriculum program;
*      Salary payments of 20,155 teaching posts;
*      Payment of operating costs to 26,210 registered schools;
*      Undertaking of a public expenditures tracking survey (PETS);
*      Undertaking of 2 rounds of students learning assessment (PASEC);
*      Development of 3 sub-sector strategies;
*      Development of the Education sector-wide strategy;
*      Development of the 'Loi cadre' (the Institutional Education Framework law).
There have, however, been some delays in school construction, due to the difficulty of working in some regions.
The Project is set to close smoothly. There are a few outstanding contracts, mostly for audits.
