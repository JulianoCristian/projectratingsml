The restructuring is a level two restructuring. One\n            of the strengths of the project, as indicated in the\n            findings of the recent Quality Assessment of Lending\n            Portfolio (QALP), lies with a 'relevant and appropriate\n            DO that reflects the strategic focus of the project'.\n            The restructuring will be undertaken to refine the scope of\n            the project in order to improve project performance towards\n            its development objectives. The components and subcomponents\n            will remain but the restructuring will narrow the range of\n            activities that are included in some subcomponents. Using\n            the positive developments in the sector, alternative\n            measures will be proposed in order to facilitate the\n            financing of teachers' salaries and the schools'\n            operating costs. In addition, the restructuring will\n            introduce, on a relatively modest basis, the community\n            participatory factor in the school rehabilitation program.\n            This factor stems from the school construction strategy that\n            was recently developed by the Government with project's\n            technical support. Finally, the restructuring proposes a one\n            year extension of the project closing date from December 31,\n            2012 to December 31, 2013 to help complete the execution of\n            some core activities."}, "docdt": "2012-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
