1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Country context

1.       At the time of project appraisal, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was one
of the poorest countries in the world despite its rich endowment of natural resources. The
country also faced high levels of social unrest and political fragility, as it had recently
emerged from a nine-year conflict in 2003 during which an estimated five million people
had been killed. The protracted conflict, combined with decades of mismanagement, had
a severe, negative impact on the country’s social and economic development. As of 2007,
the DRC ranked very low on the UNDP Human Development Index (only 167 out of a
total of 177 countries) and the large majority of the population lived under the poverty line.
Access to basic social services was extremely limited. The country’s difficult state of
affairs was reflected, in part, in its low annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
of US$554 and high levels of corruption and poor governance. 2 Achievement of the
millennium development goals (MDGs) appeared out of reach.

2.      Despite the poor living conditions of the population and the country’s faltering
economy, some progress at the time was observed in the country’s recovery. In addition to
holding democratic elections in 2006, the Government had also taken concrete steps to
secure the fragile peace and to strengthen the country’s economy. Starting from a very low
base, real GDP had steadily stabilized and began to show signs of recovery following the
end of the conflict. Increased exports and inflows of foreign direct investment, together
with renewed donor involvement, structural reforms in the public sector, and a more
stringent monetary policy provided the necessary context for the country’s economic
recovery to gain momentum. Although modest gains were observed, the economy still
remained highly susceptible to external shocks and the political climate remained fragile
and vulnerable to renewed instability and conflict. It was within this extremely difficult
post-conflict context that the Education Sector Project (P086294) (Projet d’Appui pour le
Redressement du Secteur de l’Education – PARSE) was conceived and prepared.

Sector background

3.      At the time of project preparation and appraisal, the education sector faced a
number of critical challenges, including: (i) limited access to education (characterized by
regional and gender disparities); (ii) poor quality of education services provided; and (iii)
lack of a legal and regulatory framework to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector
– particularly in terms of ensuring its financial sustainability.

4.     Limited access to Education. Equitable access to education, particularly at the
lower levels of the education system, was problematic. Compared with other Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) countries, there was low coverage at the primary level, estimated at 64


2
  The annual GDP per capita amounted to around two-thirds of the SSA average. The DRC was among the
ten most corrupt countries in the World according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perception
Index.

                                                  1
percent.3 Although the country’s 2005 Constitution had stipulated that primary education
was to be compulsory and fee-free, the Government faced considerable difficulties in
rolling out this policy. In spite of the formal adoption of this policy, households continued
to finance the costs of education – covering up to 75 percent of school operating fees as
well as costs of teacher salary top-ups, books, uniforms and other incidentals. While these
financial contributions were necessary for schools to operate, they also prevented many
children from poorer households from attending and completing primary school.

5.      Poor Quality of Education Services. The quality of primary education provided in
the DRC was poor with only one-third of children residing in urban areas and one-fifth of
those in rural areas (who had entered school) reaching fifth grade. The poor quality of
education in the DRC was a result of a number of factors, including: (i) a limited number
of trained teachers; (ii) inadequate and insufficient learning and teaching materials (i.e.,
textbooks); and (iii) an inadequate teaching and learning environment with most schools
having been destroyed or in major disrepair, rendering hundreds of classrooms unusable.
Approximately one-third of the country’s schools were in such poor condition that they
could not withstand inclement weather. Without these necessary inputs, improvements in
the quality of education in the DRC would not be possible.

6.      Lack of a legal and regulatory framework to ensure the long-term sustainability of
the sector. At the time of project appraisal, the sector was receiving less than two percent
of the GDP which was three points below the SSA average of five percent at the time. The
system had been chronically underfunded—receiving less than ten percent of the national
budget in 2006—an amount which was insufficient for rebuilding and further developing
the education sector. The lack of a sustainable financing mechanism posed a significant
obstacle to achieving the larger objectives of increasing equitable access to education,
improving its quality, and strengthening institutional capacity to manage the education
system.

Rationale for Bank assistance

7.      The needs of the education sector were substantial.4 At the time of project appraisal,
the education system was, in fact, running in ‘crisis’ mode and the Government faced
extreme challenges due to the post-conflict context. As such, support from the Bank at the
time of project preparation/implementation was instrumental as it would buttress the
reform efforts in the sector initiated by the Government. In addition, Bank support would
act as a catalyst to garner support from other development partners (DPs). Donor coverage
of the education sector, despite widespread support for a sector-wide approach (SWAp) as
embodied in this operation, had been fragmented up until that time. The Bank also had
significant experience working in the DRC and had the relevant technical expertise to guide


3
  Even if secondary at 23 percent and tertiary levels at six percent were comparable to SSA averages.
4
  In addition to these major challenges, additional challenges included: M&E, mapping of school needs;
reorganization and simplification of the cumbersome administrative structures, including payment of
teachers; providing adequate financial resources to support the education system; empowering local
communities to participate in school-level decisions; and providing adequate infrastructure.

                                                  2
the development of a sector-wide approach. Furthermore, the Bank had the experience
necessary to influence the country’s macroeconomic policy. Each of these aspects of Bank
support would be important in establishing the legal and regulatory framework for the long-
term development and sustainability of the education sector.

8.       The Education Sector Project was aligned with the Government’s development
priorities at the time which were reflected in several key documents, including the 2006
Letter of Education Sector Policy which guided the reorganization and strengthening of the
sector, the Education for All (EFA) Action Plan, and the Pact to Modernize Higher
Education. The Project was also closely aligned with the support being provided by other
donors5 active in the education sector. The Education Sector Project intended to build upon
and further strengthen the Government’s consultation committee which had been gaining
prominence since 2003 as a mechanism by which ministries could re-engage in the sector
with DPs and better coordinate their support.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9.      The original PDO as described in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) of June 8, 2007 6 was ‘to prevent further
deterioration in the delivery of essential services for primary education and prepare the
ground for a sustainable development and financing of the sector that will facilitate donor
coordination and future transition to a sector wide program’. The original PDO-level
indicators are listed in Table 1 below.7

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.      The PDO was not modified during project implementation. The first restructuring,
approved in October 2012, introduced the following changes to the results framework (RF):
(i) two PDO-level indicators were added8; (ii) one PDO-level indicator was revised; (ii)
several targets for both PDO- and intermediate-level indicators were adjusted upwards; and
(iv) a number of intermediate-level indicators were added and some were made more
specific. The newly added intermediate-level indicators were the following: (i) additional
classrooms built or rehabilitated at the primary level resulting from project intervention (as
a core indicator); (ii) new school construction norms adopted for the application of a cost-
effective school construction strategy; (iii) primary teachers in ‘registered’ schools
integrated into the public payroll; (iv) the Basic Education Interim Development Plan
implemented according to an agreed plan; (v) Citizen Report Card Survey (CRC) and
Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) piloted in selected educational provinces; (vi)
based on lessons learnt from the CRC and PETS, an action plan put in place for eventual
scale-up; and (vii) a system for learning assessment at the primary level established. A few
intermediate-level indicators were also dropped. Annex 10 provides a comprehensive
overview of PDO- and intermediate-level indicators and changes made to the RF over the
life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11.     This Project aimed to reach a large number of beneficiaries, including: children of
primary school age; primary school students; school inspectors; educational advisors;
trainers; teachers; and other government education staff. Annex 2 provides a complete list
of project beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

12.     The Project was comprised of four components:

Component 1: Increase Access and Equity at Primary Level (At Appraisal: US$104.52
million; Revised Allocation: US$108.9 million; Actual Expenditure: US$107.64 million,
or 103 percent of the appraisal estimate). This component included four sub-components.

13.     This component aimed to: rehabilitate primary school infrastructure (sub-
component 1a), support rehabilitation of the National Pedagogical University (Université
Pédagogique Nationale - UPN) (sub-component 1b); improve equity of access to primary
education (sub-component 1c); and strengthen safeguards in the teacher pay system (sub-
component 1d). In addition to rehabilitating primary school classrooms and other key
infrastructure (e.g., latrines) and the UPN, this component also aimed to increase equitable
access to primary education by eliminating parents’ monetary contributions to cover the


8
  These were: (i) the number of direct project beneficiaries (percentage of whom are female (as a core
indicator)); and (ii) the grade one gross intake rate.

                                                  4
operating costs of schools targeted by the Project, increase local communities’ participation
in school-level decision-making, and strengthen safeguards in the payment of teachers’
salaries.

Component 2: Improve Quality of Primary Education (At Appraisal: US$28.76
million; Revised Allocation: US$25.3 million; Actual Expenditure: US$28.72 million, or
99.9 percent of the appraisal estimate). This component included two sub-components.

14.    This component aimed to provide reading and math textbooks and teachers’ guides
in primary schools as essential teaching-learning materials (sub-component 2a). It also
sought to build institutional capacity to measure learning outcomes (sub-component 2b) as
a means of assessing the quality of education provided.

Component 3: Strengthen Institutional and Financial Capacity of the Education
Sector (At Appraisal: US$5.06 million; Revised Allocation: US$7.2 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$6.99 million, or 138.1 percent of the appraisal estimate). This component
included two sub-components.

15.      The objective of this component was to contribute to revising the legal and
institutional frameworks of the education system and reinforce institutional capacity for
planning, budget formulation and program execution. This would be achieved through
support to key policy reforms related to the teacher career structure (sub-component 3a)
and the preparation and implementation of a sector-wide education strategy, including a
legal framework and financing plans (sub-component 3b).

Component 4: Project Coordination and Management (At Appraisal: US$11.17
million; Revised Allocation: US$9.1 million; Actual Expenditure: US$8.85 million, or
79.2 percent of the appraisal estimate).

16.     This component aimed to support project management and coordination of the
Steering Committee comprised of the Ministry of National Education, the Ministry of
Higher Education, the-then Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity, the Ministry
of Finance and the Ministry of Budget. It also provided support for the operation of a
Project Coordination and Management Unit (PCMU) and financed the acquisition of
ancillary goods and services.

1.6 Revised Components

17.     Though the PDO and the project components were not revised during the life of the
Project, reallocations were made between components in line with changes made to the

1.7 Other significant changes

18.     A level 2 restructuring was undertaken in October 2012.10 The main objective of
the restructuring was to narrow the scope of the Project to support those activities which
could best contribute to the achievement of the PDO. Up until that point, disbursement had
been sluggish and several disbursement conditions were found to be unworkable – notably
those related to the payment of teachers’ salaries and operating costs of schools targeted
by the Project. While the components and sub-components remained unchanged, the range
of project-supported activities was reduced and the RF was significantly improved. The
modifications introduced in the RF included: (a) the addition of new indicators at the PDO-
and intermediate level (including measures to assess any reduction in the financial burden
on households and the adoption of new school construction norms); and (b) the revision of
some intermediate-level indicators to be more specific and time-bound in-line with the
extension of the closing date. Further, this restructuring also introduced modifications to:
(c) disbursement conditions to strengthen their alignment with the reality of the sector and
its development (e.g., facilitating the financing of teachers’ salaries and the payment of
school operating costs); and (d) project activities to increase focus on those expected to
have the largest impact on achieving the PDO. This restructuring also introduced a new
implementation method for the second phase of the civil works program (primary school


9
  Proceeds initially allocated to civil works related to the rehabilitation of the UPN (sub-component 1(b))
were reduced by 48 percent. Initial costs were slightly over-estimated and with the delays in implementation,
rehabilitation activities for the university were limited to works delegated to the United Nations Office for
Project Services (UNOPS) to manage. The remaining amount originally allocated to these works was
reallocated to activities for increasing education access and quality (e.g. the provision of textbooks and school
furniture, technical assistance).
10
   The Level 2 restructuring was initiated in July 2011 but was only approved in October 2012. This was the
results of administrative delays on the part of the Bank.

infrastructure) – wherein civil works activities were undertaken by the Unité de
Coordination des Projets (UCOP), the Government’s project coordination unit, and
community participation was strongly encouraged. It further formalized the procurement
arrangements that had been in use since the Project was approved. Finally, this
restructuring extended the project closing date by one year from December 31, 2012 to
December 31, 2013.

19.     A second level 2 restructuring was undertaken in November 2013 which extended
the project closing date by ten months from December 31, 2013 to October 31, 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation

20.     Project preparation began in 200411, but was put on hold due to concerns related to
potential fiduciary risks in the DRC at the time. At the 2006 World Bank Annual Meetings,
requests were put forward to re-launch project preparation. The operation’s design was
reviewed, adjusted to new circumstances, and re-appraised in the fall of 2005. The Bank
team which undertook the preparation of this operation possessed the necessary skills and
expertise across all relevant areas. Given the difficult post-conflict context, and concerns
related to capacity, a very thorough risk assessment was undertaken to identify risks and
devise mitigation strategies to address them.12 As this Project was the first comprehensive
operation undertaken in the sector after a series of emergency loans, a number of in-depth
studies were conducted which focused on economic and financial, technical, fiduciary,
social, governance, and environmental issues.13 Safeguard requirements were effectively
met with an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) produced during preparation and disclosed both in-
country and at the World Bank Infoshop.

Design

21.    The Project’s design fit squarely with the Government’s 2006 Letter of Education
Sector Policy and the most significant needs of the sector, as identified in key documents


11
   The key dates of the preparation were as follows: Concept Note Review– October 27, 2004; Appraisal –
November 23, 2005; and final project signing – June 8, 2007.
12
   In addition to Section 5 of the PAD, Annex 16 (Critical Risks and Governance Response) includes detailed
information on these risks and mitigation measures.
13
   These included in-depth studies of the teacher salary payment system, enrollment trends, education for
under-served groups, and an institutional and policy assessment. In addition to the in-depth and
comprehensive Country Status Report on the education system (World Bank, 2005), the Bank carried out a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2005), a Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR, 2004), Public Expenditure Reviews, a survey of users of public services (BERCI, 2004), a Risk &
Vulnerability Assessment to help prepare the IDA-financed Emergency Social Action Project, as well as a
more comprehensive poverty analysis (Poverty Diagnostic and Priorities of the Poor, 2005).

                                                    7
produced by the Bank and the Government. The design also took into account lessons
learned from Bank operations in other conflict-affected countries and in the DRC and the
findings of the thorough reviews which were undertaken during preparation as well as the
PRSP of July 2007. Some of the most pertinent lessons which informed the original design
of the project were the following: (i) Bank support within the education sector should be
integrated into the broader development framework of debt relief, poverty reduction and
promotion of economic growth; (ii) education projects should be stand-alone operations in
order to ensure an adequate level of operational funds and technical expertise to oversee
project implementation; (iii) complementarity among donor-funded initiatives should be
emphasized in order to leverage the country’s capacity to implement programs and develop
reform policies in education; and (iv) the Government should take steps to increase the
share of the national budget allocated to education in order to promote access and to reduce
the financial burden of schooling – especially among poorer households.

22.     Despite the strong alignment of project activities with the prevailing needs at the
time, the design of the project was ambitious given the difficult post-conflict environment
which characterized the DRC. The magnitude of need in terms of both stabilizing and
strengthening the education sector in the longer-term following a period of protracted
conflict played a key role in the articulation of a far-reaching and ambitious PDO – to
prevent deterioration in the sector and lay the groundwork for sustainable the development
and financing of the sector that will facilitate donor coordination and future transition to
a sector-wide program. In attempting to stabilize a system which was in disarray, the PDO
was broad and this was reflected in how the project objectives were articulated by the
Government and the project team. It is important to note that the Project’s PDO was
originally suggested by the 2005 Quality Enhancement Review (QER) and re-endorsed by
the 2010 Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) as “relevant” and “appropriate”.
While the PDO could have been more explicit, the aims of each of the Project’s components
were both specific and measurable. The Project’s objectives, therefore, can be inferred by
examining how the project-supported activities (as measured by both their stated aims and
associated outcome targets) were expected to positively impact the sector in terms of
increasing equitable access at the primary level, improving the quality of primary education,
and strengthening capacity for policy planning, budgeting and program execution in key
areas during both the pre- and post-restructuring period.14

23.     The key performance indicators (KPIs) were highly relevant to the Government’s
overarching sector objectives and, as was common practice at the time, a number of the
PDO-level indicators were sector-wide. The intermediate-level indicators were also
closely aligned with the specific project objectives. The RF was further improved upon
under the first restructuring, when additional performance measures were introduced to
more fully capture progress made towards the achievement of the PDO.




14
  The approach of measuring the achievement of project objectives by examining the level of attainment
across each of the outcome-level indicators is consistent with the guidance provided in the OPCS Guidelines
for instances in which the PDO is less well articulated.

                                                    8
24.    The rationale underlying the project design was well articulated in the PAD and
provides plausible linkages between the project-supported activities and the envisioned
outputs and outcomes. The PAD also illustrates how each of the supported activities could,
when implemented together, lead to the achievement of both component and sub-
component aims.

25.     The Project’s original design was technically sound and well-justified, taking into
consideration a number of potential risks that could negatively impact project
implementation. At the same time, however, the original design did not fully account for
the extremely difficult implementation environment of a post-conflict setting. This
ambitious initial design was influenced by a number of factors: the far-reaching challenges
and existing needs of the sector at the time; the Government’s strong commitment to
addressing these various needs; and the Bank’s experience in successfully supporting
sector-wide operations in similar contexts.15 Although this original design was laudable,
it did not adequately take into account the potential impact that some of the identified risks
– such as the limited institutional capacity in the DRC at the time – could have on project
implementation. Though the Project design relied primarily on the Ministry of National
Education (Ministère de l’Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et Professionnel (MEPSP))
for data collection, analysis and reporting under the Project, the MEPSP did not initially
possess this capacity and had only a nascent M&E system. Further, while the effective and
timely implementation of activities presupposed a well-functioning fiduciary support
system 16 , the financial management (FM) and procurement functions were not fully
established and had to rely on ad hoc support from other Bank-funded projects in the DRC
in the beginning of the project life. Moreover, although the Project supported capacity-
building activities specifically related to M&E within the MEPSP, these were insufficient
to guarantee the timely monitoring of and reporting on project-supported activities during
the early stages of the Project.

Quality at Entry

26.      The original project design and objectives were strongly aligned with the
Government’s goals for the primary education sub-sector and included a number of
activities to attain them. The rationale behind activities supported by the Project was clear
and when implemented together had the potential to positively the sector’s financial and
institutional capacity in the long term. Further, the Bank team supporting project
preparation possessed the appropriate mix of technical skills in all relevant areas.

27.     Despite these strengths, a number of shortcomings negatively impacted the
Project’s Quality at Entry: (i) although the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators were
highly relevant, too few measures were included in the original RF to comprehensively


15
   At the time, the project team was influenced by the Country Director and the Regional Vice-President who,
after discussions with a Government eager for a project of broad scope, saw a ‘window of opportunity’ for
long-term sector investment.
16
   As the PCMU had limited staff and expertise, it had to rely on other teams for support (e.g., relying on FM
support from the WB MAP Project team ((P082516) in Health))

                                                      9
assess performance under each of the Project’s objectives; (ii) while efforts were made to
identify and assess risks to project implementation, some were not adequately accounted
for in the project design, in particular, those pertaining to capacity to execute project
activities and perform key fiduciary and data reporting functions; and (iii) challenges
associated with the successful implementation of far-reaching reforms (i.e., passing key
legislation, implementing the fee-free policy, etc.) and developing and adopting new core
structures (i.e., teacher career structure, pre- and in-service teacher training systems, etc.)
to support the sector had been underestimated.

28.        In light of the above, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

29.      Project implementation can be characterized by three distinct phases – a slow
beginning, an ‘accelerated’ period of implementation, and a period of steady
implementation in the final phase. The evolution of the disbursement rate over the project
life is shown in Figure 1.

30.     The Project became effective on January 11, 2008. At that time, the Project
Coordination and Management Unit (PCMU) consisted of only two staff members. The
other staff joined the unit approximately ten months later in November 2008, with the entire
team being in place only by early 2009. As would be expected, this resulted in a slow rate
of disbursement in the initial phase. Moreover, during this period, little progress was made
towards the achievement of the PDO. For instance, there was no progress in terms of
identifying and absorbing teachers onto the public payroll17 and in terms of supporting
schools’ operating expenses—both of which were key objectives of the Project and
conditions for disbursement. Limited progress and low disbursement up until this point
was reflected in the downgrading of key ratings (implementation progress and progress
towards achievement of the PDO) to Moderately Unsatisfactory in ISR 6. By June 2010,
only 17 percent of project financing had been disbursed.




17
     This was one of the major activities of sub-component 1c.

31.      The second phase of the Project was characterized by an accelerated pace of
implementation. Key findings of the mid-term review (MTR) of November 2010 led to
the development of corrective measures to ensure the Project would move forward and
included an extensive action plan – the implementation of which was to be monitored and
closely followed. The rate of disbursement picked up during this period as more project
activities got underway. However, a number of issues (i.e., difficulty in identifying
teachers in registered schools, continued limited FM and procurement capacity) still
continued to hamper project implementation and were not adequately addressed in follow-
up missions. As of October 2012 (near the Project’s original closing date), 44 percent of
project funds had been disbursed.

32.      The level 2 restructuring which was undertaken in July 2011 and approved on
October 31, 2012 reduced the scope of the Project and introduced a number of performance
measures to better capture the achievements made under the Project. Although the
Project’s components remained unchanged, the restructuring narrowed the range of
activities that would be supported under each. Alternative disbursement conditions18 for
the payment of teachers’ salaries and schools’ operating costs were agreed upon in order
to facilitate project implementation. This first restructuring also extended the project
closing date by one year from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to increase the
likelihood that the outputs and outcomes planned under the Project would be achieved
during the project life.




18
  These conditions were adjusted to be more in line with the reality of the sector and its development, in turn,
facilitating the financing of teachers’ salaries and school operating costs based on lessons learned from other
IDA-financed projects.

                                                          11
33.     Throughout each period of project implementation, the Bank team provided close
supervision and support through monthly video conferences to review progress in
conjunction with extensive in-country missions. The 2012 restructuring led to a marked
improvement in the pace of project implementation, as reflected in an increased rate of
disbursement and the large number of achievements realized during the latter part of the
Project (see Section 3.2 and Annexes 2, 3, and 10 for further details). At the time of project
closing in October 2014, over 99 percent of project funds had been disbursed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

34.     M&E Design. The M&E activities aimed to monitor and report on a number of
aspects of education sector development, including: (i) education sector improvements
tracked by a set of core indicators which were Project-specific; (ii) the Government’s
commitment to reforms based on implementation of key country-specific policy targets in
the areas of access, equity, quality, and efficiency; (iii) analytic work for developing
knowledge for education reform, forward-planning and capacity-building to provide
important baseline data; and (iv) donor harmonization and financial support, which was
undertaken by the education ministries and by the donor coordination group. The Project’s
RF relied on the collection of data and production of statistics by MEPSP and project
progress reports were to be submitted by the PCMU to track progress under the Project and
in the sector overall.

35.     M&E Implementation and Utilization. At the beginning of the Project, MEPSP’s
capacity to collect, analyze and report on data was very limited. Although capacity-
building measures were included in the Project’s design, they were not sufficient initially
to ensure that M&E functions could be performed reliably and quickly enough to meet
project needs and to report on project performance and progress. Limitations in M&E
capacity was highlighted in aide-memoires. The timely collection of quality data, including
school-level data, posed a considerable challenge given the logistical hurdles stemming
from the country’s immense size and difficult topography. These limitations also delayed,
to some extent, the monitoring of and reporting on progress made under the Project during
the initial period of its implementation. The 2010 QALP exercise recommended, given
these difficulties, that the Project team consider hiring a third party to collect and verify
data. Although this recommendation was not heeded, the quality of the RF and systematic
collection of data did significantly improve over the life of the Project.

36.     Under the 2012 restructuring, a number of revisions were introduced to the
Project’s RF and M&E arrangements. At the PDO-level, the target for the indicator related
to the Education Sector Strategy was made more specific by including a sustainable
medium-term financing plan. Two PDO-level indicators were added to the RF: (i) increase
in the first grade intake rate; and (ii) the number of project beneficiaries, including the
percentage of female beneficiaries (as a core indicator). At the intermediate-level, a number
of indicators were added, sharpened and clarified while a few others were dropped.
Moreover, at both the PDO- and intermediate-levels, end-of-project targets were revised
upwards given the additional time allotted for project implementation. This approach
reflected the team and Government’s desire to maintain the ambitious nature of the
operation. A few indicators to measure change attributable to the Project were included in
                                             12
the RF to measure the impact of project-supported interventions, including, notably, the
roll out of the fee-free policy in primary education, the provision of funding for school
operating costs subsidies, and the adoption of new school construction norms. One
important measure, the Citizen Report Card (CRC) Survey, was to gauge the impact of the
fee free policy, by systematically assessing the changes in the financial burden of school
costs on households. The CRC, however, was not carried out under the Project. As such,
although the Project was able to monitor the payment of teachers and provision of resources
to cover schools’ operating costs (a major accomplishment under the Project), it is difficult
to have a full understanding of the extent to which the fee-free policy and the Bank’s
support of these activities shifted the financial burden away from households and towards
the Government.

37.      Another challenge which the M&E system faced was that many project-financed
inputs and activities required continued monitoring and oversight, including, in some cases,
at the point of service delivery. This was a significant undertaking in light of the logistical
challenges of the DRC’s geographic expanse. To track these processes, the supervision
team conducted: (i) a beneficiary assessment; (ii) two targeted audits (under the Bank-
financed Emergency Urban and Social Rehabilitation Project (Project d’urgence de
réhabilitation urbaine et sociale – PURUS)) which looked at the financing of school
operating costs; and (iii) a quality of service delivery assessment as part of the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. Assessments under the Project were frequently
carried out in collaboration with other organizations. For example, two student learning
assessments (PASEC) for grades 2 and 5 in 2010 and 2013, respectively, were carried out
under the Project. While the RF and data reporting did significantly improve over the life
of the Project, a more detailed understanding of the implementation of some project
activities would have been possible if all of the planned assessments had been carried out.

38.   While the M&E did significantly improve following the 2012 restructuring, overall,
the M&E design, implementation and utilization is rated Modest.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Fiduciary Compliance

39.     The fiduciary aspects of the Project were handled by the PCMU which, after almost
a one-year delay, was adequately staffed to satisfactorily carry out the Project’s FM and
procurement functions. 19 Procurement was handled in one of two ways: (i) under
Component 1, a Contracted Procurement Agency (CPA) was to be selected to support
procurement activities; and (ii) for all other activities, fiduciary responsibilities were vested
in a procurement specialist. After a misunderstanding related to the implementation of the
first approach led to some initial delays, responsibility for supporting all fiduciary activities
under Component 1 during Phase I of the Civil Works Program was assigned to the United


19
  The delay in recruitment occurred, in part, because an interim approach had been adopted wherein
procurement was handled under another Bank project, the MAP (P082516 in Health). As the full team was
not in place, the Project was slow to start for most of 2008.

                                                 13
Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS). Although the working relationship between
the PCMU and UNOPS was initially problematic and caused some delays in project
implementation,20 procurement was effectively handled by UNOPS. In Phase II, however,
procurement under Component 1 was transferred to the Government through the UCOP, a
project coordination unit in the Ministry of Planning 21 which had prior experience in
procurement. The working relationship between UCOP and the PCMU faced some
challenges related to the proper delineation of roles and responsibilities of these two entities.
Procurement undertaken by the PCMU for activities under other components appears to
have been adequate. In instances in which reporting weaknesses were detected, solutions
were promptly proposed by the Bank and follow-up actions undertaken by the
Government.22

40.     FM under the Project was generally unproblematic and, for the most part, was rated
Satisfactory in Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) throughout the project life. FM was
only downgraded briefly to Moderately Satisfactory in March 2009 due to the poor quality
of interim reports which subsequently improved. Annual audit reports were received on
time, revealed no irregularities, and were of unqualified opinion. Only minor comments
were made, most often pertaining to small-scale ineligible expenditures which were
deemed to be the result of unintentional errors.23 In instances where full compliance was
not observed, ineligible expenditures were reimbursed fully and without issue.

Safeguard Compliance

40. Two safeguard issues were identified in the PAD related to Environmental Assessment
and Involuntary Resettlement. An ESMF and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) were
produced during project preparation and disclosed in-country and at the World Bank
Infoshop. The safeguards rating in ISRs was maintained at Satisfactory throughout the life
of the Project with all indications that appropriate attention was paid to these areas at all
times.24




20
   The relationship between the Project, the Government, the Bank, and the UN had to be formally defined
before work could begin, which took some time.
21
   Not to be confused with the UGCP, the PCMU for the Project.
22
   From the QALP of 2010.
23
   Random audits at those schools that had received operating costs from the Project revealed that correct
procedures had not always been followed and so the expenses were deemed ineligible. These were minor
issues. A list of eligible expenses was outlined in the Project operations manual, but before a school could
use these funds, a school committee had to decide on what would be purchased. In a few cases, the auditor
found that no minutes of this meeting were kept, and so he/she ruled that the expenses incurred from these
purchases must be, in principle, ineligible. In all, approximately US$36,000 was determined to be ineligible
(out of US$30 million) and was, therefore, reimbursed.
24
   For example, the last ISR adds the following comment: “Safeguards aspects are included as an integral
part of the school civil works program delegated to UNOPS and UCOP. A technical audit of UNOPS
program has indicated that there is a well-defined monitoring framework and that consultation with civil
society was undertaken. Mitigation measures were proposed when there are weaknesses. For on-going
program [sic] with UCOP, attention has been made to ensure that the local executing agencies adhere to the
principles and procedures.”

                                                    14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.     A new post-primary education project to be delivered in FY15 is currently under
preparation as a follow up to the Education Sector Project. This new IDA-funded operation
aims to improve learning outcomes at the lower secondary level and to support technical
training in areas that are experiencing significant growth in the DRC, such as construction,
agriculture and extractive industries.

42.     The MEPSP will lead this operation as implementing agency in coordination with
other ministries and inspectorates. The Center for Technical Assistance (Cellule
d’Assistance Technique – CAT) will play an advisory role. To build institutional capacity
for project management, this operation will be managed by a designated directorate within
MEPSP rather than by a separate project management unit. The Bank will continue to
provide technical guidance to the Government and maintain close collaboration with the
Government and other DPs operating in the sector. The design of the new project builds
upon approaches used under this Project and has taken into consideration findings from
this evaluation, particularly in relation to ensuring realism in the implementation schedule
and proposed arrangements for FM, procurement, and M&E.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives

43.      The project objectives were substantially relevant as they responded to key
challenges faced by the education sector in the DRC. These challenges included: a lack of
equitable access to primary education; low quality of instruction; a lack of pedagogical and
didactic materials such as textbooks and teachers’ guides; dilapidated school infrastructure;
the lack of a legal and regulatory framework for the sector; and the absence of a sustainable
financing mechanism for the sector. The activities that the Project supported under each of
its four components were well-aligned with the Government’s objectives of increasing
equitable access, improving the quality of education, and of strengthening the institutional
and financial capacity to effectively manage the sector. More specifically, project-
supported activities reflected the country’s needs as outlined in the 2006 Letter of
Education Sector Policy. The Bank’s support to the sector corresponded to the needs and
priorities identified in the PRSP and responded to the emphasis placed on education in the
Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) wherein education would consolidate the process of
stabilization and recovery – also objectives of the Education Sector Project.

44.     The overarching objectives of the Project remain substantially relevant today and
are aligned with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the DRC (FY13-FY16).
In particular, the current CAS highlights the need to provide sustainable financing to the
sector as a way to improve quality of education and, in turn, learning outcomes—both of
which are directly linked to the activities supported under this Project.



                                             15
45.     On the basis of the above, the relevance of objectives is rated Substantial in both
the pre- and post-restructuring periods.25

Relevance of Design

46.      As described in Section 2.1, the Project’s design was complex and ambitious,
particularly in light of the difficult and uncertain context in which it was to be implemented.
While the operation’s design incorporated a number of lessons learned from other contexts
and identified a number of potential risks to the Project’s effective implementation, at the
same time it underestimated a number of potential challenges, including: (i) the limited
capacity of the implementing agency to carry out key project activities and functions; (ii)
the difficulty of meeting major disbursement conditions which, in turn, significantly
delayed project implementation in the initial phase; and (iii) the complexity of carrying out
the M&E activities need to properly monitor project interventions and assess project
implementation/performance. Though the PDO was broad, the linkages between project
activities and intended outputs and outcomes were, nevertheless, sound under the original
design.

47.      As noted earlier, the PDO was not modified during the life of the Project as it was
deemed relevant and appropriate by the QER and the QALP. However, under the 2012
Restructuring, the scope of the operation was strategically revised. Specifically, certain
disbursement conditions were streamlined and a number of adjustments were made to
activities supported by sub-component 1c (improve equity of access to primary education),
sub-component 1d (strengthen safeguards in teacher payment system) and sub-component
3b (preparation and implementation of a sector-wide education strategy including a legal
framework and financing plans). New indicators were introduced into the RF to better
capture progress made towards the achievement of the PDO and completion of project
outputs. The upward adjustment of end-of-project targets under this restructuring reflected
the Bank’s and the Government’s desire to maintain the ambitious nature of the Project.
The restructured design facilitated the uptake in project activities and led to significant
increases in the level of disbursement during the post-restructuring period. The
strengthened design provided the framework in which a large number of achievements
were realized during the post-restructuring period. The more robust M&E allowed the
team to more fully document progress made in terms of both outputs and outcomes
achieved during the post-restructuring period.

48.     Based on the discussion above, the relevance of project design is rated Modest in
the pre- restructuring period and Substantial in the post-restructuring period.




25
  For purposes of analysis, the post-restructuring period or the period following the restructuring for also
includes the period following the second restructuring (as the latter restructuring simply extended the project
closing date by ten months and did not introduce any modifications to the PDO, components or performance
measures).

                                                     16
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.      For purposes of this evaluation, and in compliance with the established Operations
Policy and Country Services (OPCS) Guidelines, this section assesses project performance
in relation to two time periods – the period from project effectiveness to the 2012
Restructuring (Pre-Restructuring Period) and the period following the 2012 Restructuring
until the project closing date (Post-Restructuring Period). The post-restructuring period
also comprises a second restructuring undertaken in 2013 which extended the project
closing date by ten months. The decision to evaluate project performance in this way, in
two distinct periods rather than three, stems from the fact that the restructuring undertaken
in 2013 only extended the closing date and did not alter the Project’s objectives, scope,
activities and/or indicators.

50.     The following section provides an overview of project achievements in the pre-
restructuring and post-restructuring periods by project objectives and associated output and
outcome targets. Specifically, the analysis assesses the achievements against each
component’s objectives and includes those performance indicators which are associated
with each component’s aims. This approach is adopted since the objectives and indicators
associated with each of the components are logically connected to the overarching
objectives as laid out in the PDO (i.e., to prevent further deterioration in the delivery of
essential services for primary education 26 and to prepare ground for sustainable
development and financing of the sector that will facilitate donor coordination and future
transition to a sector-wide program). For a detailed overview of activities undertaken and
progress observed on each of the indicators over the life of the Project, refer to Annexes 2
and 10. As the analysis below reveals, the Project not only prevented further deterioration
of the sector but, in fact, stabilized the system and achieved considerable gains by project
closing.

Objective 1: Increasing Access and Equity at Primary Level

51.     In order to increase equitable access to primary education in the DRC, Component
1 supported the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, rehabilitation of the UPN,
provided financial resources to cover a portion of teachers’ salaries and schools’ operating
costs, and strengthened safeguards within the teacher payment system.

Pre-Restructuring Period

52.     Progress made in terms of outcomes linked to this objective during the pre-
restructuring period included an increase in the gross enrollment rate (GER) from 64



26
   Preventing the deterioration in the delivery of essential services implies the aim of providing quality
education in an equitable manner. This would be achieved by both rehabilitating the learning environment
(through rehabilitation and construction of classrooms, etc.) and providing necessary inputs (e.g., textbooks
and teachers’ guides, training of teachers) to improve the quality and relevance of education services provided.
In fact, from the targets of each of the indicators, it is clear that the objective was not only to prevent
deterioration, but also to further stabilize and subsequently improve service delivery.

                                                      17
percent to 90.8 percent. Gender parity also improved with the girls-to-boys ratio in primary
school increasing from 85 percent to 86 percent. A cost-effective school construction
strategy was developed to serve as the basis for the next phase of the rehabilitation program.
There were, however, significant delays in the implementation of the school rehabilitation
program with only 43 classrooms out of a planned 450 completed by the Project’s MTR in
2010. In addition, teachers’ salaries and schools’ operating costs could not be paid as the
conditions related to disbursement for these activities had not been met.27

Post-Restructuring Period

53.     In the post-restructuring period, the following progress was observed on PDO-level
indicators that pertain to this objective: (i) GER increased from 90.8 percent to 117 percent
(exceeding the end-of-project target of 105.8 percent); (ii) the gross grade one intake rate
increased from 107.7 percent to 133.1 percent (exceeding the end-of-project target of 129.8
percent); and (iii) the girls-to-boys ratio in primary school increased from 86 percent to 98
percent (nearly achieving the end-of-project target of 100 percent). In terms of
intermediate-level indicators linked to this objective, the following progress was observed:
(i) 93 percent (1,467 out of 1,572) of classrooms were built or rehabilitated at the primary
level resulting from the project intervention across all 11 of the country’s administrative
provinces; (ii) construction norms had been adopted for the application of a cost-effective
school construction strategy (achieving the end-of-project target); and (iii) the salaries of
20,15528 primary teachers in ‘registered’ schools were integrated into the public payroll
(achieving the end-of-project target).

54.      Studies and technical work on norms and standards for low-cost construction,
community participation in school management, and community oversight of civil works
activities in the DRC were also undertaken. This work contributed to the effective uptake
of these approaches under the Project and contributed to the Project’s success in increasing
equitable access to primary education throughout the DRC. While the unit costs of
classroom construction remained high in the first phase of construction under UNOPS, in
the second phase the average unit cost was lower than other comparable projects being
implemented in the DRC at the time (see Section 3.3 and Annex 3 for additional details).
The reduction in unit costs was a notable achievement under this Project given the
challenges of the prevailing context in the DRC at the time. In addition, the Project also
supported the rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of 187 offices for school directors and
167 sanitary facilities, and the UPN was rehabilitated and equipped. Further, the Project
covered the operating costs of 26,210 registered schools (amounting to approximately
US$400/school annually).



27
   Although the project had not been able to provide financing to cover teachers’ salaries and/or schools’
operating costs, the Government had undertaken its own efforts to support the fee-free policy by integrating
a large number of teachers from registered primary schools into the public payroll (to reduce costs borne by
households) as well as providing some financial support to primary schools to cover their operating costs and
to administration and pedagogy management units to partially cover their recurrent costs.
28
   This activity was supported with project funding. The total number of primary school teachers brought
onto the public payroll is much larger.

                                                    18
55.    The rehabilitation and reconstruction of classrooms (and associated infrastructure),
the construction and equipping of the UPN, the regularization and inclusion of 20,155
primary school teachers in ‘registered’ schools on the official public payroll, and the
payment of 26,210 schools’ operating costs constitute some of the major achievements of
the post-restructuring period (and of the Project). Together, they supported the
Government’s aim of increasing equitable access to education at the primary level
throughout the country. These activities fostered improved dialogue and strengthened
cooperation between Government entities (i.e., Ministries of Education and Finance) and
with local communities.

56.     In light of the above, the achievement of Objective 1 (Increasing Access and Equity
at the Primary Level) is rated Modest during the pre-restructuring period and Substantial
during the post-restructuring period.

Objective 2: Improving Quality of Primary Education

57.     In order to improve the quality and internal efficiency of primary education,
Component 2 sought to increase the availability of textbooks and teachers’ guides in core
subjects, provide in-service teacher training in the use of textbooks, and build capacity to
assess learning achievements and outcomes.

Pre-Restructuring Period

58.     Significant progress was observed in terms of this component’s only outcome-level
indicator with the primary completion rate (PCR) increasing from 29 percent in 2007 to
56.7 percent in 2012, constituting a doubling of the rate when compared to baseline at
project launch. At the intermediate level, progress was notable on each of the indicators
supporting this objective: (i) 14 million textbooks were purchased and distributed to
provincial education directorates, with 95 percent of schools reporting to have received the
books; (ii) a student-textbook ratio of 0.8 to 1 was achieved; (iii) around 278,000 teachers’
guides had been distributed; (iv) a large number of inspectors and school advisors had
received in-service training in the use of textbooks and training on the national curriculum
program; and (v) a dialogue on a national textbook policy had begun.

Post-Restructuring Period

59.     During the post-restructuring period, the positive trend observed in the PCR
continued, increasing from 56.7 percent to 80 percent (exceeding the end-of-project target
of 72.5 percent). In addition, by project closing, at the intermediate-level: (i) 18 million
textbooks and guides had been purchased and distributed (significantly exceeding the end-
of-project target of 14 million) and the student-textbook and teacher-guide ratios reached
1:2 (with each student having Math and French textbooks and each teacher having teacher
guides for these subjects) (achieving the end-of-project target); (ii) a total of 53,230
inspectors and school advisors had received in-service training in the use of textbooks and
training on the national curriculum program (achieving the end-of-project target); (iv) a
learning assessment mechanism for grade 5 had been established and two rounds of PASEC

                                             19
had been conducted (exceeding the end-of-project target); and (v) the Basic Education
Interim Plan was under implementation (achieving the end-of-project target). Further, the
component had significant outreach in terms of beneficiaries – far exceeding the end-of-
project target.29

60.     Prior to project effectiveness, the PCR was very low with a large portion of students
not graduating and a number of quality inputs lacking. In addition to an often poor learning
environment, students and teachers had limited access to necessary materials (textbooks in
core subjects, teachers’ guides, and so on) and it was not possible to systematically monitor
sector performance. The Project was able to provide the much-needed quality inputs and
have a greater reach than originally envisaged. Not only were a large number of student
textbooks and teachers’ guides for core subjects (mathematics and French) provided to
schools throughout the entire country, this was accomplished within a relatively short time
frame – a considerable achievement in light of the large size and often difficult topography
of the country. Training provided under the Project complemented the provision of the
texts and was important in ensuring their appropriate use and in increasing the lifespan of
these materials. Finally, the utility of the learning assessment system for primary schools
developed under the Project cannot be underestimated given its ability to inform decision-
making in the sub-sector. Together, these accomplishments have provided the framework
and foundation for strengthening the quality of education provided in the DRC. These
quality inputs are likely to positively impact learning outcomes in the medium- and long-
term.

61.    In light of the above, the achievement of Objective 2 (Improving the Quality of
Primary Education) is rated Substantial both during the pre- and post-restructuring
periods.
Objective 3: Strengthening Institutional and Financial Capacity of Education

62.     Component 3 sought to revise the legal and regulatory framework of the education
system by reinforcing institutional capacity for planning, budget formulation, and program
execution in the education sector. Specifically, the Component aimed to support the
development and adoption of: (i) a teacher career structure; (ii) pre- and in-service teacher
training systems; and (iii) a sector-wide medium-term strategy for education.

Pre-Restructuring

63.    Prior to the 2012 Restructuring, progress under Objective 3 was limited as is
evidenced in the slow progress on performance measures linked to this objective. While
an education sector strategy with a medium-term financing plan and indicators was being



29
  The final target for number of project beneficiaries was 4,878,140 (the total number of grade 1 and 2
students to receive textbooks under the Project). The total number of beneficiaries (including students,
teachers, inspectors, etc.) is estimated to be 5,076,733.


                                                  20
prepared with support from the Government and various DPs, the following activities had
not yet been completed: (i) reformed guidelines for pre-service and in-service teacher
training had not been developed; (ii) the Institutional Education Framework Law (organic
law or Loi cadre) had not been transmitted to Parliament for adoption; (iii) the Convention
of Partnerships had not been fully revised or implemented; (iv) CRC and PETS had not
been piloted in selected educational provinces; (v) an action plan had not been put in place
for eventual scale-up (which was to be developed, in part, on the basis of the CRC which
had not been undertaken); and (vi) a draft teacher career structure (to address teacher
training, deployment, salary and incentives) had not been approved by the Government.

Post-Restructuring

64.     Despite the limited progress during the pre-restructuring period, significant and far-
reaching gains were observed during the post-restructuring period related to this objective.
In terms of the PDO-level indicator linked to this objective, an Education Sector Strategy
and three sub-sector strategies 30 with a sustainable medium-term financing plan (with
indicators agreed with donors and approved by Government), had been developed, thus
achieving the end-of-project target. In terms of intermediate-level indicators associated
with Objective 3: (i) reformed guidelines for pre-service teacher training had been
developed and were being applied, achieving the end-of-project target; (ii) the Institutional
Education Framework law had been approved by Government, achieving the end-of-
project target; (iii) the Convention of Partnerships had been revised and implemented,
achieving the end-of-project target; and (iv) a draft of the teacher career structure, including
teacher training, deployment, salary and incentives, had been approved by the Government,
achieving end-of-project target. While the PETS had been piloted, the CRC had not been
undertaken. As such, an action plan was not put in place for eventual scale up since this
activity relied on inputs from the CRC.

65.     In sum, the development and finalization of the Education Sector Strategy was a
major achievement under this Project, as was the promulgation of the Institutional
Education Framework Law which covered all aspects of the national teaching corps and
further strengthened the institutional and financial capacity of the education sector.
Monitoring of sector performance improved and a statistical yearbook is now published on
an annual basis.

66.    In light of the above, the achievement of Objective 3 (Strengthening Institutional
and Financial Capacity of Education) is rated Modest during the pre-restructuring period
and Substantial during the post-restructuring period.




30
  Sub-sector strategies for MEPSP, MESU, and Ministry of Non-formal Education and Literacy were
developed which have received support from various DPs, including GPE.

                                              21
3.3 Efficiency

67.     Despite a slow start, the efficiency of implementation significantly improved in the
post-restructuring period.

68.     Textbooks. The project provided a total of 18 million textbooks. The unit cost of
books for mathematics and French in grades 1 and 2 are different because two different
approaches were adopted to procure them. In the first round, publishers were chosen to
provide books and deliver them to three major entry points in the west, east and south of
the DRC from where the MEPSP arranged local delivery. In the second phase, publishers
were responsible for delivering textbooks to sub-provincial education directorates. The unit
cost for textbooks, without delivery, was US$1.32. This is high compared to education
projects in Eritrea31 where the unit cost is US$0.60 and Mauritania32 where the unit cost is
US$0.73. The unit costs are in line with those observed in Sierra Leone33 where the unit
cost ranges from US$0.97 to US$1.66 and in Niger34 where unit costs range from US$1.10
to US$1.40.

69.     Construction. A comparison of the cost of construction financed by various DPs
working in the DRC is relevant given the emphasis under this Project on low cost
construction (see Table 3 below). It should be noted that the cost of the work amongst
various DPs in different, select regions, is not easy to compare because of regional
variations based on distance, logistics, etc. While construction costs are assessed to have
been high during the pre-restructuring phase (phase 1) of the Project when managed by
UNOPS but were markedly lower, on average, in the post-restructuring phase (phase 2).

70.     While many ICRs describe unit costs per classroom, differences in classroom
design make for difficult comparisons. Unit cost by square meter helps to address this to
some extent. Although there are not many SSA countries with available data, the unit cost
per classroom under this Project seems in line with other SSA countries (see Table 4).

Efficiency of Implementation

71.      Although project implementation was initially slow because of staffing issues in
the PCMU, implementation pace gradually increased in the period which followed.
Following restructuring, the pace of implementation increased even further resulting in
greater progress towards the achievement of project outputs and outcomes. This was, in
part, a result of changes to the Project’s scope and simplified conditions which allowed for
the disbursement of US$45 million for teacher salaries. Although the disbursement rate
was low during the early years of the Project life, by project closing, more than 99 percent
of the allocated resources had been disbursed. Further, under Component 4 (Project
Coordination and Management), management costs were lower than had been anticipated
(79.2 percent lower than the appraisal estimate).

Efficiencies realized through donor coordination

72.      The Project was efficient insofar as it fostered a high level of collaboration among
government ministries, between ministerial directorates/units and between public and
private actors, including public and faith-based schools. It also strengthened coordination
among DPs working in the sub-sector. This high level of coordination and cross-
fertilization of ideas and approaches is still observed today.

73.      In light of the information above and detailed in Annex 3, the efficiency of the
Project is rated Modest during both the pre- and post-restructuring periods.

       75.     Important gains were observed in the DRC during the life of the Project in terms of
       increasing equitable access to education, improving the quality and relevance of education
       provided, and strengthening institutional and financial capacity of the sector. These
       objectives were substantially relevant in light of the needs at the time of project appraisal
       and remain highly pertinent today. Further, the operation’s objectives were and continue
       to be strongly aligned with the Bank’s current CAS as well as the Government’s strategic
       agenda for the sector. Given the large array of needs facing the sector at the time of project
       preparation and the Government’s commitment to stabilizing and improving education
       services throughout the DRC, it is understandable that the operation’s original design
       would be ambitious. In addition to supporting far-reaching reforms, the Project aimed to
       provide key quality inputs to the sector (e.g., training of teachers and education personnel,
       textbooks and teachers’ guides, construction of classrooms, etc.) In the prevailing post-
       conflict context characterized by a fragile economy and socio-political environment, the

                                                               24
effective implementation of the Project was made more challenging. This was made even
more difficult with the cumbersome disbursement conditions that were included under the
original design As a result of these endogenous and exogenous factors, and under-
appreciation of some identified risks, implementation progress during the early stages of
the operation was stymied. During the project life, however, the economy began to grow,
the socio-political environment stabilized, and the first restructuring introduced a number
of important changes which led to a marked improvement in project implementation and
performance.

76.     Equitable access to education and the quality of education provided improved under
the Project. The operation’s main outputs included: the construction and rehabilitation of
classrooms throughout the country; the integration of more than 20,000 teachers into the
public payroll; the distribution of textbooks and teachers’ guides to all children in primary
grades 1 and 2 and teachers; and the provision of essential training to various elements of
the workforce (e.g., teachers as well as inspectors). In a short amount of time, and in a
very difficult context, improvements were observed related to project objectives, including
significant increases in the primary GER, primary PCR, grade 1 intake rate, and gender
parity. Not only are more children enrolling in primary school but they are also tending to
stay longer and are more likely to complete the cycle. In addition to these more tangible
and immediate gains, the long-term and sector-wide focus of the Project, resulted in a
number of key accomplishments useful for the continued growth and development of the
sector. These included: legislation which established the framework for the sector (and sub-
sectors); guidelines for pre- and in-service teacher training; a convention of partnerships;
career structure for teachers; strategy for low-cost construction; the finalization of a sector
strategy with a sustainable financing mechanism (agreed with all DPs). The development
of the sector strategy has not only laid the foundation and framework for the sector, it has
strengthened institutional capacity related to sector development, financing, management,
and coordination.

77.    While from a purely economic standpoint the efficiency of the Project was Modest
during both the pre- and post-restructuring periods, the Project was effective in fostering a
high level of collaboration across government ministries and strengthened coordination
among DPs in the sub-sector.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

78.    During Project preparation, one of the major impediments to primary education in
the DRC was the high cost of schooling to households. Research demonstrated that these
costs were preventing children from most quintiles (except the highest one) from attending
school. Further, in such situations, the education of boys is prioritized. This project, by
supporting country wide reforms and improvements to quality, has promoted increases in
equitable access to school – achievements which are expected to be maintained in the future.
Further, data from statistical yearbooks have provided some evidence that gender parity



                                              25
has continued to improve across the DRC, reaching almost full parity in urban areas.38 The
payment of salaries of more than 20,000 teachers and operating costs of more than 26,000
schools throughout the country was an important step in increasing equitable access to
school.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

79.     Institutionally, the Project was visionary. Significant institutional change has been
realized which is likely to have a positive long-term impact in the sector. The reforms
supported under Component 3 have, in large part, laid the groundwork for continued
support to and coordinated investment in education. Achievements made – in terms of
developing three sub-sector strategies; a sector-wide strategy and a Basic Education
Interim Plan; establishing a structure for regularizing teachers’ careers; developing a
medium-term sustainable financing framework; and passing important legislation – are all
likely to positively impact the way the sector functions and grows in the future.

80.     The Project had a positive impact on strengthening and solidifying the working
relationship between the Government, schools/administration and communities. Many of
the project-supported activities increased and strengthened the Government’s interaction
with local communities wherein the Government was able to gain the trust of these
communities. The Government, with project support, was able to achieve this by: (i)
providing efficient and transparent services (through the use of school committees that
included parents who are responsible for school operating costs); (ii) providing funding to
cover schools’ operating costs and teachers’ salaries; (iii) enabling stakeholders to
participate in decision making and monitor the use of funds; and (iv) updating the legal
framework for the education sector.

81.     The Project has had a significant leveraging effect as it has been able to attract other
DPs to invest in the education sector, particularly in terms of institutional strengthening.
USAID and DfID have committed to investing US$180 million during the period from
2014 to 2020 and their investment supports, among other areas: improved governance and
accountability in the sector; strengthened M&E; and development and implementation of
strategies to reduce the total number of out-of-school children in the DRC.

  Between 2008/09 and 2011/12, the Education Statistical Yearbooks show that the national participation
rate for girls climbed from 45.9 percent to 46.3 percent, while the province of Equateur, with the lowest rate,
grew from 42.9 percent to 43.7 percent. See section 3.2.4 of Yearbooks for 2008/09 and 2011/12.

     (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

     82.     Though it was expected that the Bank’s support through this Project would
     encourage other DPs to invest in the sector, the extent to which the Bank catalyzed support
     to the sector was unanticipated. As the first entity to invest in the DRC in the post-conflict
     period, the Bank’s leadership played a role in directing the DP community’s efforts in
     developing the education sector and its strategic framework.

     83.     The risks identified in the PAD were largely appropriate. The overall risk rating
     was substantial at the time of appraisal which, in retrospect, appears to be an accurate
     rating. Table 6 provides a summary of risks and mitigation measures identified at appraisal
     and an evaluation of risks at the time of preparation of the ICR and going forward.

84.     As shown in Table 6 above, although a number of risks identified at appraisal have
been mitigated over time, two remain particularly salient, both of which are financial in
nature: (i) although budget reallocations to the sector and increases in education spending39
have increased in recent years, sector needs remain significant and will require increases
in funding over time; and (ii) in many cases, schools continue to charge parents high fees
despite support provided from DPs and the Government to implement the fee-free policy.
Given the negative implications of not having sufficient financial resources to carry out
planned activities, these financial constraints could challenge gains made in increasing
equitable access to primary education, a central objective of the Government’s education
strategy.

85.     The Government has expressed a commitment to maintain and scale-up many of
the Project’s achievements and to coordinate these efforts with those of other DPs. The
Government intends to: (i) maintain the 20,155 teachers already placed on the government
payroll, an initiative which is now also supported by other donors and regularize those
teachers who have not been placed on the public payroll; (ii) create a budget line item for
the production of sector statistics initially financed by the Project; and to (iii) gradually
increase the share of the national budget allocated to education, which has already risen.40
Despite these aims, the Government is facing fiscal challenges which may pose a
significant obstacle to fully covering the costs of paying the large number of newly
regularized teachers as well as those who are not yet on the public payroll and to
eliminating school fees nationally in-line with the Constitution. It is expected that the
sustained involvement of the donor community, both in terms of technical and financial
assistance, will likely attenuate some of these aforementioned risks. As mentioned earlier
(in Section 3.5 (c)), a number of DPs have agreed to provide additional support to follow
up on certain activities begun under the PARSE.

86.   In light of the discussion above, the Risk to Development Outcome is rated
Substantial.41

   Although the actual spending on education is on an increasing trend, it is not increasing proportionately to
GDP growth. As of 2013, only 2.3 percent of GDP was budgeted for education (well below the recommended
benchmark of 4.1 percent recommended by GPE).

well-aligned with the Government’s objectives for the sector and was informed by lessons
learned from other projects in post-conflict settings and in the DRC and drew on in-depth
and high quality project-commissioned studies. Project design incorporated activities to
support the delivery of services and to strengthen the institutional capacity and framework
for the sector in the long-term. The PDO was far-reaching in order to respond to the wide-
range of challenges facing the sector at the time and was endorsed by the QER. The
Project’s results-chain, which guided its implementation, was sound with clear linkages
between project inputs, outputs and outcomes. The PDO-level indicators were broad and
focused on capturing sector gains, as was the practice at the time, while the operation’s
intermediate-level indicators were appropriate for measuring progress across project-
supported activities.

88.     Despite the strong analytical work underpinning the original design of the Project,
a number of issues negatively impacted the Bank’s ability to ensure quality at entry,
including the following: (i) though the Bank accurately assessed and adopted appropriate
mitigation measures for some of the risks identified at preparation, it underestimated the
existing capacity available to support the Project, in particular, the capacity to fulfill
fiduciary functions and to undertake M&E activities; (ii) though the PDO and intermediate-
level indicators were highly relevant, in the original design there were too few indicators
in the RF to adequately measure progress made under each of the Project’s objectives; (iii)
there was a limited appreciation of the time required and complexity associated with the
reform process which resulted in an overly ambitious implementation schedule; and (iv)
the Bank had included a series of cumbersome and difficult to meet disbursement
conditions. Together, these issues posed serious challenges during the early stages of
Project implementation. This resulted in a low disbursement rate in the initial phase and
delays in achieving the envisioned outputs and outcomes. In order to address these
challenges, the Bank and the Government agreed to restructure the Project which led to a
significant improvement in project performance.

89.  For these reasons, the Bank’s performance in ensuring Quality at Entry is rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.     Initially, the Project’s Task Team Leaders (TTLs) were based in Kinshasa and
worked closely with the PCMU, relevant ministries and other DPs. As such, they could be
responsive to the needs and input received from the project stakeholders. The Bank team
demonstrated leadership and active problem-solving, both important attributes of effective
implementation support. The close collaboration between the project team and the
Government, and with DPs, was further strengthened during the life of the Project. This
collaboration was useful in identifying bottlenecks to implementation and other difficulties
and devising viable solutions to address them. Together, the Bank and partners worked
together to identify ways in which project execution could be streamlined. The supervision
of fiduciary and safeguards policies and practices was also effectively undertaken. Given
the Bank’s ability to provide practical solutions to issues encountered during project

                                            31
implementation, a large number of achievements were observed in this very difficult post-
conflict context.

91.     Despite the commendable proactivity on the part of the Bank, a number of factors
negatively impacted project supervision. First, despite the low disbursement rate and major
delays in project-supported activities in the initial years of the Project, ISRs on which the
Bank management relies for monitoring progress under the Project were consistently rated
Satisfactory. This suggests a lack of rigorous and critical reporting on the part of the Bank
during the early stages of the Project. Second, although the RF and M&E significantly
improved over the life of the Project, particularly following the 2012 restructuring, in the
early years of the operation there were delays in data collection and reporting. Despite
improvements in M&E (to include the ability to draw on various studies – for instance, the
PETS and Enquête 1-2-3), the Bank and the Government were unable to undertake some
key evaluations that would have provided further understanding of the large number of
achievements and, in some cases, shortcomings observed under this operation. Third, while
both restructurings were important (with the first leading to an uptake in the pace of
implementation), there was a considerable delay in finalizing th e Project’s first
restructuring which, when undertaken, proved to have a very positive impact on
disbursement and implementation progress.

92.    Although there were shortcomings in the Bank’s performance, these did not
ultimately preclude the Project from largely achieving its overarching objectives. While
the Bank’s performance was particularly notable given the difficult context in which the
Project was implemented, on balance, the shortcomings described above warrant a
Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for the Quality of Supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

93.     Based on the performance of the Bank at entry and during supervision and the
overall outcome rating, overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.      The Government expressed its commitment to this Project from the earliest phases
of preparation. During project preparation and design, the Government ensured that the
Project’s objectives and activities corresponded to the challenges faced in the educatio n
sector in the DRC at the time. The Minister of Education, who was in office for eight years
of the Project, provided strong leadership and added stability to the sector. The Government
worked closely with the Bank and other DPs through this Project to seize the opportunity
to ensure the sustainability of the sector and its achievements in the long-term. In addition
to finalizing an education sector strategy and several sub-sector strategies, a medium-term

                                             32
financing framework was also developed. In a very difficult post-conflict setting which
characterized the DRC at the time, the Government succeeded in undertaking major
reforms in terms of developing and solidifying the legal and institutional framework of the
sector. This was an important achievement as this framework could be used to guide a
coordinated and effective approach to promoting equitable access to quality education
throughout the country – and for this the Government should be commended.

95.      There were, however, a few areas where the Government initially faced challenges
related to project readiness. First, while the fiduciary responsibilities for the Project and
activities had been assigned to the Government, there were insufficient staff to support
these functions in the first year of the Project life. Over time, this capacity improved, with
the Government showing greater adherence to fiduciary requirements and demonstrating
good practice, including the timely completion of audits. Second, also in the early phase
of the Project, there was limited capacity in M&E which made monitoring and reporting
under the Project more difficult, though over time, the M&E system was also considerably
improved. In fact, by the end of the Project, the Government was publishing an annual
statistical yearbook. Despite the difficult context, the Government remained committed to
achieving the project’s objectives and had, by project closing, positively impacted
equitable access to quality education and had adopted a number of reforms which are likely
to have a positive impact on education in the medium- and long-term.

96.  On the basis of the discussion above, Government Performance is rated, on balance,
Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97.     The PCMU was created to address the limited capacity in Government and mitigate
against the risk that coordination among the five ministries42 involved in the Project would
prove difficult and jeopardize efficient project execution. The PCMU was initially
designed to execute the Project,43 but this conception evolved. The PCMU often had to turn
to MEPSP for guidance and authorization to complete various project-related tasks, such
as drawing up TORs. However, the PCMU in fact managed the Project’s day-to-day
implementation and oversaw its execution, while drawing on assistance from units in a
number of other ministries. Staffing issues in the first year of the project life, as well as the
changing nature of the PCMU’s role in relation to the ministries, caused initial delays in
Project execution. Once resolved, the PCMU became technically strong and to its credit
remained a well-functioning extra-ministerial entity throughout the life of the project. It
periodically encountered difficulties as a result of political pressure exerted from ministries,
which might have been avoided if there could have been greater pushback from this unit.
Though the PCMU was technically strong, it did not have sufficient independence to

manage the activities under its purview. As such, it remained somewhat over-reliant on the
Government.

98.     Although the PCMU would have benefited from engaging a third party M&E firm
to more fully document the Project’s implementation performance, the M&E system was
nonetheless significantly improved over the life of the Project and provided evidence on
the large number of achievements that were observed under this operation.

99.    For these reasons, the Implementing Agency Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. Based on the performance of the Government and the Implementing Agency, and
the Overall Outcome Rating, Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

101. Project design in post-conflict settings should be informed by an in-depth
assessment of available capacity and resources and include steps to address any
weaknesses in the earliest phase of project implementation. Realism in project design
in a post-conflict context such as the one in which this Project was designed is essential.
Though the initial FM, procurement and M&E assessments were thorough and accurate,
the findings of these were not fully incorporated into project design. Although the PAD
describes weaknesses in these areas, it did not provide a clear road map to address them
following project effectiveness. This hampered implementation progress in the initial
period. The capacity of the Government, and the financial and human resources available
at the time of project preparation and appraisal should be critically assessed – and factored
into the design – in order to ensure that project-supported activities can be feasibly carried
out and implemented throughout the project life.

102. The identification/establishment of an entity capable of undertaking core
M&E functions should be in place prior to project effectiveness. Data on outputs and
outcomes can serve as an important resource for project implementation, particularly in a
post-conflict setting where often little data are available. This responsibility should be
assigned to an actor with adequate capacity in the earliest phases of project implementation
in order to ensure that progress towards achievement of the PDO can be documented and
any bottlenecks can be effectively and quickly addressed. This entity could be established
by the Government and staffed with government officials or, if need be, contracted out to
a third party. In difficult settings, such as the one in which this project was undertaken, the
support of a third party M&E firm may be appropriate.




                                              34
103. The decision to embed a project implementation agency within the
government should be made with consideration for existing government capacity. The
decision to have a stand-alone unit or one embedded in the government requires careful
consideration. The strongest argument for embedding such a unit within the government
stems from expected capacity gains as a result of such an arrangement. This can be quite
costly as it requires the continued support of experts. It can also be burdensome for the
government, particularly if the unit’s staff is assigned to various tasks, some of which may
not be directly related to project implementation. Establishing a unit outside the
government can be a viable alternative, as was the case for the PARSE Project where the
PCMU was effective and able to support capacity-building within the Government without
overburdening its staff.

104. Adopting a national strategy for school construction that involves local
agencies should be pursued as a method to lower the costs of building school
infrastructure. The National Strategy for the Rehabilitation and Construction of Quality
Schools at Lowest Cost and associated guidelines that were developed and adopted under
this Project was an important achievement. Supporting such strategies along with norms
and guidelines can be a useful tool in ensuring cost-effectiveness of school construction.
The costs of construction did significantly decrease over the life of the Project.

105. Placing teachers on the public payroll can be an important measure toward
reducing the financial burden of schooling on households, although this alone is
insufficient. Under this Project, the Government placed teachers on the national teacher
payroll first and then was reimbursed by the Project. This approach promoted greater long-
term commitment on this issue by Government. This form of informal results-based
financing (RBF) continues to be used successfully in other projects in the DRC.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The achievements of Component 1 (Increase Access and Equity at Primary
Level) included the rehabilitation and reconstruction of 1,467 primary school classrooms,
187 offices, and 167 sanitary facilities. 44 In addition to a guide to maintaining school
infrastructure, one phase of the civil engineering also promoted the development of a
community construction strategy for schools based on lowest cost. In order to improve
equity of access to primary education, the component included financing to support the
government in its efforts to reduce household contributions for education, a factor
recognized to limit school access among the poor. The financing provided (i) operating
costs to 26, 210 schools45 (and encouraged community based school management) and (ii)
placed 20, 155 primary school teachers onto the Government payroll, which has
regularized their civil service status and helped stabilize their salary.46 The component also
supported the Government unit responsible for teacher salaries, SECOPE.



44
   For the first phase, UNOPS completed 100 percent of planned construction with 623 classrooms, 58
directors’ offices, and 58 sanitary facilities rehabilitated. In the second phase, UCOPS completed 83 percent
of planned construction: 844 out of 1017 classrooms, 129 out of 170 director’s offices, and 109 o ut of 170
sanitary facilities were rehabilitated.
45
   Concerning operating costs, before PARSE began, the PURUS was to pay primary and secondary school
operating costs of approximately US$400 per school per year to 26,200 schools (totaling US$40 million).
These payments were to be assumed by the PARSE. However, PARSE could not assume the payments until
the PURUS funds were exhausted and yet PURUS was late in disbursing. When disbursement was finally
complete, it was then suddenly agreed that PURUS would receive additional financing (AF) of US$19 million,
which, however fortuitous, continued to prevent PARSE from taking over. A solution was found: it was
decided that the PURUS AF would continue paying for only secondary level operating costs, while PARSE
would assume primary level costs. As it turned out, delays forced PURUS to abandon using the AF, so the
problem became eventually moot. Component 1 accounted for US$104 million out of a total of US$150
million.
46
   There were nevertheless difficulties paying salaries, which created delays that had to wait for the MTR and
eventually restructuring to be resolved. Actually executing payments was predicated on certain criteria being
established by the Government: a survey of all primary school teachers and a school mapping exercise was
needed before payment could begin. However, the Government did not have a budget needed to carry out
these preliminary exercises. They looked to DfID, which agreed initially to do the survey and then pulled out.
During the MTR of 2010, ways were found to circumvent the preliminary survey and school mapping issues
that were instituted in the restructuring of July 2011. The activities only began in 2012. The solution was the
following: SECOPE, though they were not in a position to create any new list of schools, were able (on the
basis of data they had at the time) to draw up a list of stable schools and their staff. These were schools
identified by a government registration number (even if some have no government paid staff). The project
was to take charge of placing 30,000 teachers on the government payroll during the life of the project,
provided that the government continued the payment after the project. The first approach adopted, whereby
the Bank paid the teachers/schools directly, was modified so that the selected teachers were first put on the
Government pay-roll and then paid by the Government. The Bank then reimbursed the Government, an
approach which was felt to be more likely to be sustained by Government after project end. The list was
finalized in 2011 and the Government began payments in August of that year. The Bank only began to
reimburse the Government in mid-2012 because it required evidence of payments to schools which took time.
The project paid 20,155 salaries. If the project had begun to pay out earlier as planned, the amount in question
might have paid for more salaries (given lower inflation), but the amount allocated would have also been
used up earlier and it was not clear that the Government could assure the continuity of payments at that earlier
point.


                                                      38
2.     Capacity has been increased. The rehabilitation and reconstruction of primary
school classrooms (of which 1,467 were completed by Project close in 11 administrative
provinces of the country) has increased the physical capacity of the sector to accommodate
more students.

3.      Efforts have been undertaken to reduce the costs of schooling borne by parents.
Under the Project, 20,155 teachers have been identified and placed on the Government
payroll (the Government was then reimbursed by the Project). This important measure has
contributed to the implementation of the ‘fee-free’ policy by attempting to reduce the
burden of household contributions to education on parents and in turn, increasing the
likelihood that poorer households will send their children to school. As a result of the
success of this measure under the Project, the AFD has decided to support these efforts
within its own C2D project. In addition, the Project’s support for SECOPE (the
Government directorate responsible for salary payments) in the form of materials
(computers) and training has contributed to the ongoing reform of SECOPE itself and
resulted in improved monitoring of school size and number of primary teachers.

4.      The payment of school operating costs (26,210 primary schools received at least
US$400 per year) has also led to contributing to the Government’s ‘fee-free’ policy by
reducing the need for household contributions to cover this expense. In addition, two other
impacts are notable: each school now has blackboards, which did not exist before the
Project; secondly, the measure has led to improvements in school governance, as the
schools have begun to keep their own accounts of these operating costs.

Pre-Restructuring

5.      Progress made in terms of outcomes linked to this objective during the pre-
restructuring period was as follows. The gross enrollment rate (GER) increased from 64
percent to 90.8 percent and gender parity improved (with the ratio of girls to boys in
primary school increasing from 85 percent to 86 percent). During this period, a cost-
effective school construction strategy was developed which aimed to serve as the basis for
the next phase of the rehabilitation program. There were, however, significant delays in
the implementation of the school rehabilitation program, with only 43 classrooms having
been completed (out of a planned 450 by mid-term review (MTR)). Further, teachers’
salaries and schools’ operating costs could not be paid as the disbursement conditions
linked to these activities had not been completed.47




47
   Although the project had not been able to provide financing to cover teachers’ salaries and/or schools’
operating costs, the Government had undertaken its own efforts to support the fee-free policy by integrating
a large number of teachers from registered primary schools into the public payroll (to reduce costs borne by
households) as well as providing some financial support to primary schools to cover their operating costs and
to administration and pedagogy management units to partially cover their recurrent costs.

                                                    39
Post-Restructuring

6.      In the post-restructuring period, the following progress was observed on PDO-level
indicators: (i) GER increased from 90.8 percent to 117 percent (exceeding the end-of-
project target of 105.8 percent); (ii) gross first grade intake rate increased from 107.7
percent to 133.1 percent (exceeding end-of-project target of 129.8 percent); and (iii) girls
to boys ratio in primary school increased from 86 percent to 98 percent (falling just short
of the end-of-project target of 100 percent). In terms of intermediate-level indicators, the
following progress was observed: (i) 1,467 additional classrooms were built or
rehabilitated at the primary level resulting from the project intervention (almost achieving
the end-of project target of 1,572); (ii) construction norms had been adopted for application
of cost-effective school construction strategy; and (iii) the salaries of 20,15548 (achieving
the end-of-project target of 20,155) primary teachers in “registered” schools had been
integrated into the public payroll.

7.       Although studies and technical work planned on norms and standards for low-cost
construction and evaluation of existing experience in the DRC were undertaken
(particularly involving community participation in school management and oversight of
civil works activities), unit costs of classroom construction in the DRC remain on par with
the costs reported in other countries in SSA (see Section 3.3). In addition to the
rehabilitation of classrooms in all of the country’s 11 provinces, the Project also supported
the rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of 187 offices for school directors and 167 sanitary
facilities. The National Pedagogical University (UPN) was also rehabilitated and equipped
and payment was made to 26,210 registered schools to cover operating costs (amounting
to approximately US$400/school annually).

8.       An important achievement under Component 1 was the regularization and inclusion
of 20,155 primary school teachers in “registered” schools on the official public payroll
system – which aimed to reduce the financial burden of schooling on poorer households.
However, although the fee-free policy was officially enacted by the Government, there is
evidence that households still continued to provide monetary support to cover schools’
operating costs and top-ups to teachers’ official base salary. While some of these supported
activities have resulted in improved dialogue between Government entities (i.e., Ministries
of Education and Finance) and strengthened institutional capacity, the establishment of a
sustainable fee-free strategy (including payment of teachers’ salaries, support for the
rehabilitation of schools, and funding to cover schools’ operating costs) intended to reduce
the financial burden on households is yet to be fully realized.

9.       The achievements of Component 2 (Improve Quality of Primary Education)
included the provision of 18 million French and Mathematics textbooks (instead of the
initial 11 million planned) that were distributed freely in primary years 1 and 2 of public




48
  This activity was supported with project funding. The total number of primary school teachers brought
onto the public payroll is much larger.

                                                  40
and private primary schools. 49 In addition, a guide to textbook maintenance was also
developed and distributed. Further, 53, 230 inspectors, educational advisers and primary
school teachers were trained on these new textbooks as well as the national education
curricula.50 Finally, another sub-component financed the establishment and training of a




49
   The first approach to providing textbooks was to form a committee, including members of DPROMAT,
teachers, university professors and inspectors, that would identify and categorize the books in circulation,
either adapt or bring them up to date, and then reproduce them. This approach was not put in place on the
advice of the Bank textbook expert, Mr. Diop, who saw it as too slow. Instead, it was decided that calls for
bids would be directly put out for pre-existing textbooks corresponding to the needs of the curricula and
subject at the primary level in question.
The first textbook, for first year primary French, was won by the French publishing house Belin. The entire
process took eight months and was considered a success by the Bank. It was up to Belin to print and deliver
the textbooks to three points in the DRC (in the east, south, and center). A consultant was hired to study
distribution from these points; the study, however, was not well done. Instead, the approach taken was to sign
an agreement with the World Food Program, working in conjunction with MONUSCO, to distribute the
books using their food distribution network. This worked relatively though the delays and difficulties
suggested another distribution system was really needed.
The second phase of textbook acquisition – for primary first year mathematics and second year French and
mathematics textbooks – used the same kind of procurement (via International Bids) but adopted another
approach for distribution. Now, publishing houses were responsible for distr ibution to the DRC’s 30
education provinces (proveds), while delivery from there to sub-provincial education offices (sous-proveds)
would be assured through a local call for tenders. Three different publishing houses were involved, which
created some difficulties because books didn’t arrive at the proveds at the same time, causing distribution to
sous-proveds to be delayed. Only when all three books arrived were they sent out. The PAD had planned an
US$11 million investment in textbooks, but through savings, this rose to US$14 million; then, through further
reallocation, this rose to US$18 million.
50
   The approach to teacher training defined in the PAD was abandoned, creating some delay. The initial idea
was to recruit a consultant who would work to strengthen capacity of the professors at the UPN. They, in
turn, would train inspectors who would train educational advisors ( conseillers pédagogiques) and teachers.
The approach was abandoned because the Institute became a University and as a result the training programs
there changed.
The approach that was subsequently put into place took advantage of the experience of the Belgian Technical
Cooperation (CTB) that had already distributed primary level 5 and 6 year math textbooks and had trained
teachers on their use. They had done so by training an initial group of 16 inspectors in Belgium and then,
using a cascade method, they had trained other inspectors, who trained CP, who trained teachers. This
approach was used between 2008 and 2010 in the Project with some success except for one technical issue:
while the CTB had included a transportation subsidy for teachers having to travel to training centers, the
Bank had not included this amount in Project design. At the MTR, the matter was reviewed and the problem
resolved.
More importantly, the question as to whether this training was effective, whether teachers were able to put
into practice what they had learned, came to the fore. One problem was that the teachers were only trained
on one textbook at a time, but the Project could not afford to keep sending teachers for training on just one
book at a time. The approach therefore changed: training would, from then on, provide training on how to
use textbooks in general. A second problem was that the textbooks were pedagogical means for teachers to
teach the National Education program; however, it was soon understood that many teachers did not know the
National Program (as many had not had any formal teacher training). Two training modules were
subsequently put into place: one to introduce the National Program (at the same time copies of the National
Program were distributed) and another to introduce the textbooks in general. The training lasted five days.
According the PCMU, there has generally been a positive evolution in teacher training with some 56,000
teachers now trained in five provinces.

national team to work with the CONFEMEN organization to assess national learning; two
PASEC learning assessments were carried out in 2010 and 2013.51

10.    Good Quality Learning Materials. The distribution of 18 million textbooks to all
the public and private primary schools for grades 1 and 2 has improved students’ exposure
to good quality learning materials. As a complement to this, a guide to maintaining these
textbooks is expected to increase the use, maintenance, and life of these textbooks.

11.     Teachers trained. Under the Project, 53,230 inspectors, educational advisers and
primary school teachers have been trained on the National Primary Education Program (the
curricula) and on the use of new textbooks, which should lead to improved teacher
performance.

12.     Improved Assessment of Student Performance. Two activities to improve
assessment were undertaken: i) a national team was established and trained with the
assistance of the PASEC/CONFEMEN; and ii) two PASEC surveys in 2010 and 2013 were
carried out. These assessments have led to a clear understanding of student performance in
literacy and mathematics in grades 2 and 5, and have informed policy makers on areas for
follow-up.

Pre-Restructuring

13.     Progress was observed in terms of this Component’s only outcome-level indicator
–the primary completion rate. At the intermediate level, the following was achieved during
the pre-restructuring period: (i) 14 million textbooks were purchased and distributed to
provincial education directorates (with 95 percent of schools reporting to have received the
books); (ii) a student-textbook ratio of 0.8 to 1 had been achieved; (iii) a large number of
inspectors and school advisors received in-service training in use of textbooks; and (iv) the
development of a textbook policy was underway.

Post-Restructuring

14.    During the post-restructuring period, the positive trend in the PCR continued,
reaching 80 percent (exceeding the end-of-project target of 72.5 percent). By project
closing, the following outputs had been realized: (i) 18 million textbooks and guides had
been purchased and distributed (exceeding the end-of-project target of 14 million) and
student-textbook and teacher-guide ratios of 1:2 had been achieved (each student had a
Math and a French textbook and each teacher had a guide in these subjects) (achieving the
end-of-project targets); (ii) 53,230 inspectors and school advisors had received in-service


51
  The Project paid for the PASEC evaluation of student learning in grades 2 and 5 of primary school in 2010
and 2013 (thus allowing comparison). Reports were produced by PASEC. In the first round in 2010, a team
from PASEC trained a national team to carry out the assessment, while in the second round in 2013 it was
the national team that carried out the assessment, with only support from the PASEC team. Though student
achievement was low, some evolution between rounds was noted. Some results stayed the same, while in
those PROVEDS which had faced considerable difficulties and were as such targeted by the Project, results
improved marginally.

                                                    42
training in use of textbooks (and training on the national curriculum program) (achieving
the end-of-project target); (iii) a learning assessment mechanism for grade 5 was in place
and two rounds of PASEC had been conducted (exceeding the end-of-project target of one
grade 5 assessment); and (iv) a Basic Education Interim Plan was being implemented
(achieving end-of-project target). Further, this Component had significant outreach in
terms of beneficiaries.

15.    With support of this project, student textbooks (in Math and French) and teachers’
guides were provided, within a relatively short time frame, to schools throughout the DRC.
These textbooks and guides, along with training of teachers, inspectors and school advisors,
was critical in ensuring the proper use of these textbooks and the quality of teaching –
elements which together could lead to important gains in the quality of education in the
country. The distribution of textbooks was also quite challenging in light of the size of the
DRC and the often difficult terrain. Another positive outcome was the development of a
learning assessment system for primary school which will serve as a diagnostic tool to
inform decision-making in the sector.

16.      The achievements of Component 3 (Strengthen the Institutional and Financial
Capacity of the Education Sector), the objectives of which was to contribute to revising
the legal and institutional framework of the education system, and to reinforce institutional
capacities for planning, budget formulation, and program execution, included: (i) the
development of the new Education framework law (Loi cadre), which was approved by the
Government, passed by the Parliament and promulgated by the President in February 2014;
and (ii) the revision of the statutes covering teachers and teacher careers (including training,
deployment, salary and incentives). Developed as an annex to the Education Framework
law, the statute has now been approved by the Government; (iii) the development of sub-
sectoral strategies (Ministry of National Education, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of
Labor, and Ministry for Non-formal Education and Literacy); (iv) the elaboration of the
education sector strategy, a document which has now been drafted and technically
validated; (v) undertaking of a PETS survey, whose results have now been validated; and
(vi) the annual production of statistical yearbooks.

17.     The Education Sector Strategy has been formally recognized in Law. The
Project supported the development of the new Framework Law, which was approved by
the Government, passed by Parliament, and promulgated by the President in February 2014.
The importance of this measure is that it will allow for the future development of the sector
from a legal perspective. Similarly, the legislative statutes required to cover all aspects of
the national teaching corps have been developed, approved by the Government, and now
form an annex to the Education Framework Law.

18.     Strategies that shape the future of the system have been developed. Three sub-
sector strategies (for MEPSP, Ministry of Higher Education (MESU), and Ministry of Non-
formal Education and Literacy) have been developed. The MEPSP strategy is being
implemented with the financial support of DPs, most notably the GPE with US$100 million.
In addition, a fully comprehensive education sector strategy (that includes the sub-sector



                                              43
strategies) has been developed. The necessary legislation has been produced and validated
technically; it now awaits approval by the Government.

Pre-Restructuring

19.     In terms of PDO-level indicators, an Education Sector Strategy with a medium-
term financing plan (with indicators agreed with donors and approved by Government) was
under preparation. In terms of intermediate-level indicators: (i) reformed guidelines for
pre-service and in-service teacher training had not yet been developed; (ii) the Institutional
Education Framework Law (organic law or Loi cadre) had not yet been transmitted to
Parliament for adoption; (iii) Convention of Partnerships had not yet been fully revised or
implemented; (iv) CRC and PETS had not been piloted in selected educational provinces;
(v) an action plan had not been put in place for eventual scale up (which was to be
developed, in part, on the basis of the CRC which had not been undertaken); and (vi) a
draft teacher career structure (training, deployment, salary and incentives) had not yet been
approved by the Government.

Post-Restructuring

20.     In terms of PDO-level indicators, an Education Sector Strategy (and three sub-
sector strategies52) with a sustainable medium-term financing plan with indicators agreed
with donors and approved by Government had been developed (achieving end-of-project
target). In terms of intermediate-level indicators: (i) reformed guidelines for pre-service
teacher training had been developed and were being applied (achieving end-of-project
target); (ii) the Institutional Education Framework law (loi cadre) had been approved by
Government (achieving the end-of-project target); (iii) the Convention of Partnerships had
been revised and implemented (achieving the end-of-project target); and (iv) a draft of the
teacher career structure (training, deployment, salary and incentives) had been approved
by the Government (achieving the end-of-project target). However, while the PETS had
been undertaken (it had not been fully rolled out to various educational provinces) the CRC
had not been completed. As such, an action plan was not put in place for eventual scale up
(since these activities relied, in part, on the findings from the CRC) (not achieving either
indicators’ end-of-project target).

21.     The development and finalization of the Education Sector Strategy was an
important achievement under this Project as was the promulgation of key legislation (Loi
cadre, legislation to cover all aspects of the national teaching corps, etc.) as it will be
important in further strengthening the institutional and financial capacity of the education
sector. In addition, monitoring of sector performance has improved (although significant
capacity-building support is still needed) and the statistical yearbook is now published on
an annual basis.




52
  Sub-sector strategies for MEPSP, MESU, and Ministry of Non-formal Education and Literacy were
developed which have received support from various DPs, including GPE.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.     Internal efficiency gains have been observed over the life of the Project evidenced
by a marked increase in gross enrollment rates and primary completion rates. Together this
means in addition to more children attending primary school, they are staying in school
longer and are more likely to complete the cycle.

2.     This Economic and Financial Analysis includes the following sections: (i) an
evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the main project-supported activities; (ii) efficiency
of implementation; and (iii) the external efficiency of the sector in terms of earnings and
other gains accrued among project beneficiaries.

Cost-effectiveness of project supported activities

3.      Textbooks. The project provided a total of 18 million textbooks. The unit cost of
books for mathematics and French in grades 1 and 2 are different because two different
approaches were adopted to procure them. In the first round, publishers were chosen to
provide books and deliver them to three major entry points in the west, east and south of
the DRC from where the MEPSP arranged local delivery. In the second phase, publishers
were responsible for delivering textbooks to sub-provincial education directorates. The unit
cost for textbooks, without delivery, was US$1.32. This is high compared to education
projects in Eritrea53 where the unit cost is US$0.60 and Mauritania54 where the unit cost is
US$0.73. The unit costs are in line with those in Sierra Leone55 where the unit cost ranges
from US$0.97 to US$1.66 and Niger56 where unit costs range from US$1.10 to US$1.40.

4.      Construction. A comparison of the cost of construction financed by various DPs
working in the DRC is relevant given the emphasis under this Project on low cost
construction (see Table 1 below). It should be noted that the cost of the work amongst
various DPs in different, select regions, is not easy to compare because of regional
variations based on distance, logistics, etc. While construction costs are assessed to have
been high during the pre-restructuring phase (phase 1) of the Project when managed by
UNOPS but were markedly lower, on average, in the post-restructuring phase (phase 2).

5.      While many ICRs describe unit costs per classroom, differences in classroom
design make for difficult comparisons. Unit cost by square meter helps to address this to
some extent. Although there are not many SSA countries with available data, the unit cost
per classroom under this Project seems in line with other SSA countries (see Table 2).

Efficiency of Implementation

6.       Although project implementation was initially slow because of staffing issues in
the PCMU, implementation pace gradually increased in the period which followed.
Following restructuring, the pace of implementation increased even further resulting in
greater progress towards the achievement of project outputs and outcomes. This was, in
part, a result of changes to the Project’s scope and simplified conditions which allowed for
the disbursement of US$45 million for teacher salaries. Although the disbursement rate
was low during the early years of the Project life, by project closing, more than 99 percent
of the allocated resources had been disbursed. Further, under Component 4 (Project
Coordination and Management), management costs were lower than had been anticipated
(79.2 percent lower than the appraisal estimate).

Efficiencies realized through donor coordination

7.       The Project was efficient insofar as it fostered a high level of collaboration among
government ministries, between ministerial directorates/units and between public and
private actors, including public and faith-based schools. It also strengthened coordination
among DPs working in the sub-sector. This high level of coordination and cross-
fertilization of ideas and approaches is still observed today.

External Efficiency

8.      Return to education calculations undertaken for the forthcoming PER reveal that
each additional year of education is associated with an average increase of 9.1 percent in
monthly earnings. Additional education is associated with higher earnings and higher
household consumption at all education levels (primary, secondary and tertiary). In
addition to the benefits accruing from higher salaries, education confers of course other
benefits as well, in terms of social outcomes to do with improved maternal health, greater
control of family size, decreased likelihood of poverty, knowledge of HIV/AIDS, greater
socio-political involvement, and so on. In sum, the investments in education in the DRC is
justifiable and warranted from an economic standpoint.

9.      Based on the analysis presented above, the efficiency during the Project during both
the pre- and post-restructuring periods was Modest.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.     While a beneficiary survey could not be carried out for this ICR due to resource
constraints, several school visits were undertaken. This section describes findings from one
such school site visit. Similar to many of the schools supported under the Project, this case
study provides some insight into Project achievements and the way in which the Project
supported local communities.

2.     The Munshié Primary School is a fairly typical school located in in Kinshasa. The
premises house two different establishments: Munshié 1 which operates from 7:30 in the
morning to 12:20 and Munshié 2 which operates from 12:30 to 5:20 in the evening. Each
school has its own director and staff. As the site visit was undertaken in the morning, the
description largely pertains to Munshié 1.

3.       Infrastructure. Three buildings – two blocks of classrooms (with eleven classrooms
in total) and a smaller block of offices – have been rehabilitated with support from PARSE.
This has included the provision of new and painted: roofs; new ceilings and lights;
windows; and doors. The classrooms have been furnished with new student desks and
classrooms have Mathematics and French textbooks for primary years 1 and 2. In addition,
a sanitary facility was rehabilitated. Certain infrastructure requirements, however, have
not been met – and this is, in large part, due to the limited allocation to rehabilitation of
classrooms under the PARSE. The school does not have electricity, nor does it have a flood
drainage system (causing flooding in the school courtyard when it rains). In addition there
is only one drinking water tap for the entire school. As a result of community participation
in school maintenance encouraged under the PARSE, the Parent-Teachers Association
(PTA) of Munshié 1 and 2 are now responsible for these issues, using funds reserved from
the school operating costs.

4.      Access. The PARSE project covered the annual operating costs (US$400) of
Munshié 1 while the Government provided an additional US$50 per month (totaling
US$600 for the year). As the school is located in Kinshasa it does not have fee-free status,60
so parents are expected to pay US$85 annually (or around US$30 each trimester) for tuition,
in addition to other costs (e.g., uniforms) which parents find burdensome. There are 344
students attending this school in the 2014/2015 school year with a similar number the
previous year. The school director explained that only about 50 families paid full tuition
last year. Because of this, many students are forced to drop out. A teacher in Year 5
explained that out of the 50 students that were in his class during the last school year, just
over one-half of them completed the academic year.

5.     Quality. Prior to beginning school at Munshié, most students learn to speak Lingala
at home, though a few households may speak some French. This poses learning challenges
for new students as all schooling is in French. This challenge often persists throughout the
primary school years. Nevertheless, like most urban establishments, students finishing at

  The Government could not afford to roll out this measure in the DRC’s largest cities, Kinshasa and
Lubumbashi.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Project Coordination and Management Unit (UCGP/PARSE) initiated work in January
2008 and ended in October 2014, with the Project lasting 6 years and 10 months instead of
the five years initially planned. The Project (in French called PARSE) provided assistance
to the DRC in order to (i) stop the deterioration of essential primary education services and
(ii) to prepare the ground for the development and sustainable financing of the sector with
the aim of facilitating donor coordination and transitioning to a comprehensive Education
program covering the entire sector. The approach adopted for the implementation of the
Project was essentially one of financial and technical support to the technical ministries
involved with the planned activities.

Despite the difficulties encountered -- due in large part to institutional arrangements agreed
between the two partners (the Government and World Bank) and due to low institutional
and financial capacity of the different stakeholders who participated in the realization of
planned activities -- PARSE has produced satisfactory results and achievements.

It is the conclusion of the present evaluation that the Project was relevant and in coherence
with the objectives of the DRC’s development of its National Education Sector.
Numerous physical and institutional achievements are to be noted to the benefit of the
Sector:
      Physical infrastructure and equipment: the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
         school buildings, the rehabilitation and re-equipping of the National Teaching
         University, the supply of student textbooks and teaching guides to teachers of
         Primary 1st and 2nd grades;
      Institutional achievements: the payment of operating expenses to primary schools,
         the payment of teacher salaries and their integration onto the Government, which
         was intended to ease parents’ household contribution, the development of a strategy
         of lowest cost for the construction and rehabilitation of schools (with the
         involvement of local communities), support to rewriting of the Education
         framework law (La Loi Cadre) adopted in February 2014, support for the
         development of several Education sub-strategies (in Basic Education, Tertiary, and
         in Literacy and non-formal Education), support for the development of the overall
         Sector Strategy (currently being finalized), support to SECOPE, the development
         of a Guide to the maintenance of school infrastructures, and support for a guide for
         the provision and upkeep of textbooks.
These accomplishments have had a non-negligible impact on the Sector and many of them
have led to the reform and strengthening of the Sector governance. However, major
challenges remain: assuring the sustainability of the Project’s key activities, the integration
of Project changes into the day-to-day management of the education system, as well as
ongoing support for the Project initiatives with and by State Budget (in terms of school
operating fees, the payment of teacher salaries, the process of incorporating teachers onto
the Government payroll, the supply of textbooks, and the completion of ongoing


                                              53
rehabilitation and construction of schools). All of this requires follow-up and monitoring
to ensure sustainability.

INTRODUCTION

The Government of the DRC and the World Bank signed the Grant Agreement (IDA H303
DRC) for the PARSE Project on 8 June 2007 in the amount of US$150 million. The
development objectives of the Project were the following:
       •Provide assistance to the DRC in order to halt further deterioration of essential
       services in the field of primary education;
       •Prepare the ground for the sustainable development and financing of the Education
       sector in order to facilitate donor coordination and the future transition to a
       comprehensive sectorial program.

PARSE’s specific objectives were the following:
     -To facilitate access and promote equality of opportunities at the primary level;
     -Improve the quality of primary education;
     -Strengthen Institutional and Financial Capacity of the Education Sector
     (Governance)

It should be noted that the emphasis of this Project was on Primary level education given
that three-quarters of the budget was devoted to that sub-sector.

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

1.1 Project Description

PARSE had a dual mission: the first consisted of intervening rapidly through urgent
initiatives to deal with the crisis besetting the education system (in general and at the
primary level in particular) at a time when the country was still in full armed conflict in
certain areas. The second was paving the way for the sustainable development of the
Education sector as a whole.

The Project was to be implemented over a period of five years.

Apart from the component dealing with Project management, the main activities were
grouped around three components corresponding to the three specific Project objectives.
The first two components related to the first objective of stabilizing the Education sector,
while the third component related to the second objective of general sector development.

1.2 Institutional Arrangements

The implementation of PARSE involved the following institutions and structures:
   - The Steering Committee;
   - The Project Coordination and Management Unit (UCGP);



                                            54
       -   The technical ministries in charge of the Education sector: the Ministry of Primary,
           Secondary and Professional Education (MEPSP), Tertiary Education (ESU) and the
           Ministry of Social Affairs (MASAHSN) in charge of non-Formal Education and
           Literacy.
       -   The various partners involved in the sector (Public Administration, Civil society,
           the technical and financial partners)

The UCGP provided coordination, follow-up and reporting. The administrations of
Ministries and partner institutions executed the planned activities.

II. THE EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES, ITS DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Evaluation of the Project Objectives

Given the context in which the Project was designed, one characterized by the sharp
deterioration in the provision of essential services, the present evaluation concludes that
the objectives assigned to the Project were relevant.
On the one hand, it was necessary at all cost to halt the deterioration of the educational
system, particularly at the level of basic education which is the base of the system, and, on
the other, to lay the groundwork for the development of the sector as a whole, in line with
Government policy in this matter.
In light of the results obtained at Project closure, it is clear that these two defined objectives
were achieved. Accomplishments have had non-negligible impacts on the sector. The
Project has introduced important reforms and has strengthened the governance of the
system.

2.2 Assessment of Project Design

The PARSE project ranks as a second generation project within the framework of the
cooperation between the DRC and the World Bank. It was specifically a sectorial project
defined to take into account of the particularities of the education system.

Its design was inspired by: (i) the document entitled “Education Policy in the DRC 2006”
developed by the Government; (ii) the report on the State of the National Educational
System 2004-2005 (RESEN); (iii) the reports and studies carried out by the Government
along with partners, including Education for All (2007), the ESU·PÁDEM Modernization
Pact (2003), the DSCRP 61 (2006), the memoranda of understanding between the
Government of DRC and other donors (the EFA - UNESCO, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA,
WB), the funding of the education sector. (Source: CSA, May 2007).

The design was also inspired by other multi-sectorial, emergency projects that were set up
at the beginning of this cooperation. The experience of other post-conflict countries, as in
the DRC, showed that, in the context of a multi-sectorial program, interventions in the field

     No explanation of this acronym is given in the Government Report

                                                     55
of education do not necessarily lead to the expected results for the simple reason that
emphasis was often placed more on the rehabilitation of infrastructure, rather than on the
whole education system.

Rather, the effective rehabilitation of the educational system must be based on a
combination of several factors including: (i) inputs (teaching materials, the quality of
teachers), (ii) technical assistance with regard to the planning of a sustainable policy for
the system, and (iii) the reintroduction of mechanisms to regulate institutional procedures.

That said, our assessment of the Project design reveals some weaknesses, especially for a
post-conflict context such as the DRC. These include: (i) the complexity of the Project,
akin really to a program, with a large number of executed activities, grouped into three
components; the implementation of these activities -- dependent on the administration of
technical ministries whose weakness in terms of technical capacity was obvious -- that
constituted an obstacle to the start of the Project (cited in annex 6 of the PAD:
Implementation Arrangements); (ii) the fact that the Bank and the Borrower had not
assured the capacity of the borrower, to satisfy conditions of effectiveness agreed in the
Grant Agreement for the implementation of certain key activities, including civil
engineering, the payment of operating fees to primary schools and the salaries of primary
school teachers. This is the case, for example, of the teacher/ school census, meant to lead
to the development of a School Map, (agreed as a prior condition to the payment of school
operating fees and teacher salaries, as well as the organization of quarterly technical audits),
which did not take into account the sheer size of the country and logistical difficulties in a
post-conflict context. These activities that represented more than 45% of the amount of the
Grant amount experienced considerable delay in their implementation (3 years after
implementation) while alternatives means to execute had to be found during the Project
mid-term review.

2.3 Evaluation of the implementation work of the Project

   a. Project Calendar

The planned schedule for Project implementation experienced delays, which ultimately
resulted in Project extensions. This was justified by the noted delays in the implementation
(i) of key activities (payment of operating expenses and salaries) due to the non-satisfaction,
by the borrower, of agreed condition in the Grant agreement, which had to be amended
during the Mid-term review, three years after the start of implementation, (ii) of the Phase
2 of civil engineering following the under-performance of contractors.
Nevertheless, all of the activities agreed upon between the two parties (WB and Borrower)
have been executed satisfactorily and the overall objectives have been attained.

   b. Personnel

Capacity strengthening of the various Administrations’ personnel has permitted their active
involvement in the implementation of Project activities, especially in the assessment of
textbooks, in teacher training, in the follow-up training for delegated contract managers

                                              56
(for construction), the production of the documents of policies and strategies for the
education sector. However, it is also appropriate to point out some weaknesses in the
reporting between the provincial and central levels.

Overall, the coordination and the fiduciary management of the Project were carried out in
line with the procedures agreed upon in the Grant agreement.

The establishment of the UCGP had to precede the start of the Project by a few months,
which was expected to avoid delays, especially during the start-up, and ensure a strong
start to the implementation of planned activities. However, at the start of the Project, only
the national coordinator and the administrative and financial coordinator had been recruited.
Other members of the staff were only recruited 8 months later.

    c. Role of other partners (Local donor partners, NGOs, businesses)

The PARSE defined itself as the project of reference for other technical partners who were
inspired by the strategies and results obtained by the Project as they sought to ensure
duplication of the model, mostly notably by: the support provided to the MEPSP for the
development and implementation of the Interim Education Plan, the payment of operating
fees and salaries, the lowest cost construction strategy (with the implication of local
communities), the construction standards, the strategic distribution of textbooks, the
strategy and continuous teacher training module, the results of discussion on the
organizational diagnosis, and the functional review of SECOPE.

III. EVALUATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT IN RELATION TO
ITS OBJECTIVES

In regard to the results achieved, the specific objectives assigned to the Project have been
achieved overall. Indeed, the Project produced the following:

(i) In relation to the first project objective, related to halting the further deterioration of the
provision of basic education services, the following were achieved:

    •   1467 classrooms, 187 offices for school directors, and 167 sanitary facilities were
        rehabilitated or rebuilt;
    •   Payment of operating costs to 26,210 registered schools;
    •   Salary payments of 20,155 teaching posts;
    •   Acquisition of 18 million textbooks, all of which have been delivered to the
        provincial levels;
    •   Training of 53,230 teachers and inspectors on the national curriculum program;
    •   Rehabilitation and equipping of the National Pedagogical University;

(ii) Concerning the second project objective, the sustainable financial and institutional
development of the Education Sector, the following activities have been carried out:




                                                57
   •   Sectorial diagnosis was produced by the Independent Education Commission
       (CISE);
   •   The National Strategy for the Rehabilitation and Construction of Quality Schools
       at Lowest Cost;
   •   A National Policy Note on School Buildings;
   •   A Guide to the Maintenance and Upkeep of School Infrastructures for all Primary
       schools;
   •   A Guide for the Management of textbooks for all primary schools;
   •   Manual of procedures for the management of school operating costs;
   •   An organizational diagnosis of the MEPSP
   •   The Education Framework Law promulgated on February 14, 2014;
   •   Sub-sectorial strategies for Basic, Tertiary and non-Formal Education;
   •   A technically validated draft of a Comprehensive Education Sector Strategy;
   •   A survey of expenditure tracking (PETS) in the education sector;
   •   The State of Literacy and Non-Formal Education;
   •   An organizational and functional audit of the Ministry of Literacy and Non-Formal
       Education;
   •   Two Assessment of Student Learning Achievement;
   •   Study of School Health in the DRC
   •   Diagnosis of the SECOPE
   •   The strengthening of the institutional capacity of Governments.

IV. PERFORMANCE OF THE PARTNERS: GOVERNMENT (BORROWER)
AND BANK (DONOR)

       1.1 Preparation of the project

Borrower

The preparation of the Project should have better taken into (i) the context of the country
and the major challenges (prolonged armed conflict impacting the DRC’s socio-economic
conditions and the country’s governance), (ii) the lack of reliable statistics and (iii) the
relative weakness of technical skill in the concerned Ministries. This would have avoided
the difficulties related to institutional arrangements that later had a negative impact during
the Project’s implementation phase. Indeed, the Bank should have better evaluated the
Project context.

World Bank

The evaluation of the PARSE project was made without taking into account the
socioeconomic and politico-economic particularities of the country and the technical
capacity of the Government at the time. The delay between preparation and implementation
of the project (2004-2008) as well as the lack of funds for preparation of the CN and other
studies should be noted.



                                             58
However, throughout the preparation and implementation phases of the Project, Bank-
borrower relations remained exemplary.

       1.2 Implementation of the Project

Borrower

Overall, all the activities agreed between the Borrower and Bank were carried out, even if
this required an extension of the Project. For the civil engineering component, the program
was carried out, except for activities related to the reconstruction of primary schools in
rural areas (in phase 2), which executed to 76% of its objectives. The allocated amount of
99 million SDRs was totally disbursed. Fiduciary management of the Grant was
satisfactory, as attested by regular World Bank reporting.

The borrower ensured sound implementation of the Project through the following
governmental entities: the Steering Committee, the PCMU, the M&E department. In
addition to these units, it should be noted that Project coordination meetings organized by
the Ministry of Finance with the relevant technical departments helped resolve certain
difficulties inherent in the implementation of the Project. It is also appropriate to point out
that the Steering Committee met on average once a year, instead of the planned three times
a year (i.e. once per trimester), to approve the program of activities and annual budgets.

The main constraints encountered were:

   •   In the civil engineering component: the long period of recruitment of the delegated
       Project Managers and the weak technical and financial capacity of stakeholders
       (companies and consultant study firms);
   •   For textbooks: the lack of reliable student statistics hampered the planning and
       distribution of books; the poor state of communication between central and local
       levels; the weak number of stakeholders available at the decentralized level;
   •   For school operating costs and the reimbursement of teacher salaries: the long delay
       before the conditions could be revised at the Mid-term review; the long delay before
       the stabilization of school lists and teachers; the slowness in the collection of
       receipts and payroll reports.

The Bank

The World Bank ensured regular supervision missions and follow-up during the
implementation phase of the Project, which helped to resolve issues and provide
appropriate solutions to outstanding challenges.

At the Mid-Term Review, important amendments were brought forward to improve project
implementation, most notably linked to the conditions required for disbursements. Indeed,
the measures taken by the Bank in consultation with the Government helped boost the rate
of disbursement of the project substantially.



                                              59
In addition, Bank support has had a non-negligible impact in the execution of Project
activities, particularly in relation to the components for infrastructure.

The organization of joint Government/World Bank portfolio reviews (one per year) on the
various projects financed by the Bank, sometimes in collaboration with the African
Development Bank, has allowed various country managers to get an overall idea of the
Bank portfolio as a whole, share the problems encountered in project execution (and their
solution), particularly with regard to the unique problems of each project as well as cross-
cutting issues such as financial management, procurement, M&E, disbursement, Project
closing, and the management of projects in gestation. Each joint review was followed up
with action plans.

In addition to regular supervision missions organized by the World Bank, and in the
framework of staff capacity-building for the implementation of projects, various
workshops were organized, in the country or in the sub-region, on different themes
including financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation.

Further, the Bank developed a suite of project management tools, in (i) financial
management (e-disbursement and e-signature) that have significantly reduced delays in
payment, (ii) procurement (using the PPM table) and (iii) in evaluation.
Overall, the performance of the World Bank is judged to be satisfactory.

V. REFLECTIONS ON THE ENDURING CHARACTER OF CERTAIN PROJECT
INITIATIVES

The contributions of the project have had a positive effect in the management and
governance of the Education sector. As an example, we cite: (i) the use of the results from
the construction and rehabilitation component of the Project in the Rehabilitation and
Reconstruction of School infrastructure (PRRIS project) financed by the Government and
the AFD; (ii) the operationalization of the several sub-sector strategies, in addition to the
Interim Education Plan, which has served as support for the subsequently designed Basic
Education Project (PROSEB) finance by SMEs; (iii) the approach to reimbursements of
teacher salaries which is currently employed by the APEP2 project.

The Education Sector Strategy, which is currently being finalized with input from the local
donor partners, constitutes an important tool that will allow the sector to be managed with
a holistic vision. The establishment of an interdepartmental committee, made up of
different experts from various departments (PHPA, ESU, MASAHSN, Budget and
Finance), is the beginning of an important process, aided by international consultants, in
institutional capacity-building and will have an important unifying effect on Government.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED

PARSE, the first sectorial-based project benefitting from funding from the World Bank,
has attained results that are globally satisfactory. Its disbursement reached 100% of the



                                             60
amount of the Grant after six years and ten months of implementation instead of the five
years initially planned.

In accordance with its objectives and in the light of the results obtained, the project helped
to halt the emergency situation confronting the provision of essential services and laid the
groundwork for the development of the Education sector.

The main lessons learned from PARSE may be summarized as follows:

a. In connection with the design and the preparation of the Project
    • The assessment of technical and financial capacity of the Borrower is an important
        prerequisite for implementation success, especially when this is based on improved
        accountability of Administrations;
    • The conditions for effectiveness must take into account the socio-political and
        economic context and economic of the Borrower;
    • Respecting all the anticipated steps in the preparation phase of a project will largely
        determine the first steps in the implementation phase, especially when it comes to
        deadlines. During the PARSE project preparation, the non-realization of certain
        initial activities in the implementation of the project followed directly from the lack
        of preparation funds (PPF) and so constituted an obstacle to the start of the project.

b. In connection with the implementation of the Project
    • An awareness campaign and the mobilization of beneficiary communities, as well
        as capacity strengthening of stakeholders (ALEs, in business, in the School
        Infrastructure Administration), are major assets for the implementation for the
        successful implementation of an approach to the construction of quality schools at
        least cost with the involvement of communities. In addition, the launch of a few
        sub-project pilots in certain areas also introduces stakeholders to this kind of
        approach.
    • Experience has shown that some appropriate measures can contribute to improving
        the effectiveness of planned project activities. For example, when rehabilitating and
        reconstructing schools, it is useful (i) to create a database of likely schools to be
        worked on, (ii) to establish and comply with the criteria guiding the selection of
        schools, which would include accessibility to sites for ease of effective work during
        the period of the life of the project; and (iii) to dispose of norms for the construction
        of infrastructure, as well as prior studies (of different possible architectural
        typology, estimates and pricing for work).
    • Reliable statistics (on schools and students) as well as the development of logistical
        plan which takes account of local specificities is a prerequisite for the success in
        the distribution of textbooks and other educational inputs to schools.
    • The importance of field visits is necessary to detect technical weaknesses of
        different stakeholders in the implementation of the activities;
    • The training of stakeholders constitutes a strategic intervention to boost the
        implementation of certain activities.
