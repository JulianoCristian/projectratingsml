                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Statistical data provided by the Government show significant progress in enrollments and the internal efficiency of the primary sub-sector. Gross enrollment at the primary first grade
                         reached 118% in 2010-11 from 115% in 2007-08 after consecutive years of decline. GER increased to 93% from 91%, and completion rate to 59% from 54% during the same period.
                         Girls:boys parity has remained around 0.86. The sharp increase in 2010-11 could probably be attributed to the fee-free policy which started its implementation from that school year.

                         Despite the Government willingness to produce the education statistics with a budgetary commitment, delays in providing comprehensive data prevent a real time assessment of the
                         status of the primary education sub-sector. In addition, over the years, the production of statistics has remained dependent on external financing.

                         The sub-sector Interim Education Plan (IEP) is being implemented and has served as the basis for a project supporting the development of basic education. This project has received
                         financing under the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) with a grant of US$100 million, and the Bank has been designated as the Supervising Entity. It is expected that the
                         financing agreement will be signed by mid-May 2013.

                         Due to the complexity of the task, the development of an Education Strategy, based on the strategies of the three sub-sectors ((i) primary, secondary and vocational education, (ii)
                         non-formal and adult literacy, and (iii) higher education), has been delayed. Nevertheless, the Government is keen to have the Education sector Strategy developed within the project
                         timeframe.

                         The present project will close on December 31, 2013 after a one-year extension. As of April 23, 2013, disbursement has reached 58% of the IDA grant amount of US$150 million.
                         The Government has committed to completing the remaining project activities and lead the project towards meeting its development objectives.
