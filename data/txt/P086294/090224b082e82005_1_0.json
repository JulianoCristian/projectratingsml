the\n            Democratic Republic of Congo had an overall outcome rating\n            of moderately satisfactory. There was substantial risk to\n            development with both the Bank and borrower performing\n            moderately satisfactory. The project development objective\n            and project components were not modified during project\n            implementation. The objective was to prevent further\n            deterioration in the delivery of essential services for\n            primary education and prepare ground for a sustainable\n            development and financing of the sector that will facilitate\n            donor coordination and future transition to a sector wide\n            program. Though the project development objective and the\n            project components were not revised during the life of the\n            project, reallocations were made between components in line\n            with changes made to the scope and nature of project\n            activities. Although a number of risks identified at\n            appraisal have been mitigated over time, two remain\n            particularly salient, both of which are financial in nature:\n            i) although budget reallocations to the sector and increases\n            in education spending39 have increased in recent years,\n            sector needs remain significant and will require increases\n            in funding over time; and ii) in many cases, schools\n            continue to charge parents high fees despite support\n            provided from DPs and the Government to implement the\n            fee-free policy. Given the negative implications of not\n            having sufficient financial resources to carry out planned\n            activities, these financial constraints could challenge\n            gains made in increasing equitable access to primary\n            education, a central objective of the Government\u2019s education\n            strategy. Lessons learned include: 1) project design in\n            post-conflict settings should be informed by an in-depth\n            assessment of available capacity and resources and include\n            steps to address any weaknesses in the earliest phase of\n            project implementation; 2) the identification/establishment\n            of an entity capable of undertaking core M&E functions\n            should be in place prior to project effectiveness; 3) the\n            decision to embed a project implementation agency within the\n            government should be made with consideration for existing\n            government capacity; 4) adopting a national strategy for\n            school construction that involves local agencies should be\n            pursued as a method to lower the costs of building school\n            infrastructure; and 5) placing teachers on the public\n            payroll can be an important measure toward reducing the\n            financial burden of schooling on households, although this\n            alone is insufficient."}, "docdt": "2015-04-30T00:44:04Z"}
