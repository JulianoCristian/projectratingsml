                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Statistical data provided by the Government show that the primary sub-sector continues to produce promising results in enrollments and internal efficiency. Gross admission into the
                         first grade increased to 122% in 2011-12 from 117% in 2010-11 and 115% in 2007-08after consecutive years of decline. Gross enrollment rate reached 98% in 2011-12 while it was
                         at 93% in 2010-11 and 91% in 2007-08. These results, nevertheless, hide a significant number of enrollments of over-aged children.

                         Completion rate also experienced some good improvement with 64% in 2011-12 compared to 59% in 2010-11 and 54% in 2007-08. Girls:boys parity is still weak and has hovered
                         around 0.86 for many years. The Government is aware of this phenomenon and has been engaging with the partners to find strategies to attract and retain more girls in schools.

                         On the institutional side, the development of the sector under a sector-wide approach is not yet feasible, pending the completion of the Education Strategy that will integrate the
                         strategies of the three sub-sectors of primary, secondary and vocational education; non-formal and adult literacy; and higher education in a coherent and strategic vision. In the
                         meantime, the primary subsector strategy is being implemented through the Interim Education Plan (IEP).

                         On implementation: despite delays in a number of activities (sector strategy, PETS, CRC, education statistics production, 2nd phase of the school civil works program), significant
                         results have been achieved as follows:
                         (a)      Over 16 million textbooks have been delivered to schools with the majority being delivered to schools;
                         (b)      A significant number of teachers and inspectors have been trained on the implementation of the national curriculum program with follow-up on the impact of the training;
                         (c)      The first phase of school rehabilitation by UNOPS is complete;
                         (d)      Salaries have been paid regularly to over 20,000 teachers
                         (e)      Operating costs have been transferred to 26,210 registered schools;

                         The Government has committed to invest additional efforts to complete the delayed activities. It has reiterated its request to benefit from an extension of the closing date of less than
                         12 months to be able to fully use the IDA Grant for the sector. The Bank has provided an agreement in principle.
