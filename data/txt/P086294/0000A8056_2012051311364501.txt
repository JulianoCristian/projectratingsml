                         Implementation Status Overview
                         At the sector level, the implementation of the fee-free policy in primary education, starting with the first three grades in September 2010, has been expanded to include the fourth
                         grade for the 2011/12 school year, and has resulted in increased enrollments, especially at the first grade where GER reached 113.8% in 2010/11 compared to a declining trend
                         during the past few years (115.1% in 2007/08, 112% in 2008/09 and 107.7% in 2009/10). Nevertheless, GER for primary (to include all the six grades) has experienced a slight

                         decrease (90.8% in 2009/2010 to 89.7% in 2010/11). The internal efficiency of the sector continues to show a positive trend with higher completion rates (57.1% in 2010/11, 56.7% in
                         2009/10 and 56.3% in 2008/09). The gender parity situation is also favorable with an increasing percentage of girls to boys. In 2010/11, it reached 90% in 2010/11 compared to 86%
                         in 2009/10. The above results derive from a preliminary status of the sector statistics to be completed in June 2012. Subsequently, a more thorough analysis of the data will need to
                         be undertaken to fully appreciate the sector progress and to comprehend the dynamics of various indicators.

                         To add to the achievement of Government adoption of the primary and secondary strategy in March 2010, the strategy for higher education has been submitted for Government
                         adoption and that of the non-formal and adult literacy will be submitted by June 2012.
                         A global strategy for the education sector is expected to be produced by December 2012.

                         At the project level, implementation has shown good progress since the Bank support mission in July 2011 but disbursements have not increased as expected due to a number of
                         administrative matters. These are in the process of being resolved and will lead to higher disbursements in the next quarter.
