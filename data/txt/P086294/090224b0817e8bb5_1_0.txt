                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The sector continues to have positive trends in enrollments and in its internal efficiency, in particular between 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. GER increased from 91% to 93%; the gross
                         1st year intake from 108% to 117%; and completion rate from 57% to 59%. These positive trends could probably be attributed to the fee-free policy (September 2009) as enrollments
                         increased at a faster rate between 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 than the antecedent years. Nevertheless and as indicated earlier, these results lag behind the targets which are set in

                         line with the targets of the sub-sector strategy.

                         An external evaluation has found the Interim Education Plan (IEP) to be credible and coherent. An operation developed on the basis of the IEP is in the process to be presented to
                         the board of the Global Partnership for Education for a grant amount of US$100 million.

                         The strategy for the primary, secondary and vocational training sub-sectors is available. The adoption of the strategy for higher education and that of non-formal and adult literacy is
                         underway. The complex work to develop a global strategy for the sector is underway and it is expected that the work will be completed in January 2013.
                         At the project level, implementation has shown good progress in disbursement. As of now, disbursement has reached 44% of the grant.
