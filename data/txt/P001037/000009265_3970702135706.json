improve the\n            Government's economic management through a three-year,\n            first phase program of technical assistance and staff\n            training. It would focus on macroeconomic management,\n            investment choice and procurement, control of public finance\n            and external debt. The project provides for 23 staff-years\n            of resident advisors, 326 staff-months of short-term\n            consultant services, and 45 staff-months of overseas\n            training for the core economic agencies. The National\n            Productivity Centre (CNP) would prepare and implement, in\n            conjunction with the work program and on-the-job coaching, a\n            program of staff training. Short-term consultants would help\n            carry out a divestiture program for the parapublic sector.\n            The project also includes a fund of US$350,000 for\n            pre-feasibility activities, and US$300,000 for a\n            bookkeeper/accountant training program."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
