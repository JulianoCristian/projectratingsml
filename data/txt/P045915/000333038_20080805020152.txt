1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. The Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (UUTIP) was the Bank's fifth
stand-alone urban transport lending investment in China following two loans to Shanghai,
one loan to Guangzhou and one loan to Liaoning Province for three medium-size cities.
The project was designed to support the Country Assistance Strategy (February 25, 1997,
Report No. 16321-CHA) by promoting growth with economic stability, alleviating
infrastructure constraints (particularly in western and inland areas) with integrated
transport investments, and safeguarding the environment.

2. The 1990s was a period of rapid urbanization in China. GDP grew at 9-10 percent per
year, and motor vehicle ownership and use grew even faster. This also brought traffic
congestion in many of the larger cities, jeopardizing productivity and quality of life
through increased travel times, higher vehicle operating costs, worsening air pollution,
and a high rate of road accidents. The population of Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) was approaching 2 million. Its vehicle fleet, less
than 80,000 in 1997, was predicted to quadruple to 300,000 by 2020, the planning
horizon for its transportation system. Private car ownership was just getting started and
was expected to grow substantially faster than the vehicle fleet as a whole.

3. As with other medium-sized cities, Urumqi's urban transport system was under severe
pressure to respond to the challenge of motorization. On one hand, the existing road
system was inadequate and there was an urgent need for expansion of the network and
the development of a functioning road hierarchy. At the same time, there was a need to
develop and offer high-quality transport alternatives to the automobile; not just an
imperative for the majority of residents without access to cars, but also to support the
development of a sustainable, low-impact transport system from a safety and
environmental standpoint. The role of the bus and the bicycle, traditionally the dominant
modes of transport, was also threatened by a lack of safe and convenient services and
facilities. At appraisal, congestion in Urumqi was not yet acute, but city leaders wanted
to act ahead of the problem rather than waiting for it to reach a critical level.

4. The project attempted to address rapid urban development challenges by promoting a
cost-effective and environmentally-balanced framework for urban transport development.
UUTIP was to add needed infrastructure, promote safer and more efficient use of existing
road capacity via traffic management and improved public transport, and investments to
ameliorate the environmental impact. In addition, the project included the strengthening
of the capacity of local institutions to better manage the sector. The project was fully
consistent with the Bank's sector strategy ("Sustainable Transport," 1996), which
emphasized the integrity of economic, social, and environmental dimensions of a
sustainable transport policy. These priorities were also consistent with the Bank's urban

transport strategy for China articulated at a major national symposium in Beijing in
1995.1

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5. The overall project objective was to foster a multi-modal urban transport system,
which is planned, designed and used for the safe, efficient and healthy movement of
people and goods. Five sub-objectives and their non-specific performance indicators
were agreed to during preparations and were included in the PAD exactly as listed below.
These indicators were only defined during negotiations and confirmed with baseline and
target values in a supplemental letter by the Urumqi Municipal Government dated
February 9, 2001. This final set of specific indicators with definitions, baselines, and
targets is presented in Annex 10.

1) Develop and manage the urban road system to support local land use, regional
    transport and the city's overall economic development plans
    a) Cross-town travel speeds (peak and non-peak) on key north-south corridors
    b) Travel speeds in the CBD area (particularly for buses)
    c) Network condition, annual road maintenance program, budget, and unit costs
2) Increase the safety and efficiency of the road network
    a) Traffic speeds in the CBD and key north-south corridors
    b) Increased throughput (in person-trips, across screenlines)
    c) Reduced incidence of traffic accidents and fatalities
3) Develop public transport as a viable and sustainable alternative to private car use
    a) Operating costs as a percentage of revenue
    b) Motorized mode share (across screenlines)
    c) Average bus operating speeds on key corridors
4) Protect and improve the environment
    a) Pass/fail rate for vehicle emissions inspections
    b) Proportion of fleet tested
    c) Landscaped green area
5) Strengthen local institutional capacity and integration within urban transport sector
    a) Development and implementation of policies, plans and programs

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6. There were no material changes to the objectives or indicators (as presented above)
after project approval. However, the specific definitions and values for the baseline and
targets for each indicator did not appear in the PAD. For example, the four key north-
south corridors to be monitored for cross-town travel speeds (indicator 1) were only
confirmed after negotiations in the supplemental letter. Several indicators were also

simplified or refined during implementation for ease of monitoring and reporting (as
noted in Section F of the Data Sheet) without degrading their intent or effectiveness. For
example, in the place of the annual road maintenance program and unit costs, the final set
of road maintenance indicators (indicators 2, 3, 4 and 5) include (i) total maintenance
area, (ii) total maintenance cost, (iii) costs for government administration, and (iv)
percent of roads in fair condition. Similarly, the indicator for the number of bus seats
(indicator 15) was revised as the number of standard buses.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7. The project was intended to benefit all residents of Urumqi to some degree, but
especially those who lived or worked in the city center. Vehicle operating cost savings
were estimated to be 2.5 times higher than travel time savings, with the ratio diminishing
over time as the value of time increased with rising wages. The majority of benefits were
estimated to accrue to car users, while almost one-third was to accrue to public transport
users. Benefits to pedestrians and cyclists were not estimated quantitatively for the Ring
Road investment, but were evaluated separately under complementary traffic
management investments. The nature of the project components ensured that the benefits
would be widely spread, including poorer citizens as well as richer ones. The PAD did
not explicitly analyze the impact on other beneficiary subgroups, such ethnic minorities
(further described in Section 2.1).

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
8. The components of the appraised project are summarized below (and detailed in
Annex 2):
        A. Road Network Development (US$222.6 million total, US$84.0 million Bank
        financing): To maintain and improve the road network, a 31.25 km Ring Road
        (RR) was to be constructed, 29 km of which was financed under the project. A
        few short missing links in the downtown network were also to be constructed, and
        other streets were to be widened or made one-way. Road maintenance systems
        and equipment were also included. It is important to point out that this
        component was over 80% of the total project value.
        B. Traffic Management and Road Safety (US$11.8 million total, US$7.0 million
        Bank financing): Five programs of investment and technical assistance, including
        intersection channelization and signalization, were aimed to enhance the efficient
        use of the existing road space and to improve road safety.
        C. Public Transport (US$7.5 million total, US$3.6 million Bank financing): The
        project financed the construction of terminals and depots, procurement of
        equipment to improve bus services, and studies on network development plans. It
        was also aimed at strengthening the regulatory and planning capabilities of the
        Urban Construction Commission and the commercial viability of the Urumqi
        Public Transport Company
        D. Environmental Management (US$4.6 million total, US$2.5 million Bank
        financing): Urumqi's leadership was active in developing an environmental
        protection and improvement strategy. The project funded the next stage of those
        initiatives, including green landscaping, the development of a motor vehicle



                                                3

        emissions control strategy (MVECS) and a motor vehicle pollution control center
        (MVPCC) with equipment for an inspection and maintenance program.
        E. Institutional Development (US$3.5 million total, US$1.9 million Bank
        financing): Technical assistance, studies and training would be provided to
        strengthen local capacity and processes for urban transport planning,
        programming, budgeting and system management.

1.6 Revised Components

9. There were two revisions to the loan's allocation approved by the Bank's Country
Director in March 2003 and December 2006. The revisions increased the civil works
disbursement rate from 48% to 100% to compensate for (i) unused funds from lower than
expected bid prices (about US$16 million) that would otherwise have remained unused
by the closing date, and (ii) higher than forecast resettlement costs, which increased the
cost burden on UMG. These revisions also allowed the borrower to use part of the
unallocated portion of the loan to expand the scope of the public transport component by
improving a 5 km segment of Xinhua Road.

1.7 Other significant changes

10. Significant schedule delays affected implementation of most non-road components
(further described in Section 2.2). As a result, the loan's closing date was extended once
to December 2007.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11. Overall, the quality of the project at entry was generally satisfactory and preparation
had several features worth noting. First, the comprehensive nature of the project
simultaneously responded to the client's immediate interest in adding capacity to the road
network, as well as to broader concerns related to sustainability, safety and equity of
Urumqi's urban transport system. As such, the project design was closely aligned with
the Bank's urban transport strategy ("Cities on the Move", which was being finalized at
the time of appraisal) and previous experience from other Chinese cities (namely
Guangzhou and Shanghai) that suggested that urban transport solutions needed to be
multi-modal and comprehensive. In response to discussions during the appraisal decision
meeting, several suggestions from previous projects were included in the project's
components and development objectives, such as improvement in public transport cost-
recovery and adequate provision of pedestrian and cyclist facilities to contain growth in
motorized mode share.

12. Second, in contrast to the supply-driven approach and uniform design standards
typical in China, the preparation of the Urumqi project tailored the design of various
sections of the RR to realistic projections of traffic demand over 20 years. This was a
learning experience for the Urumqi Municipal Government (UMG). In the end, only



                                              4

two-thirds of the RR was built to expressway standard, while the rest was built with
signalized intersections according to the traffic demand forecast.

13. Lastly, the PAD was generally well documented, with the section on performance
indicators a weak link (see Section 2.3). The PAD assessed the risks associated with the
public transport component as substantial, while all other components were moderate to
negligible. The PAD also addressed the issue of whether the safeguards policy on
indigenous peoples (OD 4.20 at the time) should be triggered. After extensive internal
Bank debate it was concluded that the Uygur, Hui, Kazakh and other ethnic minorities
living in Urumqi had migrated there in the last few generations, were fully urbanized, and
therefore did not meet several key definitional determinants. A localized exception to
this was the need to demolish a downtown mosque to make way for the RR. In
consultation with the concerned community, a new and larger mosque was built not far
away. The PAD laid out the logic of this conclusion in a special annex. The replacement
of the Lanzhou Mosque by a new larger mosque without prompting by the Bank was a
praiseworthy achievement and contrasted other resettlement issues described in Section
2.4.

2.2 Implementation

14. Schedule and Delays. Implementation, particularly of the non-road network
components, was delayed and the loan's closing date was extended once, for two years,
taking the closing date to December 31, 2007. The Bank team recommended the
extension on the grounds that it would allow time for completion of the area traffic
control system (ATC), bus dispatching system (APTS), motor vehicle emissions control
strategy (MVECS), as well as the study on comprehensive public transport planning and
the design of the road maintenance information management system. Consideration of the
extension request also created leverage for the Bank to insist on installation of noise
barriers along the RR (further described in Section 2.4).

15. Despite Urumqi's short construction season of six months per year due to extreme
winter climate, the RR was substantially completed and opened to traffic as scheduled by
November 2004, approximately 4.5 years into implementation. The progress on the
construction of the RR slowed when routine construction supervision and contract
management uncovered problems, all of which were eventually resolved. The most
consequential example of this was in the initial phase of the RR construction, which had
to be repaved by a contractor because of poor material quality. On the other hand, there
were delays to start most non-road components by more than one year because of the
client's relative inexperience and their initial focus on the RR construction. The progress
of implementation of the non-road components accelerated after 2004 once the RR was
completed. In this case, a lesson learned from implementation was that the complexity of
the project as designed severely taxed the implementation capacity of the local
government, thus resulting in implementation delays. Nevertheless, the Bank did a
satisfactory job through routine supervision to ensure that capacity building and
institutional strengthening were ongoing, even as physical progress of the non-road
components was slower than expected.



                                               5

16. Resettlement. Involuntary resettlement and compensation became a critical issue after
project initiation as some ethic minorities appear to have been differentially impacted,
particularly the Project Affected Peoples (PAPs) from Lidaowan and Yamalike. In the
case of Yamalike, it was characterized by reluctance on the part of the borrower to fully
adhere to Bank requirements. These problems surfaced in 2001, soon after the start of
the project, and were resolved in 2005, through considerable Bank intervention, including
a visit by the Bank's Regional Vice President.

17. Project Cost and Components. The components were implemented as appraised.
The final cost of the road network component was about US$18 million below appraisal
due to (1) bids coming in below estimates, (2) road maintenance units being consolidated
allowing the cancellation of US$2.1 million in equipment (including road rollers,
maintenance lift, bitumen and concrete mixers), and (3) some subcomponents using other
local funds.

18. Technology Subcomponents. The project financed a number of new technology
systems including a new traffic signal system, a GPS-based bus fleet management system,
and a computerized road and bridge management system. In each case, implementation
turned out to be considerably more difficult and time-consuming than the City had
anticipated. There were both technical and institutional challenges. On one hand, City
agencies were generally unfamiliar with the technological features of the proposed
systems. Finalizing technical specifications took longer than planned and in many cases
there were complications and delays in the procurement process (such as the equipment
procurement for the vehicle inspection and maintenance system).

19. These technical challenges were further compounded by a formidable set of
institutional challenges. Implementing the new systems required changes in business
procedures, sometimes radical ones as pencil-and-paper was replaced by real-time
computer-based systems. Active participation and involvement of senior management
was needed to effect the changes in business processes and implementation arrangements
needed to use the new systems effectively. Further, these systems need extensive data
collection and implementation requires extensive system integration. As a result the
implementation process required the active participation and commitment of the end-user,
which many end-users had not planned for or anticipated.2

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20. The set of indicators designed for this project represented a comprehensive and
good-faith effort to meet the Bank's results agenda and standard practices at the time.
The indicator data collected were generally appropriate and properly utilized. However,




2The Bank's task team is distilling these lessons from technology implementation and related institutional
issues in a technical note to be published in the second half of 2008 as "Bus Fleet Management Systems:
Improving Public Transport in China."




                                                      6

in hindsight the indicators could have been simpler, better structured, and more focused
on outcomes.

21. The PAD defines thirteen different kinds of indicators across four out of the five sub-
objectives, requiring at least 29 distinct measurements. While comprehensive, this makes
for a burdensome implementation effort for the client and supervision effort for the
Bank's task team. Three of the seven of the public transport indicators were related to
costs (i.e., operating cost recovery, operating unit costs, and annual subsidy) and could
have been made less redundant. Moreover, there were no specific indicators for the fifth
objective of strengthening institutional capacity and the five "Intermediate Outcome
Indicators" (in Section F of the Data Sheet) were more suitable as PDO indicators.

22. While most of the indicators were appropriate and relevant, it remains difficult to
design indicators robust to the range of changes affecting Chinese cities in a typical 5 to 7
year project implementation period. For example,
    a) Even as the forecasts of traffic on the RR financed by the project were close to
        target, traffic volumes on cross-town road links did not decrease as expected. In
        theory, the RR would alleviate congestion on these roads by providing through
        traffic alternatives. Over the implementation period, the city center attracted
        significantly more economic activity (and traffic) than had been forecast. Thus,
        speeds on cross-town road links (indicator 1 in the Data Sheet) did not increase as
        much as forecast. A better indicator would have been traffic counts on the RR and
        the adjacent network, which could have been normalized by the growth in the
        regularly monitored traffic counts for the city.
    b) Comparing public transport unit costs (indicator 11 in the Data Sheet) across
        years would be meaningful as long as factor unit costs remained stable. But
        during the project implementation period the price of fuel increased five-fold and
        labor costs have also increased significantly, thus making the indicator much less
        meaningful.

23. Some indicators were not technically optimal or more appropriate as measures of
"output" rather than "outcomes". For instance,
    a) Indicator 17 measures the percentage of tested vehicles passing emissions
        standards; a 30% increase in the pass-rate was targeted. However, such a pass-
        rate depends on a number of factors outside the control of the project including
        consistency, enforcement, quality control and equipment quality. A higher pass-
        rate could mean either a good outcome (better quality of auto fleet) or an
        unintended negative outcome (inconsistent tests or poor enforcement). As it was,
        the target was partially achieved, but it is difficult to link that outcome in a
        meaningful way with air quality improvements in Urumqi.
    b) The final environmental and road maintenance indicators did not embody
        efficiency performance criteria but were simple measures of output (i.e., area of
        landscaping, total maintenance area, total maintenance cost, and costs for
        government administration).




                                              7

24. Finally, the baseline and target values for the indicators were not shown in the PAD,
but were confirmed in a supplemental letter following negotiations. With the increased
attention given to measurable results in recent years, it would be standard practice to
include them in the PAD. In the end, the indicator data were effectively collected and
used to inform or reinforce certain decisions, particularly the benefits of the public
transport improvements and reforms.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

25. Environmental Impacts. The project was rated `Category A' since it involved
resettlement, major road construction partly on a new alignment, and increased air
pollution and noise, particularly adjacent to the RR. In response to heightened
sensitivities on this issue, Bank appraisal and PAD documentation focused significant
attention on ensuring sufficient public consultation and disclosure of the environmental
and resettlement documents.

26. The Bank required series of public participation activities from August 1998 through
December 1999. The first consisted of on-site surveys, telephone interviews,
questionnaires, and a public meeting. The second included two telephone hotlines for
public input, informational pamphlets, public review of project environmental impact
assessment, and a public meeting with the press and local representatives.

27. An EIA was developed and a stand-alone EMP was adopted by the city government.
Generally, the EMP was satisfactorily implemented with the exception of the installation
of noise barriers. A year after opening of the RR to traffic, only 100 meters of noise
barriers had been installed (phase 1 pilot). Many sensitive locations were still filing
claims for noise barriers or noise-reduction window treatments and air conditioners. The
Mayor had been concerned about the effectiveness of the initial design for the noise
barrier and was reluctant to see a particular style of barrier installed because of visual
intrusion. The Bank helped arrange a visit by Urumqi representatives to Shanghai,
Guangzhou, and other cities using noise barriers of various types, and an acceptable style
was found. Successive phases consisting of 1.1 km of additional noise barriers were
completed by the end of 2007.

28. Resettlement. Resettlement was identified as a risk in preparation because Chinese
government policy did not require equal treatment for project affected people lacking
residence permits. The minutes of negotiation recorded that the Chinese delegation
accepted the Bank's resettlement policy, which required equal treatment for squatters.
Despite this, complaints were received from people from the Yamalike area of the
Saybagh District that the housing to which they had been relocated lacked essential
services such as internal roads and household water hook-ups. The majority of Yamalike
residents were ethnic minority Uygurs; and according to the Municipality, many did not
have legal residence permits. It is likely that the Municipality's treatment of the
Yamalike residents was due to their illegal status rather than ethnicity, but the two issues
closely overlapped in this case.




                                              8

29. The mission at mid-term review noted that "present living circumstances [of the
project affected people] create an unsightly blemish on what is otherwise a successful
project." The Bank supervised the issue closely and also required, internal and external
monitoring of resettlement implementation. By December 2004, progress had been made
to resettle the people from Yamalike to the Xishan resettlement area, except in relation to
the school and the mosque. All utilities had been constructed and buses were provided to
transport students to the original school in the Yamalike area while the new school was
being planned and build. The approved master plan indicated that a primary school and
high school would be built by 2010 about 1 km from the Xishan area. The mission was
advised that a mosque could only be built if the population in Saybagh District increased
or the old mosque in Yamalike was demolished. The PEO agreed to improve the
pedestrian facilities in the resettlement area with sidewalks and lighting. The remaining
works were completed in August 2005. In the end, compliance was achieved but only
after considerable and close Bank supervision.

30. Fiduciary. All fiduciary and project expenditures issues raised during
implementation were successfully resolved. Two financial management audits (in 2005
and 2006) resulted in unqualified (clean) opinions on the project balance sheet, summary
of sources and uses of funds by project components, statement of implementation of loan
agreement, and statement of special account. Financial management and reporting was in
accordance to the loan agreement and the project complied with Bank guidelines.
Disbursement was slower than initial projections in part due to delays in implementation,
particularly for non-road components.

31. Procurement. The project experienced procurement delays, particularly for
technology-related equipment and subcomponents, due to technical difficulties and
institutional challenges (described in Section 2.2.). All procurement issues raised during
implementation were eventually resolved according to Bank guidelines. An ex-post
review in 2006 found no major outstanding issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

32. The infrastructure investments financed by the project (including the RR and Xinhua
Road) are being successfully funded, operated, and maintained. The overall quality of
construction of the road components is very good and on par with Chinese projects. At
project closing, the ATC and Road Maintenance Management System were close to
completion and operations. The bus fleet management system financed by the project
was being successfully operated. The Motor Vehicle Emissions Control Center and air
monitoring equipment was to be fully implemented after the closing of the loan. The
project also financed several innovations that are being successfully operated, including
state-of-the-art noise mitigation, traffic safety improvements, and bus priority measures.

33. Urumqi has expressed interest in a follow-on urban transport project though no
official proposal has yet been endorsed by national authorities. The city has also noted its
intention of using GEF funds to prepare the public transport component of a new project
being proposed for World Bank financing. It was agreed that future operations would



                                               9

focus on bus priority measures, training, and integration of proposed BRT/urban rail
investments.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

34. The project remains consistent with the country's current development priorities to
relieve infrastructure bottlenecks and develop western provinces (see Section 1.1). It is
also consistent with current national policies on public transport prioritization and
"people first" transport policies. It is fully consistent with the Bank's current urban
transport strategy ("Cities on the Move," 2001), and the most recent China urban
transport strategy ("China: Building Institutions for Sustainable Urban Transport," 2006),
both of which emphasize that the impacts of rapid motorization can be dealt with on a
sustainable basis only by a comprehensive set of actions going beyond new road
infrastructure.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

35. Considering overall progress and the performance indicators, the project has
successfully achieved its PDO to "foster a multi-modal urban transport system, which is
planned, designed and used for the safe, efficient and healthy movement of people and
goods." It has achieved this, as described below, through strategic improvements to the
road network, public transport services, road safety facilities for pedestrians and cyclists,
traffic management systems, and institutional development.

(a) Develop and manage the urban road system to support local land use, regional
transport and the city's overall economic development plans -- Satisfactory
36. This objective has been largely met, despite not fully achieving the target
improvement of 15% for traffic speeds on cross-town streets. The original logic for the
target was that longer-distance traffic would shift to the RR and important cross-town
streets would be decongested allowing overall speeds to increase. In actuality, speeds on
the four RR segments monitored have remained virtually the same (3 to 4 percent higher).
Total traffic volume on the RR was just below the forecast during appraisal, while
volumes on local roads varied widely from the forecast reflecting changes in travel
patterns and urban structure over a 10-year period. In hindsight, the original speed
targets were probably overly ambitious. Given the high level of motorization and
economic development during the project implementation period, traffic on these streets
has remained heavy despite the successful construction of the RR. It is likely that in the
absence of the RR, speeds on these links would have been significantly slower.
Additionally, the roads are all operating at speeds that are not unreasonable for major
cross-town arterials. From a safety and management perspective, it is not in the city's
interest for these roads to operate much faster.

37. The indicators related to "maintenance of the road network" have been met. The
portion of the road network in fair condition has successfully achieved the target of 86%,
reflecting the outcome of increases in the total maintenance area and expenditures.


                                               10

(b) Increase the safety and efficiency of the road network -- Satisfactory
38. This objective has been largely met. The targets for reductions in traffic accidents
and fatalities (18-25% by 2004) have been met and largely sustained since 2002.
Recommendations made by a road accident study were to be piloted on Xinhua Road, but
were not be implemented until the road was reconfigured for bus priority in 2007.
Nevertheless, by 2006 the number of traffic accidents in the city had declined by 32%
and fatalities had declined by 40%. In the four districts affected by the project, the
reduction in accidents and fatalities was as significant or more. This result generally
reflects the effectiveness of traffic safety analysis and mitigation measures implemented.

(c) Develop public transport as a viable and sustainable alternative to private car use --
Satisfactory
39. The indicators related to public transport have been substantially met. A major
planning study being conducted as part of the Bank-financed project has found that the
public transport share of all motorized trips has increased from 65% at the start of the
project to about 68% at present, while the target at appraisal was 72%. Bus speeds in
major downtown corridors have increased by 15%; less than the target increase of 20%,
but reflecting a significant and impressive improvement in the level of service
nonetheless. Several actions towards institutional reform of bus operations have been
undertaken including a bus maintenance program, computerized information system,
communications system, and training center. Operations are currently provided without
any operating subsidy, surpassing the target and confirming the viability of the mode.

(d) Protect and improve the environment ­ Satisfactory
40. All environmental indicators have improved, but as designed it is difficult to attribute
environmental improvements to the project as designed (see discussion in Section 2.3).
The area of green landscaping exceeded the projected targets (recording an 83 % increase
from 2000 to 2006 despite the harsh climate and initial problems with the vegetation)
reflecting the city's aesthetic improvement priorities. The percentage of tested vehicles
passing emissions standards rose from 71.5% in 2000 to 75.8% in 2006 (falling short of
the target of 90%) and the number of vehicles tested increased by 38% in the same period
(target increase was 15%). However, a higher percentage of vehicles passing the
emissions standards is not necessarily a positive outcome without additional information
about the quality and enforcement of the tests. Moreover, the increase in the number of
vehicles tested is consistent with an increase in the vehicle fleet over the period.

(e) Strengthen local institutional capacity and integration within urban transport sector -
- Satisfactory
41. This project has strengthened capacity and integration within the sector, although
progress at times has been slow (described in Section 2.2). A considerable number of
studies and technical assistance efforts, detailed in full in Annex 2, have been completed
to support every component of the project. The project has also contributed to at least
three considerable accomplishments, which will be instrumental in any potential follow-
on project (such as the GEF program discussed in Section 2.5):




                                               11

a) A major national policy initiative was issued in 2005 (State Council Decree 46)
    calling for providing priority to public transport. In response, the Urumqi
    government issued a 6-page note in September 2005 titled "Implementation Options
    on Prioritizing the Development of Urban Public Transport in Urumqi." This note
    presented sound policies and substantial proposals for actions on all the fronts
    recommended by the Bank, including: (i) expansion of the public transport networks,
    (ii) opening the market to private operators under appropriate regulatory and licensing
    regime, (iii) strengthening the guidance role of the municipal government, (iv)
    providing bus priority on city streets (trial of bus rapid transit and signal priority at
    traffic lights, etc), (v) control management system, and (vi) addressing the needs of
    poor citizens through `public service obligations' compensated by the City. It also
    identified the City agencies expected to take the lead in implementing the various
    actions.
b) A permanent (standing) multi-agency body to address urban transport issues has been
    created. Early on, the City stated its intention to set up a Transport Planning Institute
    to strengthen the Municipal Government's technical capacity in urban transport. The
    concept evolved into an Urban Transport Improvement Office. Plans and policies for
    public transport development have also improved markedly since project initiation,
    and are currently being implemented.
c) In July 2007, the UMG issued a circular on establishing a Municipal Leading Group
    on Public Transport Priority Development (PTLG), which named the Mayor as
    chairman, directors of 14 agencies as members, and the director of the Urumqi
    Construction Commission as the secretary-general of the office.

3.3 Efficiency

42. A traditional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used by the Bank to evaluate the
economic impact of the largest component of the project, the RR, representing more than
80% of the total investment. The economic efficiency measures of the RR (summarized
in the table below) were driven by 20-year forecasts of traffic volumes using standard
transport modeling techniques described in an annex to the PAD. The evaluation of the
RR included sensitivity analysis of key variables including construction costs, travel time
and vehicle operating cost benefits, and projected economic growth. The appraisal
results confirmed the robustness of the RR's economic effectiveness.

             Ring Road Component                  PAD                        ICR
                         NPV (@12%)         1.487 Billion RMB         1.156 Billion RMB
       NPV (@12%, US$1=8 RMB)                US$185.8 Million           US$144.5 Million
                                  EIRR                    20.2%                    17.9%

43. As shown in the table above, the recalculated NPV and EIRR for the RR at
completion are somewhat lower than the appraisal estimates. Details of the economic
evaluation at appraisal and completion are presented in Annex 3. There were at least two
significant differences between the assumptions at appraisal and completion that, on
balance, yielded this result. Other important observations also follow:




                                              12

a) The estimate of vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings was considerably lower at
    completion than at appraisal because the VOC models used different formulations,
    although both included travel speeds. HDM-3 was used for the PAD estimate, while
    a model developed by the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design and Research
    Institute was used for the borrower's ICR.
b) The estimate of travel time savings increased considerably between appraisal and
    completion because (1) average wages and municipal GDP have outpaced earlier
    forecasts, and (2) the method used to calculate the values of time for work and non-
    work trips differed from appraisal to completion. Details are presented in Annex 3.
d) Actual traffic volumes in 2007 overall were only slightly below forecast at appraisal.
    Traffic volumes are lower than forecast in 6 segments, while they are higher than
    forecast in 4 other segments.
e) Actual investment costs and the appraisal estimate were virtually the same, reflecting
    the completion of the project within the original budget (including contingencies).
f) Operations and maintenance costs (if combined with the residual asset value) are
    similar at appraisal and completion.
g) The 20-year forecast of costs and benefits at appraisal end in 2023 because it assumed
    that the RR would be completed in 2003 (the scheduled end date was later revised to
    2004). The actual completion was in November 2004 and is reflected in the
    economic analysis at completion.

44. A simplified CBA was used in the PAD to evaluate other investment items including
the ATC and signalization, intersection channelization, one-way road scheme, and an
advanced public transport information and communication system. The analyses of each
of these components at appraisal resulted in positive NPVs and EIRR above 19%.
Detailed estimates of the benefits for these components were not available at completion.
However, certain performance indicators (such as traffic volumes and person-trips)
suggest that the forecasts were reasonably accurate and that the EIRR for these
components are satisfactory.

45. A financial capacity analysis was performed during appraisal, which included at least
the following items as annexes to the PAD: (1) a review of the fiscal impact and
counterpart funding arrangements, and (2) a review of the financial management system.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

46. The satisfactory rating for overall outcome is justified above by (1) the project's
relevance to the objectives of the Bank and client; (2) achievement of PDO and a large
majority of the performance indicators; and (3) the confirmation of its economic
effectiveness.




                                             13

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

47. In the end, resettlement compliance was acceptable and the city made progress in
social development by improving the lives of hundreds of former squatters. Although
quantitative poverty impacts were not measured, evidence from the resettlement program
suggests that the lives of poor PAPs were greatly improved by newer and more
comfortable homes.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

48. This project has significantly enhanced Urumqi's ability to manage and implement
large construction projects, particularly their capacity for procurement, financial
management, resettlement and environmental compliance. The project called for the
creation of a transport planning and modeling unit in the Urban Planning Bureau, which
was achieved under the UCC. This concept evolved into an Urban Transport
Improvement Office, which was formally set up and continues to be enhanced. Further
details are discussed in Section 3.2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A stakeholder workshop was held in 2005. A summary of the results is provided in
Annex 6.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

49. There is little doubt that the City will continue to give its full support to the
operations and maintenance of the infrastructure components of the project. The only
areas for doubt are the "softer" components, where actions taken or to be taken are
institutional in nature. The recent policy by national and local governments providing
"priority for public transport" has been extremely important. The PLG, reconstituted in
late 2005, provides the foundation for a multi-agency, holistic approach to transport
planning. Thus far, the PLG has been slow to reach decisions on public transport policy
and environmental management areas despite the availability of competent technical
studies. Nevertheless, one cannot underestimate the significance of the change in urban
transport policy in China at the national and local levels in the last 10 years. Where there
was previously no interest or capacity to address the relevant sector issues (see Section
1.1), Urumqi today is an illustration of the change in mindset that can occur.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50. The project design was well articulated and was closely aligned with the sector and
country strategies at the time. The PAD makes clear that multiple alternatives were
evaluated before decisions were made about which segments of the existing RR should
be upgraded and to what standard. The Bank team advised and guided the municipal
authorities as they explored every component and examined many alternatives before
arriving at final decisions on the design of each. Project preparation took 33 months from
identification to loan negotiations (July 1997 to March 2000), including about 6 months
spent on the issue of resettlement. The quality at entry largely reflected the state-of-
practice at the time, but in retrospect included deficiencies that justify a moderately
satisfactory rating.

51. The project design adequately addressed the known risks at the time, but it did not
foresee the eventual problems that delayed non-road implementation and institutional
development. The Bank made a reasonable effort to incorporate institutional capacity
building in the project design and ensure continuing discussions on the non-road
components by including in the Project Agreement that, "by April 1 of each year, or such
other date as the Bank shall request, Urumqi shall evaluate with representatives of the
Bank the progress in the implementation of its strategies for public transport reform and
development, motor vehicle emission control, and road maintenance management." In
retrospect, the design of the project could have better recognized the slower pace of
implementing the "softer" components (as experienced by projects in Guangzhou and
Shanghai) with a more realistic schedule.

52. Lastly, the performance indicators were unnecessarily complex and could have been
better structured. It remains a challenge for task teams to design a set of relevant, simple,
and yet comprehensive indicators within a satisfactory M&E framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

53. The Bank approved the project in December 2000 and the Project was declared
effective in May 2001. Supervision missions were generally conducted at least twice a
year, except for a period of reduced activity in 2003-2004 related to the outbreak of
SARS in the region. The composition of the mission teams duly reflected the needs of
the implementing agencies. Back-to-office reports and management letters were
generally comprehensive and action-oriented.

54. The Bank generally acted appropriately and decisively to resolve the resettlement
issues. A supervision mission in 2003 rightly drew attention to unacceptable living
conditions of Yamalike PAPs. As a result, the Bank withheld approval for use of unused
funds until this issue had been resolved. A mid-term review that highlighted the delays in


                                              15

non-road components was held in June 2004 as the main infrastructure construction
component was nearing completion. This was a natural opportunity to take stock of
unused funds that could be reallocated to the non-road infrastructure components.

55. A major workshop in October 2005 clearly reaffirmed the broad agenda and
commitments for integrated development of Urumqi's urban transport system. The
Mayor attended the opening session and two Vice-Mayors attended additional sessions.
The workshop also brought together all the municipal entities managing the components
covered by the project. Annex 6 summarizes the workshop's conclusions, notably twelve
actions, which effectively captured the core reform agenda going forward.

56. The Bank showed flexibility in agreeing to raise the disbursement percentage on civil
works to help Urumqi use the full amount of the loan, although only a relatively modest
amount of civil works remained to be carried out by the time the percentage was
amended. Overall, the quality of Bank supervision was satisfactory considering (1) the
continued focus on the development impact of the non-road components, and (2) the
supervision of the safeguard aspects including noise mitigation and resettlement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57. The Bank's overall performance was satisfactory based on the quality of the project
at entry and during supervision. The project's objectives and design were aligned with
both the borrower's and World Bank strategies on urban transport. There has been
substantial completion of the project without compromising environmental, social, or
financial safeguards as outlined in the appropriate plans. The design and implementation
also ensured the delivery of a majority of the project development objective. The Bank
team was able to effectively guide the design of a large road investment and balance the
project with public transport, non-motorized transport, environmental management, and
institutional components. Each successful project builds trust with Chinese leaders and
allows for growing acceptance of the Bank's reasoned advice and technical assistance in
urban transport.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

58. The satisfactory rating is justified by the institutions, policies and programs adopted
by local government in support of the project objectives (described in Section 3.2(e))
despite of their slow pace to make these changes and initial reluctance to fully implement
the Bank's resettlement policy (see Section 2.2). The national policy giving priority to
public transport was announced in the fall of 2005, at about the same time as a broader
policy to "put people first." Together these developments created a strongly supportive
environment for municipal action on public transport. It is also noteworthy that the
Xinjiang Region played a proactive role in guiding the City as a vice-governor chaired
the reconstituted PLG (see Section 4).



                                              16

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59. The implementing agency's performance is rated as moderately satisfactory for
ensuring that the project was implemented and its development objectives were met,
despite delays. The implementing agency had only limited control over government
decision-making, and it is difficult to assess if the agency could have done more to ensure
timely implementation.

60. The rating is also justified by the progress made to implement a large majority of the
components despite implementation issues. Lengthy delays for implementing the noise
barriers and the emissions control strategy called into question the initial commitment of
the City to these components and to the safeguards they were intended to address.

61. Disbursements were very slow; only about half of the loan was disbursed after three
years, and only about two-thirds was disbursed after six years. Delays also resulted from
the initial quality of RR implementation (although overall quality was very good as
described in Section 2.2), and more importantly, cumbersome internal procedures. The
Bank team provided guidance for all implementation and recommended simplification of
the document flow. Action on the withdrawal application process was taken after
discussions and a training program was put in place in 2006.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62. The moderately satisfactory rating is reflective of the borrower largely delivering the
project as designed and meeting its developmental objectives despite significant delays.

6. Lessons Learned

63. More work is needed to develop appropriate indicators for urban transport
projects. Inconsistencies persist between the Bank's internal requirements for
measurement and evaluation (M&E) of results, the ability of the task team to define
meaningful and measurable indicators, and the client's interest and capacity in this area.
The focus of the borrower is often on output indicators, while task teams have a difficult
time attributing outcomes to project activities. Task teams would benefit from
constructive guidance from the M&E community to develop a concise of relevant,
comprehensive and straightforward indicators that are integrated with measurements
regularly made by the borrower, thus ensuring ownership and data quality. Indicators
should also be generally robust to exogenous factors to ensure that they meaningfully
reflect the outcomes of the project.

64. The Bank should ensure that project components and schedule consider a
natural "learning curve" and other institutional capacity issues. For a first-time
borrower like Urumqi, the Bank's fiduciary and safeguards requirements for a relatively
large investment is a challenging prospect. It is usually the case with complex projects
with multiple components that they are implemented sequentially starting with the


                                             17

biggest investment (such as a Ring Road), which features most prominently on
government's agenda. The challenge is designing projects that do not overwhelm, but
complement the borrower's implementation capacity as it improves over time. One
approach is to integrate the development of corridors with road, public transport,
environmental management, safety and traffic management investments. Where stand-
alone infrastructure and institutional components are deemed necessary, there needs to be
recognition that they may progress at different rates.

65. Replicating successful urban transport projects is an important and valuable
role for the World Bank in China as the country continues to urbanize and motorize.
There is much to be learned from international experience and great value in the
opportunity to shape the future of fast-growing cities. The high population density in
many Chinese cities and shortage of space necessitate urban transportation strategies that
give a central role to public and non-motorized modes (and not to space-consuming
patterns of car-based urban sprawl) and are supported by appropriate pricing, land use
policies and other regulations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

66. The following are responses to select comments or issues raised by the borrower and
summarized in Annex 7.
· As addressed by the first lesson above, we recognize the need to develop more
    appropriate performance indicators for urban transport that utilize readily available
    data in each city to ensure the veracity of the baseline and target values and avoid
    unnecessary data collection and redundancies.
· Borrowers implementing similar World Bank-financed projects indeed may be able to
    learn a great deal from each other through better communication. The Bank is keenly
    interested in finding opportunities to bring implementing agencies from similar
    projects together to share experiences and training. In fact, the World Bank is
    ensuring this kind of interaction through lending and grants programs that involve
    multiple cities with similar problems. One example of this is the China GEF Urban
    Transport Partnership Program made up of 14 cities (including Urumqi) that
    underwent a competitive selection process.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Table A is a summary economic analysis included in the PAD for Ring Road only, while
Table B was generated using the benefits and costs presented in the borrower's ICR in
May 2008. The PAD also included a cursory economic analysis of the traffic
management and public transport components. The remaining components under the
project were far smaller in cost and less amenable to a quantitative cost-benefit analysis.
The PAD cites insufficient data available on the benefits of bus priority, pedestrian
improvement, enforcement and road user education, and other safety measures for a
reliable cost benefit analysis, but international experience had shown that these types of
investments are cost-effective nonetheless.

            Urumqi Urban Transport Development Challenges Workshop
                                     Oct. 25 to 26, 2005

                              Summary Strategy Statement

A. Achievements of Urumqi's urban transport development since the project started:
   1) Extended road network with completion of Outer Ring Road;
   2) Rehabilitated over one thousand local roads;
   3) Completed metro study, road accident study, etc.;
   4) Began road network improvement, public transport network improvement,
       parking studies, etc.;
   5) Began development of urban road asset management system;
   6) Completed development of motor vehicle emission control strategy;
   7) Began study of public transport ITS, implementation of Outer Ring control and
       ATC systems;
   8) Began public transport reform process; and
   9) Change in attitudes away from just new road construction toward more
       comprehensive interventions.

B. Development objectives:
   a) Road construction only cannot solve traffic congestion; building more roads for
       private cars will lead to traffic paralysis, economic suffering, environmental
       deteriorating, and life quality reduction.
   b) The city's future competitiveness will be based on its attractiveness to highly
       qualified and creative professionals. The objective of the city development is to
       increase its quality of life and this is also the final goal of "putting people first".
   c) Therefore, Urumqi will adopt a radically new model ­ giving priority to public
       transport, adopting transit-oriented development, fully integrating all
       transportation modes including pedestrian and non-motorized vehicles with land
       use development, developing public transport infrastructure which will be cost
       effective, environmental friendly, attractive to the needs of all residents, adopted
       to Urumqi's characteristics, and sustainable for the city's long-term development.

C. Future actions:
   Implement recommendations of road accident study, including public communication
       program.
   Implement motor vehicle emission control strategy, including public communication
       program.
   Initiate a single on-going, comprehensive, multi-modal planning process,
       incorporating all transportation modes
       a) Strong, formal link to land-use/master planning
       b) Strong, formal link to capital budget development process




                                               30

    c) Rational and objective, creating sound technical basis for investment decision-
        making
Implement public transport institutional reform, strengthening government policy,
    planning, budgeting, regulation, performance monitoring functions.

    agencies).
Initiate a study of transport financing alternatives, addressing all potential sources for
    a stable, predictable finance stream.
Pursue institutional development and capacity building:
    d) Training for government technical staff in traffic and parking management
        planning and operations
    e) Training of traffic police in traffic management and transit priority
        enforcement
    f) Public transport planning/management training in a variety of areas, e.g., BRT,
        financial planning, concession, ITS
    g) Peer reviews and discussions with other Chinese cities on key technical and
        policy issues, e.g., BRT, traffic and parking management
    h) Training for RMMI system staffing

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The following sections paraphrase the main points of the borrower's ICR and other
comments received from the PEO in May 2008.

Project Objectives

The borrower's ICR concluded that the objectives of the project were achieved as a result
of the following:
· Successful completion of urban road construction program and general improvement
    in the level of operations and maintenance management
· Considerable progress in traffic management and road safety resulting in greater
    throughput, fewer accidents and fatalities
· Improvements to public transport infrastructure and the quality of services
· Positive initial results from environmental improvement programs including air
    pollution control, green landscaping, and noise abatement
· General capacity improvement and establishment of needed institutions such as
    transport planning and modeling unit, road asset information management center,
    parking management centre, and vehicle pollution control center

Implementation by the Bank

· The project management procedures of World Bank (from concept to
    implementation) contributed to the project's success. The World Bank safeguards and
    requirements for public involvement, environmental mitigation and resettlement were
    critical for the successful implementation of the project and positive results. In
    specific, the requirement that "the living standard for the people resettled should be
    better than before" is worthy of application in local projects.
· The quality of the project at entry was good. The project's comprehensive approach
    proposed by the World Bank was appreciated by the borrower. The project included
    not just road building, but multi-modal components that proved to be very valuable
    such as traffic management, public transport, environmental management and
    institutional development.
· The supervision by the World Bank was effective. Many details of the project,
    procedures, and management knowledge were learned by the borrower through
    supervision.
· The possibility of revising the loan agreement and the flexibility shown by the World
    Bank in this regard was helpful in allowing the borrower to maximize the use of the
    loan.

Implementation by the Borrower

· The Ring Road and road maintenance components were completed in accordance
    with implementation plan, while other, non-road components were completed with
    some delay. The main reasons for the slow progress were: (1) at the beginning of the


                                             32

 project, the municipal government and the Project Executive Office focused on the
 Ring Road, (2) the unit and staff lacked experience in management of large projects,
 and (3) the climate exacerbated delays as the construction season lasted 6 months or
  less.
· Although lacking implementation experience for such a comprehensive project, the
  borrower completed the project and achieved the main objectives through hard work.
  The borrower also gained a great deal of experience in project management,
  procurement, resettlement, and financial management, and has utilized the experience
  on other local projects.
· Ring Road was implemented by the RR Executive Office. The project was started in
  June 2000 and was opened in November 5, 2004. Xinjiang DRC organized the
  acceptance of the completion of Ring Road in September 2005. The construction
  quality of all products achieved compliance. Ring Road operation and maintenance
  work was transferred to the municipal utility bureau in August 23, 2006.
· Several engineering innovations were studied and implemented as a result of the
  project including anti-skid, low-noise pavement, asphalt pavement cracks control
  techniques, road tunnel fire retardant, pavement durability measures and others.
· Relevant policies and institution were established to ensure lasting outcomes from the
  project. The most important of these are summarized in the next sections.

     Policy Development

     1) Ring Road development policy
     On March 7, 2006 Municipal People's Government 34th executive meeting
     adopted the "toll collection and management regulation for road and bridge
     funded by loan".
     2) Public transport priority
     By decree of national and province government, the Urumqi Government issued a
     policy note in September 2005 titled "Implementation Options on Prioritizing the
     Development of Urban Public Transport in Urumqi."
     3) Vehicle emission pollution control policy
     With the support and endorsement of Urumqi Municipal People's Government,
     UEPB issued a policy report of "control measures for the prevention and control
     of vehicle emission pollution." UEPB was tasked with implementing it and also
     drafting the "Urumqi City vehicle emission control plan" with relevant laws and
     regulations.
     4) Traffic management policy
     Urumqi in recent years promulgated the "Urumqi City Road Management
     Ordinance", "Urumqi City temporary parking management plan" (adopted on
     June 28, 2005), and the notice about "clean-up of illegal road-occupation."

     Institutional Development

     1) Urumqi Urban Comprehensive Transport Projects Research Center




                                           33

       The Centre is an institution under the management of UCC, conducting studies of
       comprehensive urban transport development strategy, urban transport policy, and
       specific transport topic studies.
       2) Urumqi Urban Road Asset Information Management Center
       The center main task is analyzing, organizing and monitoring Road asset,
       evaluating maintenance, and developing a mid and long-term maintenance plan.
       3) Vehicle Emission Monitor Center
       In accordance with relevant laws, regulations and technical standards, the agency
       introducing scheme of motor vehicle emission control, technical specifications
       and measures; collecting and analyzing the data of vehicle emission, proposed
       advice to control motor vehicle emission; supervising and guiding the work of the
       companies testing motor vehicle emission.

       Other Development Effects

       1) In accordance with World Bank policy, the scope of the Ring Road
       resettlement included 551 acres of land, demolition of buildings with an area of
       257,505 square meters, 1,187 affected families, and 291 affected units. The scope
       exceeded the RAP because of design changes. The project also focused on the
       resolution of several sensitive issues, such as resettlement of YaShan area, the
       resettlement of Lanzhou Temple, the resettlement of LiuDaoWan public housing
       and mosque. During relocation, the project hired consultants to monitor and
       evaluate the work of relocation. The assessment results show that the
       resettlement targets identified in RAP were achieved, and the living standards and
       work environment of project affected person/units were improved.
       2) The project stimulated the local economy with about 2 billion Yuan in
       domestic demand for labor and materials. Road-building required a great deal of
       direct consumption of steel, cement, asphalt, gravel, energy, and equipment,
       thereby stimulating the development of industries, while the implementation of
       the project also provided a lot of job opportunities and promoted the coordinated
       development of the city as a whole.

Overall Lessons Learned

1The city's original plan and project design did not consider two important factors in
the design of the Ring Road. First, a ZhiZhushan tunnel was not included but was
deemed to be necessary after implementation. Second, the land near SuZhou Road
section of the Ring Road was used as a logistics and distribution center (rather than the
planned industrial park) resulting in severe congestion on this section.
2High staff turnover had an impact on the efficiency of knowledge transfer. As the
project was implemented over many years, many key positions had to be filled more than
once. Training and experience did not accumulate as much as it should have.
3Disbursements were slow because of overly complicated local procedures resulting in
delays and loss of information. There were numerous layers for approval including the
subcomponent unit, PEO, Construction Investment Company, Municipal Finance Bureau,
and Provincial Finance Bureau.

Other Comments and Suggestions

1) The Bank's ICR is well structured and the analysis is deep.
2) Some terms should be explained, such as ISR, QAG, core ICR, SIL, and the different
rating should be explained too, such as satisfactory, moderately satisfactory. That is an
opportunity for the borrower to learn something as well.
3) PDO indicator 7 seemed redundant considering that indicator 8 reflects same
information. It is more suitable for a city with large growth rate of vehicles.
4) The PDO indicator should use the readily available data in the city, avoiding new or
extensive data collection effort, thereby ensuring the veracity of the baseline and target
values.
5) Borrowers implementing similar World Bank projects could have better
communication and learn more from each other. The Bank could provide opportunities
for this by organizing annual meeting of various transport project PEOs.
6) World Bank documents should be provided and/or accepted in Chinese, avoiding
issues of quality and delay of the translation by the local PEO.
7) The scope of the Bank loan should extend to resettlement, which will lighten financial
pressure on borrower and making the implementation of the resettlement more compliant
with the requirements of the Bank.
