1. INTRODUCTION
This document. Executive Summary of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the
Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project (UUTIP). Xinjiang. China. provides a general
summar\ of the findings in project EIA and project Environmental Action Plan (EAP) for
environmental administrators, project decision-makers. and project design engineers in China as %~ell
as the executive board of directors and environmental specialists of the Whorld Bank (WB). It could
also ser\e as a concise environmental report for project-affected groups. Non-Governmet
Organizations (NGOs) and the general public.
The partially WB financed project will help provide a solution to the traffic congestion in the cit\
center of Urumqi. improve the quality of urban life and stimulate the economic development. resultinu
in both social and economic benefits. With regard to the environment. the project will generate botl
positive and negative impacts,
For predicted adverse impacts from the project implementation. a series of mitigation measures
have been developed  for the design. construction, and operation  phases. When effectivelr
implemented. the adverse impacts will be mitigated to acceptable levels. For those impacts which
cannot be miticated. such as demolition and land occupation, affected people will be compensated wi th
ne\\ housing and impacted environment with tree planting and greening programs.
Durinm the EIA. affected public was consulted and their concerns have been incorporated into the
proiect engineering design and mitigation measures. Further public participation will be conducted to
further communicate with the affected residents for their input to project design and impact mitigation.
In addition. an environmental monitoring program will be in place to verifv the predicted impacts and
the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
This document summarizes potential project impacts, mitigation measures designed. public
participation program and environmental action plan including the monitoring program for the UUTIP.
1 .1 EIA Timetable
Entrusted bN the Project Execution Office (PEO), Xinjiang Environmental Technologr and
Assessment Center (XETAC) prepared the EIA from July, 1998 to November. 1999. The Terms of
Reference (TOR) for the EIA was developed in November, 1998 under the guidance of China State
Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the specialists assigned by the WB which vas later
re\ ieked and approved by the SEPA. The initial draft of the EIA Report was completed in April. 1999
and \\as preiiminaril\ reviewed by the WB environmental specialists in May, 1999 and by the China's
Ministr\ of Construction (MOC) in July, 1999. The ELA Report was further reviewed in August. 1999
and re\ ised in November. 1999 by environmental specialists retained by the World Bank. prior to its
submission to the WB.

The project components or subprojects ma\ be divided into those with potential ad%erse
environmental impacts and those with minor or no adverse environmental impacts. This EIA focuises
on those subprojects w ith potential environmental impacts.
2.1 Subprojects w ith Potential Env'ironment Impact (see Figure 2.1-1)
The malor subprojects with potential adverse environmental impacts include the Outer RingT Road
(ORR). Road Network Improvement Subproject (RNIS). both of which are in the Road Netnork
Development Component and the'Fifth Bus Repair Faciliry which is from  the Public Transit
Improvement Component.
The total length of the ORR is 31.25 km. including 8.88 km of viaduct, 10.23 km of ground
express\%a\. 10.59 km urban artern, 0455 km tunnel, and 1.09 km alread\ completed QiantangiianL
Road Fly over and Suzhou Road Fiyover. In the ORR, the existing roads \will be A idened from 1 6-50I m
to 24-60 In. The new roads \will have 4-6 lanes for motor vehicles. 2 full-scale interchanges. 2 simple
interchanges, I auxiliary road interchange, 5 grade separations. II ramps and 8 exits;entrances to the
ground expressway The designed driving speed is 60-80 km/hr.
In the RNIS. 0.6 km of Heilongjiang Road (Nianzigou Intersection-Baoshan Road. Intersectiont)
ill be reconstructed with 27m in width and 4 lanes for motor vehicles. In addition. 1.2 km of Tuan jie
Road (Tuanjie Road Intersection-Dawan Road Intersection) will be reconstructed with 29 m in \.\ idth
and 4 lanes for motor vehicies.
A bus maintenance and repair facility will be built near Nanhu Road. It will service 1'0
articulated buses (corresponding to 220 standardized buses) a year with 450 employees. performing
grade 1-4 mandator\ bus maintenance.
2.2 Subprojects with Minor or No Environment Impact
These subprojects include the proposed road maintenance (procurement of road maintenance
equipment and personnel training only. No engineering component). prioritv to public transport. one-
,Aa\ traffic. facilities for pedestrian, traffic management, improvement of road safety and existing bus
territinals. estabiishment of bus bays (that can avoid occupying traffic lane when buses stop).
dispatching system. systematic management of urban transport, technical aid and training.
These subprojects will have little to no adverse environmental impacts. In fact, these subprojects
will help establish good maintenance practice for buses and the priority public transport. benefiting the
public, and contribute positively to the urban economy, quality of life, traffic safety and the
en\ ironinental improvement.
23 Construction Schedule
A four-, ear implementation period (2000 - December, 2003) is planned for the project (the ORR
and other components). Table 2.3-I presented the implementation plan for the project components v, ithi
potential environmental impacts.

3. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
In this Summary, the word 'altemative" is used only to refer different alignments for a given
seument of road. k hile word option" is used to refer different road configurations or designs on the
same alignment
Based on the engineering and environmental analysis, five segments of the ORR consist of'
alignment alternatives The preferred alignment of each segment was selected by comparisons (see
Figure '2.1-I ). A full analysis of the alternatives is presented in the EIA report. The alternatives of each
segment are as follows:
Segment One (11): Alignment of Qiantangjiang Road - Tuanjie Road (south Ring)
A A lignment of Qiantangjiang Road - Tuanjie Road (preferred)
B. A hgnment in the south of Qitanjiang Road
Segment Tvko (2) Liudaowan-WuThang Road (North Ring)
A. A hgnment of Suzhou Road - Altav' Road (preferred)
B. Alhgnment of Henan Road
Segment Three (3): East Karamay Road - Nanhu Road (Northeast Ring)
A. A lignment of Nanhu Road (preferred)
B. Ali=nment of crossing the coal mine area (surface road)
C. A lignment of crossing the coal mine area (elevated viaduct)
Segment Four (4): Altay Road - Wuming Road (northwest ring)

Seement Fi\e c5}: Xishan Road- Heilongiiana Road (Hongshanzui section)
A Alignment of crossing Hongshanzui by tunnel (preferred)
B. A lignment of detouring Hongshanzui along Baoshan Road
The preferred alignments were selected in each segment based on comparisons of enN ironmilental.
socio-economic and relocation and resettlement impacts. In general. the alignment with the least
inpacts compared -nith other altematives in the same segment was considered as preterred alnd
incorporated in the project. Engineering related factors were also evaluated during the comparison.
On the basis of the comparison and selection of alternatives and traffic volume forecast. tour
design options related to the configuration. scale and complexity of the ORR were proposed on the
preferred alignment. Among these options. Option 4 has the least amount of viaduct and express%ra\
and also the simplest in terms of engineering complexity when compared with others. It is therelore
considered tO have the least potential adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts. \' ith all
factors considered, such as engineering and traffic forecast. Option 4 was selected as the ORR project.
This EIA covers the detailed assessment for this option.
4. EXISTING ENVRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
ASSESSMENT
4.1 Air Quality
Existing Conditons
Based on the results of the air quality monitoring program carried out in October 1998 (non-
heating season i) and Januan 1999 (heating season), the existing air qualitv in Urumqi is poor
In thie non-heating Season. air pollution mainly results from air-borne dust and motor vehicle
emissionis. The pollution attribute to TSP, NO,, SO: and lead is 31.40. 27.95. 14.99 and 3.96.o
respectikelk. wsith TSP having the highest share among the pollutants. The monitoring showed that

In 2020. the emission from single motor vehicle wvill decrease due to the anticipated development
in emission control technolog\ for motor vehicles. However. the decrease in total emissions vN ill be
limited because of the increase in traffic volume. The maximum readings of NO\NO. at roadside ' il

Impact on Air Quality in the City Center
The operation of the project w ill improve air qualinr in the central area of the cit\. because mucC
traffic x ill be attracted to the project roads and average motor vehicle speed wAill increase. Based on the
prediction. in the earl\ operation years of the project, the traffic volume in the central area of the city
will decrease by more than 30%. As a result. the emission of CO, NMHC and NO, (NO2) will decrease
by 39.3. 39.0 and 28.6 %, respectively.
4.2 Noise
Existing Acoustic Environment
Based on the monitoring results, within the range of 30 m from the project roads. 25%/6 of the
locations monitored exceed the standard at day time and 75% at night. The average exceedance is 0 1-
0.8 dB(A ) above the day times standard of 70 dB(A) and 2.6-10.2 dB(A) above the night standard of
55 dB(A). respectivel. The exceedance at the environmentally sensitive receptors such as schools.
hospitals and kindergartens is higher, with the average of 5.1-14.4 dB(A) in daytime and 2.8-16.1
clB(A) at night. respectively. The maximum noise readings are recorded at 2nd - 3rd floors of buildinus
along surface roads and 4h - 5-h floors of buildings adjacent to viaducts.
Predlicted .AVoise Levels
\V ith the increase in traffic volume. the acoustic environment along the ORR will worsen. The
exceedance of traffic noise over the standard in davtime and at night is predicted to be 1.8 - 5.5 dB(A
and 12.0-1 5.8 dB(A). respectively. Noise levels at all sensitive receptors (such as hospitals. schools
and kinder_artens will exceed the standard in the 2000-2020 period by 0.1-19.2 dB(A) at day time. It
will be w orse at night with the noise leveis exceeding the standard by at least 10 dB(A) and with the

4.3 V-ibration
All the monitorina vibration values for the proposedroads do not exceed the standard. W\'hile the
vibration impact will increase after the project implementation. vibration level will still meet the
standard according to the prediction. The vibration during construction will not affect the environm1ent
if construction machines are kept at least 30 m away from the sensitive receptors.
4.4 Sunshine
There will be sunshine obstruction to the first floor of four residential buildings alona East
Honushan Road - Tivuguan Road. There will be no impact of sunshine obstruction on the other road
sections.
4.5 Surface Runoff (Snow)
On the basis of on site monitoring, the surface runoff on the proposed ORR basically met Class
Ill ofIntegrated Standard for Waste Water Discharge (GB8978-1996). except COD which significantl\
exceeded the standard of 500 mg'L by up to 1.73 times. The surface runofffrom the project roads wk ill
not siLnificantl\ affect the environment because it will be directed into the citv's sewage treatmenit
plant \ ia the municipal storm sewer system.
4.6 Landscape and Ecolop7
The road widening will result in trees cut and green area loss, totalling 115.119 m: along the
existing road. However. newly built green separation media (29.66 km long with a total area of
227.600 m-) will mitigate the impact. Besides. an additional 212.780 m: green area will be created as
part of the Environment Improvement Component (Component Four). Thus. the newly developed
-reen area \\ ill be 440.380 m: in total. resultina in a net increase of 325.261 m: in green areas as w\,ell
as a better ecological environment and scenery for the city.

In the feasibilit\ report for the Fifth Bus Repair Facility, the workshop for paint spra\ 'A ill be
relocated in northeast comer of the site to minimize the impact of exhausted gas on residents located
southeast to the Facilit.
\Ventilation system and cataiytic combustion process will be designed to treat the emission ga,
trom paint spra\. The height of the exhaust emission after the treatment will be over 15 m.
5.t1.2 Noise
Confitguration and Construction Materials
*    The construction of viaduct will be limited. Surface road is the preferred solution and no viaduct
ill be constructed except that the road capacity at grade is still insufficient through road
w idening.
*    The effective sound absorption material for road surface, such as Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA 
modified asphalt will be applied to reduce the traffic noise at road sections where there are
numerous noise sensitive receptors.
*   The x%ork in bus reDair facilitv will be done in the enclosed buildings to reduce noise impact on
the surrounding environment.
Soun7d ahsorption Barrier Design
*    The location. configuration. material and height of sound barriers with roadside absorptive lining
ill be designed depending on the sensitivity of the road side buildings, predicted noise levels.
road structure. resistance to wind and erosion. safety and urban landscape.
*     Y  shaped barrier will be designed mainly along the elevated viaduct. In order to minimize the
sunshine obstruction  by the barrier, transparent materials will be used  for the barriers
(transparencN ¢80%) which will be easily assembled and disassembled for regular cleaning. The
barrier V ill be 3.5 m high at viaduct and 5 m high at ground expressway.

*      Double-glazed  windows will be  installed  for the  first row   of residential buildings affected  bx
traffic noise in combination with a cooling ventilation system. A coolin2 ventilation system is a
unit using a cooling agent (or ice) and enforced air ventilation and is capable of lowering the
indoor temperature by 6-8 °C  in a typical residential room  in Urumqi. An important consideration
in selecting the cooling system is the low operating cost compared with an air conditioner, as vw ell
as the lovA purchase cosI. The loA operating cost will allow affected residents to use it more often
so that they A ill close their windows in summer to mitigate the noise to acceptable levels.

5.3.1 Air Qualit
As a ma jor rnitigation measure to address the long term air quality of Urumqi. a Motor Vehicle
Emission Control Strategy (MVECS) will be developed and included in this project. The developmenit
and implemiienitation of MVECS will ensure sustained improvement in air quality in the cit\ center and
in itigate tihe air qualitN deterioration alona the ORR. Urumqi currently has and plan to have a number
of initiati es to address motor vehicle related air quality issues. The MVECS will be developed on the
basis of these initiatives. to further enhance the existing effort and to form an integrated air quality
control strateg! for the city. A detailed proposal or termts of reference (TOR) for MVECS. including
scope of sNork and detailed budget. will be presented separately by Project Appraisal time.

E.vi.wing Iniitirtiies
At present. the citx of Urumqi has launched a number of air pollution and motor vehicle emission
cotitrol initiatives in the cit. These existing initiatives are:
*   Prepared and submitted report on Management of Mitigating Pollution from Vehicle E\hatisl
Emission- in Urumqi to the Municipal Govemment
*   Fi;c tYpes of products for controlling vehicle exhaust emission have been identified and
recomimlended based on the performance. economr  and energy conservation.
*   Tested 6145 motor vehicles in 1998. among which 3294 (53.53%10) met standard. 965 vehicles did
not and were repaired to go through services.
*   Banning the use of leaded fuel since JuIl 1999.
*   B! 1998. 500 vehicles had been converted to alternate fuels. B! year 2003. 14.000 vehicles are
planned for the conversion and between 2003 and 2005. another 6.000 vehicles will be con\erted
*   Four gas-filling stations were built in 1998. By the year of 2005. ten multi-purpose stations (CNG.
LPG and fuel oil). ten dual purpose gas stations (CNG and LPG) and twent% stations specialized
in LPG v ill be built.
Proposetl .fea,sures
A  Liunber of motor vehicle emission control measures are also proposed in Urumqi on the basis
of the relevant lau-s and regulations, technical support and management. The\ are:
*   Improvemlient of pertinent laws and regulations and rigorous enforcement of standards
*   Supervision and management
*   Enforcement of equipping tail-gas purifier
*   Speed up the elimination of old vehicles
v   De% ote major efforts to developing public transit
*   Acceletate hiuhx%a% construction, strengthen road maintenance and improve its function
*   Traffic system management
*   ContinuouslN develop clean energy
*   Greening Plan ofthe ORR
*   lmpro\e the Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) System for Vehicles, including establishment of
an institutional frame" ork and technical objectives.
* The control and m itigation of vehicle emissions is one of the essential measures for mitigating ait
pollution associated with traffic. The control of vehicle emissions will require an integrated
approach and sufficient funding. With the help and support of World Bank. an Motor Vehicle
Emission Control Strategy is proposed and will be included in the project. The MVECS X ill be

7. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Public participation is essential to preparing the EA Report and improving the rationale or-
decision-makin2. Public input is ver\ helpful to identif\ potential impacts. evaluate alternati\ e
alignments and enunieering design, propose pertinent mitigation measures. and promote pub lic
a\s arene, and suppori for the project. The Public Participation in this environmental assessment \\a 
implemiienied in tmo stages.
The public consultation was conduced by interviews at site. handing out questionnaire. mailing
letters. telephone interviews and br public meetings.
7.1  First Round of Public Participation (August, 1998 - June, 1999)
On both sides of the ORR. 57 institutions. 10 residential committees. 6 mosques. including 162
people. % ere surveyed during site visits. In addition, 72 telephone interviews and more than 2(00
questionnaires were hand out. In response 145 completed questions were received. Besides. 3 official
responses. ' documents with official seal and 187 responsive telephones were received.
The public meeting of the first stage was held in the Urumqi Construction Commission on
December 28. 1498. and attended by 40 representatives from the environmentally sensitive receptors
(schools. hospitals. etc.). residential areas, villages, sub-district offices, residential committees.
enterprises and institutions, and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs). Two reporters also took part
in this public meeting. Main contents of the ORR project were introduced in the meeting. Potential
ens ironmenital impacts (including resettlement) and the related mitigation measures were discussed in
general. Public concems from the meetings as well as from the questionnaires and intervies\ s as
summiarized in Table 7.3-1
7.2 Second Round of Public Participation (June - September 1999)
Tx\ o hotlinies for public input, one available in PEO and the other in EIA team. were set up in this
stage fobr pLIblic inquiries. The public was noticed of the availability of the hotlines as well as the otftice
addresses ot' the PEO and the EA team through advertisements in both Chinese and Uvgur. a major
local dialect. in the Metropolitan Consumer Mornings and Urumqi Evening News, two major local
ne%N sprinit In addition. a preliminary EIA Summary in both Chinese and Uygur was distributed in each
of the 19 affected residents' committees for public review. At the same time, more than 800 pamphlets
introducing the project in both Chinese and Uygur were distributed along the ORR.
A total of 2 1 7 inquiries were received through the hotlines. 67% of those called expressed
concerns related to resettlement. 18%  noise impact, 7%  air pollution. 5%  greening and 3q'o eater
discharge pipeline.The inquires were responded properly in each case.
The second stage public meeting was held in Urumqi Construction Committee on September 24.
1Q99. Ov-er 140 representatives from  sensitive receptors, the resettlement department. the District
People's Congress and the government agencies attended this meeting. 3 reporters and I expert from
