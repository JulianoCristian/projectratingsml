There are three\n            subprojects that are considered to have potential adverse\n            environmental impacts: they involve the road network\n            development component and the public transit improvement\n            component. Mitigation measures planned are the following:\n            Contain dust by separating demolition and excavation sites\n            with tarpaulin or similar materials, watering unpaved roads,\n            covering transport vehicles, regularly clearing out garbage,\n            distancing temporary roads from residential areas, and\n            properly operating maintaining, and repairing equipment and\n            machinery. Reduce noise by restricting machinery use at\n            night and restricting heavy vehicles by day, using sound\n            absorption materials, prefabricating some structural\n            components, routinely monitoring motor vehicle noise, and\n            using vegetation buffers and zoning. Protect water quality\n            by proper sewage disposal, and building temporary toilets\n            and sewage collection facilities. Solid waste from\n            construction will be removed from the site. Overpasses and\n            underground passages will be built to ease pedestrian\n            crossing through construction roads. Vehicles transporting\n            hazardous materials must drive on specially designated\n            roads. Lastly, people whose residences are converted for\n            commercial use will receive preferential treatment."}, "docdt": "1999-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
