Xinshi Region, Shuimogou Region, Toutunhe Region, Dongshan Region, Dabancheng

                                              I

Region and Wulumuqi County. The project is located in the Tianshan Region. Tianshan

Region locates in southeast of Urumqi with total area about 198.36km2, urban building

area 32.79km2. Eastern starting point of the project is Dongshan Cemetery 1-idge and

borders Shuimogou Region and Dabancheng Region. West of the project bobndary is

Heping Drains facing Shayibake Region. South of the project boundary is Tuoli village

and borders Wulumuqi County. The starting point for the north is the intersections of

Hongshan Road and Hetan north Road connected with Shuimogou Region. Geagraphical

coordinates: east longitude 87'36'-87'42',        north latitude 43'316'-43'49'.     Tianshan

region is the political, economical, cultural, financial center of Urumqi. .

1.2 Present situation of road

     The length of Xinhua Road is 4493m from Santunbei of Shengli Road to Hongshan

Road. Xinhua Road is divided into Xinhua south Road and Xinhua north Road by

Renmin Road. Plane line type has six break points which are distributed over cross range

of Tuanjie Road, Longquan Street, Renmin Road, Zhongshan Road, Minzhu Road,

Guangming Road and average longitudinal slope of road is 1.2%.

Road diseases such as crack, pit, upheaval and loose has appeared on asphalt pavement

because existing asphalt pavement of Xinhua Road was lay in 1978 with 15cm bacadam
                                                                                    I

base and Gravel Subbase and there has no big repair or rebuild for 12 years fipm 1992.

The index of pavement smoothness have exceeded standards and pavement strehgth have

decreased for road surface material aging. The damage of road curbstone iS serious.
                                                                                    I


Pavement structure life has exceeded design working life and mare than halr of street

pedestrian crossing facilities are imperfect. The road can't satisfy the requiremehts of the

traffic movement and need rebuilding because of above-mentioned qause.

1.3 Engineering survey of construction project

1.3.1 Road reconstruction plan


1.3.1.1 Road engineering

     The total length of Xinhua Road rebuilding engineering is 4493m from saitunbei to

Hongshan Road. The width of plan road's red line is 38m, and the width of cenlral motor

lane is 20m, and both sides in turn are green belt with 3m in width and footway with 6m

in width.

     The road is designed according to the grade I standards of urban minor arterial roads

with three lanes in each of side, 40 Wh in driving speed and 8 cross points in plan

alignment.

     (I) Subgrade design

     There are four forms of roadway section composition. Firstly, the width of motor

lane is 15m and the width of each side footway is 2.0m from Santunbei to gateway of

Xinjiang brewhouse. Secondly, the width of motor lane is 20m and both sides in turn are

green belt with 3m in width and footway with 6.0m in width from Xinjiang brewhouse to

Longquan Street. Thirdly, the width of motor lane is 20m and both sides in turn are plant

pit belt with 1.75m width and footway with 7.25m in width from Longquan Street to

Guangming Road. Lastly, the width of motor lane is 22m and the width of each side

footway is 5.5m from Guangming Road to Hongshan Road.

     Subgrade needs layered paved roadbed and uniform compaction. All fillers are

nature gravel. The degree of compaction of motor lane subgrade should meet the demand:

degree of compaction>96% for 0-80cm below pavement structure bottom; and degree of

compaction>94% for footway subgrade.

     (2) Pavement design

     Asphalt concrete pavement is used to motor lane and the interlock type floor brick is

used to footway.

     (3) Intersection design

     Full line of Xinhua Road is intersectant with nine urban primary and secondary

roadway and many branches. The entry of main intersection is widened properly

according to land use and traffic volume character of intersection. The length of widened

road is 70m (not including length of bus station) except for 59m in Yingawati Road and

the length of transition section is 30m. Entry and exit of partial intersection road are

widened. Intersections will be found in table 1.3-1.

     There are 8 pairs (sum to 16) open type bus stops along line, with the width of bus

stop 3.5m, the length of deceleration lane 15m, the length of acceleration lane 20m.

Different station length is provided in terms of different traffic demand of Xinhua south

Road and north Road.

     Zoo-Longquan Street: the station length 40m.

     Longquan Street -Guangming Road: the station length 60m.

     And the length of two station located at Xiaoximen is lengthened to 80m, separated

into two bus stops.

     (5) Others

     Barrier free design: the ramp is established in intersection and department gateway,

and barrier-free access is established along full line of footpath.

     Pre-buried casing design: the casings for greening, illume, traffic engineering and so

on are pre-buried in greening break, department gateway and intersection.


1.3.1.2 Traffic engineering

     There are 423 blocks sign plate consisting of warning signs, prohibition signs,

indication signs and auxiliary signs. The side bus private channel is setup in 2038 meter

from Guangming Road to Longquan Street with indication signs and period auxiliary

signs in entrance of bus private channel.

        Through field investigation, there are more socially sensitive points along the
                                                                                                  I

  vehicles along the road as well as the related traffic

  2.2.1.1 The barrier effect to residents along the road

        The project will adopt all-closed traffic or construction, only keeping the road from

  east to west open. According to field investigation, the hotel, shops, schools and
                                                                                                   I

  neighborhoods along the sides of entire project, the construction of the north-soukh

  project will be constructed under temporary closure which will have impact on
                                                                                                   I

Road. The residents on trips, the students go to school, and even patients to hospitals will

be inconvenient because of road construction.

     But this inevitable impact on production and daily life of local residents will be

short-term and can be finished at the end of construction.

     (I) Residential area along the road

     Many residential areas (about 31) gathered along the road, particularly in the South

of Xinhua Road .During the period of road construction, residents along the road have to

travel through the reserved sidewalk or other traffic intersection, which will bring

inconvenience to resident trip.

     (2) The hospitals, community services along the road

     In addition to gathered residential areas along the road, there are municipality

people's hospital and two community service centers (the community service center in

South of Xinhua Road at K1+880, Longquan community health service stations at

K2+640), including hospital department in the community service center in South of

Xinhua Road. Thus, it will bring inconvenience to the patients in the construction of

sectors.

     (3)Kindergartens and schools along the road

     There are 2 kindergartens (Municipal Women's Federation Xinhua kindergarten at

K1+020, Department of Commerce kindergarten at K2+640) and 4 schools ( city 32nd

primary school at K1+240 ,city 38th middle school at K1+860, city 5th primary school at

K2+750,city 11th middle school at K4+080). Closed road construction will impact

kindergartens and students from school, especially for those students living opposite to

kindergarten and school.

     (4) Impact on business trade

     There are large malls such as East 100 commercial building, DanLu Fashion Square

shopping centers, clothing business, small commodities, retail and wholesale transaction

centers such as Large Simon Shoe City, Success Square and Contemporary Mall where

the flow of people and vehicles gathers everyday. Because of the alteration of Xinhua

Road and the closed construction, it may reduce the number of the businessmen which

will cause a considerable influence on business.

2.2.1.2 Traffic impact

      (1)Impact on vehicles of units and individuals

      Because there are so many resident areas and units along the road, the project would

be closed to all traffic, by on-site inspection with traffic police detachment, to enrsure

traffic of bus and units vehicles along the road and keep the east-west roads free. That is

to say West Bridge Road, the District League junctions, Democratic Road junctions,

Zhongshan Road junctions, People Road junctions, Longquan Street junction and Unity
                                                                                     I
Road junctions will maintain a smooth flow during construction period, and the ~ t h e r

junctions will be closed. The north part of Liberation Road will resume two-way during

                                                                                     F
construction, as the road will be closed to other sections during the construction eriod,

such as: Overflow Road, Bright Road, Construction Road, Red Flag Road, ~iber'~tion

Road, Democratic Road, Zhongshan Road, People Road, Longquan Street, and dnity

Road, which can cause congestion phenomenon.

      (2) Impact on bus
                                                                                     I

      As the main passenger from north to south channels in southern district of the city,

there are 22 public transport lines in operation on Xinhua Road, such as 7, 35, 6d,910, the
                                                                                      I

construction can cause part of buses re-routed.                                       I
                                                                                      I

      The reconstruction of road will in turn put various pipes into the earth, and the roads,
                                                                                      I

greenery, lighting and other projects will be under construction. Pipelines in the earth

include water supply, sewage, storm water, telecommunications, electricity, headng, and
                                                                                      I


green irrigation pipelines. Construction on the pipeline will produce certain impact on the
                                                                                       I

supply of electricity, water, and communications along the road. Thus, road d e s i b
                                                                                       I

      In short, the proposed alterations in the construction period will certainly have
                                                                                       I

adverse impact on resident trips and traffic along the road. But the impact will be

short-lived, with the proposed road construction and implementation of various
                                                                                       I

mitigation measures, this impact will be reduced to the minimum.

2.2.2 Construction activity, ecological environment and landscape influence analysis

2.2.2.1 Landscape influence analysis of the increasing occupation of land

     This project is the rebuilding of the original streets. under the premises of moving

trees as few as possible, widening driveways advisably, constructing the appurtenant

works of over ground part of roads, crossover and cuniculus ,virescence and illuminating

as well as waiting room because of pipelines and nets of rainwater, sewerage, water

supply, telecom, electric power which are put under the ground. The increase of the land

occupation is little.


2.2.2.2 Influence analysis of this project on vegetation and woodland during the

construction period

     This effect of project on vegetation along the route mainly appears as the

transplanting of trees and the blackouts of lawns during the construction time.

     The area of this project has no natural vegetation planting and the artificial

vegetations are just some green belts on both sides of the road and some accessorial

woodland. Common plants are fraxinusm, long shoot Siberian elm, round crown clove,

loblolly pine, northern catalpa and so on.

     (1) Influence on vegetation by the occupation of land

     The amount of the trees that are transplanted is 340. Although transplanting will

cause some decline of rate of plant coverage during period of time, when the project is

put into service, new vegetation and woodland will be built up and the ecology landscape

will be improved.

     (2) Influence on vegetation by the contamination of construction process

      O Influence on vegetation by dust emission

     Dust emission is one of the influencing factors to the plant growth. But intensity of

this project is finite, dust emission caused by the cubic meter of earth and stone's

excavates influenced little on vegetation, and the effect will impair with the ending of the

project. Construction watering could put-down the dust, improve the construction

environment, so it is propitious to protect the vegetation, and reduce the effect of dust

emission as low as possible.

        Influence on vegetation by the offal of construction

      In municipal engineering, the effect from the offal of construction on vegetation is

mainly caused by scrap asphalt dregs and domestic garbage during the construction time.

At job location, rebuilding the original roadbed would cause some fallout stayink in the

circumstance unavoidably. It would tamper with respiration and photosynthesis bf the

plants.

      3 Influence on vegetation by waste water of construction time

      There is only some sanitary waste produced, without liquid containing greaiy dirt,

so it will not influence on vegetation.

      (3) Influence on vegetation by artificial activity

      Influence on vegetation by artificial activity mainly appears as the constructor and

machinery destroying the plants' cuticle and root carelessly, but this could be cobtrolled.
                                                                                   I


2.2.2.3 Influence analysis of wildlife during the construction period

      Animal type of this area before the project is primary rodent. Most of them are
                                                                                   I

abbreviated rodent such as abbreviated house mouse and ash hamster,etc. Aves is mainly

tree sparrow, barn swallow and lavrock,etc. The project may demolish their livihg

environment and influence some individual. But because the number of abbrevia~ed

rodent and Aves are multitudinous and their adaptive faculty is strong, there woqld not
                                                                                   I

2.2.2.4 Landscape influence analysis during construction period

      (1) Influence on landscape by construction back plate

      During construction time, traffic diverted speed operation and sidewalk, judctions, a
                                                                                    I


variety of back plates would cause disorderly feeling.

                                                                                    I

      The stacks of the earth and the abandons the dregs would influence the city

landscape.

2.2.3 Air impact analysis in construction period

      In Urumqi, the reconstruction of Xinhua Road will improve its traffic condiiions and

services level, and meanwhile, the urban roads outlook and underground pipe nebork

facilities will be changed greatly, which provide hardware support to urban infrabtructure

construction for building international city development goals of Urumqi. The road

reconstruction will inevitably have impact on atmospheric environment and surroundings.

In this section, it will focus on analyzing the problem of air impact in this reconstruction

engineering work.

     The qualitative analysis evaluation method of the air impact analysis in construction

period is analogy. The dust from transport vehicle road accounts for more than 50% of

the weight of space dust, especially the dust from lime carrier road has a more significant

impact. According to the monitoring results of road construction, it shows that in the case

of 2mls wind speed, 150m to the leeward side on the roadside, TSP concentration is

greater than 1Omglm3.

     The dust produced by mixing lime is the heaviest in construction-operation. The

monitoring results of that show in the case of 1.5-2.0mIs wind speed, IOOm to the

leeward side in Mixing Station, the impact of dust is a bit great, and 150m to the leeward

side, TSP concentration is about 0.5mgIm3. Therefore, there is the most significant

impact of the construction dust IOOm to the leeward side in the construction site, and the

scope of influence is mainly about 200m of the construction site.

     On the entire project, the atmospheric effects to the road in construction period are

as following:

     (1) The process of cut-and-fill operations, soil banging, produce dust.

     (2) The transportation of waste, spoil and construction materials such as soil.

aggregates and cement, if the conditions of confined is not good, the dust will leak.

     (3) In the region of pipeline excavated, vegetation damage, soil loosen, produce

dust.

     (4) Dust scattered at the construction site, shortcut of the construction and around it,

will form the second floor dust pollution when the vehicles pass or there is wind.

     (5) In the construction materials processing site, the dust is leaked as the fine soil

leaks from the cement and aggregates when the concrete is mixed.

     (6) Asphalt smoke and fumes.

     In the construction of pavement, it is impossible to generate the impact of asphalt

smoke and smoke pollution to regional environment because mixing asphalt plant far

                                               19

2.2.4.2 Construction noise resource

     The noise comes mainly from the operation of construction machineries an4

transport vehicles in road construction. Road Construction noise types can be broadly

divided into two categories:

      (1) Motor Transport Noise: when the project is constructed, the vehicles trapsporting

                                                                                   I
soil, stone and other materials will have an impact on the surrounding environqient.

      (2) Road construction site machinery noise: At present, the machineries used in the

road-building project are mainly excavator, grader, bulldozer, roller, agitator, shared

catching machine and loader, etc, and the noise generated from them will have a definite

impact on the environment on both sides of the road.

2.2.4.3 Construction noise intensity

      Road construction project has a wide range of mechanical equipment, curr&tly the

noise from the mechanical equipments which are often used in road construction during

operation period is listed in table 2.2-2.

2.2.4.4 Impact of construction noise

     In this project, within both sides of the road within 50m, there are many

noise-sensitive points, except Xinjiang TVU quarters, the Home Office courtyard (East),

the Department of Commerce kindergarten, and the 5th city primary school. The

remaining sensitivities are all the objects on both sides of the road within 50m.

     Construction noise prediction:

     The noise source of construction could be similarly handled as a point source, and

according point source noise attenuation model, the noise value of the different distance

from its construction noise sources can be estimated, and the prediction model is as

follows:

     LP= LPO-2010g { r/rO )

     Where: LP-Predictive value of construction noise from the sound source r meters



              LPO-Reference        levels of construction noise from the sound source r

                        meters dB (A).

     According to the noise value of all kinds of construction machineries and

equipments in table 3.2-2, the predictive noise value of the different types of construction

machinery in different distance can be obtained by calculating, listed in table 2.2-3.

in construction will have a definite impact around construction site within 50m,

especially the impact is more serious when constructing at night.

2.2.5 Solid waste environment impact analysis in construction period

     The solid waste in construction is mainly the building garbage generated in         ~
                                                                                         I
construction sites and the domestic garbage of the construction staff,                   ,

2.2.5.1 Construction waste                                                                I
                                                                                          I



     (I) Solid waste of pipeline construction                                             I




     In the process of pipeline construction, when the pipeline outer is bound uplwiththe

insulation materials and brushed with the protective coating, then some solid material

will be likely to fall into the soil which is difficult to be dismissed. So the construction

workers shall not discard construction waste arbitrarily for civilization.

      (2) Solid waste of road construction

      Solid waste generated in construction is mainly abandoned building materials,

including sand, lime and other solid waste and engineering spoil (In this project the Cut

volume is 100829.47m3,fill volume is 1149.66 m3, spoil volume is 99679.81 m3), If not

timely treated, not only the overall landscape of road construction site, but also the wind

dry weather will be polluted with dust.


2.2.5.2 Domestic garbage

      Domestic garbage of the construction stuff results mainly from the construction

camp. According to the information, the garbage produced by each construction camp in

the course of construction is 9.6t, when the garbage produced by one construction person

is estimated by I kg, construction staff is calculated by 80 people and the construction

cycle of each construction camp is totaled by 4 months. From this view the domestic

garbage from construction camp is less; nonetheless, if the management of the domestic

garbage is neglected during the construction, it is easily to lead to the mosquitoes and

have a negative impact on the environment. Thus many temporary trashes should be set

in construction camps and the collected garbage must be cleared regularly.

      In the process of construction, if the construction unit deals strictly with the

domestic garbage of construction stuff and construction waste, the solid waste produced

in construction of this project will not have adverse effects to the environment obviously.

2.3. Environment impact analysis in operation period

2.3.1 Social and economic environment impact analysis in operation period.

2.3.1.1 Compatibility of planning analysis

      According to the road traffic planning in ((Urumqi Urban Overall Planning)) , the

length of secondary distributor road is planned to be 326km and its density is planned to

be 1.63km/km2, which is expanded comprehensively on the basis of existing roads. And

the road level will be raised, the road infrastructure will be improved.

      Road traffic conditions are seriously lagging to the development of surroundings,

commercial and passenger. With the comprehensive improvement begun from 2002, slip

road and roadway construction project were carried out step by step and the

accomplishment of Outer Ring Highway construction, Urumqi downtown road rietwork

is gradually perfected. Road conditions and road capacity has been changed gredtly, but

the overall level between Xinhua road and center city roads has a large differenck, so the

operation of Xinhua road construction project meets the need of Urumqi overall iurban

planning, and the construction of project is necessary.


2.3.1.2 Effect of social and economic analysis
                                                                                   I

space to obtain further protection and optimization. And the natural landscape will be

more harmony and will make the dirt, disorder and poor belonging to past and become a

new beautiful scenery.

2.3.1.3 Effect of the removal and resettlement

     This project will remove 133 electricity poles, 13 1 telecom posts, 340 trees.

Electricity poles, telecommunication poles will be buried underground. People will not

see a pole and wire when walking on the Xinhua North-South road after completing

transformation. Lines are buried underground, and underground electrical equipment will

not affect the user's electricity price.

     Trees are moved to another area planted by the garden department, which will not

cause adverse effects.

2.3.2 Effect of ecological environment and landscape in operation period

2.3.2.1 Planting design

     Green design should maintain the existing arbors in principle and replant some

arbors and increase quantities of flowering shrub, through the rational allocation, which

will play the role of enhancing functionality and rich landscape and improving the

environment.

(1) Fractional Outline

    Zoo- Longquan Street

On both sides of the road there are two green belts, and the width of green belt on the

west side of the road is 4m from zoo to Ying Awa and 3m from Ying Awa to Longquan

Street, and it is 3m on the east of road, also the green belt beyond harbor bus stops should

be compressed.

    Longquan Street-Hong Shan road

Green belt is not set in this section, and it is only to keep the original arbors on sidewalk.

(2) Planting Content

O The existing arbors are reserved basically on Xinhua road, but some arbors beyond

harbor stops, junctions disconnected, and conflicting with the pipeline and cartons

changing will be transplanted.

    Shrub red berberis, Xinjiang lonicera, Philip water is increased and planted       closely

                                                 25

to form pattern, embellish hemerocallis (Golden Baby) locally and model water Philip

ball and then factor the existing arbors for forming solid landscape.

C! Hemerocallis (Golden Baby) is planted within the lateral of the traffic islands in

bright road intersection and red weigela Florida. The inner the traffic islands will form

strong contrast with the color and layer.

     In the section from Soap roadway to Ying Awa, a small road which is 2m wide is

built in the lateral of 3m road east greenbelt. In this section, the road is widened locally

for forming small pieces of the pedestrian playgrounds with lateral 5.5m regarddd as

green belt, and some round stools are set by selecting the leisure benches made df

                                                                                          I

2.3.3 The analysis of ambient air in operation period

2.3.3.1 The technological route of appraising the ambient air in operation period

     The Xinhua road is a main traffic road which goes through the old Urumqi city, from

SanYong tablet in the south, to the Hongshan road in the north. Therefore, the software

ADS-ambient appraising(1inear pattern) invented by Cambridge environmental research

company in Britain and then admitted by environmental protection bureau of China is

used to predict ambient air during the operation time. The main parameters needed in the

process of forecast are as following: traffic flow, the standard of route technology, the

terrain surrounding the roads, and local meteorological data. The software includes

factors of vehicles giving off pollution promulgated by DIVIRB in 1994, and in 1999, and

users can choose them by themselves. Besides, it can convert the traffic flow into the

volume of pollution giving off by vehicles directly. By utilizing local meteorological data,

the density of the pollution falling to the ground which is from every point in the grid in

every special scope for long-term and short-term could be calculated.

2.3.3.2 The choice of factors for appraising forecast and deciding the time for

forecast

     During the operation time of roads, the air pollution mainly comes from the exhaust

caused by traveling vehicles, the main pollutants of which are NOx, CO and NMHC.

According to the professional standard of the People's Republic of China called "the

standard for appraising the influence of environmental caused by the project of the road

construction " (JTG B03-20069) , this project considers NOx, CO as the factors to

forecast the ambient air during the road operation time.

     The forecast of the influence on environment during the road operating time is

divided as the short-term. middle-term   .long  -term, the respective base year is 2010, 2015

and 2020.

2.3.3.3 Forecasting the density of influence of various time intervals

     Using the CALINE4 model in this project to calculate the volume of the exhaust

pollutant of automobile, according to the forecast made by computer, the forecast result

of the density of ambient air in Xinhua road of Urumqi city can be seen in tables from 2.3

         From the forecast result, the density of CO can meet the secondary standard of

 ambient air in the near future (2010) and in the middle stage (20 15), however, part of

 sensitive target will beyond the secondary standard of ambient air in the forward future

 (2020), and the highest density will exceed the standard value (4.0mg/m3) 1.168 times.

 The density of NO2 along the whole route will meet the standard in the near future (2010),

 in the middle stage (2015), the density of NOz along part of the route will meet the

 standard. In the future, except the far away dormitory residential district of Xinjiang TV

 University, in which the density of NO2can meet the standard, , the density of NO2 in all

 the other sensitive places will beyond the standard value. The highest density is 1.34

 times of the standard value. During the operation time, the density of NO2. CO can not

 meet the request of environment during the periods of middle stage and the forward

 future.

 2.3.4 The analysis of effect caused by sound environment in operation period

         The noise during the operation time are mainly from traffic noise which is mainly

 composed by mechanical noise ( mainly caused by engine) and the noise caused by the

 friction between the types and the road surface. The effect of intensity of noise to the

 sensitive spot is decided by some factors such as the traffic volume, the level of radiation

 rate, the constitution of vehicle type, the road surface, the linear of the routes, the

 environmental character along the two sides of the routes and the distance between the

 sensitive spots.

      Traffic noise in the scope along the central line of Xinhua road within 200 meters is

 forecasted in different years. According to the design plan for the cross-section of the

 road, the traffic noise in the scope along two sides of road in the condition that the width

 of road is 20 meters is valued. The forecasting result can be seen in table 2.3-9.

standard can implement the Class 4 of standard in the << Environmental noise standard

of Urban Area >> (GB3096-93). Other regions can implement the corresponding standard

in the <<Environmental Noise standard of Urban Area>> (GB3096-93). If not within the

distance, it should be controlled according to the functional area of Urumqi.

     This project includes 41 points for predicting and measuring the noise such as

hospital, school, kindergarten, residential area and so on. The area from the start point of

project to Unity Road is suitable for the Class One of the noise standard. Along it there

are 17 sensitive points within the 30m outside both sides of red lines of road. The region

from the TuanJie Road to the key point of road is suitable for Class 2 of the noise

standard. Along it, there are 24 sensitive points within the 45m outside both sides of red

lines of road.

     Due to the prediction and measurement of noise, the noise of every sensitive spot

surpasses the maximum value by the 4.68dB (A) at daytime and exceeds the maximum

value by the 16.72dBin the Class 4 area at night in 2020; It exceeds the maximum value

by the 10.58dBat day time and 18.41dBat night time in the Class 1area. It surdasses the

maximum value by the 10.58dBat daytime and 18.41dBat night. Therefore, trakic noise

pollution is severer. The measure to alleviate the pollution must be taken to coniol the

lead to the high occurrence of traffic accidents.

     In order to control the influential scope and extent of disastrous traffic accident and

alleviate the lost caused by the accident, the following points should be still noticed.

     (1) Establish the emergency command institution for traffic accident

     The institution consists of the road management department, fire and environmental

protection department etc. Its target is to command, lead and organize the emergency

team in charge of checking server accident potentiality and making the emergent plan.

     (2) Make emergency plan

     The plan contains the duties and tasks of command institution, emergency

technology and the choice of proceeding procedure, allocation and layout of equipments,

the guarantee and deployment of personal and physical resources, and mechanism of

dynamically monitoring accidents.

     (3) Allocate of emergent prevention equipments

      All kinds of the small-typed equipments for dealing with emergency should be

equipped including the emergent communication material, monitor equipment on the spot,

emergent rescue and infrastructure for eliminating the risk.

     The above measures should be implemented through the participation of the traffic

management, environmental protection and fire, police and highway management

departments and so on. The main charge should be undertaken by the operating company.

      (3)Requirement for landscape

      Design plan should be in good agreement with the landscape of urban area.

3.3.1.3 Acoustic environment

      (1)All pipelines of road are pre-buried according to design. Sewer line lies on the

west of road axis with the distance of 3m and water supply line lies at symmetrical

position. Sewage well cover lies on the west of road axis with the distance of 3m and well

cover of fire hydrant lies at symmetrical position. The well cover is made of colophony

combined material, which causes lower noise than traditional cast iron well cover with

same outside force. The well cover without noise reduction will generate excited noise

still when rolled by cars, which will affect sensitive positions along the road especially in

night.

      The suggestion is drawing trafic marking on the well covers in order to reduce

rolling frequency if the condition is permitted. Putting absorbing pad under the well

covers can avoid excited noise.

      (2)In order to decrease the impact of traffic noise AC-161 middle grain modification

bituminous concrete should be used in upper layer pavement and AC-3011 coarse grain

modification bituminous concrete in lower layer pavement. The pavement also should

have adequate evenness. Testing results of Traffic Research Institute of Xinjiang show

that this kind of reduction noise pavement may decrease 2-5db of the noise of single car.

     (3)Infrastructure

     Reconstruction headquarter should know the place of infrastructure and underground

pipelines before construction and carry out following measures in order to reduce

negative impact of residents along road.

     UTo avoid impact on important infrastructures such as means of communication and

underground pipelines in design of project. The angle of cross between road line and

reconstruction project should be as big as possible.                           ,

     UReconstruction headquarter should reinforce main traffic road or build the

connection between pavement and original road before construction of project.

Headquarter must rehab the severe damage of local road during construction immediately

or pay reparations to local highway administration for repairing.

     ODesign units should consult with power and telecommunication departments ahead

for reducing negative impact on power and telecommunication because of demolishing of

infrastructures. The power and telecommunication facilities cannot be demolished before

finding substitutes.

     UConstruction teams must construct according to the region defined by engineering

design strictly during excavating process especially for sensitive section.

     (4) Alleviation measures for traffic impact

     OEngineering contractor should consult with transportation and public security

departments for organization and leading of traffic at relevant intersections especially the

section with big traffic flow.

     OEngineering contractor should draw up traffic management planning during

construction and release the road line, time and place of traffic controlling or traffic

diversion ahead through media.

     UThe passageway of residents and units along the project cannot be blocked off.

There should be passageway, roadblock and caution sign to ensure normal life of

residents and working of units in the region of construction.

     (5) Time of construction

Mechanical execution generating strong noise at the section nearby residential area is

                                             45

forbidden from 22 to 8 o'clock. At the section nearby school, such as 32ndmunicipal

elementary school, 38Ih municipal secondary school, fifth municipal elementary school

and eleventh municipal secondary school, construction is forbidden during school time.

In order to reduce the time of noise impact on school construction is concehtrated on
                                                                                 I

path. Trench on two sides can be covered using transportable short covers. Caution mark

at night also should be installed, which practically achieves Be convenient, fabarable to
                                                              l1



people and do not harass the people".

     (2)Make suitable decoration to the isolation fence of construction site such as

through painting advertisement and picture to desalt its crude and rough feeling.^

     (3)Sweep and cleanse the construction site at regular time to keep clean and neat.
                                                                                    I

Reasonably arrange layout of each different working procedure to keep the cobstruction

location orderly.

3.3.2.3 Ambient air

     In the project construction process, the mainly duty is preventing pollufion from

construction dust. Measures for preventing pollution are suggested as follows.

     (1)Dust-failing of construction path

     The sensitive area along the path route is crowd therefore we should;take the

corresponding environmental protection measures to reduce the influence of dulston city

peoples during constructing process. The measure is spraying water promptly when

construction nearby the residential area with frequency of 2-3 timeslday
                                                                                      I
                                                                                      I

Construction units should spray water frequently on the path in and out of materials yard

and un-paving path for reducing the dust pollution. When roadbed is constdcted, we

should lamination compact promptly, and take attention to spray water for dust-Ailing.

     (2)Construction material

     The powdery material like cement should be canned or packed in bags, pdohibiting

bulk transportation and raising the dust and scattering on transportation way. The piled up

material should be covered with tarpaulin.

                                              46

     (3)Civilized construction

     Construction units should construct civilly and complete the maintenance of the

construction machines to reduce the discharging of air pollutant during construction.

3.3.2.4Sound environment

     According to the forecasting results of construction time noise we know the daytime

noise produced on outer ring road construction period surpasses the standard of " Noise

Standard of Construction field" (GB12523-90) 3        - 9dB (A). The noise at night all

surpasses the standard. Obviously the noise produced by construction will have certain

influence to 50 meters scopes nearby the construction location. To reduce the noise

influence on the environment, we suggest the construction unit should take following

measures to reduce its noise influence.

     (1) Select the low noise construction machines or equipments with sound insulation

and noise elimination

     (2) Arrange construction time and the construction location reasonably, reduce the

construction time as far as possible, and reduce the time influenced by construction noise.

Avoid the strong noise construction machinery being used in the identical region. To

individually construction location bring more serious influence, construction units must

adopt temporary sound insulation enclosure structure or sound insulation barrier.

     (3)Construct civilly and complete the maintenance of the electricity generation

machinery to reduce the discharging of noise during construction.

     (4) Strong noise construction machinery must be stopped at night (22:OO-8:OO).

     (5) Construction machinery operators and the scene constructors should control

work time reasonably according to the work health standard and be equipped with

protective measures like belt ear plug, hard helmet and so on by the construction.

     (6) The project construction should use the commodity concrete. Some construction

components should be prefabricated as far as possible in appropriate location and then be

transported to construction site for assembling.

3.3.2.5 Solid waste

     All kinds of solid wastes such as asphalt, pavement abandon spoil, construction trash

and living waste dug during construction should be handled respectively.

                                             47

     In order to reduce land occupation and save the project expense the spo,il and the

waste residue stone produced during construction should be used as far as pdssible for

project itself on the principle that adjust measures to local condition. The gravdl soil dug

out from the Xinhua road is good. The gravel soil is piled up in assigned)place for

backfilling roadbed. The units who need abandoned spoil also can cdntact the
                                                                                 I

exhaust after the completion of the road. At present our country is implementing the

strategy of automotive exhaust contamination control. The implementation of this

strategic will bring good function to contamination control of this project during service

stage.

     Automotive Exhaust Pollution Monitoring Center will be established by Urumqi

Environmental Protection Bureau in May 2007. On the occasion, automotive exhaust will

be tested by the Monitoring Center. When automotive exhaust meet standards, the vehicle

can be permitted to run on the road with green signs, or else the vehicle will be required

for rectification. Vehicles of other cities also proposed to adopt the same standards in

Urumqi.

     To further implement the newly published standard of automotive exhaust, the

annual evaluation increase the testing project of automotive exhaust after automotive

exhaust testing system completed at Automotive Exhaust Pollution Monitoring Center. In

other words, the vehicle can go on the annual evaluation after only vehicle exhaust

testing get qualified report. From management to strengthen governance for motor

vehicle exhaust pollution.

3.3.3.4 Sound environment

     At present, the traffic noise of Xinhua road region can not be reduced to the

corresponding region ambient noise standard (especially at night) under the Urumqi

economy, the technology and environmental condition. In order to reduce the noise

influence brought by this engineering construction to the minimum and achieve the goal

that will not synchronization cause the advancement of traffic noise during the

improvement of transportation condition, concrete measures to reduce the noise pollution

must be implemented during service stage as following.

     (1)Protective measures to receptor itself

The protection for objects of receiving the noise harm is mainly the first row of housing

building along the route which receives more serious noise harm. The independent sound

insulation comprehensive measures according to the actual situation are installing double

glazing sound insulation windows and the ventilate adjustment facilities and so on.

     a. Distance between the first row of buildings on both sides along path and the red

line should be bigger than 20 meters (used for greening or sidewalk). Distance between

permanent buildings and red line should be bigger than 50 meters.

     b. The first row of buildings on both sides of the path should be commercial

constructions which are insensitive to sound environment. Sensitive buildings such as

school, hospital and kindergarten must be apart from the red line > 200 meters, and some

centralized residential quarters must be apart from the red line > 100 meters.

     c. The buildings which are sensitive to vibrate (school and units using precision

instrument like performance test center and so on) will be apart from the red line > 40

meters.

     Reconstruction of Xinhua road may influence local environment and cause

economic loss. But it will improve environment and cause some environmental benefit

through carrying out environmental protection measures. The protection measures such as

greening works will reduce soil and water loss and resume environment. Greening and

slash restoration will beautify the environment, avoid dust and reduce noise. The

enhancement of environmental quality along the line will embody general benefit of the

project.



3.8 Public participation

     Environmental impact of Xinhua road reconstruction project directly related to the

vital interests of the masses of the enterprises and institutions along the project. Allow

citizens to understand the significance, building and potential environmental impact by

public participation and take the initiative to collect the recommendations and proposals

for the project from masses and units, we can seek better measures to reduce pollution.

Meanwhile, in order to timely collect relevant feedback from masses during road

construction and after the operation   road construction unit and EIA unit will provide

platform for public communication through telephone and e-mail.
