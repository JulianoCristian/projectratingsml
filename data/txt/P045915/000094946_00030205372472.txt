1. INTRODUCTION
This Environmental Action Plan (EAP) is prepared as part of the environmental assessment
documentation for the partially World Bank financed Urumqi Urban Transport Improvement Project
(UUTIP). As required bN the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and the \rorld Bank.
potential environmental impacts of the UUTIP are evaluated and corresponding mitigation measures
designed in the project Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. including impact and
mitigation for air quality, noise, vibration, soil and vegetation, landscape. water, sunshine obstruction.
socioeconomic impacts and relocation and resettlement. This EAP is intended to be a stand alone
document includinL all mitigation measures to be implemented during the project design. construction
and operation phases. The EAP provides the framework for the implementation ofmitigation measUres
and environmental management and monitoring during the construction and operation of the pro ect. It
provides details of all commitments made in the EIA Report and can be used as a reference docuLlielit
to ensure all environmental protection measures will be implemented.
1.1 Project Background
The UUTIP consists of five components:
-   Road network development
-   Traffic management and safety improvement
*   Public transit improvement
e   Environmental improvement
e   Urban transport management system and technical assistance
The main purpose of this project is to improve the existing road network, to miti-ate the traffic
congestion in the central area and anerial highway of the city and to develop public transport. The
project also allows for the opportunity to enhance the environmental conditions in the citN center
through long term environmental programs such as an Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy.
To determine the scope of EIA, the UUTIP may be divided into subproject with potential
ens ironmenial impacts and subproject with minor or no environmental impacts.
Suhprojects wit/i Adverse Potential Environment Impact (see Figure 1.1-1)
Three subprojects are considered to have potential environmental adverse impacts. They are:
Outer Ring Road (ORR). Road Network Improvement Subproject (RNIS), both of which are in the
Road Netsmork Development component, and a bus repair facility in the Public Transit Improvement
Component.
The ORR is the core of UUTIP and plays the most important role in the implementation of the
overall UUTIP. It is a successive high-grade urban expressway and urban trunk roads surrounding the
central urban area, that can smooth the urban traffic, distribute the transit traffic, optimize road nets or-k

in north-south direction and reduce the high traffic pressure on the road networks in the old urban area.
The ORR will have a total length of 31.25 km. including 8.88 km viaduct. 10.23 km groLund
expressAar. 10.59 km urban artery. 0.455 km tunnel. 1.09 km already built Qiantangjiang- Road
Flyover and Suzhou Road Flyover.
In the ORR. the existing roads will be widened from  16-50 m to 24-60 m. with 4-6 lanes for
motor vehicles. There will be 2 full-scale interchanges. 2 simple interchanges. I auxiliarn road
interchange. 5 flvovers. 11 ramps and 8 exits/entrances to the ground expressway. The designed
vehicle speed is 60-80 km'hr.
In the Road Network Improvement Subproject (RNIS). 0.6 km Heilongjiang Road (Nianziuou. -
Baoshan Road) wvill be reconstructed with 27 m in width and 4 lanes for motor vehicles and 1.2 km
Tuanjie Road (Tuanjie Road Intersection-Dawan Road Intersection) will be reconstructed with 29m in
v idth and 4 lanes for motor vehicles.
After the completion of the ORR and the road network improvement. an integrated municipal
road net" ork wvill take its shape. It will combine urban trunk roads, the outer radial roads and the
suburban ring roads into a "ring-radial road network" as planed in the municipal transport plan. It w ill
contribute to improvina the traffic conditions of the city center, promoting the development of the neu\
urban areas and increasing the development of the municipal economy and the quality of urban life
The bus repair facility will be built near Nanhu Road, with a capacity of 150 articulated buses per
year (corresponding to 220 standardized buses) and 450 employees. performing from Grades 1-4
compulsor\ bus maintenance. The facility will benefit bus performance, increasing travelling
efficienc\ and mitiuating environmental pollution by minimizing air emissions from buses
Subprojects wvithl Minor or No Adverse Environment Inpact
These subprojects include the proposed road maintenance (procurement of road maintenance
equipment and personnel training only and no engineering components), priority to public transport.
one-wa\ traffic. facilities for pedestrian, traffic management. improvement of road safety and existing
bus terminals. establishment of bus bays which will avoid occupying traffic lanes when buses stop.
dispatching system. systematic management of urban transport, technical assistance and training.
These subprojects will have little or no adverse environmental impacts. In fact, these subprojects
w,ill help establish good road maintenance practice and priority public transport. benefiting the public.
the urban economy. quality of life. traffic safety and the environmental improvement.
The EIA covers mainly the project components with potential environmental impacts.
1.2 Objectives
The primars objective of the EAP is to ensure that the mitigation measures designed during the
environmental assessment be implemented effectively. More specifically objectives of the EAP are:



E.AP - UL TIP                                                               N'o\embc:. 199)
Describe Site-specific Mitigation Measures
Appropriate site specific engineering and managerial mitigation measures have been designed b\
the EIA team. in cooperation with Project Execution Office (PEO) and Design Team for sensitive
receptors and the surroundina environment of the project area. These measures should be technicallk
effective and economicallK feasible. These measures will be provided to project designers in sufficient
detail to ensure they be incorporated in the project design or bid documents for contractors as
appropriate.
Providle a Stand Alone Document for Project Implementation
The EAP is one of the documents for the World Bank to appraise the project and provide a single
source of environmental information for contractors, inspectors and others associated with the pro.Ject
during construction and operation.
Identift Institutional Roles and Responsibilities
The roles and responsibilities of various institutions and regulatory agencies for environmental
management during project implementation are identified as well as proposed lines of communication
and reporting relationships.
Su,nmarize Environmental Monitoring Plan during Construction and Operation Phases
The EAP identifies requirements related to the environmental monitoring program.
Environmental monitoring will be undertaken during both the construction and operation phases to
ensure the effectiveness of mitigation measures. to respond to unanticipated environmental concerns at
an earlk stage and to determine the accuracy of impact predictions.
1.3 Roles and Responsibilities of Various Institutions
The institutions for UUTIP implementation and project environmental monitoring are divided
into decision-making organizations, supervising organizations and supporting organizations An

1.5 Overview of Environmental Impact
1.5.1 Air Quality
The proposed project will improve transportation efficiency in the urban center. Traffic vill mo\e
faster and there % ill be less congestion and iess queuing at intersections. It is predicted that, as a reStllt
of' const-uction of' the ORR. the average speed in the city center will increase to 21 .5 kim hr fronm the
current I .8 km 'hr. As the speed improves, the emissions from vehicles will decrease resulting in a net
impro-ement in the overall air quality. Within the corridor of the ORR. however, the traffic \' ill
increase and the quality of the air will deteriorate.
1.5-1.1 Existing EnX ironment
Based on air quality monitoring in October. 1998 (non-heating season) and Januar>. 1999
(heating season). the existing air quality in Urumqi is poor.
During non-heating season the air pollution mainly results from air-borne dust and motor vehicle
emnissions. The pollution attributes to TSP. NO,. SO, and lead is 31.40. 27.95. 14.99 and i.96∞o.
respectivel\. w ith TSP having the highest share. The rate of exceeding standard of TSP. NO, and SO.
is 100. 100 and 333o.3%  respectively. The maximum  is 1.47. 2.07 and 1.17 times over the standaidc .
respectix el.
During the heating season. the air pollution mainly resulted from coal combustion. The pollution
attribute to SO_. TSP. NO, CO and lead is 34.04, 22.12. 19.48, 15.07 and 2.01%. respectivelx. All
samples exceeded the standards, with the maximum up to 5.18. 2.32. 2.01 and 1.50 times over the
standards. respectivel\.
1.5.1.2 Predicted Air Quality Impact
In ! ear 2010. the concentration of NO/NO. will exceed the standard along the whole sections of
the proposed road. The maximum reading at roadside and 50 m from roadside will be 1.070/0.713 and
0.501 0.33.4 mg m' equivalent to 6.13/4.94 and 2.34/1.78 times over the standard. The maximum range
of e\ceedance is u ithin 300.240 m. respectively. CO and NMHC won't exceed the standard. vx ith the
maxint1utri readimn  at roadsides of 6.272 and 1.382 mg/in3. respectively. The increase of NMHC. CO
and NO, \n ith the project is 89.3. 78.6 and 109.7%, respectively, compared to those without the project.
In ! ear 2020. the emission of single motor vehicle will decrease due to the expected developtitent
of emission control technologies. However, the decrease in emissions will be limited because of the
increase in traffic volume. The maximum readings at roadside will be 0.904/0.603 mg/m. or 5.03 4.03
times higher than the standard for NO,/NO. 5.532 and 1.182 mg/in3 for CO and NMHC. respectivei\.
The increase of NMHC. CO and NO, with the project will be 98.9, 88.8 and 120.2%. respectivel\.
compared to those v. ithout the project.
The ai- pollution particularly NO, with the project will be much greater than without the project

1.5.1.3 Impact on the CitN Center
The operation of the project can mitigate the pollution emission of motor vehicles in the central
area of the cit%. because more traffic will be attracted to the project roads. Based on the prediction. in
the early operation of the project. the traffic volume in the central area of the cit xx ill decrease b\
more than 300.o. Meanwhile. the emission of CO. NMHC and NO,(NO.) will decrease bh  39.3. 3').0
and 28 6% . respectix el!. benefit the air qualitr of the city.
1.5.2 Noise
1.5.2.1 Existing Environment
Based on monitoring results, within the range of 30m from roadsides. 25% of the noise readings
exceeded the daytime noise standard and 75%/o exceeded night time standard. with the average
exceedance of 0.1-0.8 dB(A) and 2.6-10.2 dB(A) for day and night. respectively. The exceedance at
the environmentally sensitive receptors such as schools. hospitals and kindergartens was higher. xx ith
the averagle of 5.1-14.4 dB(A) in daytime and 2.8-16.1 dB(A) at night, respectively. The main
receptors of traffic noise along road and viaduct are 2d _ 3rd floors and 4th _ 5" floors. respectivel
1.5.2.2 Impact Prediction Along the Proposed Road
With the increase in traffic volume in predicting years, the acoustic environment along the ORR
ixill worsen. the exceedance of traffic noise in daytime and at night is predicted to be 1.8-5.5 dB(A)
and I 2.0- 1 5.8 dB(A). respectively.
In year 2000 to 2020. 100%  of predicted noise levels at sensitive receptors will exceed the
standard. the exceedina range in daytime will be 0.1-19.2 dB(A). with most over 10.5 dB(A) and the
maximum11 up to 23.8 dB(A) above the standard.
As xxell. the noise level of the first row of residential building along the ORR will also exceed the
standard.
1.5.2.3 The Traffic Noise Impact With/Without the Project
Based on the prediction. the traffic noise levels with the project will be higher than that without
the project. The increase of the noise level will vary with the different sections, ranging from 1.3-8.2
dB(A) in davtime and 2.1-9.0 dB(A) at night, respectively, along most sections of the road. Particularl.
the increase range xw ill be 17.9-29.2 dB(A) along the roadside of Liudaowan-Xinyi Road. which will
be a nevx alignment.
1.5.3 N'ibration
All the monitoring values along the proposed road were below the standard. The vibration impact

w, ith the project is heavier than that without the project. Based on the prediction, the vibration level can
meet the standard even after the project implementation. however. The vibration in construction x' ill
not sicinifcantrl  affect the environment if construction machines can be kept 30m  aw ax from  the
sensitive receotors
1.5.4 Sunshine
There will be impact of sunshine obstruction on the first floor of the residential buildings in toui
places along East Hongshan Road to Tivuguan Road. There will be no impact of sunshine obsiruction
on the other- road sections.
1.5.5 Surface Runoff (Snow)
On the basis of on-site sampling and testing. the discharge water of the proposed ORR basicall\
met Class 111 of Svnthetic Standard for Waste Water Discharge (GB8978-1996). However. COD
si2nificanil\ exceeded the standard with the maximum  1.73 times higher than the standard. The runoff
from  thie ORR  will not significantly affect the environment during the operation phase, however,
because it % ill be directed into the sewage treatment plant via the municipal storm sewer systein
1.5.6 Landscape and Ecology
The road videnin- will demolish trees and green spaces (totaling 115.119 m2) along the existing
road. Howvever, newly planted green separation media (29.66 km lona and 227.600 m' in total) \%ill
mihigate the impact. Besides. additional 212.780 m2 green area will be developed in Environment
Improvemilent Sub-project (Component Four). Thus, the newvly developed green space vwill be 440.380
m- in total. resultina a net increase in green area of 325.261 m2 and a better ecological environment
and scener\ for thie city.
1.5. Socio-economic Factors
A total of 144.609.9 m: floor area of buildings will be demolished, among which. 59.355.5m-
floor area  xn ill be residential buildings involvina in 871 householders and 3.580 persons. 85_254A rnm
floor area x% ill be non-residential buildinas involving in 835 institutional units and 5.495 staff. Besides.
100.7 Z11 (I  n7mu to a hectare) of cultivated land. 18.8 mu orchard and 78.5 mu of land for other use in
Lrunliqi Counrt  w ill be occupied. The total cost for demolition and resettlement is estimated to be
RN1B307.00 miillion. Further details on relocation and resettlement for the project are presented in the
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).

reconstruction and the other two thirds from buying commercial housing. The PEO promises that the
housing and traffic condition and the communit\ service will be better than existing. Based on this. the
living qualit\ of the resettled resident will be improved.
MedicalI Esablisl.0ents
There are six hospitals along the proposed road, among which. some temporar\ housing of
Jiangong Hospital and Bintuan Hospital along the existing road will be demolished. These hospitals
* ill be compensated in accordance with the RAP.
MairA er
The market at Suzhou Road will be moved 2 m backwards on the basis of the existing locatlon.
but the existing scale A ill not be changed. The remaining market will not be affected.
Mo.sque
Lanzhou Mosque at Yaojinjie intersection will be resettled toErdaowan, which is in a close
distance to Lanzhou Mosque and the rebuilding scale will be equal to that of the existing one to meet
their religious requirements. The new one will be in use prior to demolition of the existing one. The
other mosques near the road w ill not be affected adversely as pedestrians crossing structures to he built
ill provide convenience to Mosque goers.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION MEASURES
in order to mitigate the environmental pollution caused by the proposed project, it's necessar\ to
take appropriate measures. In order to mitigate the negative impact of the proposed project. the
relevant regulations stipulated in Order 253 of the State Council Environmental Manaeent:in
Regulations on Construction Projects will be implemented. Environmental protection facilities and
pollution control measures must be established or implemented simultaneously with the design.
construction and completion of the major projects. Based on the principles above, the corresponding
mitigation measures for different project implementation phases have been determined in the EIA-
report and are detailed herein.
2.1 Design Phase
2.1.1 Air quality (Bus Facility)
ï   In the feasibility report of Fifth Bus Repair Facility. the workshop for paint spra\ u ill be
relocated to northeast corner of the site to minimize the impact of exhausted aases on
residents located on southeast side of the Faciliti.
*   Coercive ventilation system and catalytic combustion process will be designed to treat the
emission gas from paint spray operations. The height of the emission stack of treated
exhaust will be over 1 5 m.
2.1.2 Noise
Configuration and construction materials
*   Limit construction of viaduct to the minimum. Surface road is the preferred solution and no
'iaduct will be constructed except where the capacity is still insufficient through road
N idening.
*    Construction material for road surface structure with effective sound absorption. or stone
matrix asphalt (SMA). will be applied to reduce the traffic noise.
*    Flexible supports. such as rubber plates and bowl shaped piers will be used for viaduct and
interchanges to buffer vibration of the structure and associated noise.
*    Larger structures and the application of flexible joints, as well as minimizing the number of
joints (crevices) will be used for viaduct and interchanges to reduce noise caused from
bumping vehicles.
*    In order to ensure traffic safety and minimize the traffic noise, green areas will be used to
separate motor vehicles. non-motor vehicies and sidewalks. According to experience in
other studies. green area of 3-6 m width can reduce the noise level by 1-2 dB(A).

*    The work in bus repair facility will be done inside workshops to reduce noise impact on the
surrounding environment.
Sound absorptiom barrier design
The location shape. material and height of sound barriers with roadside absorptixe lining is
designed depending on the sensitivity of roadside buildings, noise levels, road structure. resistance to
w ind and erosion. safety and urban landscape.
*'YY' shaped barrier is designed which will be built mainly along viaduct. In order to minimize
the sunshine obstruction by the barrier, transparent materials will be used for the barrier (transparenc%
D80%). The barrier will be easily assembled and disassembled for regular cleaning.
The sound absorption barrier is designed as a part of the whole project by designing team
entrusted b! the Project Office.
Protectioni of residential buildings and sensitive receptors adjacent to the road
For sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools and kindergartens. double-glazed windows s x ill
be installed in addition to sound absorption barrier. In order to ensure that the windows can be closed
during summer, air conditioners will also be provided to these sensitive receptors.
For other sensitive receptors. i.e., the first row of residential buildings. double-glazed w indow% s
ill be supplied in combination with a cooling ventilation system. The cooling ventilation system uses
a cooling agent and through forced air circulation can reduce the temperature in a typical residential
room in Urumqi by about 6-8 ∞C. While not as effective as an air conditioner, the cooling ventilation
system has the advantage of very low operating cost.
Figures 2.1.1-1. 2.1.1-2 and 2.1.1-3 and Tables 2.1.1-1 and 2.1.1-2 summarizes the noise
mitigation measures.
2.1.3 Vibration
*    Structures and materials effective for vibration mitigation will be used at the joints between
pre-fabricated structures and bridge piers. Application of flexible supports, such as rubbers
and bow l shaped supports for viaduct and interchange to buffer vibration of structure.
*    Road surface quality  has a direct impact on traffic vibration. The use of high quality
materials for surface smooth, regular maintenance and repairs will be required. The
roughness uwill be less than 4 mm.

Surface runloff
The design of storm swer system has been taken into account the overall design of the proiect.
The surface runoff from the project roads will be drained into the existing and newly built storm  se\ ei
s\stem both of which A ill lead to the city's municipal sewage treatment plant.
Oil contanmizated effluent
Bus \Nashina and other oil contaminated wastewater from the Fifth Bus Repair Facilit\ wN ill first
go into an oil removal tank to get rid of suspended oil and sedimentation sludge. It will then go to an
aeration tank to remove soluble oil and fine suspended particles and finally enter into water recclin.
tank through a filter. The effluent will be pumped back to workshop for recycle and re-use such as
vehicile and floor washing. Excessive effluent will be discharged into municipal sewer system after the
above treatment.
Battery cell washing water treatment process design
The battery cell washing and the waste liquid from the workshop at the Bus Repair Facility w ill
be recovered by electrol)zation and neutralization with alkali in a neutralization tank. It will then be
discharged to municipal sewer after meeting the pH standard.
2.1.5 Landscape and Ecology
Landscape Design
*   The shape of structures will be unified, harmonious and homogeneous so as to be blended
into the existing visual environment
*   The proportional relationship of various parts ofthe viaduct itselfwill be harmonized.
*    The alianment of the whole project roads will be smooth and harmonious. avoiding the
sudden change.
*    Within a certain range along the viaduct, add green areas, landscape and artistic flavors ion
the design.
*   Control the retaining walls for slopes to below 3.5 m.
*   Connect the ORR with the already finished interchanges smoothly and naturally.

Because all the contract sections can't be constructed simultaneouslk. much surplus earth and
stone x ill be generated. For the purpose of balance. the surplus earth and stone w\ill be kept
temporarilk which ma\ be used for other sections later. Erosion control measures w\ill be taken at the
tem porar% storage sites.
The surplus earthwork of WuChana Road - Jiujiawan Road section man not balance that ol
Beijnin_ Road - Alta\ Road section at the same time. the surplus earth will be stored at a designated
storage site in the northwest part of the city, and moved to Beijing Road - Altay Road section  lihei it
starts construction.
The excavation of South Rina is bigger than filling. and together with the Hongshan Tunnel.
surplus earthwork w ill be 149.542 mi This earth may meet the filling need at East Ring however.
Disposil oJfAbandoned Earth and Stone
Wkaste construction waste (excessive earth) from West Ring and South Ring (includingI Homnushan
tunnel) xo ill be disposed of in the emptN pits of Xishan Coal Mine. Those from Tuanjie Road-Yaoiinjie
will be disposed of in the big pits of Heijiashan and Erdaowan. Finally. excessive earth from the East
and North Ringswill bedisposed of in the empty pits ofLiudaowan and Qidaowan Coal Mine.
The location of the temporarv sites for both abandoned earth and stone and storing up is seen in
Figure 2.1.5-1. There are designated accessible roads to these sites. along which there is no
environmental sensitive receptor.
Mitigation for Soil Erosion
Retaining wall will be built on hills of both sides along the sections of deep excavation and high
filling such as Hongshan Tunnel, Xishan Flyover, Yaojinjie and Qidaowan Roads to prevent erosion
fiom rainfalls. In addition, surface runoff management will be designed for the tunnel to guarantee the
efficient drainage.
Greening
The greening range will be 50 m from surface road side and 60 m from bridge approaches. Trees
ill be planted along sidewalk while shrubs and lawn on separation media.
Accordinug to the project design. the total green area within the project red line area will be
2'7.600 m-. making up 15% of the total occupied land. The total greening area will be 29.66 krm. lI
addition. the greening plan in the Environmental Improvement Component (Component Four) will be
212.750 m- making up another 15%  for a total of 30%  of the total occupied area. The following
priniciples w ill be adopted for the greening plan:
*    In farmland section of West Guojing Road, the width of shade tree belt is at least 5 m with
more than three rows. to protect the farmland. Elm and poplar will be selected.
*    The w idth of the treed area along the sections in the urban area will be not more than 2 n .

Design of irrigation and Flood -Relief Canals.
Irrigation canals undemeath the ORR via culvert will be constructed before April 20 of the
construction year for meet the irrigation need. Similarlv flood-relief channels also via culverts under
the ORR wx ill be completed before August 25. In suburban section. the temporary roads for
construction uwould be designed so as to minimrize impacts on soil and vegetation.
2.1.6 Socio-economic Environment
An underground passage has been set up at the West Side of Changjiang Road. An L-shaped
underground passage is proposed to be built at the entrances of West Henan Road and Alta\ Road In
addition. 16 pedestrian overpasses are planned for along the ORR. Among them. Qingnian Road and
Hongshan Road pedestrian overpasses extend in all directions. Two pedestrian overpasses w ill be built
in Baoshan Road. Four pedestrian overpasses on western section of the ORR will have a slope of 1:1'
(designed based on standard for handicapped person). One overpass at Urumqi Passenger Train Station
wvill be built in accordance with requirements for handicapped. In other intersections and the sections

Rules for Environmental Noise Prevention and Control in Urumqi. The following mitigation measures
ill be entoiced.
*    The use of noise machtnery. such as percussion hammers. pneumatic drills and rock dr ills
during rest time (00:00-08:00 at night). is strictly prohibited. The detailed requirements are
provided in Standard for Noise at Boundaries of Construction Sites (GB 12523-90).
X    Machinery with low, noise and machinery with noise shielding and/or sound absorption
materials will be used as much as possible, e.g. on-site generator with muffler or silencer
* Contractors Aill rationalize work timetable, keep noise operations axsax from sensitixe
points. carr\ out regular maintenance and repairs, and enforce strict implementation ot'
operation procedures. In the seriously affected sites for construction. temporary enclosure
xa itli noise shielding and /or sound absorption will be built.
-    Steam and diesel pile drivers are prohibited for use in areas where sensitive acceptors are
vaithin 50 m from construction site (Table 2.1.1-1). The location of concrete mixers and
materials storage sites (must be applied for in advance) will be approved by reievant
departments of municipal govemment.
*    The construction components used for viaduct and interchange will be prefabricated and
transported to the construction sites.
*    If on-site monitoring result exceeds the standard, Xinjiang Environment Monitoring Center
'a ill report to PEO. and PEO will stop the construction for rectification.
*    If' construction activities during 00:00-8:00 cannot be avoided due to the requirement of' the
engineering schedule and site limitations. contractors must coordinate with PEO  to get
perinissions from  UEPB  and special placard will be erected to notice the public. The
enx ironmental personnel from PEO and/or the supervision engineers trained fol
environmental protection will inspect and monitor construction noise everv night at both the
sensitive receptors nearby and the construction sites where the construction activities are
taking place. If construction noise is much higher than the standard and the affected people
can not tolerate noise, patients, senior citizens and other vulnerable people will be
temporarilk relocated to places not affected by noise till the noisy activities are over.

discharged into municipal sewer system through public toilets on streets.
*    At construction sites where public toilets are not available. temporary toilets and fazilitm for
sewage collection will be available. from which the waste can be moved into municipal
sewage system or to cultivated land as fertilizer.
*    Clearance and restoration of the site for temporary facility will be carried out once the
construction is finished.
2.2.5 Landscape and Ecology
*    Ensure the irrigation and flood-relief canals will not be affected.
Strictly protect the existing vegetation and land for agricultural use. Construction vehicles
ill be driven on the designated temporary roads only.
*    In areas near cultivated land and orchard, dust-proof measures. e.g. the regular waterimn  at
construction site will be taken.
*    The abandoned and surplus earth and stone after the completion of construction section w ill
be collected at the designated sites only. The restoration of construction slash will be carried
out once the construction work is finished. In Yamalik hilly section. abandoned earth and
stone produced in tunnel works will be moved away from the construction site. forbidding
piling up on the slope.
*    Trees along the roads and cultivated land will be planted before ORR operation. The
greening in flyovers site will be finished within the first year after the completion of the
construction.

Existing Initiatives
At present. the air poilution in Urumqi is primarily due to the following factors: coal-smoke. alt-
borne dust and vehicle emissions. The pollution is very serious in winter. As a result the XiniianL
Environment Protection Agency (XEPA) and the Urumqi Environment Protection Bureau (UEPB)
jointly issued a report entitled Measures for Mitigating Air Pollution in Urumqi in Winter and
presented the Report of Combating Pollution from Vehicle Exhaust Emission by Adopting Srnthetic
Measures to the municipal govemment. The existing initiatives are:
*    Prepared and submitted report on Management of Mitigating Pollution from  V'ehicle
Exhaust Emission in Urumqi to the Municipal Govemment
*    Five types of products for controlling vehicle exhaust emission have been identified fioml
more than ten tvpes in the Xinjiang market on the basis of inspecting and monitoring the
performance. economy and energy conservation (see Table2.3.1-1).

(CNG. LPG and fuel oil), ten dual purpose gas stations (CNG and LPG) and twent% stations
specialized in LPG will have been built, with the total capacity of 0.72  10 8rn3 CNG and
Q.64 104t LPG.
Proposed Measures
A number of measures are proposed on the basis of the relevant laws and regulations. technical
support and management. They are:
Improvement of pertinent laws and reguiations and rigorous enforcement of standards
At present. the environmental pollution control standards applied in China correspond to those of
the middle 1 970's in Europe. It is necessary to improve the standards as soon as possible. In the 131 1
Project of Environment Protection deternined by Xinjiang Government. the first priorit\ is the control
of air pollution in Urumqi. As a result, Temporary Provisions of Coal-smoke Air Pollution Control in
Urumqi and Interim Procedures of Pollution Control for Vehicle Exhaust Emission drafted b! UEPB
are the tw o local laws and regulations as the basis of enforcement.
Supervisiont and Management
Formulate new regulations to test vehicle emissions and maintenance of in-use vehicles and
determine environment protection objectives for future years.
Enforcenteltt of Equipping Tail-Gas Purifier
In general. the decrease of pollutant emissions is 3-4 % and this increases by ten percent when
unleaded Lasoline is used.
Speed zilp the elimination of old vehicles
A greal number of vehicles currently in service were made in 1980's. Their energy consumption
and pollution emission index can not meet present standards. Therefore, it is necessary to ban vehicles
once their pollution emission can not meet the environmental standards.
Devote nzauoI- efforts to developing public transit
In comparison with private cars, public transit has advantages of higher efficiency of passenger

transport and lower resource use. Tramcar and subway have the advantages of greater capacit. higher
speed. efficienc\ and much less pollution. Tramcar should be considered in accordance weith land
utilization and traffic development in Urumqi in the future.
AccLlc'rl;-u higln   constrcion, strengthen road maintenance and improve its function7
The function of the existing road network in Urumqi is not perfect. The restriction and bottleneck
effect of north-south orientated road. broken road. lopsided and poorly located roads impedes traffic
and reduces vehicle speed. which consequently increases fuel consumption. resulting in the increase of
CO and NMHC emissions. The improvement of road network can increase the driving speed and
reduce emissions.
Traffic .s1a ten7 )management
A dri,in2 license system will be implemented in busy traffic areas. particularly in the central
urban area. to control and divert vehicles. The measures are composed of issuing special licenses.
parking fees, developing public transit. limiting the driving zones, time separation and vehicle type.
intersections management, separation of motorized and non-motorized vehicles, time allocation of'
traffic lights and intelligent traffic management.
Continlt,11 deC elop clean energy
Adjust the existing energv structure and replacing gasoline and diesel with clean energ! to
reduce pollution. Methane takes the majority of the composition of natural gas as well as propane.
prop\ lene and butane constitute the main proportion of LPG. The combustion of these fuels the
emission of tail-gas is much less than that of gasoline.
61e'nint ' P16117 of t7e ORR
According  to the general requirements of greening  associated with the Urumqi Traffic
Inipro\em en: Project. the ratio of green space will be at least 30 %, (44.038x 104m2).  The green belt
xv ill also beautif, the environment.
IMpOVe thIe In7specCion and Aaintenance (I./M) System for Tehicles
An institutional framework will be established to execute and supervise the system performance.
These institutions are:

Overview of Proposed MVECS
The control and mitigation of vehicle emissions is one of the essential measures for mitigatinv air
pollution associated with traffic. The control of vehicle emissions will require an integrated approach
and sufficient funding. With the help and support of World Bank. a Motor Vehicle Emission Control
Strateu\ is proposed. which will consist of three implementation stages based on Environment
Protectioni Objectives of Urumqi in 2010.
*   Stage I (from the present to 2002) By' the end of 1999. the emission system of all existinu
motor vehicles will have been tested, the motor vehicles without compliance will have been
upgraded to meet the existing emission standard. From 2002, more strict pollution control
measur-es v. ill be imposed based on the Program of Air Pollution Remediation in Uriimqi in
W'inter and the development of alternative fueied (gas) vehicles as well as higher emission
standards. Additional initiatives will include the following: ne\u motor vehicles must meet
the emission standard: existing motor vehicles must meet the new emission standards: the
regulation for the retirement of vehicles will be strictly enforced; priority of public transit
u ill be implemented: complete conversion to alternate fueled buses and taxi: establish the
research center of vehicle emission control: establish the automatic air quality monitoring
S! steri.
*   Stage 2 (2003-2005) Enhance the enforcement of supervision and control of vehicle
emissions: gradually increase the research center and the air quality ,monitoring system:
research and develop the technology and measures for emission control; gradually increase
the use of alternate fuel gas to other kinds of vehicles in addition to bus and taxi: develop
the public transit vehicles to larger size and higher-speeds and lower emissions.
*   Sta<ce 3 (2006-2010) Based on the requirements for improved air quality in Urumqi and the
proposed existing vehicle emission control measures, increase the utilization of alternate
fuels. test all motor vehicies with the I/M system; comprehensively research and develop
the technology and measure of emission control; develop the public transit system with
lous er pollution.
For the three stages above, measures related to alternate fuels will be funded by the Xinjiang

Government and the Municipalit. Stages I and 2 will be undertaken based on the loan from WB
Based on the proposed Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy. the implementation is described
further in the Component Four Feasibilit, Report. The PEO have committed to pro ide a draft terms. of
referenice and revised cost estimate for this component prior to Project Appraisal.
In summi-ar\. the MV\ECS will include and integrate the above measures and other measures to he
identified and de eloped to meet the goal of sustained air quality improvement. As inentioned Defore.
a more detailed TOR will be presented by Project Appraisal time. which will outline in detail this
mitioation measure.
2.3.2 Noise Reduction
*   The plan and objectives for motor vehicles noise control will be formulated by LEPB and
the standard for motor vehicle noise emission will be graduall  enhanced and entorced
(More in the Component Four Report).
*   A reoular noise inspection for motor vehicle will be established bl UEPB in cooperation
with traffic police. The vehicle with noise exceeding the standard will be requested to
r epaire (e.g. equipped w ith efficient siiencer) and it can be in use only when the noise meets
the standard. Vehicles with excessive noise after repair will be forced to be out of operalion
*   The driving speed will be strictly limited, particularly at night. Heavy-duty vehicles are
prohibited on elevated viaduct. Heavy-duty vehicles are only allowed on designated routes.
*   The pavement and noise barriers will be maintained regularly.
*   Proper planning and distribution of land use along the road.
=   The distance between the first row of buildings and the ORR red line must not be less than
20 m. New l\ developed and redeveloped areas must have vegetation buffers.
-   The first rows of buildinr along the ORR will not be assigned sensitive uses such as schools.
hospitals and kindergartens. Within 100 m of the red line the land may be assigned for
commercial facilities. parking lots and other insensitive uses.
*    In design of residential buildings. bathrooms. kitchens and elevators will be allocated to on
the side facing the road .
2.3.3 Vibration
The vibration N ill increase as the service life of the road goes on due to pavement damage in
various degrees. Besides. the vibration will be greater if changes occur in fleet composition e.g.. a
bigger proportion of heavy-and medium-duty vehicles and increase of driving speed. To meet the
vibration standard (GB 10070-88) in the operation phase, attention should be paid to the road structure
and traffic maina-emiient.
*    Heav\-dut\ vehicles are prohibited on elevated viaduct at night and furious driving on the
N hole ORR.
*   Land use sensitive to vibration, e.g. hospital and institution with precise instrument used.
ill not be permitted within 40m from both sides of the road.

2.3.4 Sunshine
*   Transparent noise-barriers will be used in sunshine sensitive sections so as not to obstruct
sunshine. Meanwhile, it is forbidden to use sun shading billboard.
*   The house owners of the first floors of the four buildings affected bN elevated viaduct \k ill
enio\ the preferential treatment of the municipality to convert the residences to commer-cil
uses and benefit from ii.
*   Reasonable and proper land use plan will be made to adjust zoning of affected buildings step
b\ step. For buildings, distance from the viaduct must be a minimum of 14.7 m.
2.3.5 Landscape and Ecology
Protect the existing vegetation. green land and cultivated land along the road. if possible. enlarge
the greening area, complete the greening in the separation belt of the ORR and around fl\o\ers.
guarantee the existing canals unimpeded.
2.3.6 Socio-economic Factors
Increase facilities such as overhead walkways, underground passages. zebra lines and traffic
signal lights for the safety and convenience to pedestrians. Along the ORR and at intersections \k ith
other roads. bus services wvill be available at the same time With the ORR operation.
2.3.7 Accidental Discharge
*   According to regulations related to the transport of dangerous goods. the license must be
obtained  from  transport administration. When transporting  explosives or dangerous
chiemicals. the carrier must get transport license from police.
*   The State Law of Environmental Protection stipulates that when accidents happen. the
responsible organization or possibly responsible organizations must take measures at once.
notifx the affected organization and residents, report to local environment department and
related departments and undertake an investigation.  Spill accidents of dangerous goods are
hanidled by police. municipal environment department and traffic management department.
Vehicles for transporting dangerous goods must be driven on designated roads only.

3. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
Environmental monitoring will be undertaken during both the construction and the operation
phase to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation measures. to determine the accurac\ of impact
predictioni and to respond to unanticipated environmental concems at an earls staige in order to adopt
appropriate remedial measures.
The purposes ofthe environmental monitoring plan are to:
*   Evaluate the effectiveness of mitigatiDn measures;
*   Respond in a timely manner to unanticipated environmental impact when the pro'ject is
under construction: and
*   Prov ide supporting information for formulating regulations and improving traffic
managsement and environmental controls, based on monitoring data.
Xinjiang Environmental Monitoring Center will undertake the compliance monitoring during
both the construction and operation. Environmental factors to be monitored will include air quality.
noise and vibration. In addition. impacts of the project on crops, orchard and woodland w~ ill be
monitored
As one of components in the Environmental Improvement Subproject (Component Four). an
automiiated monitoring network consisting of the monitoring substations. computer system and a
controllingt center will be established for the city of Urumqi. Parameters to be monitored will be traffic
condition factors. ambient air concentrations of various contaminants and meteorological conditions.
The establishment of the automated monitoring system  will assist the UEPB to understand the
dynamnics ofair quality in the city and the contribution ofvehicle emissions to the overall air pollution
In addition. the netAork will help improve traffic management. environmental management. policy
stren othening and public awareness. Therefore. the new automated monitoring stations can be utilized
for and strengthen the long term monitoring for the UUTIP. The data from the automated monitoring
s\stern mentioned above will be fully utilized for understanding the impact of the project and assisting
formulating further mitigation measures as needed.
The monitoring program described herein is project specific and more site related with regard to
the UUTIP. The results of this monitoring program, in conjunction with those from the city u ide
automated monitorina network will be used as an important tool for environmental management
du-inLI ULITIP implementation.
3.1 Construction Phase
The monitoring plan during construction phase consists of three components: compliance
monitoring,. env ironmental inspection and monitoring related to environmental incidents.

*    Year 2002:  air monitoring at location '2: noise' vibration monitoring at locations =1. I   and
=3 mentioned above.
*    Year 2003:  air monitoring at locations '3 and '4: noise and vibration monitoring at
locations=4. =5 and -6 mentioned above.
Sampling Frequenc l and Duration
The construction of each segment is divided into two stages: one, demolition. blasting. excavation.
grading and pile driving, and two. concrete mixing, structural erection and paving. The monitorin- at
each location is also divided into two sessions, each corresponding to one of the construction stages.
Each monitoring session will consist of three sampling events, aiming at the earl. middle and late
period of each stage. respectively. That is. six sampling events in total will occur at each specidc
location  \lhere construction is taking place. For each time of sampling event at each location. the
duration i, determined as follows:
*   Noise Leq (A): 24 hours
*    Vibration VLz,,:24 hours
-   TSP: at least 12 successive hours
*    CO. NM HC: 4 samples
The monitoring will be documented and submitted as annual report to the World Bank. XEPA
and lEPB.
3.1.2 En'ironmental Inspection
During the construction of each segment, two full time staff from the Environmental Protection
Team (EPT) attached to the PEO will carry out the routine monitoring.
Noise and vibration monitoring will be carried out using hand held meters at least 2-3 times a da}
or more frequently if deemed necessary (e.g. night time construction) in every construction constract
sections. Dust inspection will be undertaken by visual observation with the same frequency mentioned
above. Sampling locations will be at all construction sites throughout the construction period.
If monitoring results indicate that the activities are over the standards. the staffwill require the on
site super\ ision engineer and contractor to take effective mitigation measures to achieve the standards.
The monitoring results before and after the attainment of the standards will be documented by the PEO
and be incorporated into monitoring report submitted to UEPB.
