It will provide\n            financial assistance to about 130 SSIs, creating about 5,200\n            jobs at an average cost of about $11,000 at 1980 prices.\n            Bank funds amounting to $29.35 million, will be channeled to\n            sub-borrowers through commercial banks and the Economic\n            Development Bank of Tunisia (BDET). All subprojects will be\n            reviewed by the Investment Promotion Agency (API), and a\n            $650,000 technical assistance component is included in the\n            loan to help API perform this task. The main project risks\n            are inadequate subproject preparation, implementation and\n            management, and the commercial banks' reluctance to\n            lend to SSIs. Provisions made in the project are expected to\n            minimize these risks."}, "docdt": "1981-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
