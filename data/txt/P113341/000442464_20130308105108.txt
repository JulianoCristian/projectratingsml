            HEALTH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION QUALITY PROJECT

                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.       Following a request from the Government of Indonesia (GOI) dated 20 December 2012,
this is to request your approval of a Level II restructuring of the Health Professional Education
Quality Project (HPEQ) as follows: (i) expand the activities to include three additional
professions; (ii) reallocate the proceeds of the Loan; and (iii) update the reference to the
national regulation on procurement for the clarifications relating to National Competitive
Bidding Procedures.

2.     In addition, the target date in the result matrix is being modified to take into account
implementation delays. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are not affected by the
proposed changes. The government’s request is to cover the activities above (estimated cost at
US$4,786,194) will be done through a reallocation of loan proceeds across project components.


B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      HPEQ was declared effective on December 9, 2009. Achievement of PDO is rated
moderately unsatisfactory, and Implementation progress is rated moderately satisfactory. The
latest available financial audit report (for CY 2011) was received by the Bank in a timely
manner and without qualifications.

Project Development Objectives:

4.      Certain key performance indicators have not been achieved. The flux in the legal and
regulation context of higher education has hampered the establishment of the independent
bodies for accreditation (LAM PTKes) and competency testing (LPUK). By end 2012, the
establishment of these independent bodies was not completed as planned, which consequently
affected other key performance indicators, especially those related to implementation of
accreditation activities. During the Mid-Term Review the GOI confirmed its commitment to
prioritize and finalize the legal status for the establishment of the independent bodies. The
Central Project Coordinating Unit (CPCU) has taken measures to ensure involvement and
support from major stakeholders such as the National Accreditation Body and the Indonesia
Health Professional Council.

5.      As of end 2012, overall disbursement rate of the Project reached only 43.5% and behind
the target of 59%; this is due primarily to slow disbursements of the Financial Assistance
Package (FAP) grants. The CPCU has carried out a capacity assessment of FAP grantees and
has incorporated estimates of maximum capacity in the restructuring plan.

                                               1
Implementation Progress:

6.       The project has nevertheless made important progress as follows:

        Establishment of the Quality Assurance System for the education of doctors, dentists,
         midwives and nurses (the four initial professions), through the strengthening of school
         accreditation and graduate certification systems.
        Draft regulation for the establishment of an independent accreditation body for health
         professional education (Lembaga Akreditasi Mandiri or LAM-PTKes), standard
         competencies and education of the four professions, and accreditation instruments for
         the medical schools.
        Certification of graduates using a national competency based examination .
        Final draft of Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) / Ministry of Health (MOH)
         joint decree to legalize the establishment of an independent agency for developing
         national competency testing of health professionals (Lembaga Pengembangan Uji
         Kompetensi or LPUK).
        Examination blue print and the examination items for the four health professionals.
        The first national computer based examination (CBE) of doctors and dentists was
         conducted in 2010 and used nation-wide for the examination of medical and dental
         students prior to graduation.
        The trial for introducing Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) for medicine
         was completed in 2012, and OSCE will be implemented to accompany the CBE in
         2013.
        The examination blue print for the midwives and nurses is now available, and the
         examination trials (paper and computer based examinations) were successfully
         completed this year.

7.     The progress of FAPs to medical schools is equally satisfactory. The selection of
grantees and contract signing with 41 grantees were completed by December 2010 and the
grants program started implementation in 2011 as scheduled. The implementation of the FAP
provides valuable lessons in establishing partnership between weaker and stronger medical
schools to accelerate the attainment of accreditation standards in all medical schools in
Indonesia. Despite the above progress under implementation, the disbursement of FAP funds is
lagging behind.

8.     In addition, there have been delays in the procurement packages for the medical schools
under FAP financing, but the CPCU has taken the necessary measures to expedite the
procurement process.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

1. Expand the activities to include three additional professions

9.      The additional professions to be included in the project are for a pharmacist,
nutritionist, and public health specialist. The request will finance the system for quality

                                                2
assurance of the three professions, through capacity building of stakeholder commitment,
preparation of academic papers, formulating standards and accreditation instruments,
developing examination blue prints and other items, and piloting the system overall. In
addition, the government has requested the inclusion of Nusa Cendana University (UNDANA)
in East Nusa Tenggara, and Cendrawasih University (UNCEN) in Papua in the FAP scheme.
Both Universities were not successful in the FAP competition organized by the Directorate
General of Higher Education (DGHE MOEC) at the start of the project, however, due to the
strategic roles both Universities play in meeting the needs for basic health services in Eastern
Indonesia, the government has requested a specially designed scheme for providing FAP
financing to both Universities during the remainder of the project. Activities for the three new
professions will be included under Components 1 and 2 of the project, while the FAP for
UNCEN and UNDANA will be under Component 3.

10.    The result indicators will be modified to include the three new professions and the two
universities.

11.    The result matrix will now be revised to reflect the following:

a) Three additional professions (pharmacist, nutritionist, and public health specialist)
b) Two additional medical schools (UNCEN and UNDANA) who will receive FAP Grants

12.    The intermediate indicators will now reflect new dates:

(Refer to Annex 1)


                                               3
The above revisions refer to the Annex in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), and follow
agreements made with key stakeholders (example: OSCE will be implemented only for doctors
and dentists, and not for nurses and midwives).


2. Reallocations

13.     The following redistribution will be made from the loan proceeds under Parts 1, 2, and
3 to cover the above changes.

14.    By end 2012, disbursement rate for category 3 was 32.5% of the original allocation to
the 41 FAP recipients/grantees. Based on this, the addition of FAP financing for UNCEN and
UNDANA will amount to US$51,300,762 at project closing date.

3. Procurement

15.    Attachment 3 to Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement on the National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) Procedures will be revised to be in accordance to the NCB provisions as agreed
by the National Public Procurement Agency (Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/ Jasa
Pemerintah) for World Bank financed projects. The procurement plan will include changes to
accommodate the participation of UNCEN/UNDANA.

4. Financial management

16.    The revised FAP manual will accommodate the participation of UNCEN and
UNDANA in Component 3 of the Project. Participation of both Universities will be based on a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Director General of Higher Education and
the Rector of each university. The revised FAP manual and the MOU were submitted and
approved by the WB on December 15, 2012.

5. Institutional arrangements

17.     With the addition of the three professions outlined above, new stakeholders will
participate in project implementation. These are:

       Pharmacists: The Indonesian Pharmacist Association (IAI) and The Association for

2.      Project Implementation Progress: The project has made progress in a number of areas
such as the establishment of a Quality Assurance System for the education of doctors, dentists,
midwives and nurses (the four initial professions), through the strengthening of school
accreditation and graduate certification systems; establishment of draft regulation, improved
coordination, enactment of standard competencies, certification, clinical evaluation and testing.
However, there are delays in disbursements. However this should improve through the
strengthening of the procurement system.

3.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to take into account the three new professions
added to the project, and the full complement of activities that goes with those additions
regarding training, regulatory processes, competencies, evaluation and testing.
