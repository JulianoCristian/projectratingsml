                          There has been some progress in preparing the supporting regulations for the establishment of the independent bodies for accreditation and competency examination. The Ministry
                         of Education and Culture (MOEC) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) have finally signed the joint decree about the competency examination of students from health professional higher
                         education on 30 April 2013. Another important development is the signing of the MOEC and MOH joint decree clarifying the roles and responsibilities between the two ministries

                         regarding hospitals belonging to public universities, particularly the use of such hospitals for teaching, medical care and research, and on financial management. Three draft
                         ministerial regulations (Permen): the draft permen for accreditation, for higher education standards (SNPT) and for certificate of competencies (Serkom) are now ready for public
                         consultation prior to signing. The government has decided to call the independent body for accreditation as the Independent Accreditation Body for Health Study Programs
                         (Lembaga Akreditasi Mandiri Program Studi Kesehatan/LAMPS-Kes) to differentiate its function of conducting the accreditation of health higher education study programs, from that

                         of BAN PT (the National Agency for Accreditation of Higher Education Institutions) which conducts institutional accreditation for all higher education institutions.

                         There was a meeting on May 24 involving the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MOEC, the Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU) and the World Bank (WB) to discuss the fund
                         channeling mechanism to the independent bodies upon their establishment. The discussion concludes that based on existing government regulations, the financing mechanism is to
                         have a working/implementing unit (Satker) in MOEC acting as a fund holder for the activities of the independent bodies. The Satker will then transfer the funds to the independent
                         bodies based on a contract assignment (metode swakelola). Although this is the approach recommended by MOH, the disadvantages are (i) an increase in workload for the Satker,
                         and (ii) the risk of delayed activities by the independent bodies if budget availability at the Satker is delayed. Although the Project management will have further discussion with MOF
                         to address the concerns, it was agreed that funds will be available to support the first year operation of the independent bodies during this fiscal year (2013). The government will
                         conduct an assessment of financial independency and sustainability of the newly established independent bodies. The plan to pilot the business process of the independent bodies
                         later this year will provide important insight to this important aspect.

                         The release of MOEC budget was delayed by five months. Although the underlying issues are not related to HPEQ, it has negatively affected the project in a critical period of project
                         implementation. The delay will definitely influence project disbursement status, implementation progress and ultimately the achievement of project objectives. The budget was made
                         available on the first week of June. The CPCU will prepare a realistic assessment on project disbursement for this fiscal year taking the budget delay into account, and the
                         government has indicated that there will be another request for project restructuring
