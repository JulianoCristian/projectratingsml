                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The specific Project Development Objectives are to strengthen quality assurance policies governing the education of health professionals in Indonesia. This will be
                         achieved by: 1) rationalizing and assuring competency-focused accreditation of public and private health professional training institutions; 2) developing national
                         competency standards and testing procedures for certification and licensing of health professionals; and 3) building institutional capacity to employ results-based
                         grants for encouraging the use of accreditation and certification standards in the development of medical school quality.

                         functioning as a task force under the coordination of the HPEQ Central Project Coordination Unit (CPCU) since early in the project and will now function as an independent entity.

                         On the other hand, the establishment of the LAM-KES (Independent Accreditation Body for Health Disciplines) is still pending the completion of thee MOEC Ministerial Regulations
                         (for national standards of higher education, for quality assurance system of higher education isntitutions, and for accreditation). Despite delays in establishing LAM-KES, HPEQ has

                         been instrumental and successful in designing the new accreditation system for the various health disciplines bringing it closer to international practices, marked by the readiness of
                         all elements to support the new accreditation system including the accreditation instruments, the business process clarifying the roles of facilitators, assessors, validators, unit cost
                         estimates, and the feed back to the education system. During the December 2013 implementation review mission, it was agreed that BAN-PT (National Accreditation Agency for
                         Higher Education Institutions) will run the new accreditation system of health disciplines pending the establishment of LAM-KES. For this purpose BAN-PT will be collaborating with
                         the LAM-KES task force of the HPEQ CPCU.

                         MOEC will send a request for project restructuring to Bappenas and MOF to adjust the project key performance indicators related to the establishment of the independent
                         accreditation body. The last four year of project implementation has shown that legalizing the independent body required significant adjustments to the regulatory framework. This is
                         beyond the realm of the project and does not reflect the actual project contribution to reforming the accreditation system. The proposed new indicator will emphasize the actual
                         implementation of the new/specific accreditation system for health disciplines.

                         MTKI (Indonesia Health Workforce Council) with support from the LPUK-NAKES has successfully conducted the first national competency examination for nursing and midwifery in
                         October and November 2013. The passing score was around 40 percent and around a third of examination takers were successful. Although the percentages were low, the
                         examination has followed international practices with good examination reliability and validity indicators. The results not only provide a baseline but also valuable input for improving
                         the midwifery and nursing education systems. The competency examination for medicine and dentistry continued regularly. In 2013, OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation)
                         was added formally to the medicine and dentistry competency examination system. Students have to passed both the CBT (Computer Based Test), and OSCE to graduate. OSCE for
                         medicine has involved at least three external OSCE judges to strengthen the reliability and objectivity of the examination.

                         The progress of pharmacy, nutrition and public health (the three health disciplines joining the project post project midterm review), was hampered by the 6 month delay of MOEC
                         budget (DIPA) release. All disciplines did not meet the 2013 target of completion of instrument and assessor training for accreditation and of co mpetency examination blue prints.
                         Nevertheless, commitment remains high and the three disciplines were determined to achieve the target of accreditation and competency examination field testing by project closing

                         The DPT (Board of Higher Education) and the CPCU have recently completed a performance evaluation of the 41 medical schools involved in the HPEQ's FAP (Funding Allocation
                         Program). The indicators for each school were an index of program performance (school performance in the 6-7 FAP intervention areas) translated into percent and percent
                         disbursement. program performance is better in general compared to disbursement performance, and performance of private schools is better in general compared to that of public
                         schools.
