 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The specific Project Development Objectives are to strengthen quality assurance policies governing the education of health professionals in
 Indonesia. This will be achieved by: 1) rationalizing and assuring competency-focused accreditation of public and private health professional training
 institutions; 2) developing national competency standards and testing procedures for certification and licensing of health professionals; and 3)
 building institutional capacity to employ results-based grants for encouraging the use of accreditation and certification standards in the development
 of medical school quality.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project, which closes on December 31, 2014, has broadly met the project development objectives as measured by the achievement of the project
 intermedicate indicators and key performance indicators. The Ministry of National Education and Culture Decree No 291/P/2014, dated October 17,
 2014, acknowledged LAM-PTKES (Independent Accreditation Agency for Health Higher Education) as an independent entity authorized to conduct the
 accreditation of health higher education. At project closing, 168 schools completed the accreditation process using specifically designed instruments
 and accreditation process. LPUK-NAKES will continue to support professional associations and associations of higher education institutions. The
 Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission for the project is planned for February 2015

         Comments
         The status is yes for pharmacy and public health. Nutrition needs more time to clearly differentiate between the competencies of D3, D4
         and S1 level graduates. Readiness means the availability of standards of competencies, examination blue print, examination items, and
         item bank.

         closes as it still has to clarify the standards of competencies.

         See the breakdown percentages for medicine, dentistry, nursing and midwifery.
         The percentage for medicine is below target, but the passing score has increased from 58% at baseline to the current 66%. The result does
         not reflect the final examination (November 2014) as the examination committee is still processing the data.
         The percentage for nursing is also below target, but the passing score for registered nurse (ners) has increased from 44% to 46.7% and for
         bechelor nurse from 37.47% to 42.16%.

         Comments
         At midterm review, the target was reduced because of the delayed establishment of the LAM-PTKES. The new target is 42% from 69
         schools of medicine (29 schools), 42% from 24 schools of dentistry (10 schools), 10% from 516 schools of nursing (52 schools), and 10%
         from 324 schools of midwifery (33 schools). The total target is 124 schools. When LAM-PTKES started implementing the new accreditation
         system in 2014, the DG of Higher Education proposed 290 candidates schools as priorities for going through the accreditation process. By
         the time of the writing of this final ISR, from the proposed 290 schools, 32 schools withdrew from the process, 24 schools were still in the
         facilitation process, 66 schools were about to have the field visitation, and 168 schools have completed the accreditation process (which is
         above the target of 124 schools)

               PTKES is independently financing its operational costs.

               The higher education law (law 12/2012) and the medical practice law (law 20/2013), the health workforce law (Law 36/2014) and the
               nursing law (law 38/2014) are umbrella laws guiding the development of accreditation and certification policies. Three ministerial regulation
               from the Ministry of Education and Culture/MOEC (No 49/2014, No 50/2014, and No 67/2014) regulated the accreditation process. One
               ministerial regulation from MOEC (no 83/2013), and one joint Ministry of Health (MoH) and MOEC regulation supported the implementation
               of the national competency examination.
