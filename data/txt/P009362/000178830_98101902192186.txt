INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
RECONSTRUCTION IMPORTS PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the equivalent
of US$50 million on standard IDA terms, to help finance the foreign exchange
costs of imports required for the Government's reconstruction program.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        On December 16, 1971 the Government of Bangladesh assumed control
of the territory which formerly was East Pakistan. On August 17, 1972
Bangladesh became a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and IDA. An economic mission visited Bangladesh in July and August
1972. Its report, entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(Report Number SA-35a), was distributed to the Executive Directors on
October 13, 1972 (IDA/R72-230). A Country. Data Sheet is attached as
Annex II.
3.        Even under the best of circumstances the Government of Bangladesh
would have faced severe development problems. Its people are poor (per
capita income is US$50 - 70 and has not risen for two decades), overcrowded
(nearly 540 per square kilometer), and becoming more so (population growth
is about 3 percent per year), short-lived (life expectancy at birth is
well below 50 years), and largely illiterate (the literacy rate is below
20 percent). Although the land is fertile, there are few other natural
resources, and flooding and other climatic disasters are common.
4.        Two major disasters, the cyclone of November 1970 and the events
of March - December 1971, compounded these normal problems tremendously and
left the land in the worst economic state it has known in modern times.
Along the coastal areas the cyclone killed several hundred thousand people
and destroyed boats, roads, homes and power lines. The war spread further
disaster throughout the country. Millions of people who had been driven
from their homes had to be resettled and provided with relief; food was
needed to avert famine; a political, administrative and legal structure
had to be reconstituted; and the urgent task of reconstruction had to be
begun. In the agricultural sector, production of rice, jute and tea was
disrupted; villages were burned; draft animals, irrigation pumps, boats
and nets were destroyed or damaged; stocks of food, seed, fertilizer and
other inputs were depleted; and important agricultural development projects
were interrupted. The transportation and telecommunications systems were
seriously damaged. Some 300 railway bridges were damaged, linkages between



-2-
the various modes of transport were disrupted, and long distance communi-
cation was seriously curtailed by major demolitions at focal points in the
system. The industrial sector suffered some physical damage, but much more
.serious was the running down of stocks of raw materials and spare parts:
by July 1972, large and medium-scale industrial production had been restored
to only about 60 percent of the 1969/70 level.
5.        With independence Bangladesh faces the problems of adjusting to
a drastically altered set of economic relationships. West Pakistani supplies
and markets have been cut off. West Pakistani managers and entrepreneurs
have fled, contributing to the general disruption of production. These
developments may be partially offset by the reestablishment of normal
trading relationships with India, but it will take time for the economy to
adjust to these potential trade opportunities.
6.        The worl,d community responded generously to Bangladesh's crisis,
both bilaterally and through the UN. As of June 30, 1972 almost US$900
million in aid had been pledged to Bangladesh, including some US$178 million
channeled through the UN Relief Operation in Dacca (UNROD). During the
early months India'provided vitally needed emergency assistance. The UN
arranged for a high level assessment team led by Ambassador Erna Sailer, and
including 10 staff members of the Bank responsible for the critical trans-
portation, agriculture and telecommunications sectors, to identify relief
needs during the first 18 months. The Bank helped in these early stages
also by making staff members available on secondment to UNROD's New York
and Dacca offices. In addition to receiving contributions, UNROD acted as
a vehicle for coordinating other relief activities. Most importantly, UNROD
has analyzed foodgrain import requirements and coordinated their timely
arrival and distribution.
7.        At the request of the Government of Bangladeh, IBRD has reestablished
a resident office in Dacca which now has two professional staff members and
soon is expected to have four. Special Bank assistance has already been
requested to follow up the work done previously in the agriculture and water
sectors. The International Monetary Fund also has one'staff member in
residence in Dacca, and the possibilities of Bangladesh drawing on the Fund's
resources are under consideration.
8.        The economy of Bangladesh is still in the very early stages of
recovery from the severe shocks of 1970 and 1971. Although the most pressing
short term famine relief needs appear to have been met, it will be some time
before levels of production and income can be restored to those of 1969. An
encouraging start has been made; a reconstruction program has been formulated
and work on it begun, and a number of high priority development projects have
been resumed. The programs for 1972/73 are embodied in the First Annual Plan.
The Plan is frank about data limitations, reasonable in its targets and
pragmatic in its policy proposals. It concentrates on restoring the economy
to pre-war levels.' Work has begun on the preparation of a medium-term
plan, which will tackle broader questions of policy, and above all contribute
to the formulation and selection of new development projects.



-3-
9.        It is understandable that in the present very difficult situation,
the import needs of Bangladesh are far in excess of its capacity to finance
out of its own resources. Before independence, imports to Bangladesh, in-
cluding estimated imports from West Pakistan, were about US$600 million per
year and consisted almost exclusively of items essential for maintaining the
economy, implementing development projects and providing for minimum con-
sumption needs. Import requirements this year are at least US$300-350 million
higher than before independence, because of (i) the needs of physical re-
construction (about US$125 million); (ii) increased foodgrain requirements
(about US$125-150 million); and (iii) price increases (about US$50-60 million).
The minimum import requirement consistent with operating the economy at the
pre-independence level is thus not less than US$900 million, a figure that
makes no allowance for reconstituting seriously depleted stocks of maintenance
and consumer goods. Prudent policy would suggest that if additional foreign
exchange sources could be found, import restrictions should be loosened to
reduce the grave shortages of almost all imported items, and the attendant
high prices and political unrest.
10.       Starting at independence with no foreign exchange reserves,
Bangladesh had built up reserves equivalent to about US$150 million by
June 30, 1972, of which US$30 million must be used to meet short-term lia-
bilities. Bangladesh should, if possible, continue to build up its reserves
over the next year. The economy is unusually vulnerable to sudden changes
in its import requirements as a result of the vagaries of the weather. It
also faces uncertain prospects for its jute exports (nearly 90 percent of
the total). In the current year, however, jute exports have recovered well
and prices have been firm, largely as a consequence of the very great re-
duction in deliveries from Bangladesh during the time of the disturbances.
This will probably lead to export earnings of about US$400 million this year.
The remaining US$500 million required to finance minimum import needs will
have to be provided by aid, as will any additional amount to provide for
restocking of maintenance and consumer goods and for building up foreign
exchange reserves.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
11.       The Bank and the Association have made one loan and 19 development
credits totalling (net of cancellations) US$4.7 million and US$168.1 million
respectively, for projects located wholly within what was formerly East
Pakistan. Of these, the loan and seven of the credits have been fully
disbursed. The right of Pakistan to continue withdrawals under twelve
development credits was suspended on December 29, 1971 (SecM 71-60), and the
unwithdrawn amounts of these credits, totalling US$95.6 million, were can-
celled on September 29, 1972. Under ten loans and eight development credits
totalling about US$495 million for projects in both East and West Pakistan,
amounts presently outstanding total about US$257 million, part of which
will presumably be assumed by Bangladesh. Annex I contains a smmary state-
ment of the Bank loan and IDA credits for projects wholly located in Bangla-
desh. There are no IFC investments in Bangladesh.



- 4 -
12.       As a result of the events which started in March 1971, very little
development work was done on any of the unfinished projects, including Bank-
and IDA-financed projects. While consultants, contractors and suppliers
employed on the IDA-financed projects continued their activities for some
time, thereby incurring some expenditures, the processing of withdrawal
applications was delayed. As the result of the suspension of Pakistan's
right to make further withdrawals for expenditures for projects located in
the East, some project expenditures incurred in 1971 still remain unpaid
under most projects.
13.       Earlier this year the Government of Bangladesh decided that the
interrupted IDA-supported projects were of very high priority and work on
them should therefore be resumed as early as possible, subject to the avail-
ability of the necessary foreign exchange. At the same time, Bangladesh
applied for membership in the Bank Group and expected to receive renewed
IDA support for these projects in due course. While the membership applica-
tion was being processed, Sweden offered an interim credit of US$11 million
equivalent to Bangladesh to finance urgent expenditures incurred under these
projects after January 1, 1972, and a credit agreement between Bangladesh
and Sweden was signed on June 2, 1972. With financing assured through these
interim measures, activities under a number of the projects were in fact
resumed. A memorandum describing these arrangements was considered by the
Executive Directors on April 18, 1972 (R72-74). Meanwhile the Association
has begun reactivating the interrupted IDA-supported projects in Bangladesh:
the Second Chandpur Irrigation Project and the Coastal Area Rehabilitation
and Cyclone Protection Project were approved by the Executive Directors
on' October 3, 1972; and the Northwest Region Tubewells Project was approved
on October 24.
14.       Of past Bank and IDA lending in the East, about one-third went to
agriculture, about one-fourth each to transportation and industry, and the
remainder to education, urban water supply and telecommunications. By 1971
the Association had prepared a program for substantially increased support
by the Bank Group as well as by the other members of the Consortium for the
development of the agriculture and water sectors in the East wing, with
particular emphasis on the need to raise agricultural production. Much of
this work remains valid and modifications where necessary are being made.
While priorities may change, it is certain that a substantial portion of
lending in the next few years will have to go to agriculture with some
lending for transport, industry and telecommunications, and perhaps for
education and family planning. For the projects that are being identified
for IDA support in the fiscal years 1974 and 1975, it is clear that the
Government's own resources, together with the IDA funds likely to become
available, will be inadequate; it is hoped that bilateral donors will provide
joint or parallel financing in substantial amounts. In fiscal year 1973,
however, the urgent needs of reconstruction must take priority over the
initiation of new projects. Consequently I am submitting for your consideration
this reconstruction program credit to finance imports of items which are
urgently needed for the rehabilitation of the economy. Before the end of the
current fiscal year, however, I also expect to submit to you one or two
new development projects requiring some US$10 million of IDA financing.



PART III - THE PROJECT
The Case for Lending for a Reconstruction Imports Program
15.       To help finance the unusually large import requirements arising
from its reconstruction efforts (paragraph 9 above), the Government has
requested IDA to provide a credit for a reconstruction imports program. The
economic mission to Bangladesh in July and August discussed the proposed
program credit with the Government. It was agreed that the IDA credit in an
amount equivalent to US$50 million should be available for use primarily in
three major sectors -- agriculture, transport and communications, and
industry - with some assistance also for the construction and power sectors.
It was recognized that other sectors such as education and health were
also in need, but since assistance from other sources appeared to be more
readily available for these sectors, funds for them were not included in
the proposed credit. A project summary is presented in Annex III.
16.       Within the sectors selected, the items eligible for financing under
this credit fall into two major categories: (i) equipment and spare parts
to replace or repair capital goods destroyed or damaged during 1971, to
restore the economy's pre-war productive capacity; and (ii) materials,
components or intermediate goods needed as inputs to utilize existing pro-
ductive capacity fully and to regain the nation's pre-war levels of agricul-
tural and industrial production. With a few minor exceptions, the credit
will not create new capacity. The exceptions (shallow tubewells and low
lift pumps) are included because they afford the most efficient and rapid
path to restoring previous trends in foodgrain output, and to lowering food
import requirements. The proposed credit, then, would be a reconstruction
credit in the literal sense of the term.
17.       If orders could be placed towards the end of calendar year 1972,
about US$30 million of the proposed IDA program credit would be disbursed
during the course of the current fiscal year. This would supplement other
available aid and contribute to meeting Bangladesh's foreign exchange
requirements as, follows:
(US$ million)
Minimum import requirements (1972/73)            900
Anticipated export earnings                      400
Projected deficit                                500
Financing (estimated 1972/73 disbursements):
Bilateral project aid                        125
Bilateral commodity aid                      285
UNROD                                         25
IDA Project Aid                               20
IDA Program Credit                            30
Total Aid                              485
Gap  (deficit minus aid)                          15



- 6 -
These resources would not even cover the full US$900 million minimum import
requirement (paragraph 9 above), let alone provide the additional funds
desirable for restoring depleted stocks of maintenance and consumer goods
and for building up reserves (paragraph 10 above); however, they do not
include the proceeds of possible drawings on the IMF.
18.       Due to the difficulties in using tied bilateral aid, there is some
doubt whether it will be possible to disburse the intended amount of bilateral
commodity aid in 1972/73. In view of the very serious consequences of a
shortfall of commodity aid on production, the urgency of the IDA credit is
increased, not only in terms of its amount, but also due to the form in which
it is provided. It is essential to have the maximum reasonable flexibility in
coverage and disbursement procedures to permit the IDA credit to be used
to fill gaps in the,overall import program as they arise during the year.
Because of the need4for rapid disbursement and flexibility, new project aid
would not be an adequate instrument for meeting the essential import require-
ments of the economy, even if a substantial portion could be used for local
currency expenditures.
19.       The list of goods eligible for financing under the proposed credit
(Annex IV) is based on an assessment of total needs during fiscal
year 1973, the absorptive capacity of the economy, and the availability of
other external assistance. In order to provide the Government greater
flexibility in using both this credit and the rest of the international aid
package, the proposed credit is not divided into categories with precise
amounts of the credit allocated to each category. Instead,-a ceiling has
been set in each category beyond which the proceeds of the credit may not be
used without prior approval by the Association. The total value of all these
ceilings is more than three times the amount of the proposed credit, thereby
providing the government with wide scope in adjusting both to changing needs
and to alternative sources of aid. This flexibility will be particularly
helpful both because additional bilateral aid pledges are still being received
which may cover some of the items in the list of goods, and also because the
needs and absorptive capacity of the economy are constantly being reassessed
and may require rapid readjustments. However, the ceilings on imports of
cotton (US$5 million), cotton yarn (US$5 million), and construction materials
(cement and corrugated iron sheets, US$10 million), were set at levels well
below anticipated requirements both because it is hoped that the Government
will succeed in obtaining additional bilateral aid for such items and also
because the Association wishes to ensure that the limited funds of the credit
will be available for other vital needs as well.
20.       The proposed credit would not only provide the Government with
additional foreign resources, but also would complement the bilateral and
other multilateral aid activities. It will substantially increase the value
of tied bilateral aid by giving the Government flexibility to seek the best
prices on goods it plans to import. Tied bilateral aid could be concentrated
more on goods for which the donor countries have competitive prices, while
the IDA funds could be used in all member countries and Switzerland to get
the best possible price on other goods. Thus the IDA credit would form an
integral part of the entire international effort to help Bangladesh finance



-7-
requirements of essential items of machinery, spare parts, components, mater-
ials and agricultural inputs needed to restore production and income to
earlier levels. The proposed credit will focus on repairing or bringing
to full utilization existing productive capacity by financing, wherever
possible, imports of inputs rather than finished goods. This focus will
insure that the credit has the greatest impact in conserving foreign exchange,
providing employment and stimulating the whole economy.
Agriculture
21.       Agriculture provides more than 55 percent of Bangladesh's output
and 80 percent of its jobs, making it the most important sector in the
economy. The sharp drop in production, induced by the events of 1971, has
necessitated large scale foodgrain imports which must now be reduced
gradually by increased local production to conserve foreign exchange.
Fortunately, Bangladesh has a well prepared agricultural program, developed
with Bank assistance. The needs in the agricultural sector are thus well
established and the absorptive capacity in various areas is well known.
The strategy for immediate stimulation of agricultural production calls for
coordinated action on three major fronts -- fertilizer, pesticides, and
irrigation -- to promote the spread of new yield-increasing technology.
Items in these three fields dominate the attached list of goods for the
agricultural sector. In addition the list includes such supporting goods
as spare parts and fuel trucks to distribute fuel to pump users, and
specialized items for the fish and tea industries. The total list takes
into account the relatively large contributions in this field expected
from other aid agencies.
22.       With short term needs for improved seed varieties largely met
by other donors, it has become crucial that sufficient fertilizer supplies
be made available at the right time. Late arrivals of fertilizer are
largely responsible for shortfalls in foodgrain production this year and
the consequent high level of foodgrain import requirements. Demand for
fertilizer remained surprisingly strong during 1971, seriously depleting
available stocks. Local production has not yet fully recovered and even
at normal levels it cannot meet total demand, especially for phosphatic
(TSP) and potassic (MP) fertilizers which depend on imports. Consequently,
substantial quantities of finished fertilizer will be required.
23.       As new varieties are spread, plant protection efforts must be
increased. Imported materials, equipment and components are required for
these efforts. Here also stocks are depleted and equipment has been
destroyed. Bilateral assistance is expected to meet much of the need in
this area, including the replacement of aerial spraying equipment, but one
important need. materials and components for the construction of hand
sprayers, remains unmet. Such sprayers, loaned by the Government's extension
service to trained farmers, are important for the efficient and safe use of
pesticides.
24.       The availability of adequate, timely and well controlled sources
of water is critical to insure that the use of the high yielding seeds leads
to increased output.   Small separate investment units such as low lift pumps



- 8 -
and shallow tubewell sets offer a rapid and flexible way to expand irrigation
and provide farmers with increased control over water resources, and con-
sequently these items are prominent in the list of goods. Unlike the deep
tubewells being provided under the existing IDA tubewell project, the low-
cost shallow tubewells are technically unsophisticated, and can be installed
and used easily with existing local administrative and technical skills.
The expansion of irrigation will provide an immediate stimulus to production
and in the longer run will be part of an integrated program including
improved drainage and flood control. The low lift pumps will provide for
the more efficient use of available surface water essential for the
expansion of irrigated area for the boro crop. The tubewells will generally
serve those areas with adequate groundwater which are too distant from rivers
to use pumps.
25.       Fisheries hold an important position in the economy of Bangladesh
ranking second only to the rest of agriculture as an economic activity and
providing substantial employment. Before the war, fish provided some 80
percent of the per capita intake of animal protein. Many boats were lost in
the 1970 cyclone and many more were destroyed when Hindu fishermen fled to
India during 1971. Most of these men own no land and are now unemployed.
Fishing catches have fallen, with harmful consequences for the average
Bengali's diet and for fish exports. Yet as trade links with India are
developed, fish could become an important export. The Government has begun
a major program to rehabilitate and reequip the fishing fleet and has requested
that nylon twine, critically needed for weaving fishing nets, and polyvinyl
chloride resin, needed in boat construction, be included in the list of goods.
The Government plans to distribute the twine through cooperative groups to
fishermen and their families who would then weave the nets, thereby providing
employment and reequipping the fleet at the same time. Administrative
arrangements for the credit (paragraph 41 below) will ensure that there will be
no duplication of financing for the nylon twine being provided under the
cyclone credit to meet the special needs arising from the cyclone.
26.       The tea industry, an important source of employment, was
especially hard hit by the events of' 1971. Many estate managers and tea
laborers were forced to flee, leaving most estates unattended. During the
war there was severe damage to one-third of the tea factories, and loss of
supplies and transport vehicles. In addition, the loss of traditional
markets for tea in West Pakistan has created a need to develop new markets.
The Government realizes that in the long run it will be necessary to improve
the quality of the tea and lower the cost of producing it. The immediate
need, however, is to develop new markets and bring the already large fixed
investments in the tea estates back into production quickly, thereby providing
employment for the tea estate workers. The vehicles and factory machinery
included in the list of goods will help meet this immediate need. By speeding
the arrival of tea in the factories, the vehicles will also contribute to the
longer run objective of quality improvement.
Transport and Telecommunications
27.       Of all sectors, transport and telecommunications suffered the
heaviest physical damage during the war. Damage to the transportation



- 9 -
sector caused the most important bottleneck to distribution of emergency
food supplies and also impeded the recovery of other sectors of the economy.
The complex interconnection imposed by the geography of Bangladesh between
sea ports, railways, roads and inland waterways was seriously disrupted.
Seaport operations have been curtailed by mines and sunken ships. Railways
and highways have been fragmented by heavy damage to the principal bridges
over the Meghna and Ganges rivers, the sinking of many vehicle ferries and
destruction of vehicles. Inland waterway capacity has been reduced by the
loss and destruction of many larger craft and the depletion of spare parts,
although large numbers of UNROD-chartered vessels have temporarily alle-
viated this problem.
28.       A comprehensive transport coordination plan is urgently needed,
particularly to take into account Bangladesh's new relationship to India.
The Economist Intelligence Unit, with financing from the U.K. Government,
has revived a transport study begun before the war, and consequently it
may be advisable to defer major new investments in the sector until the
survey report and recommendations are available. Meanwhile, there are a
number of clear and urgent reconstruction needs to be met. Although the
transportation sector has benefitted more than other sectors from bilateral
aid, serious gaps remain which the proposed IDA program credit is designed
to fill. In meeting these needs, emphasis will be placed primarily on
imports of parts and components for local assembly and manufacture rather
than on finished goods.
29.       In road transport vehicle losses were particularly heavy.   Some
2,500 buses, 5-6,000 trucks and thousands of passenger cars were destroyed
or badly damaged in 1971. To meet these requirements the list of goods
includes truck and bus components for local assembly. In addition, supplies
of spare parts urgently needed to repair many serviceable vehicles are also
included in the list.
30.       The inability of the damaged rail and road systems to cope fully
with the massive distribution requirements has led to greater reliance
on water transportation and renewed recognition of the importance of this
mode of transportation in Bangladesh. UNROD in particular has provided
large amounts of support and investment for water transportation, including
many chartered vessels. The longer term water transport situation has not
yet been thoroughly investigated, however, and investments in major items
should be deferred pending further study. Consequently in selecting water
transport items for the list of goods, emphasis was placed on some smaller
but vitally needed craft and those supplies and spare parts which are
needed to bring damaged craft back into use.
31.       The long range telecommunication system suffered heavy damage
both from major demolitions at focal points in the system and from many
cuts in the open wire network. The list of goods for telecommunications
includes items needed to repair the old system which have not been provided
by bilateral aid (particularly cable, wire, line plant materials, radio
equipment and box exchanges) and a few items for high-priority development
work.



- 10 -
Industry
32.       Bangladesh's industries are few but they produce items critically
needed both for exports (e.g. jute) and for home consumption (textiles and
clothing). The industrial sector suffered some physical damage during the
war, but the main problem is the shortage of spare parts and raw materials.
Stocks of all imported items have been seriously run down. In addition,
industry suffered from the loss of some skilled managers to West Pakistan,
and from the effects of damage to the transportation and power systems.
33.       By June 1972, large and medium scale industrial production had
recovered to only about 60 percent of pre-war levels. While the jute
industry has recovered well, reaching about 85 percent of former production
levels, such important industries as sugar, cement, cotton, paper and board,
steel, and engineering, are producing at less than 50 percent of capacity.
Small scale industries appear to have been more resilient, but since they also
are hindered by severe shortages, the proposed credit provides for the import
of spare parts and raw materials for small scale industries.
34.       The provision of adequate amounts of spare parts, materials, and
components can go a long way towards reviving production and providing
employment for the labor force, especially in those industries where demand
is strong. Consequently', the list of imports for the industrial sector
includes relatively large amounts of spares and materials for the jute and
textile industries. One of the largest allocations is for raw cotton and
cotton yarn which were traditionally imported from West Pakistan. Now new
supplies of the proper quality'need to be found. These cotton supplies will
increase the availability and lower the price of locally produced cloth,
and also will put several hundred thousand currently unemployed handloom
workers back to work.
Power
35.       Although damage to major physical facilities was not too heavy,
the power system was seriously disrupted by the events of 1971. During that
year energy generation dropped to half of the 1970 level, primarily due to
the disruption of linkages in the system (some 100 towers were destroyed)
and the destruction or depletion of spare parts. Bilateral aid will meet
the requirement for major repairs and replacements. The items included for
possible financing under the IDA credit would provide for spares required to
repair damaged equipment and to replace stores depleted or destroyed during
the war.
Construction
36.       Many houses and other buildings were destroyed during 1971, making
many homeless and placing severe strains on already inadequate supplies of
construction materials. The list of goods includes provision for cement
and corrugated iron sheets, up to a total value of US$10 million, the latter
to be used primarily for the construction and repair of low-cost housing.



Administrative Arrangements
37.       The bulk of the imports to be financed under this credit, including
some of the goods to be used by the private sector, will be imported through
Government agencies. Normal Government procurement procedures require inter-
national competitive bidding or at least requesting offers from a minimum of
three international suppliers. These procedures will be followed for all
government procurement under the credit except in special cases in which
proprietary items, compatible spares and components, or delivery on an
emergency basis are required.
38.       Direct private sector imports (comprising perhaps 20 percent of
the total) will be made through normal commercial channels. For goods
in this category costing more than US$100,000 it is proposed to require bids
from at least three international suppliers.
39.       For all items costing less than US$100,000, the Government will first
make payment to suppliers from its own foreign exchange resources, and then
will be reimbursed by the Association. For items in excess of US$100,000,
letters of credit, guaranteed by the Association under its normal disburse-
ment procedures, will be used. In some instances, payment may be made by the
Association directly to suppliers.
40.       The Bangladesh Bank would be responsible for obtaining reimbursement
from IDA and will arrange with designated banks to obtain the necessary
shipping documents. The Bangladesh Bank would also assure, and certify, in
each case that the goods have been supplied by IBRD member countries or
Switzerland and that they have not been previously financed by any bilateral
or other multilateral source. These documents would then be forwarded by the
Bangladesh Bank to the Association in support of withdrawal applications.
All items included in the list of goods and paid for after the date of the
credit would be eligible for financing under the Credit. It is expected that
all contracts under this credit would be placed by June 1973 and that the
bulk of disbursements, excluding a few items made to order, will be made
within 18 months of the date of the credit. The credit should be fully
disbursed within 21 months, i.e. by August 1974.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft De-elopment Credit Agreement between the Association and
the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.



- 12 -
42.       Under Section 7.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement, the
Association would be entitled to suspend further disbursement if, after
reviewing with the Government the progress being made in Implementing its
reconstruction program, the Association determines that the purpose of the
credit is not likely to be achieved.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
