The components call for: 1) implementation\n            of a periodic road maintenance, and improvement program.\n            Specific subprojects will implement road improvements, and\n            replace bridges, based on an economic analysis for\n            integrated road management systems; 2) identification of\n            accident black-spot locations, development, and\n            implementation of accident mitigation measures on priority\n            locations, followed by investigation, and monitoring\n            measures to ensure traffic safety; 3) consulting services to\n            support project implementation, as well as provision of\n            funds to meet incremental operating costs, and equipment\n            required for project implementation; and, 4) technical\n            assistance, and training provision, to support the road\n            sector requirements, with an emphasis on facilitating the\n            ongoing decentralization process."}, "docdt": "2001-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
