outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: Designing and phasing projects to respond to\n            political and technical realities leads to better\n            implementation progress. Implementing activities with\n            multi-agency responsibility needs clear agreement on\n            responsibilities and very explicit implementing\n            arrangements, without which road safety activities remain a\n            challenge. Working with governments to bring about\n            institutional changes is a challenge and is likely to fail\n            unless there is clear Government commitment and there is\n            involvement from all Government ministries not just the\n            implementing ministry. Empowering independent consultants is\n            necessary if they are to carry out their responsibilities\n            for supervision of the technical aspect of works."}, "docdt": "2006-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
