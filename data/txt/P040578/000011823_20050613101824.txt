PREFACE
This report is an English language summary of Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) Study that was prepared in Bahasa Indonesia for the Batu Klotok-Dawan-
Kusamba Road and Bridge Subproject. This subproject, generally referred to as the
Tohpati - Kusamba Road Subproject, has been classified as a World Bank
Environmental Category A type subproject for proposed implementation under the
World Bank-funded Eastern Indonesia Region Transport Project Phase 1 (EIRTP-1;
IBRD Loan 4643 - IND; loan period: January 2002 - June 2006). This EIA study
represents a collaborative effort between the Faculty of Engineering, Udayana
University (Bali) and the Public Works Department of Bali Province.
The Tohpati - Kusamba Road forms the 4.1 km long eastern segment of a 26 km long
arterial bypass road which has been planned since 1991 / 1992 to reduce travel
distances along Bali's East Coast and divert through-traffic away from highly populated
and congested existing alternative routes. The connecting sections of the Bypass were
constructed in 2000 / 2002 under the World Bank-funded Bali Urban Improvement
Project (BUIP) as well as by Indonesian national budget.
This EIA Study was conducted to anticipate and minimize the negative impacts that
may result in the development of the road and also to identify problems in the
transportation, social and culture, economy and environmental aspects. This Executive
Summary report contains the following sections: Introduction, Predicted Significant
Environmental Impacts and Environmental Management Plan, with supporting
appendices. More detailed information is available in the complete EIA report written
and locally disclosed in Bahasa Indonesia as well as the related subproject documents
*            that were prepared and submitted to the World Bank and concerned local government
agencies in accordance with Indonesian and World Bank environmental and social
impact safeguard requirements, with guidance and reviews provided by the World
Bank's Jakarta office and EIRTP Review Missions.
In addition to the EIA, the following additional studies were conducted for the
proposed project and subject to reviews and approvals by concerned local agencies
and the World Bank:
I            .  Feasibility Study
. Tracer Study (for all project right-of-way areas that were previously acquired)
.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP); for the two remaining land
I               areas, totaling some 7,000 m2 to be acquired for project right-of-way (ROW)
.  Detailed Engineering Design (DED; to be completed in late January 2005), which
will provide the final designs and updated bill of quantities, including the needed
I               volume of fill materials for the Unda River Bridge approach embankment
. Social Impact Assessment (SIA; to be completed in mid-February 2005), for rice
paddy sharecroppers and Unda River sand quarry laborers who previously utilized
the acquired ROW   areas for which the actual land owners were already
compensated for in 2002.

Eastern I ndonesia Region Transport Project - I (El RTP- I)
CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
1.1        Background
3            Bali is the most popular tourism destination in Indonesia and represents a major
source of income to this country. Various services, facilities and infrastructure
developments are needed to support sustainable tourism and economic development.
This includes the provision of an adequate road network to facilitate land transport,
minimize traffic problems and encourage equitable economic development to
surrounding areas. It is hoped that completing the construction of Tohpati - Kusamba
Road (Figure 1) can directly improve public transport and reduce travel costs along
the East Coast of Bali and complete construction of this Bypass Road which was
originally planned in 1991 / 1992 and initiated in 1996 - 2002 under the World Bank-
3            funded Bali Urban Improvement Project (BUIP).
The improved access and reduced travel times along Bali's East Coast is expected to
provide important economic benefits as well as divert through-traffic away from
existing, longer routes which pass through more highly developed and populated
areas. The project aims to support Bali's economic development, which is largely based
upon tourism, agriculture and handicraft sectors.
Once completed, the Bypass Road is expected to divert an estimated 80 % of the
through-traffic that currently must pass through the Klungkung - Gianyar - Denpasar
areas, the existing 40 kilometer long alternative route. This proposed project is the last
segment of the 26 kilometer long Tohpati - Kusamba arterial bypass road.
I            The proposed project will pass through several villages, including Gelgel and Tangkas,
agricultural areas (irrigated rice paddies and dry fields) as well as providing a second
crossing of the Unda River where il!egal sand mining and quarry operations (referred
to as Class C, or "Galian C," material mining) have been prevalent for many years
|            1.2         Objectives of the Study
The objectives of the EIA study in the development plan of the Tohpati - Kusamba
|            arterial road, Batu Klotok - Kusamba section were to:
a. Identify needed environmental impact management and mitigation measures
for the project, particularly for any impacts that are described as significant
based on the results of the study.
b. Identify and describe existing environmental conditions in the project area that
could be impacled by the project.
3               c. Estimate the impacts and to evaluate any significant environmental impacts.
d. Minimize any negative impacts.

Eastern Indoniesia Region Tranisport Project - I (EIRTP-I)
The purposes of the EIA study were to:
a. Provide guidance in the   project's planning  and  design  to  minimize
environmental impacts.
b. Identify and avoid any sensitive areas that could be impacted by the project.
c. Provide an appropriate document as a basis to support project evaluation,
funding and implementation decisions, including World Bank Category A
safeguard requirements.
d. Integrate an environmental management plan into the proposed project plans
and implementation framework.
e. Stimulate community participation in project planning and evaluation cycle.
f. Document the perceptions and aspirations of the local community regarding the
project to improve project planning, design and implementation.
g. Provide guidance on needed environment management and monitoring
5                  measures and responsibilities.
This EIA study was conducted for the proposed two-way, two-lane asphalt road. The
|            width of each lane is 3.5 meters and the right-of-way (ROW) of the road is 40 meters
wide (and for the Unda River bridge 60 meters wide) to accomodate future widening
to four-lines due to projected traffic volumes. However, if future traffic volumes justify
wideing of the bypass to a two-way, four-lane road, such potential widening activities
will require further environment and social impact studies and are outside the scope of
g        ~~~the current project.
1.3        Environmental Regulations

e. Complete the East Coast bypass route that has been planned since 1991 / 1992
with construction of connecting links funded by the World Bank's Bali Urban
Improvement Project (BUIP) in 2001 / 2002 and national budgets allocations.
1.5        Methodology
Data collection includes primary and secondary data collection to identify existing
environmental and social conditions of the project site and surrounding area. Primary
data collection was conducted by performing direct site observations, household and
perception surveys, focus group discussions and public consultations. Secondary data
was collected from related literature and institutional report, including the previous EIA
and related studies completed for the entire bypass route in 2002 and approved by the
respective Indonesian agencies and the World Bank under BUIP.
The primary data collected consisted of physical, chemical, biological, socio-economic
and cultural data that were observed directly on-site. Identification of predicted
impacts was done by using interaction matrix based on guidance provided by the
Environmental Impact Management Agency (Bapedalda) of Bali Province. Impact
assessment methods applied during this EIA study were based on current national and
provincial laws and regulations listed in Section 1.3 and build on methods and work
completed in 2002 in preparing an EIA for the entire 26 kilometer Bypass under BUIP.
Additional guidance was provided by the World Bank's Jakarta office environmental
and social sector staff, EIRTP-1 World Bank Review Missions and environmental
specialists of the EIRTP-1 Core Team Consultants.
1.5.1      Public Consultation
The proposed bypass route has been planned since 1991. Extensive public
I            consultations were held between 1996 - 2002 under BUIP. The EIA study commenced
with public announcements in the local paper as well as to local communities,
institutions, government and non-government agencies (see appendices).
In accordance with a two-stage consultation requirements of a World Bank Category A
Type Project, several public presentations and consultations were conducted to review
I            both the EIA TOR and draft final EIA report, involving all concerned stakeholders,
including NGOs, community leaders, local environmental agencies, and other related
institutions. Suggestions and corrections were incorporated into the final TOR, study
*            process and report. A summary of public consultations is provided in the appendices
including notes on how each issue raised is being addressed within the EIA or other
*            related studies.
1.6        Proposed Project Activities
The activities proposed ir the construction of die Tohpati - Kusamba Road (Table 1)
include site preparation, sub-grade, sub-base, base and surface works (asphalt
pavement), bridge structural work as well as related facilities. For the bridges, the
*            upper structure can be reinforced or pre-stressed concrete or steel truss. For shorter
span bridges between 15 - 40 m long, it is proposed to use either Slab Bridge type or
Pre-stressed Girder Bridge type. It is recommended to use Reinforced Concrete or

The detailed design of the Unda River bridge and approach embankment will also
determine the actual need for river training works and embankment volumes. If
funded under EIRTP-1, the project's detailed design and bid documents, which detail
possible sources of materials, are subject to World Bank reviews and approval prior to
issuance of No Objection Letters (NOL) for bidding and contract award.

Remarks: (*) actual volumes will depend on selected final design.
*            As the area is relatively level, cut and fill activities will be minimal with the exception of
the construction of approach embankments for the Unda River Bridge. Spoil will be
used as fill or landscaped appropriately so as to minimize the creation of stagnant
ponds or siltation of surface water features. Spoil management will be carried out in
accordance with the Ministry of Public Works's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
|            for road projects (see Appendix H).
Additional fill required for the construction of the approach embankments will be
extracted from existing volcanic deposits in the Unda River (according to Standard
Operating Procedures for quarrying), so as to minimize negative impacts associated
with importing large volumes from other quarry sites. It is estimated that most of the
fill requirement for these embankments (80-90%), including 'common fill' and Class A
and B grades (for road surfacing and concreting), can be extracted from the Unda
River. No new quarries sites will be opened.
I            In order to avoid the possible disruption of existing irrigation systems and creating
ponds in northern (upstream) area of the road or near the proposed bridges, irrigation
channels have to be constructed in the form of siphons and box culverts that pass
under the road to keep the irrigation water flowing. The irrigation channel siphons also

The proposed Tohpati - Kusamba Road section will intersect with several existing local
roads. Increased traffic problems at these intersections may be experienced following
|            completion of the bypass and therefore proper traffic management will be needed.
There will be six intersections along the new road as follows:
.  Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 19 + 666), intersection between the proposed road
and the existing local road serving movement to Batu Klotok temple.
. Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 20 + 186), located in the middle of the rice field.
.  Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 20 + 786), located in the middle of the rice field.
*  Gelgel - Jumpai (Sta 21 + 486), intersection between the proposed road and
the existing local road serving movement to Jumpai village.
.  Gelgel - Jumpai (Sta 22 + 186), located close to the Pura Dalem Agung
Padharman Shri Nararya Kepakisan temple.
* Klungkung - Kusamba (Sta 23 + 776), intersection between the proposed road
and the existing Klungkung - Kusamba road, close to the Dawan T-junction.
Labor mobilization will ensure that maximum opportunities are given to local people, as
a means of minimizing social conflict. A base camp will be located in an area that is
likely to cause limited disruption to local people. The contractor's mobilization plan,
including siting of base camps and temporary access points for heavy equipment, will
be subject to approval by local government agencies in consultation with community
leaders.

|                                            CHAPTER II
SUMMARY OF PREDICTED
SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
2.1          Physical and Ecological Environment
Dominant existing land-uses in the project affected area are irrigated rice and sand
mining, the latter occurring only in the Unda river bed. Sand mining has been on-
going under informal management arrangements for the past 20 years. The district
administration has recently taken steps to halt this activity and to ensure that any
further extraction is carried out under controlled conditions.
There are no significant ecological features within the project area, the closest
important wetland area being Candi Dasa which is located more than 20 km to the
east. The river Unda itself was subject to catastrophic ecological change resulting
from ash flows associated with the 1963 volcanic eruption of Mount Agung.
The Unda river catchment area is 220.52 km2, equivalent to 3.91% of the total area of
the Island of Bali. The main channel of the river is 60 m wide at the proposed bridge
crossing, with river flow controlled by a series of weirs about 800 m upstream. The
predicted 100 year flood event at this point is 855 m3/s, well within the capacity of the
proposed bridge to withstand, assuming a velocity of approximately 5m/s.
Bali is comparatively dry in relation to Western Indonesia and Kalimantan, with total
annual precipitation of under 2000 mm at Dawan, most of which falls from November
to April usually peaking in February (315 mm).
2.2          Socio-Cultural Conditions
Five villages are immediately affected by the project, including Gelgel, Tangkas,
Gunaksa, Dawan and Kusamba with a total population of 30,582. The dominant
I            economic activity is rice farming (66%), organized according to traditional systems
('subak'). Additional employment is accounted for by small scale commercial activity
(23%) and government employment (6%), either as a primary or secondary source of
I            income. The community is wholly Balinese/Hindu organized according to a traditional
leadership structure comprising 'Bendesa Adat' (Head of Adat) and 'Lembaga Subak'
(Head of an Irrigation system).
A recent socio-economic study of the impacts of land acquisition on project affected
people' indicates that there has already been a discernable shift away from agriculture
I |          and the primary source of income, particularly among sharecroppers. This has tended
towards greater reliance on secondary income generating activities, yet, with no
discernable loss of income. Among landowners there has been a clear increase in
l |             income, resulting from re-investment of compensation money in other areas or the
payment of long-standing debts.

Eastern Indonesia Region Transport Project - I (EIRTP-1)
U            2.3        Summary of Predicted Impacts
Significant positive socio-economic and environmental benefits are expected from
completing the remaining 4.1 km section of this Bypass route, which has been planned
since 1991 / 1992. These predicted positive impacts include reduced travel distances
along Bali's East Coast and the resultant diversion of through-traffic from highly
populated and congested existing alternative routes.
Based on the Feasibility Study submitted for the project, an estimated 80 % of the
through-traffic currently utilizing this 40 kilometer long alternative route is predicted to
divert to the shorter, 26 kilometer Bypass route once it is completed. The existing
through-traffic that was estimated to divert to the completed Bypass is in the range of
660 passenger car units (PCUs) per hour. The calculated economic benefits of the
project are high, with an estimated Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 26 - 37 %.
*            Based on the EIA study, results of local consultations and study reviews involving the
World Bank's Jakarta office, several important impacts were identified and will need to
be managed as discussed in the following sections. These predicted impacts and
*            recommended mitigation and management measures build on the experience gained
to date following completion of the adjoining 19.6 km sections of the Bypass route,
largely funded by the World Bank under the BUP Project.
2.3.1.     Predicted Impacts during the Pre-Construction Stage
|               .  Various possible community mis-perceptions toward the objectives and benefits
of the project; the choice of road alignment; the design; the placement of
*                  bridges and water channels.
Potential social impacts of completing the remaining ROW land acquisition
activities in accordance with the Bank-approved LARAP and SIA. These
I                  activities will involve appropriate compensation for the remaining portions of
two property lots totaling some 7,000 m2 with the Unda River bed which were
used as a sand quarry area.
2.3.2.     Predicted Impacts during Construction Stage
|               .  Potential social impacts from the presence of any non-local workers and their
daily activities around the base camp.
|               .  Potential security problems caused by the presence of non-local workers.
*  Short-term increase of air pollution and noise caused by the operation of heavy
lI |equipments and asphalt mixing plant (AMP).
*  Irrigation channels damage or disrupted water flows leading to flooding caused
I                  by the road construction.
*               .  Diseases caused by any created stagnant water ponds.

of the bypass, balanced by decreases along the existing, more populated
alternative routes.
I            2.3.4.     Predicted Impacts outside of the Project Area
|  Potential lost of job opportunities for seasonal migrant workers in the Unda
River basin quarry (sand mining) area, as activity which has been repeatedly
banned by the local government. A separate SIA will be completed by February
2005 to assess these impacts in accordance with World Bank requests.
2.4        Summary of the Predicted Significant Impacts
I            The completion of the Bypass route with the 4.1 km long Tohpati - Kusamba Road
project is predicted to have significant positive environmental and socio-economic
benefits compared to a "no action" alternative. The predicted project benefits extend
*            beyond the immediate project area and include completion of road transport plans that
date to 1991 / 1992 to improve access to and economic development of the East and
North Coasts of Bali while diverting through traffic from the congested and highly
populated existing route through Gianyar and adjacent communities.
The results of the EIA study and conducted local consultations indicate that the
predicted negative impacts of the project are short-term in nature and will during the
construction stage, which is typical for such types of projects. This impact prediction is
supported by the lessons learned from completing the connecting sections of the
I
Bypass route under the Worid Banik-funded B'UIP and niational government budgets.
These impact predictions are also supported by a perception survey conducted for
I            some 120 directly affected community respondents, a summary of key results of which
is provided in Table 4. Based on these findings, environmental and social impact
management priorities need to be given to the construction stage of the project
without disregarding impacts at the other stages.

CHAPTER III
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
The environmental impacts of Tohpati - Kusamba Road project have been identified at
each stage of the project. The required environmental management activities to
3            mitigate these predicted impacts are described below.
3.1         Environmental Management during the Pre-Construction Stage
*            3.1.1.      Potential Community Misperceptions of the Project
Adequate information dissemination ("socialization") and community participation is
needed during the project implementation stages to avoid possible misperceptions of
the project or work schedules. Such a process of socialization and participation can
strengthen the community's project awareness and support.
In addition to local media and regular meetings, information on the project objectives
and benefits can also be given by placing information boards at strategic locations in
the project area (see appendices). Monitoring of such activities will be conducted
during implementation by observing and distributing questionnaires on the community
|            perceptions to the project.
3.1.2.      Social Impacts of Land Acquisition
I            The total ROW area required for Tohpati - Kusamba Road project is about 29 hectares
of rice fields and river bed quarry areas, which involves about 442 land owners or
claimants. All required project ROW areas, with the noted exception of some 7,000 m2
I            of river bed areas, were acquired in 2002 under BUIP. Compensation arrangements for
the remaining 7,000 m2 of needed ROW areas have been agreed and will be paid in
accordance with the LARAP prepared and submitted to the World Bank for approval.
The negative impact of acquiring this land for the road ROW may be the loss of
agricultural production from these areas and related loss of income of the land owners
I            and their "sharecropper" workers. The government's original compensation offer of Rp.
50,000 per m2 was refused by the land owners (year 2002 exchange rates were about
US$ 1 = Rp 9,000). Following further consultations, a compensation price of Rp
100,000 per m2 was agreed with community members and paid by the Klungkung local
government in 2002
I            Following World Bank Mission reviews in December 2004, it was agreed that a social
impact assessment (SIA) would be conducted by the project proponent (Udayana
University) focusing on displaced sharecroppers and sand quarry miners. This SIA will
I            be completed in mid-February 2005 and will support: preparation of a Remedial Action
Plan (RAP) to the Klungkung local government. All stakeholders, including concerned
local government agencies, will need to continue to work together to ensure project
success with minimal social impacts.

Eastern Inidonesia Region liansportProject- I(EIRTP-I)
3.2         Environmental Management during the Construction Stage
3.2.1.      Social Impact of the Presence of Non-local Workers
One of the key concerns of the community is the presence of non-local workers during
the construction stage of the project. Sensitive issues include security, socio-cultural
conflict, base camp location, and protection of temples. To overcome these potential
problems, the local government and community has to be involved during
construction, including review and approval of the contractor's proposed mobilization
plan and base camp site. If the contractor is new to Bali and the project area,
socialization of the local culture and concerns to the contractor and their non-local
workers will be required. Therefore, routine supervision of the behavior of the workers
will be required of the project and contractor.
The contractor has to provide a construction base camp with good sanitation and
environmental management throughout the construction period. The proposed base
camp should be located outside and away from any temples or holy areas (pura).
Information concerning the requirement of workers qualification for possible
employment on the project has to be given to community. This will be the
responsibility of the project proponent, supervised by the local government and
community leaders.
3.2.2.      Security Issues from the Presence of Non-local Workers
Security issues, such as crime, violence and cultural conflict, related to the presence of
any non-local workers have to be considered. To prevent the incidence of such security
issues, all construction workers will be required to register with the local government
and police.
3.2.3.      Environmental Impacts from Heavy Equipment Operations
During construction, current levels of noise and air pollution may increase from the
operation of heavy equipment and the asphalt mixing plant (AMP). These possible
sources of noise and air pollution need to be managed in accordance with local and
national standards, laws and regulations. Such construction noises can be reduced by
assuring that all equipment and machinery is properly maintained, mufflers are
functional and limiting use to regular daytime hours and when no religious ceremonies
are scheduled.  Related problems, such as increases in dust during construction
activities may disturb the local community. Regular watering of active construction
areas will be required, to be monitored by the project proponent and local
government.
3.2.4.      Maintenance of Irrigation Systems
Disruption of existing irrigation systems can result from clogging with debris as well as
cut and fill works. Any long-term disruption of irrigation systems can cause crop losses
to paddy rice and must be avoided. To provide sufficient water supply for the
irrigation, it is required to build proper new irrigation structures with siphons which
pass under the road or with permanent substitution channel. Siphons need to be
complemented with screening and clean-out facilities. This management is the

3             3.2.5.       Risks Associated with blockage of drainage and Ponding
Any stagnant water or ponds that are created during construction may present new
|             health hazards. Therefore, the presence of water ponding or blockage of drainage
during the construction stage has to be avoided and corrected. This will require a
combination of design and management measures including filling in or landscaping of
3             borrow pits, back-filling of excavations in the Unda River due to sand and gravel
extraction, maintenance of existing surface water flows and effective management of
spoil generated from cut and fill activities.
*             The management and monitoring of such potential problems will be the responsibility
of the project proponent and local government agencies.
3             3.2.6        Flooding
The elevation of the road above surrounding agricultural land, specifically from Batu
*             Klotok to the Unda River2, will act as a barrier to the movement of floodwater as well
as generate stormwater run-off which will require effective channeling to avoid soil
erosion, clogging of channels and further flooding. These potential impacts will be
mitigated via appropriate engineering design measures including use of pipes and box
culverts (36 in total).
I             3.2.7.       Potential Traffic Problems and Pavement Damage
Construction traffic impacts may result during site clearing, construction of access
roads to the project, cut and fill works, hauling of materials and paving of roads.
Increased traffic problems may occur during construction, particularly at existing
intersections and during the temple ceremonies that are held some three times a year.
*             These potential traffic impacts can be avoided by appropriate sourcing of materials,
providing alternative access roads and proper traffic management and public safety
measures, including:
a. Informing the community about proposed project schedules and activities through
|                local community heads and leaders of the two religious temples.
b. Preparing alternative access roads and detours
*             c. Giving priority to completing the work at intersections quickly.
d. Postponing work and diverting construction traffic away from the two temple areas,
nearby intersections and access roads during periods of religious ceremonies. Close
I                project coordination will need to be established and maintained with the leaders of
these temples.
e. Limiting the loads of heavy vehicles using local roads in accordance with local
regulations and officiais to avoid pavement damage, including extraction ot most of
the required fill material from volcanic deposits in the Unda river.
|             f. Quickly repairing any pavement damage that may occur on local roads that may be
caused by heavy vehicles during construction.

g. Locating the contractors' base camp away from busy roads, intersections and
temples. The site of the base camp will need to be discussed and agreed with local
community officials and temple leaders.
h. Providing  proper traffic management and  public safety measures during
construction in accordance with local regulations and leaders. Specific measures
are provided in the project's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and contract
I                documents.
i. Assuring that construction materials do not disrupt traffic or block the roadway.
3            j. Paying attention to the safety of local users, especially pedestrians, by installing
appropriate traffic signs and traffic barriers as well as the use of flagmen.
3            Temporary alternative access roads and detours are required during construction at
the following intersections to avoid traffic problems:
|                *  Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 19 + 666), which is an intersection with a local road
to the Pura Batu Klotok temple.
* Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 20 + 186), located in the middle of a rice field.
|                *  ;Gelgel - Batu Klotok (Sta 20 + 786), located in the middle of a rice field.
* Gelgel - Jumpai (Sta 21 + 486), which is an intersection with a local road to
Desa Jumpai.
*  Gelgel - Jumpai (Sta 22 + 186), which is located close to Pura Dalem
Padharman Shri Nararya Kepakisan temple.
* Klungkung - Kusamba (Sta 23 + 776), which is an intersection with existing
3                   Klungkung - Kusamba national road near the Dawan T- intersection.
3.3         Environmental Management during Post-Construction Stage
1            3.3.1.       Possible Disruptions to Traffic Capacity
Future disruptions of the Bypass's designed traffic capacity and transport function may
occur if development of the adjacent land areas is not controlled, which could lead to
unplanned ROW encroachments or access to the Bypass road. In the absence of
proper land use controls and planning by the local government, typical examples of the
possible problems that could occur include "ribbon development" and unplanned
access roads and driveways along the completed Bypass as well as "informal" roadside
*            businesses which could develop within the ROW.
To date, such unplanned developments that could disrupt traffic capacity have not
occurred along completed Bypass sections. The local government should be further
encouraged to continue to protect the designed transport function of the Bypass. The
detailed design of the Bypass should also consider appropriate measures, such as
3            fencing or frontage roads, to better manage future ROW access and uses.
Use of the completed Bypass may also be disrupted during regular road maintenance
activities. This potential problem  can be avoided by properly scheduling such
*            maintenance work in coordination with local agencies and communities. The schedule
of such road maintenance activities should avoid peak traffic periods and involve local
agencies to maintain traffic capacity and ensure the safety of both road maintenance
workers and Bypass users.

Eastern Indoniesia Region Transport Project- I (EIRRTP-I)
3.3.2.       Possible Traffic Disturbance of Religious Ceremonies
There are over 10,000 recorded temples in Bali, many of which are located close to
roads. Traffic management and Bypass maintenance activities close to the Pura Dalem
Pedharman Shri Nararya Kepakisan temple must take into account religious ceremonies
and related traffic which must cross the Bypass several times a year.
To manage such potential impacts, post-construction or maintenance activities should
be closely coordinated with the temple leaders or postponed during the time of such
ceremonies. As an alternative measure, traffic along the completed Bypass section may
also be temporarily diverted to currently used routes during such ceremonies.
Based on future consultations with the temple leaders, a green belt separating the
temple and the roadway may needed to help reduce impacts of the completed Bypass
section. Such potentiai landscaping and related landscape maintenance measures
along the completed Bypass section are the responsibility of the local government.
3.3.3.       Public Safety Risks to Cross-Traffic
The completed Bypass section may separate some community areas from their rice
fields and temples they may use for occasional religious ceremonies. Such needs for
pedestrian, livestock or vehicular cross-traffic must be taken into account during the
detailed engineering design (DED) stage to minimize increased public safety risks or
disruption of these existing activities. A road safety audit is being prepared as a key
input into the DED.
The Audit/DED should carefully evaluate the local need to provide cross-walks ("zebra
crossings"), underpasses or overpasses at any critical locations, including appropriate
crossing for livestock. The Audit/DED should also ensure the use of appropriate traffic
signs or signals to minimize local risks from through-traffic utilizing the completed
Bypass section.
3.4          Other Project-Related Impact Management Activities
3.4.1        Potential Socio-Economic Impacts from Acquired ROW Areas
Potential socio-economic impacts may occur to former rice paddy sharecroppers and
illegal quarry operators and migrant workers in the Unda River bed area (Galian C)
affected by ROW areas that were acquired and the owners compensated.
Based on a request of the World Bank, the project proponent will prepare a separate
Social Impact Assessment (SIA) of potential project-related socio-economic impacts to
these two groups. Based on this SIA, a recommended Remedial Action Plan (RAP) will
be drafted and presented to the Klungkung local government for their comment and
implementation. This SIA is scheduled to be completed by a study team from Udayana
University (Bali) in mid-February 2005 for submission and approval by the World Bank.
A copy of the agreed Terms of Reference for this SIA is provided in the Appendices.

(b)  Quarry sites must be selected amongst those off'ering the highest
ration between extractive capacity (both in terms of quality) and
loss of natural state.
(c ) Quarry sites lying close to the alignment. with a high level of
accessibility and xwith a low hill gradient. are preferred.
a.   Quarry  exploitation  should  be avoided  in areas of
importance for natural resources. suchi as natural wooded
