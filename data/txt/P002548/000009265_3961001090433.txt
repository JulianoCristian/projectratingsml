MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE
E_ A SECOND MULTISECTOR PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a pronosed credit to the
Democratic Republic of Sao tome and Principe for SDR 4.5 (US$6.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and would help finance a second multisector project.
I. Country Policies and Bank Group Assistance Strategy
2.    Bcrnd: Sao Tome and Principe (STP) is a small country in both size and
population. With approximately 120,000 inhabitants, and a population growth rate of about
2.1 percent a year (after net out-migration of almost 1 percent per year), it is the least
populated country in Africa after the Seychelles. It consists of two islands about 200 miles
off the coast of Gabon, well distant from major air and sea routes. Notwithstanding its
physical isolation, STP mainains strong ties with neighboring Gabon and Angola, as well as
with Portugal, from which it gained independence in k975. These ties exert a significant
impact on political, social and economic developments. The country has some natural
resources, agriculture and hydroelectric potential, and great scenic beauty.
3.    Since its discovery in 1485, the country's economic development has been determined
by dependence on a series of single commodities. In the 16th century STP was the world's
largest sugar producer, in the 19th, one of the largest producers of coffee, and at the
beginning of the 20th, one of the three or four largest producers of cocoa. In each case, the
fall in production levels after an initial boom caused a similar fall in prosperity. Particularly
given cocoa's prospects, more diversified growth is critical to achieving sustainable
development in STP.
4.    There are serious development problems, including large economic imbalances (with
an export to import ratio of 1:4 and a debt service ratio of about 100 percent), as well as a
stagnant production base, and very weak institutions. STP's health and basic education
indicators are good, compared to the African continent. For example, life expectancy at birth
is 62 years, and primay school enrollment is over 95 percent. However, both health and
education sectors are now facing serious problems: since the mid-1980s there have been a
major surge in malaria and endemic diseases; shortages of trained teaclers and health
workers; lack of essential supplies; and deteriorating infrastructure.
5.    Since independence, STP has undertaken two distinct development strategies. In the
period immnediately following independence, the government embarked on a large program of
public borrowing on commercial terms. The investments financed by this borrowing were in
areas in which the country did not have a comparative advantage, and by the early 1980s,



-2-
their failure to generate adequate revenue streams led to a build up in arrears. In addition,
cocoa production, the mainstay of the economy, fell from 10,000 tons in 1975 to 3,900 tons
in 1987. This resulted in large operating deficits for the state farms, financed through
expansionary credit policies, which fueled inflation. With a fixed nominal exchange rate, the
real exchange rate appreciated, and real producer prices declined, exacerbating the weak
balance of payments situation.
6. By 1987, it was clear to the Government that the post-independence policies were not
working-GDP per capita was down significandy from the levels of the 1970s. There was
also a huge extrnal debt overhang and severe imbalances in the extnal account, while the
external debt service ratio increased from less than 1 percent in 1975 to almost 100 percent by
1987. Export receipts increased by only 43 percent over the same period, and by 1987
covered only 35 percent of imports, with the balance financed by aid and affears. It was in
this context that the Government decided to embark on a comprehensive Structural
Adjustment Program covering the period 1987-90, supported by IDA, AfDB and SIDA.
More recently, in 1989, the IMF supported the program with a structural adjustment facility
(SAP), covering the period 1989-1991.
Ile St§ ctural Adjustment Progm= L/
7.    The Government has made a start in implementing a fairly comprehensive program of
stabilization and structural measures, particularly in 1987 and 1988. Probably the most
important policy change has been the introduction of a more realistic market value for the
domestic currency, the dobra-it depreciated by about 40 percent in real terms between mid-
1987 and end-1990. There has been greater fiscal discipline, complementing a more prudent
monetary policy, that has reduced domestic inflation from 60 percent in 1986 to about
34 percent in 1990. The Government has also started to liberalize trade and prices, breaking
the monopoly of the state trading companies and dismantling what once was an extensive
system of price controls. Subsidies on imported foodstuffs have been eliminated. Tariffs for
electricity, water, and transport need to be adjusted more often, however, to ensure that they
cover operating costs.
8.    Notwithstanding a fairly good start in 1987 and 1988, program slippage occurred in
1989 and 1990. The root cause was the Govenment's weak administrative capacity,
compounded, in 1990, by its preoccupation with the country's first multi party elections. The
1989 fisca and monetary targets were exceeded, thus delaying negotiations on the second
annual SAF, although a shadow IMF program for 1990 was drawn up. Throughout 1990 the
authorities became increasingly preoccupied with the run-up to the elections, and key policy
actions on the exchange rate, petroleum prices, and import duties were not implemented, thus
program targets for 1990 were not met. A a result, the second Structural Adjustment Credit
has not yet become effective.
9.    While it will take considerable time to address STPls weak institutional base, the main
elements have started to be put in place during the past three years. On public enterprise
reform, the authorities had started to implemt4 a proram of liquidation, privatization and

Adjustment Progrm, see Report No. P-5308-STP, of June 5, 1990.



.3-
restucturing. However, the reform timetable has slipped by several months, due to the
authorities' attention to the elections. The administrative reform program, started in 1988
with UNDP support, has been similarly affected.
10.    During the past three years, agricultura output has started to respond to the
Govenment's policy teforms, as well as to new invesm s in the cocoa sector. Food crop
production increased, while overall GDP is estimated to have grown by between 1.5 and
2.5 percent between 1988 and 1990, compared to a 1.4 percent decline in 1987-see Table 1.
However, the fall in iational cocoa prices since 1937 has obscured these gains and
increased both the time and magnitude of the adjustment required. Notwithstanding the cocoa
price decline, in the absence of the Government's adjustme  efforts and the associated
foreign financing, GDP and living standards would have continued to decline in STP. Shifts
in income in favor of the rural sector would also have been delayed. Hence, the turarund
in the economy and response of agriculture, while modest to date, provide the basis for
intensifying the adjustment effort.

Government's Medium Term Strategy and Prospects:
11.   STP has stard on a long and difficult path to establishing the conditions for self-
susined growth. Recognizing this, the Government i.as embarked on a second phase of its
adjustment program, covering the period mid-1990 to 1993. Ihe same President and a single
political party, the MLSTP, had been in power from independence until January 1991, when
the first multi party elections were held. They resulted in victory for the main opposition
party.
12.   The new Govermment has already indicated its firm commitment to continue with the
second phase of the adjustment program supported by a second structural adjustment credit
from IDA, with cofinancing from the AfDB and SIDA. Because of recent program slippage,
to bring the structural adjustment program back on track and allow the Bank to make the
second adjustment credit effective, the new authorities has agreed to adopt a number of policy
measures quickly. First, on the exchange rate, the authorities have already reduced the
differential with the parallel market to 15 percent by devaluing the official exchange rate by
about 25 percent. Secondly, on the fiscal front, the authorities will: (i) continue to extend the
ad valorem taxable base amd eliminate import tax exemptions; Cii) increase import taxes on
non-essentials, including wines and spirits, and reinstate consumption taxes on beer and non-
alcoholic beverages; and (iii) increase petroleum product prices. Finally, the authorities will
adjust all tariffs and administered prices to take account of changes in the official exchange
rate and eliminate profit margin controls on six essential commodities.
13. The broad thrust of the program will continue to be on improved incentives to
increase the production of traded goods within a stable macroeconomic framework, by
strengthening key government and support institutions, such as banking, and agriculture
extension services. The main element3 of the policy agenda are sumnmized below.
A. kbsoe non  A aW
14.   Exchange La policy: The structural adjustment program calls for mantning a
flexible, market-based, exchange rate policy, with the objective of unifying the foreign
exchange markets in the longer tem. For 1991, the objective Is to continue narrowing the
gap between the parallel and official rates.
15.   fi    plicy: The structural adjustment program calls for strengthening of public
finances to ensure that in the longer term domestic resources will be sufficient to cover not
only recurrent costs, but also a growing share of public investment expenditures. The overall
objective is to continue reducing the current fiscal deficit.
16.     M Q D . The program envisions prudent monetary and credit policies to
educe inflation and to relieve pressure on the exchange rate, while providing an adequate
supply of credit to the productive sectors. To foster domestic savings, Interest rates that are
positive in real terms are expected to be introduced by end-1991. This would contribute to
finance domestic investments with domestic savings . The inflation rate is expected to decline



-5-
progressively during the program period, as the impact of achieving a realistic exchange rate
and fiscal policies works through the economy.
B. Structural Policy Agenda
17.   Trade and pricing poicy: Private and public enterprises are now permitted to export
and import in competition with ECOMEX, the State's international trading firm. Under the
adjustment program, it is intended to liberalize international trade further. During 1991
export procedures are to be simplified, an automatic impcrt licensing system implemented,
and private traders are to handle all exports and imports, except for official commodity grants
and petroleum products. To reduce price distortions further and to provide adequate
incentives for domestic food production, the Government is expected to continue liberalizing
prices, with the exception of petroleum prices which would be sold at import parity levels,
plus taxes.
18.   Private investment and diversification: A fundamental aspect of the Government's
development strategy is to open the economy to direct private investment, both foreign and
local. The Government is revising the Investment Code to improve incentives, while
safeguarding the State's interests, including those related to land use, environmental protection
and tax revenues. It has also requested funding for a study to: (a) indicate potential for
diversified export earnings; (b) identify areas/products where STP has a comparative
advantage; and (c) determine the scope for private sector development in STP.
19.   The obvious priority is to promote private involvement in agriculture. This will be
helped in a number of ways, including reform of the cocoa sector, and land distribution.
Some 39,000 ha, 45 percent of STP's arable land, is currently under cultivation, most of it in
15 Government-owned cocoa estates. In efforts to promote greatar agriculture growth, the
Government has handed over control of 8 of the 15 estates to private management. Three of
these are under a long term lease, and 5 under management contract, with IDA, the ADF and
other donors financing these efforts. To date, this has resulted in the rehabilitation and
replanting of some 1,500 ha of cocoa trees, and the upgrading of drying and other facilities.
The Government is studying whether to break up the remaining estates and distribute them to
qualified applicants. In parallel, the authorities are implementing an action program to
overcome inefficiencies in cocoa marketing, including more up-to-date and better information
on cocoa prices, and the establishment of quality standards.
20.   One of the most promising potential sources of future economic growth is tourism,
based on exploitation of STP's natural resourc.s, especially its tropical island seting, and
unique fauna and flora. The Government intends to take only a regulatory and promotional
role in tourism development, and to provide support mainly through rehabilitation of the
country's infrastructure, including airport and roads.
21.   The Public Expenditure Program: The Government's expenditure program is
ambitious. The Bank and the UNDP have been advisirg on priorities, and how to prune the
program. While some improvements have been evidenced in the design of projects, much
remains to be done, particularly in implementatior- To this end, improvements in the
management of the public investment program are being supported by technical assistance
from the AfDB. Rehabilitation of existing economic and social infrastructure is being
emphasized, mainly to improve productivity in agriculture and fisheries. Investments in



-6 -
infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, water and fuel storage facilities, as well as in support
services for smaliholders, are expected to reduce production and marketing costs and help
diversiflcation into other crops and into other sectors of the economy. Finally, to arrest the
decline in social indicators, priority public expenditures are being identified, such as malaria
eradication, mother and child health services, provision of essenti health and education
supplies, and training of key workers in the two sectors.
22.   Public Enterrise-R^ : The new Government is assessing the status of its public
enterprise program. Impending actions include privatizing the brewery, and rehabilitating the
printing office and the water and electricity company, fAe latter under a management contract
with a foreign utility company. Moreover, a decision on privatzing public transport and
construction enterprises is also pending.
23.   Adminismive lSefg: The Govenment's administrve capacity is being
stregthened in key areas, with the provision of technical assistance, training, and proposed
changes in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Priorities are to strengthen the capacity for
public expenditure planning and budgeting, and monitozing of priority investments in
agriculture, infrastructure and the social sectors. Civil service numbers have to be reduced,
and savings used to reward increased productivity. Partly to prepare for this, in early 1990
the Government revised its social security legislation to offer greater incentives for retirement.
The personnel management function is to be centralized and strengthened, and this will, inter
alia, allow for better control of Government employment levels.
24.   Financial Sector Reform: To improve the financial system's efficiency and
effectivemess, the Government, with technical assistance from the AfDB, IDA and the IMF,
intends to establish a two-tier financial system, in which a Cena  Bank will be engaged
exclusively in central banking activities, and commercW and development banking activities
wI be conducted by other financial institutions. In this context, the Government intends to
privatize commercial banking, and allow majority foreign private ownership. Tbe
government is thus pursuing possible joint ventures with foreign bankers, and IDA is
encouraging this development.
25.   External Debt Policy and Manatement: A successful resolution of STP's relatively
large debt obligations is critical to achieving longer term external viability. At end-1990, the
outstanding debt stock, including arrears, was about US$143 million, some 1,125 percent of
exports of goods and nonfactor services. The scheduled debt service ratio, including arrears,
will reach some 87 percent in 1991, and remain at about 70 percent during 1991-93,
reflecting suppliers' credits falling due.
26.   To address this onerous debt burden and normalize relations with creditors and
suppliers, the Government intends to contract or guarantee only concessional loans; to service
on schedule its debt obligations to multilateral institutions; and to request debt relief from all
other creditors. A strategy and timetable for renegotiating STl's bilateral debt was agreed
with the authorities in March, 1989, and is being implemented, albeit slowly. The objective
is to reschedule on IDA-equivalent terms or better. To this end, in mid-19I9, the authorities
requested nine major bilateral creditors-Algeria, Angola, China, East Germany, Italy,
Portugal, the Soviet Union, Spain, and Yugoslavia-to reschedule their obligations on highly
concessional terms, or, preferably, to forgive this debt. Already Portugal, the USSR and
Yugoslavia have responded with proposals to reschedule principal and interest payments on



- 7 -
concessional terms. The Government is also exploring prospects for buying back, at a
discount, its commercial debt through the IDA-funced debt reduction scheme for least
developed countries. This proposal is stalled for two reasons. First, the Bank put the request
on hold due to slippage in the structural adjustment program. Sewadly, there has been lack
of interest until now among mainly Portuguese creditor banks, qs they expect they will be
bailed out by their government, as part of their ongoing privatization program.
C. PoE&-%  Eocal
27.   Adverse social consequences are expected to be limited, and outweighed by economic
growth and efficiency gains. Proposed incentive policies are expected to offset some of the
negative impacts of the adjustment process. In addition, shifts in internal terms of trade in
favor of the rural sector should increase incomes of rural workers, the majority of the
population. The cocoa estate policy, as well as wage, price and trade liberalization, and land
distribution, are to benefit a substantial twmber of workers and smalll.olders.
28.   Moreover, to prot  groups negatively affected by the economic reforms, the
Government has undertaken the following: (a) provided food-for-work and distnbuted free
lunches to approximately 20,000 school children; (b) assured minimum budgetary allocations
to health and education, and redesigned some programs to maximize their social impact;
(c) with IDA and other donors' assistance, established a Social and Infrastv-'ture Fund (SIP),
that supports economically sound sub-projects which generate employment id) to monitor the
program's social impact through a Social Dimensions of Adjustment (SDA, Project, that
includes developing a data base on the impact of the SAP, and poverty alleviation sub-projects
under the SIF; (e) distributed some unused land, permitting smallholder development and
diversification of production, an improved supply of foodstuffs for both internal and export
markets; and (f) set up a redeployment f1nd with flnancing from ADF, which will provide
traning for a period of two years and an allowance equivalent to up to 18 monXt salary for
redundant civil servants and public enterprise workers.
D. Economnic EMets
29.   GDP is expected to increase by about 2 to 3 percent on average between 1991 and
1993, as investments in the cocoa sector yield results. Annual food crop production is also
expected to increase by about 3 percent per year to end 1993. This is due to increases in
acreage devoted to food crop production and product diversification, resulting from of the
Government's land distribution policy and improved support services, i.e. extension and credit
facilities, and more appropriate pricing policies. Food imports are thus expected to fal1 in
real terms starting in 1990. Private investments are also being reoriented to the most
profitable cash crops, e.g., pepper, palm oil.
30.   Increased value-added is expected from a more efficient public sector, as well as from
the emerging ptivate sector, due to more appropriate pricing policies and improved availabil-
ity of foreign exchange. Forestry, fishing, and the energy sectors are all areas where STP
appears to have a comparative advantage, and are likely to be the leaden in economic growth.
Other sectors, including services and tourism, are projected to grow at between 2.5 and
3 percent per year between 1991 and 1993. Tourism, in particular, will contribute to growth
in these other sectors, as ongoing and planned investment in tourism yield results.



-8-
31.   A shift of resources to the private sector is expected. Continued contraction of public
consumption, improved public sector resource allocation and investments, along with
improved incentives for the private sector, would imply increased private savings and
investnts. Private consumption is projected to grow only slightly over the 1991-1993
period. Thlis should complement more efficient public investnents and consumption, which
are not expected to grow in real terms.
32.   The depreciated value of the real exchange rate is projected to help reduce the trade
deficit over the 1991-1993 period, from US$15 million in 1990, about 30 percent of GDP,
to US$13 million in 1993, about 20 percent of GDP. There will be greater emphasis on
financing intermediate and capital goods imports, rather tan consumption goods. To this
end, achievement of a realistic, market-based, exchange rate, together with import taxes on
consumption goods, are expected to reduce the import bill over the 1991-1993 period.
}Bank GrXp.AssistanceStrategy:
33.   IDA Q     irons. STP joined the Bank and IDA In 1977, and became a borrower only
in 1985. As of March 31, 1991, IDA has made S credits to STP, for a total of
USS 34.7 million in commitments. Of this amount, US$20.1 million has been disbursed,
leaving an undisbursed balance of US$14.6 million (Schedule E). Policy based lending
accounts for 48 percent of total IDA conunitments, multisector lending for 28 percent and
agriculture for 14 percen-see Table 2. In 1985, a US$5.0 million equivalent line of credit
(Cr. 1590-STP) was approved to address issues in a number of key sectors, including
agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. This approach reflected the Bank efforts to deal with
STP's small size. Since 1987, because of STP's overwhelming macro imbalances, the Bank's
efforts were focussed on dealing with stabilization and structural adjustment. Thus, the first
Structural Adjustment Credit (US$4.0 million equivalent plus US$3.0 million equivalent from
the Special African Facility), approved in May 1987, supported both the stabilization and
sructural agendas.
34.   To complement the structural adjustment program, the Bank also approved the Cocoa
Rehabilitation Project (US$7.9 million equivalent) in May 1987. Tbis was designed to help
regain former levels of cocoa production and export revenues, and to stimulate food crop
production, In a first start at addressing issues of food security. The project also supported
creation of an inventory of the country's forest resources as a first step to improving
environmental protection. A Multi Sector Project (US$5.0 million equivalent) was approved
in June 1989 as well as a Second Structural Adjustment Credit for US$9.8 million equivalent.
These two projects continued the efforts of removing infrastructure botflenecks started in 1985
and supporting STP's adjustment efforts. The Bank has also coordinated donor assistnce in
preparing a Social Dimensions of Adjustment operation, with cofinancing from the AtDB.

35.   Over the next few years, the Bank's country assistance stra  will focus on:
(a) maintaining the structural adjustment; (b) accelerating the process of achieving self-
sustained growth, with emphasis on the private sector; and (c) improving the social indicators.
The proposed Bank program represents what it is believed to be a reasonable balance between
the country's requirements to continue the stabilization-with-adjustment process, and the
resources needed to support this, taking into account STP's size.
36.   In the context of supervision of the existing portfolio of Investment operations, the
Bank would highlight the importance of gett' t the adjustment program back on track, and of
maintaining the structu  adjustment program over the next few years. In addition to the
proposed Second Multi-sector Project to remove infrastructure bottlenecks, the Bank would
undertake investment pojects in agricutdwe and the social seors. The agriculwe project
would address three programs of special emphasis: private sector development,
diversification, and the environment. The socW sector project would arrest the declining
social indicators 1"' accelerating work on malaria control/eradication, improving availability of
drugs and textbo .s, working with the govemment and NGOS to reverse the decline in
mother and child health services and improving teacher and health worker training. A third
quick disbursing operation is planned, which should continue the transition to a more
sustainable adjustment path.
37.   In summary, for the FY92-FY94 period, IDA lending would concentrate on capital
investment, including investment in human resources and physical infrastructure. As a
consequence, a distribution of 25:75 between policy based lending and investment lending is
expected to materialize.
38.   Economic and Sector Work. The Economic and Sector Work is designed to support
these objectives and focus on: (a) the social sectors, to identify policy and investment
priorities, including how best to eradicate malaria, arrest the declining health and education
indicators. In addition, the social sector work would identify to what extent the proposed
social sectors project should address specific problems of women in development; (b) the role
of government and the private sector in controlling the environmental impact of tourism and
agriculture development has been emphasized in ongoing work on agriculture and tm;
(c) a CEM in FY91, focussing on: () key implementation and instittional issues in the



10 -
public expenditire program; and (ii) capacity building-this would focus on both short and
long term growth options for the economy, how quicldy the private sector wUi respond, and
where, and what policies and institutional support the Government needs to accelerate this
process-in this context, potential for IFC involvement will be explored; (e) a public
enterprise review in FY93; and (1) a CEM in FY94, focussing on the emerging private sector.
'Me Bank intends to encourage greater ownership of the adjustment program within STP by
assisting the Government to organize a series of National Long Term Perspectives Study
seminars, with help from EDI and others.
39.   STP is not yet a member of IFC. Given the country's size, IFC's involvement is
likely to be through the African Project Development Facility (APDF) and the Africa
Enterprise Fund. FIAS/MIGA is providing some help with the revision of the investment
code.
40.   Relations with fte IMP: The first annual arrangement under the Structural
Adjustment Facility (SAF) was approved in May 1989, covering the period 1989-91. A
failure to boost revenues during 1989, compounding factors outside the authorities' control
such as the fall in cocoa prices, caused slippage in meeting the 1989 performance targets.
This has delayed negotiations on the second annual SAF, although a shadow IMF program for
1990 was put in place. Based on perfonnance slippage in 1990, the second annual SAP
arrangement will continue to be postponed, and is not envisaged in the near fiutre. In
addition, a substantial strenhening of the Government's administrative capacity is
necessary. To this end, the IMF is expected to contnue to support the Government's
adjustment efforts by providing policy advice on macroeconomic and structural policies, as
well as long term technical assistance in tax and central banking reforms.
41. Relations with Creditors: Some 40 percent of STP's debt, about US$50 million, is
owed to commercial creditors, mainly Portuguese banks and suppliers. The Government is
currently verifying these amounts, and has requested the Bank to participate in the IDA-
supported commercial debt buy-back scheme. However, the Bank put this request on hold
due to the large amount of new commercial borrowing by the authorities, contrary to their
undertakings under the structural adjustment program. Both the authorities and creditor are
seeking to settle this in a manner consistent with STP's overall debt strategy. The balance of
STP's debt is owed mainly to Angola, China, East Germany, Portugal, the Soviet Union,
Spain, and Yugoslavia, and efforts are underway to reschedule this debt on IDA-equivalent
terms or better.
42.   Reato  wi Don: Other than IDA, STP's main donors are the AfDB, Sweden,
Portugal, France, and Angola. The lead in donor coordination is taken by the UNDP, which
holds a Round Table for STP about every 18 to 24 months-most recently in Geneva in March
1989. While the AfDB was to have taken the lead in organizing this meeting, it was unable
to do so, and the Bank played a major role, because of STP's tinancing needs under the
Special Program of Assistance. The Government and UNDP are planning sectoral
consultations in STP in the second half of 1991, where strategies, funding requirements and
Implementation of the public investment program are to be reviewed.



- 11 v
43.  lTe measures taken thus far as part of STP's Structur Adjustment Progmn have
reduced somewhat economic instability and many of the most serious distortions in the
inives framework. They nevertheless represent only the beginng of a long effort of
reform to address a legacy of incorrect policies. In addressing these isues, the Goverment
will be constrained by a huge debt overhang, a weak admnistaive capacity and fragile
popular support for the reform program. The Government has however indicated its
commitment to its development strategy, including iu structural adjustment program.
44.   The Bank's stey  over the next few years emphasizes a progressive shift from
adjustment to sectoral investments. Given the magitude of the macro imbances, however,
a third adjustment operation might be required. In investment lending, the focus wil be on
agriculture, social sectors, and physical infrstructure, with the underlying objective of
promoting the private sector, alleviating poverty and arrstg decliing soci indicators. To
support the productive sector, In agriculture, the focus will be on research and extension
services, infrastructure and other institutional support to overcome supply botlenecks. Efforts
to mobilize support from donor countries for these sectors wil remain a priority, in which
contined flow of IDA resources will play a critical role.
45.   The level and composition of Bank's support will critically depend on the contiwed
saisfactory implementation of the reform program. Performance criteria include maint_e
of sound macroeconomic policies; improved management of public expenditure, especially
redirection of the public investment program to reflect priority eoonomic and social needs;
contiued progress in improving the regulatory environment and promoting the private sector;
and financial sector restructring.
Public Inveshnent and The Sector
46.   The Government has prepared a three-year public investment program covering the
period 1990-92, which is focussed on the rehabilitation of existig economic and social
infructure. The country's deterioratng and overstrained infastructue has become
inadequate for providing essnt  services, and institutional strengthening is required in all
areas. Only those projects that support STP's developmet strategy and meet acceptable
economic rate of return criteria are included. To this end, investments in infrstructre, such
as roads, electricity, water and fuel storage facilities, as well as support serices for
smallholders, are expected to reduce production and marketing costs and help diversificaion
of the economy. STP annual expenditure programs will continue to be reviewed by IDA.
II. lhe EM=d Credi
47. B1W for IDA Involvememt ID this small country, IDA's involvement is critical
at this junctre to provide the infrastructure and public services necessary to support a return
to economic growth and to protect the more vulnerable groups while the structual adjustment
program takes effect. IDA's involvement under the First Muldsector Project helped set-up an
appropriae mecaism (SIP) to channel etern  resources to prority development sub-



- 12 -
project. Good progress is being made in implementing practically all on-going subprojects.
To date total committed credit funds amount to about US$4.2 million or 85 percent of the
credit, and disbursements amounted to US$2.2million as of April 30, 1991. Furthermore,
IDA's lead in the first project encouraged involvement by the international donor conununity
and is helping to provide much needed planning and coordination of donor activities. The
SIP is now in a strong position to finance a number of critical development activities, but
without additional IDA funds its development activities would be minidmal. Some co-fiancing
has been secured under the First Multisector Project but much more needs to be done and this
will take time. Additional IDA funds would allow SIP's development activities to continue
and would provide the catalyst to generate additional sources of finance.
48.   PrIojeS Oyectives: The proposed project seeks to mitigate the social and economic
impact of economic decline and structural adjustment. It would assist the Government in the
provision of basic infrastructure to facilitate private economic activity, generate employment
oppotunities for urban and rural households and raise living standards. The project would
also assist in improving the local technical capacity to prepare and implement infrstructure
improvement projects.
49.   Proect Description: The proposed project would provide financing for:
(a) infrastructure sub-projects compatible with social and economic priorities (such as water
supply and slum upgrading); and (b) technicai assistance funds to prepare sub-projects and for
istitutional strengthening (training, administrative improvements). With support from the
First Multisector Project (SDR 3.9 million) which became effective in February 1990, the
Social and Infrastructure Fund (SIF) was set up as an autonomous institution to channel credit
and other funds to fmance sub-projects under specified criteria. The proposed project would
also use SIF as the channelling mechanism. Sub-projects would be presented to SIP by
sponsoring agencies, appraised by SIF and implemented either by sponsoring agencies or
other qualified units. SIP would provide assistance in all phases of sub-project development,
including the pre-appraisal stage, and monitoring the entire process. Without this wholesaling
mechanism, several separate small projects and programs would be necessary, whiih would
be less cost-effective for the Govermment and for external donors to implement. Only sub-
project proposals that comply with selection criteria would be financed by SIF. The list of
pre-idendfied sub-projects (which are currently uuder preparation) includes construction or
rehabilitation of water supply systems, sanitary and storm drainage, solid waste management,
urban roads, priority small works, urban upgrading, and small power projects. The exact
amount to be financed for each type of sub-project cannot be determined at this time.
Procurement arrangements (Schedule C) are tentative and wUi be reviewed upon completion
of Sub-project design. The Government, through SIF, would present annually for IDA's
comments and concurrence, annually a list of proposed sub-projects for the next year together
with a summary description of the finan-!ng required and the sponsoring agencies. In
addition, SIF would submit to IDA the financial projections (cash flow, balance sheet and
income statement) for the upcoming year. IDA's review would ensure that there is a
reasonable balance among the various categories and the investments in sub-projects under
each category are consistent with the total investment agreed under the annual Public
Expenditure Reviews (PER). SIF would finance about US$5.0 million worth of multi-sector
sub-projects over the three-year commitment period FY 1992-1994 which represents about
80 percent of totl sub-project costs (Schedule B). The disbursement period may add another
two years, becaue any sub-projects approved in the third year of SIF's operations may take
as much as two years to hnplement. Employment generation from the appraW  sub-projects



- 13 -
under the First Multisector Project was estimated at 850 man-years; a similar number is
expected under the proposed project. The number of expected beneficiaries is expected to be
in the range of 8,000 to 10,000. Considering the volume and characteristics of potentiW sub-
projects which are already in SIF's "pipeline", these estimated levels of employment and
benefit generation may well be exceeded.
50.   Agre Actions: During negotiations, the following agreements were reached with
the Government to: adopt the Statement of Policies for SIF, and that any subsequent
modifications would only be made after IDA's authorization, with SIF to: (a) hire by
December 31, 1991, an agriculture specialist; (b) prepare and implement by December 31,
1991, a plan of action for improving SIF's administration; (c) submit by October 31, 1991
and on an annual basis thereafter, a training program for its staff and an action plan for
employment of consultants; (d) submit on an annual basis to IDA for comments, a proposed
plan covering its operations for the following tweive months; (e) submit every six months
semi-annual progress reports, covering all areas of SIP's operations, including information on
the effectiveness of financed sub-projects; (f) carry out, no earlier than September 30, 1993
and no later, than December 31, 1991, jointly with IDA and the Government, a mid-term
review of progress made in carrying out the project; and (g) to modify by October 31, 1991,
SIF's Operational Procedure Guidelines to take into account in more detail the crteria for
assessing the environmental impact of sub-projects. Coditions of Credit effectiveness will
include: (a) approval by the Government/SIF of the Statement of Policies; (b) execution of the
Subsidiary Administration Agreement; (c) submission of a satisfactory audit report of SIF's
1990 accounts and of the Special Account set up under the First Multisector Project.
Condition of Disbursement* Compliance of all sub-projects with SIP's policies and
procedures as approved by IDA and prior approval by IDA of all sub-projects with total
estimated cost of US$1S0,000 equivalent or more.
31. Environment: Deterioration of physical infrastructure has become an environmental
problem. These problems give rise to concern about the future use of the islands' great
natural beauty for tourism. The project would assist in improving the environment, through
the rehabilitation of deteriorated infrastructure.
52.   Benefits: Social and Economic benefits of the Project would be: (a) provision of
urgendy needed infrastructure to facilitate private economic activity and raise living
standards; (b) creation of employment opportunities for the underemployed and unemployed;
and (c) cost recovery to sustain public services. Institutional benefits would be: (a) efficiency
in utilizing available resources to achieve tangible results in the shortest possible time; (b) on-
the-job training opportunities for locally recruited SIF staff under guidance of experienced
consultants in key operational areas; (c) improvement of government units in need of
strengthening; and (d) coordination of activities of the donor community in STP.
33. Risks Possible risks relate to SIF's newness as a financial institution and include:
(a) the lack of adequate technical expertise in SIF to appraise and supervise an increasing
number of complex infrastructure sub-projects. To off-set this risk, pre-investment financing
would be available under the project to support preparation activities to be carried out by
consulting firms. Training would be provided to private local consultants, Government
agencies and SIF staff on preparation, appraisal and supervision of infrastructure sub-projects.
Implementation of infrastructure sub-projects will be carried out by specialized units in the
various sectoral ministries; (b) SIF's high administrative start-up costs could continue without



- 14-
sufficient increae in revenue generation. To off-set operating costs, SIF has adopted a policy
of charging the government agencies for Its appraisal supervision and advisory services. This
plus the commercial interest rates on lending for private sector sub-projects should, in the
next two years largely off-set administrative costs. (Cash-flow projections indicate that SIF
can begin to pay the Government for funds on-lent to the privae sector, taking into account
the need to provide SIF with a solid capital base). In addidon, every effort is being made to
contain adminitmtive costs by improving efficiency and reducing staff recruitment to the
minimum necessary.
54.   Renend: I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
