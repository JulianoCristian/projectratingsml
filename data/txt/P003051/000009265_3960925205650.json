Implementation took\n            three years longer than the three-year period envisaged\n            during appraisal. This significant delay was due primarily\n            to: (a) a shortage of government counterpart funds in\n            relation to estimated needs and their tardy disbursements;\n            (b) delays in recruiting consultants and numerous turnovers\n            in long-term expertise; (c) poor quality of the work\n            produced by certain experts and/or their Zairian\n            counterparts; (d) lack of knowledge and experience on the\n            part of DEPS officials to monitor such an operation and lack\n            of information and documentation about various aspects of\n            the project; more specifically, the coordinating committee\n            created to supervise the project locally did not function\n            adequately; (e) absenteeism and a lack of professionalism of\n            staff involved in implementation; (f) gaps in project\n            management by the Bureau des Projets Education (BPE), in\n            particular as regards procurement and accounting.\n            Disbursements were thus slower than estimated at appraisal,\n            but nevertheless they were regular owing to the large share\n            represented by technical assistance costs. The credit was\n            closed on March 31, 1991 and the last disbursement made on\n            August 19, 1991. An undisbursed balance of about 10 percent\n            of the credit was canceled."}, "docdt": "1992-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
