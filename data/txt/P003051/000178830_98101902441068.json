       capability and therefore its ability to provide more\n            efficiently education services of better quality. In\n            particular, the project would: (a) strengthen education\n            planning by introducing a program of systematic data\n            collection and analysis, and a pilot program of school\n            mapping; (b) improve the relevance and quality of education\n            by conducting a survey of technical schools, preparing\n            programs to upgrade technical teachers, and assessing new\n            methods of textbook production, distribution and cost\n            recovery. Further, it would strengthen education management\n            and administration by carrying out an in-depth analysis of\n            the administrative structure and procedures of DEPS;\n            developing a plan for DEPS reorganization; training DEPS\n            staff, school principals and inspectors in budgeting,\n            accounting and management; and providing better\n            communication and transportation equipment. The project\n            would finance about 37 man-years of experts' services;\n            14 man-years of overseas fellowship training; in-country\n            training for about 2,800 Zairians; and miscellaneous\n            equipment, supplies and materials (including materials for\n            printing and distribution of textbooks)."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
