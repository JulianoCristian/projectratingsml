infrastructure\n            project in the gas sector, and to help strengthen the\n            country's institutional capacity to develop gas\n            resources.  These objectives would be achieved by providing:\n            (a) engineering design, procurement assistance, review of\n            detailed engineering by contractors, and initial\n            construction supervision for the Escravos-Lagos pipeline\n            (ELP) project; (b) assistance in establishment of\n            NNPC's Gas Unit, including training, organization, and\n            management and operating assistance for the ELP system; (c)\n            engineering services for future gas supply expansion in the\n            western delta area, for feasibility studies for recovering\n            natural gas liquids from flared gas and gas streams, and\n            other gas and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) engineering\n            studies; (d) marketing, pricing and tariff studies for gas\n            and LPG; and (e) assistance to NNPC for corporate planning,\n            information systems, capital budgeting and project evaluation."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
