the irrigated area for crop\n            production, improve pastures and promote livestock\n            development on 20 state farms in Northern Xinjiang.\n            Specifically, it will construct irrigation works on 32,300\n            ha to be planted with food, fiber and fodder crops; improve\n            44,700 ha of rainfed pasture through fertilizing, fencing\n            and seeding; and introduce improved animal breeds.  To\n            handle the increased production of raw materials, the\n            project will construct and equip agroprocessing facilities\n            such as cottonseed oil processing plants, wool processing\n            plants, slaughterhouses and raisin production facilities.\n            In addition to agroprocessing equipment, the project will\n            provide tractors, combine harvesters, balers, silage\n            equipment, scrapers with laser-control, bulldozers, fuel\n            tankers and refrigerated trunks.  A project-supported\n            training component will be used to train equipment\n            operators, plant managers and workers, and project personnel."}, "docdt": "1987-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
