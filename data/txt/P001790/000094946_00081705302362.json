Lessons\n            suggest that the slow process of reforming institutional\n            structure, and management approaches, requires a sustained\n            dialogue beyond one operation's scope, in addition to a\n            continuous monitoring, and supportive policy advice to the\n            reform program. Based on the recent institutional\n            development, and weak capacity at the project's\n            preparation, more than one operation will be required to set\n            a sustainable transport sector in Mozambique. Government\n            ownership is a crucial factor for project success,\n            exemplified in this project, particularly, by the competent\n            management of the National Directorate of Roads and Bridges,\n            who developed a system of technical assistance monitoring,\n            and evaluation, thus ensuring the capacity of local staff,\n            and, strengthened human resources, by adapting their\n            capacity to the local needs, and environment. However, there\n            is still a need to address comprehensive road policy\n            reforms, ensuring all sector aspects, that is, provision of\n            adequate financing for road maintenance, and management\n            arrangements, and, most importantly, ensure a political\n            commitment to safeguard the use of money, and a\n            check-and-balance governance system, to restrict\n            government's discretionary power, and arbitrary behavior."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
