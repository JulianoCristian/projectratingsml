      providing basic infrastructure and employment and\n            income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; 2)\n            supporting rural community groups in planning and\n            implementing their own subprojects; 3) providing a safety\n            net for the rural poor during a period of strong fiscal\n            adjustment when the Government's ability to finance\n            essential investments and services is constrained; and 4)\n            leveraging revenue mobilization at the community and\n            municipal levels. The project will ensure that funds are\n            targeted and reliably transferred to the poorest\n            communities, and will promote further decentralization of\n            decision-making to State, municipal and local levels. The\n            project comprises three components: community subprojects\n            supporting infrastrture, social, and productive small-scale\n            industrial investments; institutional development providing\n            technical assistance and training to increase capacity and\n            improve implementation of the project; and project\n            administration, monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
