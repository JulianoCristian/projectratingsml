the Rural Poverty\n            Alleviation Project for the State of Sergipe is rated as\n            satisfactory, sustainability as likely, institutional\n            development impact as substantial, Bank performance as\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance as satisfactory. The\n            lessons of this project include: Community Driven\n            Development projects can successfully support decentralize\n            resource allocation and create social capital in poor rural\n            areas. The equitable graduation of communities who have\n            accumulated sufficient assets and organizational capacity to\n            access mainstream financing and other services, is expected\n            to be an important product of this more integrated approach\n            to Municipal Community Scheme Council roles/activities.\n            Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making\n            and implementation to the state and local levels ensures\n            administrative efficiency and superior results.\n            Participation by beneficiaries in the selection, financing,\n            execution, and organization and management of subprojects\n            ensures that investments meet genuine community needs.\n            Poverty targeting mechanisms that are simple, verifiable and\n            based on objective criteria foster transparency, minimize\n            political interference in project resource allocation and\n            ensure that project resources reach the poorest. Supervision\n            remains an indispensable determinant of success and\n            sustainability. Dissemination of \"best practice\"\n            can speed learning and reward innovation."}, "docdt": "2001-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
