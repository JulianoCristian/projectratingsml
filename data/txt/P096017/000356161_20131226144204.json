Some lessons\n            learned includes: the experience gained under this operation\n            raises a series of questions regarding the most appropriate\n            way of structuring regional or umbrella type projects. The\n            implementing agency needs to be capable of exercising its\n            implementation capacity since the grant/loan effectiveness.\n            Trying to strengthen and build the implementation agency\n            while in parallel trying to advance execution is not\n            recommendable and inevitably leads to delays in project\n            implementation. Additionally, ensuring cross-fertilization\n            and effective coordination between projects can be extremely\n            challenging, particularly when resources, both human and\n            financial, are restricted. Functions endowed on the\n            'coordinating body', including information\n            sharing, dissemination, institutional strengthening,\n            monitoring and evaluation are often too broad when compared\n            to budget availability, making operating costs often higher\n            than expected."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
