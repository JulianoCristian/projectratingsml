                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Regional project development objectives will be: (i)to establish a network of local and national government stakeholders, international organizations and private
                         sector entities to promote policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in Latin American cities; (2) to assist
                         cities to develop sustainable urban transport strategies that integrate climate change and air quality components; and, (3) to improve the capacity of cities to
                         quantify the impacts of transport policies on climate change and air pollution emissions.
