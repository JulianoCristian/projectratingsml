                                   Restructuring Paper

1.      The closing date for the LAC Regional Sustainable Transport and Air Quality
Project, TF093591, P096017 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until June 30,
2013 and grant proceeds will be reallocated as shown in paragraph 8 below.

2.      In the last ISR, the project implementation progress and the performance of the
Clean Air Institute (CAI), the implementation agency and Recipient of the grant, were
rated satisfactory. Among others, CAI organized 16 training courses for a total of 540
people and a well-evaluated regional conference with 406 attendees. They reviewed and
analyzed methodologies and models to assess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
transport interventions, set up a webpage with these methodologies and models, provided
detailed instructions for their use, and created a helpdesk. CAI also supported cities,
mainly in Mexico and Argentina, in assessing the impacts of their transport interventions.
CAI set up a technical support help desk; provided technical assistance to cities in
Argentina, Brazil and Mexico; and produced policy papers on urban transport and climate
change topics.

3.        This enabled CAI to comply with all but two of the June 2012 indicator targets
and make important progress toward achieving the intermediate outcomes. The Global
Environmental Objectives (GEOs) are to (i) establish a network of local and national
government stakeholders, international organizations and private sector entities to
promote policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban
transport systems in Latin American cities; (ii) to assist cities to develop sustainable
urban transport strategies that integrate climate change and air quality components; and
(iii) to improve the capacity of cities to quantify the impacts of transport policies on
climate change and air pollution emissions. They continue to be achievable.

4.       This regional project and three separate country projects in Argentina, Brazil, and
Mexico form the GEF Sustainable Transport and Air Quality Program (STAQ Program).
The regional project is expected, among others, to support the overall STAQ Program by
(i) fostering knowledge sharing on climate change and transport among the country
projects and with other cities in the region; (ii) expanding the knowledge base on the
issues mentioned in the previous point; (iii) providing the country projects with support
and technical assistances as well as monitoring and evaluating their results; and (iv)
establishing a network of governmental and other entities to promote policies and actions
for more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in LAC cities.

5.      The proposed closing date extension is necessary for two reasons. First, the
country projects had substantial effectiveness delays and started about a year later than
the regional project. Therefore, by extending the closing date of the regional project by
six months, CAI will still be able to provide the country projects with the necessary


                                             2
technical assistance and help them to complete the evaluations of their transport
interventions.

6.       Secondly, the regional GEF project itself had an effectiveness delay of six
months. This shortened the implementation period for CAI’s activities not directly aimed
at supporting the country projects, in particular the establishment of the above-mentioned
network. The six-month project closing date extension will enable CAI to complete these
activities and will increase the chance of fully achieving the related project objectives.

7.      CAI prepared an action plan to complete the project by the new closing date.
This will be the first closing date extension for the project.

8.     In addition to the closing date extension, proceeds will be reallocated as follows:

   Category of Expenditure               Allocation                  % of Financing
      Current        Revised        Current      Revised          Current      Revise

TOTAL AMOUNT                       2,903,000      2,903,000

9.      The proposed reallocation of US$48,000 from Categories 1 and 3 Consultant
Services to Categories 2 and 4 Training and Operating Costs is necessary to enable CAI
to carry out their functions during the six-month closing date extension period.
