                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Regional project development objectives will be: (i)to establish a network of local and national government stakeholders, international organizations and private sector
                         entities to promote policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in Latin American cities; (2) to assist cities to
                         develop sustainable urban transport strategies that integrate climate change and air quality components; and, (3) to improve the capacity of cities to quantify the
                         impacts of transport policies on climate change and air pollution emissions.
