                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Regional project development objectives will be: (i)to establish a network of local and national government stakeholders, international organizations and private
                         sector entities to promote policies and actions leading towards more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in Latin American cities; (2) to assist
                         cities to develop sustainable urban transport strategies that integrate climate change and air quality components; and, (3) to improve the capacity of cities to
                         quantify the impacts of transport policies on climate change and air pollution emissions.

                         The project implementation progress has picked up mainly in the last two to three months. The main project activities included (i) continuing the work on the critical review of
                         methodologies, (ii) starting the implementation of an online helpdesk on transport emission assessment, (ii) advising the city of Salta on mobile source emission inventories, (iv)
                         continuing the support to the city of Rosario in evaluating the emission impact of non-motorized transport (NMT) interventions, (v) providing technical assistance to the cities of
                         Rosario, Cordoba and Puebla, (vi) designing and publishing a folder on sustainable transport, (vii) finalizing and printing of two technical papers, (viii) organizing a clinic, training
