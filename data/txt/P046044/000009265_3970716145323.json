This decree increases\n            security for rights to land and real estate, facilitates\n            transactions in land and real estate, and promotes credit\n            systems development.  The project will also test the use of\n            digital mapping for registration system support, and for\n            current and long-term requirements for map production and\n            revision.  The project comprises three components:  (1)\n            institution building; (2) establishment of the registration\n            system; and (3) map production.  The first component\n            consists of developing a Project Implementation Unit,\n            providing technical assistance in elaborating and testing\n            aspects of the registration system, and implementing\n            training programs.  The second component establishes the\n            registration offices of the Ministry of Justice, defines\n            linkages between those offices and the offices of the State\n            Land Committee and the Ministry of Construction, locates\n            premises   and hires staff, sets up procedures to enter and\n            maintain information in the registry, designs office\n            procedures and standard forms, and installs and tests\n            database management practices.  The third component tests\n            and elaborates map digitization on a pilot basis, trains\n            staff, examines the economic costs and benefits of shifting\n            from paper-based maps to electronic maps, and establishes a\n            digitization center that will add parcel boundary\n            information to these base maps."}, "docdt": "1997-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
