effective supply of electricity.\n            The project consists of the following components: (a)\n            involves construction of a new 475 km 500 kV single circuit\n            overhead line (OHL) from the air-insulated substation\n            Ekibastuz (1,150/500 kV) to the airinsulated substation\n            Agadyr (500 kV), including a Fiber Optic Communication Line;\n            (b) will expand the existing 1,150/500 kV substation at\n            Ekibastuz by three bays and installing shunt reactors (3x60\n            MVAR) to accommodate the new 500 kV link with the Agadyr\n            substation. The existing 1,150 kV switchgear is presently\n            operated at 500 kV; (c) will expand the existing 500 kV\n            substation at Agadyr by six bays to accommodate the new 500\n            kV link with the Ekibastuz and YuKGRES substations; and (d)\n            includes consulting services for: (i) procurement and\n            project management for the construction of the 500 kV OHL\n            between Ekibastuz and Agadyr; and (ii) further reforms of\n            the transmission sector, including transmission pricing\n            (zonal tariffs) and establishment of a real time balancing market."}, "docdt": "2005-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
