maximum future debt service requirements) is at least 1.2.


A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsector issues

Country Context. Kazakhstan has made significant progress in nation building since the
breakup o f the Soviet Union. The country's recent economic performance has been impressive
and its reform record i s among the best inthe former Soviet Union(FSU). Economic growth has
been buoyant at about 11% on average since 2000, with income per capita expected to exceed
US$2,000 in 2004, 65% higher than in 2000.                    Growth has been driven mainly-but  not
exclusively-by       increased oil production and higher oil prices.       Many industries, including
electricity, mining, metallurgy, petrochemical and construction, have rebounded owing to
structural reforms, economic stability and demand generated by higher oil revenues.              The
country's economic activity over the past few years has been financed almost exclusively by the
private sector, with nearly three-quarters of all investment carried out byprivate companies.

Electricity Generation, Consumption and Trade. There are 70 power generation plants in
Kazakhstan with a total installed capacity of 18,485 MW, consisting of four large ("national
level") coal-and gas-fired power plants (8,340 MW), 21 hydropower plants (2,247 MW) and 45
combined heat and power plants (7,898 MW). In 2004, total generation and gross domestic
consumption were 66.6 TWh and 64.8 TWh, respectively, with net exports o f 1.8 TWh.'
Domestic consumption, which was declining from 1990 to 1999, has since been growing at an
averagerate o f 6% per year. Kazakhstanexports power to Russia, while imports are mostly from
Central Asia. Net imports from Central Asia (currently about 1.2 TWh per year) are primarily
dependenton the water released for irrigation from the Toktogul reservoir inKyrgyzstan, and as
such do not coincide with the Kazakh peak demand inthe montho f January.

Transmission. The high voltage transmission system of Kazakhstan has three voltage levels:
1,150 kV, 500 kV and 220 kV. The state-owned Kazakhstan Electricity Grid Operating
Company (KEGOC) operates all transmission assets at 1,150 kV and 500 kV levels. KEGOC is
responsible for dispatch control and operates international connections, principally with Russia,
Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The central dispatch arrangements are best characterized as self-
dispatch by generators against contracts with the regional distribution companies and large
consumers directly connected to the transmission system.

KEGOC's transmission systemconsists of three regional power grids:

    0   Northemgridconnected to the Russianpower system.


    0   Southem grid connected to Central Asian power system (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan)
        and the northern grid with a single circuit 500 kV tie line.


    0   Westem grid comprising of two subsystems which are isolated from the other systems
        and import power from Russiato supplement local generation.

                                                          1

Distribution. There are 21Regional Distribution Companies (REKs), which own smaller sized
generation units (mostly combined heat and power), transmission at 110 kV level and electricity
and heat distribution networks. The total capacity o f the regional level generating plants account
for nearly halfo f the installed capacity inthe country. Not all o f the REKshave beenunbundled
and some continue to retain the status o fvertically integrated utilities.

Power Sector Reforms. Inthe area o f power sector reforms, Kazakhstanranks among the most
advanced countries in the FSU. The Government o f Kazakhstan (GOK) began reforms in 1996,
with a view to introducingprivate participation and establishing a competitive power market. By
1997, the large "national level" electricity generation plants were separated from the former
Kazakhstanenergo (an integrated monopoly), KEGOC was formed to operate the high voltage
transmission network and the REKs were established. Inaddition, the single buyer model, under
which the REKs purchased power from the generators and resold it to local customers, i s being
replaced by a competitive retail market under which customers purchase energy from Energy
Supply Organizations (ESOS),~which inturnpay KEGOC and the REKs for the costs associated
with transmission, dispatch and distribution.

Privatization. Most o f the large-sized thermal generation assets have been privatized to foreign
and local strategic investors. The large hydropower plants have been given on concession basis
to private investors. Most o f the REKs have also been privatized, a number o f them under
concession contracts.3

Wholesale Market Structure. The wholesale electricity market i s fully liberalized and operates
mainly on the basis o f bilateral contracts between generators and large consumers or REKs for
direct sale o f power. Provided that they acquire access to the KEGOC-operated high voltage
network, large electricity consumers can enter the market and shop freely for power. There i s
strong competition in the bilateral contract market and, consequently, the average wholesale
price i s very low (estimated at U S cents 1.5 per kWh).

Under the ongoing Bank-supported electricity transmission rehabilitation project, the GOK has
established the legislative, technical and organizational infrastructure for a functioning electricity
spot market, which will increasingly supplement the bilateral contracts as a trading place for
short-term electricity tran~actions.~To complete the wholesale electricity market reforms under
the subject project, a real time balancing market will be established by December 31,2007 to be
operated by KEGOC. To ensure the reliable and secure operation o f the power system in real
time, KEGOC will conclude market-based transactions on balancing bids submitted by
generators under transparent market rules.




  Formationo f ESOs was mandated under the new Electricity L a w (effective July 9, 2004). As o f January 1, 2005,
there were approximately 20 ESOs registered. There are numerous new applications for ESO status.
3 As of May 1, 2005, only two remained instate ownership.
  Since March 2004, there has been continuous day-ahead trading.             The spot market operates more and more
successfully and has established itself as a credible part o f the electricity wholesale market. Liquidity o f the market
has increased substantially. In 2004, spot sales reached nearly 1 TWh (more than 3% o f the wholesale market
turnover) or KT 1.5 billion (US$l 1million).

Sector Regulation. The Ministry o f Energy and Mineral Resources i s in charge o f licensing
activities. Under the ongoing transmission rehabilitation project, a modem Electricity Grid Code
was adopted in December 2001 (and updated since) which established a set of transparent rules
governing non-discriminatory third-party access to the transmissionnetwork and the services the
grid operator (KEGOC) is obligedto provide.

Underthe Law on Natural Monopolies, the natural monopoly parts o fthe power sector (KEGOC
and REKs) are regulated by the Agency for Regulation o f Natural Monopolies (ARNM)which
reports to the Prime Minister. The Law ensures full recovery o f justifiable costs, including the
cost o f new investments, for the regulated mon~polies.~KEGOC's transmission tariffs are
approved by the ARNM on a justifiable cost-plus basis. The existing tariffs are fully cost-
reflective. Under the ongoing modernization project, the transmission tariff methodology has
been improved by reducing the weight o f the (geographic) distance-based component, which has
beenan anti-competitive feature. Underthe subject project, the distance component will be fully
eliminated with the introduction o f zonal tariffs by the first quarter o f 2006, thereby fostering
competition and creating a mechanism to deal with congested capacity in the transmission
system.

Electricity Deficit in Southern Kazakhstan - Key Project Rationale. Vigorous economic
growth and increasing diversification o f the economic base have led to a sharp upswing in
electricity demand in Kazakhstan in recent years. While Kazakhstan has sufficient generation
capacity to meet domestic power demand, four-fifth o f power generation comes from the
northem part o f the country, predominantly from power plants located in the coal-producing
regions and to a lesser extent from hydroelectric facilities located primarily along the Irtysh
River. Generation facilities in the south are limited to small hydro, combined heat and power
plants, and a high cost gadoil-fired power plant at Zhambyl which i s operated (with government
subsidies to cover high fuel costs) to meet winter peak demand.

The existing North-South (N/S) electricity transmission lines o f 500 kV and 220 kV, via which
low-cost electricity i s transmitted from the northem power stations to the south, have a limited
transmission capacity o f approximately 650 MW. This i s grossly insufficient to meet demand in
the rapidly growing southern part o f the country, especially inthe industrial belt between Almaty
and Shymkent. Power deficit in the south (i.e., the difference between demand and local
generation) i s 900 MW (about 5 TWh or half o f regional consumption). At present, the deficit i s
met largely by transmitting power from the north and in part by importing electricity. During
winter, the costly Zhambyl plant is operated. However, the deficit cannot be fully met in the
winter period o f maximum electric loads, which necessitates restrictions on consumption (load
shedding)6 with an adverse impact on regional economic development. At the same time,
because o f the limited N/S transmission capacity, surplus electricity from the northem power
stations is exportedto Russia.



'Unlike   inthe case ofKEGOC, this provision has notbeenconsistently carried out by the ARNM for the REKs.
Regulatory problems have resulted infew notable cases of disinvestment by international private investors from
distribution business.
 Consumption restrictions amounted to 100 MW duringthe 2000-2001 winter and 200 MW inthe 2003-2004
winter.


                                                       3

Furthermore, reliability o f the 500 kV interconnector i s low because o f its single circuit design.
Disconnection or outage o f even one o f the five 500 kV line sections can stop power
transmission to southern Kazakhstan and the parallel, interconnected operation o f the Kazakh
power system with Central Asia and Russia. At present, the scheduled maintenance o f the
interconnector can only take place during the lower-load summer period. Irregular power flows
cause frequent activation o f emergency control systems on the interconnector thus causing load
rejection, disconnection and voltage control switching o f 500 kV reactor^.^

Insouthern Kazakhstan, electricity demand is poisedto increase rapidly and the supply shortfall
i s expected to more than double by 2015 (to reach 1,900 MW or 10 TWh). At present, energy
and peak supply capacity in the south is limited to 3,000 MW o f total installed capacity (of
which only 2,300 MW i s operational) with most o f the plants obsolete. Investment costs in the
south are prohibitive incomparison with the north both for rehabilitation o f existing capacity and
for new generation. Therefore, major investments are unlikelyinthe south inthe mediumterm.*
Net imports from Central Asia (currently about 1.2 TWh per year) are not expected to increase
substantially inthe foreseeable future as availability is primarily dependent on the water released
for irrigation from the Toktogul reservoir inKyrgyzstan.

In-depth feasibility studies camed out in 2001-2002 established that the least-cost method o f
meeting current and mid-term electricity demand in the south was to expand and strengthenthe
capacity o f the existing N/S transmission line.'              Accordingly, the GOK authorized KEGOC to
implementthe project, and authorized tariff increases to cover the associated costs o f financing
and debt service.

DevelopmentImpact. Expandingthe N/S transmission links offers numerous benefits interms
o f system reliability, increased exporthransit capacity and the ability to make more effective use
o f low-cost generating plants in northern Kazakhstan to serve domestic markets. The project
also offers an opportunity to maintain dialogue within the region relating to increased electricity
trade and better integrated power markets.                    Prospectively, more hydroelectricity could be
exported from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to the power deficit regions o f Russia thereby
promoting regional integration. loThe new transmission line will also improve the reliability o f
parallel operation o f the power systems o f Russia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia, thus improving


'Due  largely to the increasing overload o f the existing N/S interconnector, there has been a steep increase inthe
number o f major emergency breakdowns (outages) inthe system, resulting inthe cut-off of highvoltage substations
and reduced frequency (occasionally to as low as 48.35 Hz). While in 1998 no major breakdown was reported, there
were 18 in2003. (The average annual number o f breakdowns was 15 in 2000-2004.)
  Other than the new 300 MW Moinak hydropower plant (whose production was factored into the above deficit
forecast).
   The least-cost assessment was performed as part of the project pre-feasibility study prepared by RWE
Solutions/Lahmeyer International. It was assumed that the energy and peak supply deficit in southern Kazakhstan
can either be overcome by (i)   various scenarios o f new and rehabilitated generation capacity in the south; or (ii)
construction o f a second NIS transmission line.       It was established that the new transmission line i s the best
economic alternative. I t s economic justification increases as (i) coal price at the Ekibastuz coal mines decreases; (ii)
crude oil price increases; and (iii)
                                   electricity demand inthe south rises.
lo However, this export scenario i s largely conditional o n the establishment o f substantialnew hydropower capacity
inTajikistan andKyrgyzstan. At present, the envisagedprojects (including Sangtuda inTajikistan and Kambarata
inKyrgyzstan) are beset with considerable uncertainty.


                                                             4

the quality o f power supply across the region. Therefore, the new N/S line i s seen as a regional
strategic asset.'

From the broader development perspective, the N/S project will also enhance the well-being o f
the population in southern Kazakhstan by (i)     providing inexpensive and higher quality energy;
(ii) removing a binding energy supply constraint to continued economic growth in the region;
and (iii)increasing the region's competitiveness in terms o f industrial and commercial
development with related benefits interms o f employment and income.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The Bank's involvement inPhase I1o f the N/S project will facilitate continuation o f the dialogue
with respect to the completion o f the transmission sector reforms which have been implemented
or initiated under the ongoing Bank-financed transmission rehabilitation project. Moreover, the
financial savings to KEGOC associated with Bank participation are substantial and would allow
more moderate increases in transmission tariffs than would otherwise be required while
considerably easing the cash flow pressure on KEGOC over the near and medium terms. The
Bankalso has a stronginterest inthe development o fregional electricity markets and, through its
involvement in the project, could ensure that the regional integration aspects are properly
addressedunder the project (e.g., by providing non-discriminatory Third Party Access to the N/S
line for export- and international transit-related transmission services). Finally, completion o f
the new N/S line will help to ensure realization o f the benefits o f previous and current Bank
initiatives in the power sector (including, support for financing o f transmission system
rehabilitation and development o f the spot market) by providing the infrastructure needed to
ensure that national and regional electricity trade can take place without technical constraints and
on a transparent, non-discriminatory basis.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

Kazakhstan's current development focus i s on achieving international standards for public
services and enterprises over the next 15 years and increasing the competitiveness o f its tradable
non-oil sectors. This inturn involves (i)  improving public institutions and policies; (ii)fostering
competitiveness and facilitating business; (iii) investing inhuman capital and infrastructure; and
(iv) safeguarding the environment. Reliable and cost-effective electricity supply is fundamental
to both social and economic development. To this end, the GOK has chosen to invest significant
efforts in support o f the rehabilitation, modernization and expansion o f the power sector.
Strengthening o f the transmission grid will ensure wide-spread access to low-cost generation,
while development o f the physical and institutional framework for electricity trade will facilitate
the longer term development o f competitive national and regional electricity markets.

The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Kazakhstan, which was discussed by the
Executive Directors on September 9, 2004, recognizes that financing will not be the primary
driver in the relationship between Kazakhstan and the Bank in the coming years. Rather, the
Bank will use its international knowledge and experience to help Kazakhstan build a modern,
rapidly growing and diverse economy that improves the welfare o f all its citizens and especially

"See"CentralAsiaRegionalElectricityExportPotentialStudy," WorldBank,November2004.



                                                  5

the poor. At the same time, the CPS recognizes the important role o f Kazakhstan inthe context
o f regional trade and development. The CPS envisions a combination o f technical assistance and
targeted lending in support o f both national and regional objectives. The first basis for any
engagement must be demand by Kazakhstan. However, on its side the Bank must ensure that its
work in Kazakhstan serves the institution's broader goals and meets institutional standards. In
both respects, the proposedproject i s an example o f the type o f support envisaged inthe CPS.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The Bank would extend an IBRD loan o f US$lOOmillion to KEGOC to finance Phase I1o f the
N/S project, under terms agreed during project preparation. The Borrower has elected to take a
Variable Spread Loan denominated in U S dollars, with Level Repayment Method over 17 years
including 5 years grace. The primaryreasons for this choice are that it parallels the terms of the
existing loan which have proven to be satisfactory and well-understood by all Kazakh parties
involved, and also that KEGOC sees little need for the additional flexibility afforded by the
higher-cost Fixed Spread Loan. The loan will be guaranteed by the Republic o f Kazakhstan
underGOK resolutionNo. 926 dated September 19,2005.

2. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators

The primary development objective o f the overall N/S project i s to ensure that business
enterprises and households in southern Kazakhstan have access to adequate, reliable and cost
effective supply o f electricity. The project also supports regional integration with respect to
optimizing the use o f energy resources through international electricity trade. The project aims
to promote competition both on the national and regional levels by allowing low cost producers
inKazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to compete on the broader regional market, including
Russia. The project i s a step towards regional power market liberalization to eventually involve
all five Central Asian countries.

Specifically, the completion o f the N/S project i s expected to have the following outcomes:


     0  Reduction in the average cost o f supply to electricity customers in southern Kazakhstan
        through increased access to low-cost domestic generating plants.
     0  Improved quality and reliability o f electricity transmission.
     0  Reduced transmission losses.
     0  Increased intra-regional electricity trade with a consequent reduction in the long-run
        marginal cost o f electricity supply for all countries inthe region.
     0  Completion o f power market reforms through the establishment o f real time balancing
        market.

    0    Further rationalization o f the transmission tariff-setting12 to (i) regional inequities;
                                                                                      lessen
         (ii)  provide correct price signals for siting o f new generation and transmission; and (iii)
         foster competition among generators.

The proposed Bank-supported project would finance only the second o f three phases o f line
construction (see section B.3 below) and full benefits will not be realized until all three stages
are operational. However, partial improvements in terms of electricity transfers, loss reduction
and reducedoutages are anticipated as a result of Phase I1completion, and the project is also
expected to contribute to the advancement o f policy reforms. The monitoring indicators related
to outcomes include:

    0    Reduction inline losses inthe overall N/S interconnector from 8.8% to 6.5%.
    0    Increased transfer o f electricity from generating plants in the north to markets in the
         central (Karaganda) and southern regions - transmission capacity to increase from
         existing 650 MW to 750 MW on completion o f Phase Iandto 850 MW on completion of
         Phase 11. The maximum transfer capacity would be 1,350 MW upon completion o f the
         second line.
    0    Reduction inthe frequency o f emergency outages in the entire N/S interconnector (from
         the average 13 inrecent years to 10by 2008 and 8 by2009).
    0    Adoption o f a satisfactory methodology for setting transmission tariffs in accordance
         with the principlesdefined above bythe first quarter of2006.
    0    Introduction o f a real time balancing marketbyDecember 31,2007.

3. Project components

The entire N/S project includes the construction o f 1,115 km of overhead 500 kV, single circuit
alternate current (AC) line and upgrades of four highvoltage air-insulated substations (1150/500
kV Ekibastuz, 500 kV Agadyr, 500 kV YukGRES and 500 kV Shu). The project is to be carried
out inthree phases: Phase I(YukGRES-Shu, 250 km), Phase I1(Ekibastuz-Agadyr, 475 km) and
Phase I11 (Agadyr-YukGRES, 390 km). The map in Annex 15 provides a schematic of the
proposedroute.

Total cost o f the entire project (including taxes and contingencies) i s estimated at US$347.0
million (Phase I:    US$90.5 million, Phase 11: US$160.8 million and Phase 111: US$95.7 million).
In March 2004, KEGOC signed loan agreements with EBRD and the Development Bank of
Kazakhstan (DBK) for a total ofUS$81 million to finance Phase Iconstruction.




  A special working group consisting o f representatives o f KEGOC, the GOK and ARNM developed a proposal to
implement zonal (nodal) pricing for transmission services. Under this concept, all generators and consumers within
a zone (defined as having no internal transmission constraints) face the same transmission price, which may differ
between zones. The advantage o f nodal prices i s that they define the value o f the transmission connecting adjacent
nodes and provide an appealing solution to two difficult problems: how to signal where consumers and generators
should locate, and how to decide when and where to build additional transmission capacity. The working group has
identified eight zones based on three major criteria: (i)  supply deficit within the region; (ii)   constraints on the
capacity o f transmission links to other regions; and (iii)
                                                         capacity constraints on intra-regional transmission.

Phase I1(the Bank-supported subject project) involves construction o f 475 km o f overhead lines
between Ekibastuz and Agadyr substations and modernization o f 500 kV outdoor switchgear at
both substations.

The specific components of the Phase I1project include (a more detailed description i s provided
inAnnex 4):

ComponentA. Constructionof 500 kV OverheadSingleCircuitTransmissionLine
(estimatedcost: US$113.8million,of which the Bankwill financeUS$99.5million)

Specifically, this component involves construction o f a new 475 km 500 kV single circuit
overhead line (OHL) from the air-insulated substation Ekibastuz (1,150/500 kV) to the air-
insulated substation Agadyr (500 kV), including a Fiber Optic Communication Line. The line
will be constructed using steel portal guyed towers. The arrangement o f the phase wires is
horizontal. The OHL will be lightning-protected by means o f two overhead ground wires along
the entire transmissionline. Fiber Optic Cable will bebuilt inone o fthe overhead groundwires.

ComponentB. Extension/Modernizationof 1,150/500 kV EkibastuzAir-Insulated
Substation(estimatedcost: US$13.2 millionfinancedby KDB and KEGOC)

This component involves expanding the existing 1,150/500 kV substation at Ekibastuz by three
bays and installing shunt reactors (3x60 MVAR) to accommodate the new 500 kV link with the
Agadyr substation. The existing 1,150 kV switchgear is presentlyoperated at 500 kV. The work
will include installation SF6 circuit breakers; disconnect switches, current transformers, voltage
transformers, three single-phase shunt reactors as well as substation automation and protective
relaying and a Power Line Carrier (PLC). Installation o f shunt reactors will improve the stability
o f the power grid and will regulate voltage conditions o f the transmission system.

ComponentC. Extension/Modernizationof 500 kV Agadyr Air-Insulated Substation
(estimatedcost: US$32.7 millionfinancedby KDB andKEGOC)

This component involves expanding the existing 500 kV substation at Agadyr by six bays to
accommodate the new 500 kV link with the Ekibastuz and YuKGRES substations. Three new
shunt reactors (3x60 MVAR) would be installed, with two shunt control reactors connected to
the busbar and the third shunt reactor connected to the Agadyr-YuKGRES line. The work will
include installation o f SF6 circuit breakers, disconnect switches, current and voltage
transformers, shunt reactors and substation automation and protective relaying as well as PLC.
Installation o f shunt reactors will improve the stability o f the power grid and will regulate
voltage conditions o fthe transmission system.

ComponentD. TechnicalAssistance (US$0.9 million)

This component would include consulting services for (i)      procurement and project management
for the construction o f the 500 kV O H L between Ekibastuz and Agadyr (estimated cost: US$0.5
million to financed by the Bank); and (ii)   further reforms o f the transmission sector (estimated




                                                 8

cost: US$0.4 million), including transmission pricing (zonal tariffs) and establishment o f a real
time balancing market.

Total estimated cost o f the PhaseI1project, including contingencies, up-front financing charges
and taxes, i s US$161.1 million. The detailed cost and financing tables are inAnnex 5.

4. Lessons learnedand reflectedinthe project design

With respect to lessons to be drawn from prior work in the region and sector, Bank experience
has shown that (i)    the need to coordinate amongkey government agencies canpresent challenges
that should be taken into account in both the project processing plan and in the ultimate scope
and design o f the project; and (ii)       competent and efficient national project management staff are
invaluable in ensuring the viability and sustainability o f the project and should be brought on at
an early stage. Prior experience has also shown the need for close coordination among co-
financiers inorder to ensure efficient procurement and implementation o f components, as well as
compatibility o f lending terms and conditions. Inthe case o f the proposed project, a significant
amount o f the necessary coordination has already been carried out by KEGOC, including
obtaining the approval o f the State Expertise, and obtaining support o f GOK ministries with
regard to the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment and project financing plans.
The project will also benefit from an established and experienced Project Management
Department, with a proven competence inthe implementation o f complex projects.

Prior experience in the implementation o f transmission projects has also revealed some specific
areas that require special attention, including the need for thorough analyses so that facilities are
designed and routed to minimize social impact. Also, commitment by provincial governments
and public participation are key factors to successful environmental management. All o f these
issues are to be addressed in the proposed project as part o f the detailed route selection and
environmental impact assessment. Previous projects have also shown that implementation o f
physical components o f the project can be expedited by paying close attention to the following
factors: (i) prompt government clearance; (ii)              effective design management to ensure a timely
delivery o f drawings; and (iii)      thorough design, investigation and preparation works.

5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Increased Generation Capacity in Southern Kazakhstan. A least-cost assessment was performed
as part o f the overall project pre-feasibility study prepared by RWE Solutions/Lahmeyer
International. It was assumed that the energy and peak supply deficit insouthem Kazakhstan can
either be overcome by (i) scenarios o f new and rehabilitated generation capacity in the
                                 various
south13or (ii)   construction o f a second N/S transmission line. Investment costs in the south are
prohibitive in comparison with the north both for rehabilitation o f existing capacity and for new
generation. Therefore, major investments are unlikelyinthe south inthe mediumterm, although
two small hydropower peaking plants (Moinak, 300 MW and Kerboulak, 50 MW) are planned
with an expected output o f 1.2 TWh per year, which will cover only a small portion o f the
projected deficit. It was thus established that the new N/S transmission line i s the best economic


l3 The options consideredincluded construction of new oil-fired steamturbines, oil-gas fired combines cycle
generation, and rehabilitation of existing gasloil-fired units at the Zhambyl power station.

alternative by a considerable margin. Its economic justification increases as (i) price at the coal
Ekibastuz coal mines decreases; (ii)       oil and natural gas prices increase (as actually happened in
the most recent years); and (iii)     electricity demand inthe south rises.

Increased Imports into Southern Kazakhstan.                  As an alternative to domestic generation,
consideration was given to the possibility o f increased imports o f electricity from neighboring
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, both of which have low-cost hydroelectric power. However, the
hydropower plants also supply water for irrigation, and are dispatched so as to ensure adequate
water supply to the agriculture sector. As a result, surplus electricity from these countries i s
available mainly on a seasonal basis and could not be relied on to rapidly growing winter peak
demand in southern Kazakhstan. In addition, the available hydro power export capacity in
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan i s seriously limited in relation to Kazakhstan's needs. Net imports
from Central Asia (currently about 1.2 TWh per year, all to the south) are not expected to
increase in the medium term. Possible new generating facilities in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
would increase the export potential, but these (including Sangtuda in Tajikistan and Kambarata
in Kyrgyzstan) are still at the conceptual planning stage and many major financial and
institutional issues will needto beresolvedbefore they can be implemented.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Part o f Phase I1 project financing (an estimated US$43.4 million)14 will be provided by the
Development Bank o f Kazakhstan (DBK) under a separate loan agreement between KEGOC and
the KDB. Funds from the DBK loan will be used for the supply and installation o f equipment at
the Ekibastuz and Agadyr substations, while funds fi-om the IBRD loan (US$lOO million) will be
usedfor the construction o f the Ekibastuz-Agadyr transmission line and related consulting work.
Fundingfor the remaining US$13.14 million of transmission line cost will be provided under an
EBRD loan approved by the EBRD on July 29, 2005 in the total amount o f US$87.8 million
(covering Phases I1and 111). This final amount o f the EBRD funding will be known only after
the actual cost o fthe transmission line is determinedunder a tender.

i s regulated by ARNM, which i s responsible for reviewing corporate plans and for setting and
implementing tariff policy. Company property consists primarily o f power transmission lines
(total length: 22,871 km), 69 high voltage substations, the National Dispatch Center and nine
Regional Dispatch Centers. Total assets as o f the end o f 2004 were valued at approximately
US$705 million. The operating revenue totaled US$125 million in 2004. The company has
about 4,400 employees.

The Borrower has performed satisfactorily under the ongoing Electricity Transmission
Rehabilitation Project hnded by a US$140 million IBRD loan (No. 4526 KZ, Project ID:
P065414) and a US$45 million EBRD loan.

Project Executing Agency.        The executing agency responsible for project management and
implementation for all three phases o f the N/S line will be the Borrower (KEGOC). KEGOC has
an established Project Management Department (PMD) which would be responsible for the
proposed project. The Director o fthe PMDreports directly to the President o f the company, and
the unit is staffed by specialists intechnical, financial, environmental, and procurement matters.
The PMD also liaises closely with other major departments o f the company including Finance,
Technical/Engineenng,     Legal and Planning.        The PMD has been responsible for the
implementation o f the ongoing Bank-financed Transmission Rehabilitation Project as well as the
Phase Io f the N/S line (financed by EBRD and DBK). The P M D will carry out the day-to-day
activities o f the entire N/S project, including procurement; project accounting and financial
reporting; disbursement o f funds, administration o f the Special Account, withdrawal applications
for disbursements and extemal audit arrangements.          The detailed organizational scheme for
implementation o f the overall N/S project is shown inAnnex 6.

Strengths and Weaknesses. The PMD has established and maintained satisfactory project
financial management (FM) arrangements and has been submitting satisfactory financial reports
to the Bank. PMD staff have gained experience with Bank procedures for FM, procurement and
disbursement. Audit reports, both for the corporate entity (KEGOC) and the project, have been
submittedon time and have been satisfactory to the Bank. The only issue i s that project financial
statements have not been generated from the entity's accounting system, but have been
summarized manually on a spreadsheet. This means that the entity's accounting system will not
have capacity to generate Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) unless some enhancements are
made to the system to enable automatic generation o f all reports without further manual
summarization.     Although under the ongoing rehabilitation project the PMD has submitted
Project Management Reports (PMR) on time these have not been accompanied by explanations
for the huge variances reflected in the reports. In addition, there has not been clear linkage
betweenphysical targets and financial information both duringplanning and reporting. Staff o f
the PMD will also needto familiarize themselves with the FMRs that will be required under the
proposed Phase I1project. These are slightly different and simpler than the existing PMRs.

Disbursement. Disbursements from the IBRD Loan will be transaction-based to finance eligible
expenditures for works and consulting services consistent with the Bank's new County Financing
Parameters for Kazakhstan.       To facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower will
establish, maintain, and operate a Special Account (SA) denominated in U S dollars, under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The SA will be held in a commercial bank acceptable to



                                                  11

the Bank. Applications for replenishment o f the SA will be made on not less than quarterly
basis. The SA will have an initial allocation of US$5,000,000. Once cumulative disbursements
underthe loanhave reached US$15,000,000, the allocation will increase to US$10,000,000. The
minimum size of application for direct payments and issuance of Special Commitments will be
10% o f the current authorized allocation o f the SA. Available loan disbursement methods
include reimbursements with full documentation, reimbursements on the basis o f Statements of
Expenditure(SOE) for small expenditures within agreed threshold and payments against Special
Commitments.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The PMD, with the assistance o f KEGOC management and the relevant GOK agencies, will
monitor progress against agreed performance indicators specified in section B.2 and Annex 3.
The PMD will provide, on a quarterlybasis, 45 days after the end o f each quarter, consolidated
reports on project implementation progress in the Bank's FMR format. The Bank will conduct
reviews annually during supervisionmissions. The PMD will prepare a detailed mid-term report
within 24 months o f project effectiveness to serve as the basis for a project mid-term review, to
be undertaken not less than three months later. In addition to the topics covered under the
quarterly reports, the mid-term review will include a review of the economic viability o f the
project, based on actual costs and benefits achieved to-date as well as any revised estimates.
Based on the outcome o f the mid-term review, measures will be taken to ensure efficient
completion o f the project. The PMD will also help prepare a Borrower's contribution to an
Implementation Completion Report (ICR), so that IBRD could complete the ICR within six
months o f the closing date of the Loan. The ICR would include an assessment of project costs
andbenefits, project execution, andperformances o finvolved parties.

4. Sustainability

The N/S transmission project enjoys strong support from the GOK.I5 In December 2002, the
ARNM approved tariff increases over the 2003-2005 period sufficient to allow KEGOC to
implement the project.          Owing to strong financial performance in 2003 and the slower-than-
anticipated progress on implementation of the N/S line, KEGOC proposed and ARNM agreed
that tariffs for transmission and dispatch in 2004 would be retained at the 2003 levels. InApril,
2005, the ARNM approved an increase o f 8.9% in the transmission tariff and 9.5% in the
dispatch tariff. The 2005-2007 Development Plan, which was approved by the GOK, envisions
further increases of6% inthe transmission tariffand 15% inthe dispatchtariffby2007.

Over the longer term, the sustainability o fthe overall N/S project will dependon:

    0     Preserving the financial viability o f KEGOC through timely adjustment o f tariffs in
          accordance with the pre-agreed schedule.
    0     Careful management o f the use o f discounts for transmission services.
    0     Continued growth inboth the domestic power markets andregional trade.



Is Under resolution No. 123 dated February 3, 2003, the GOK approved the feasibility study for the second NIS
electricity transmission line, authorized KEGOC to arrange loan financing and instructed the ARNM to adjust the
transmissiontariffs inorder to ensure that KEGOC is able to finance the project and repay the debts.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancialanalyses(Annex 9)

Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR).                   The economic benefits o f the N/S transmission
project will flow primarily to electricity consumers in southern Kazakhstan. Taken in isolation,
the benefits o f the Phase I1segment o f the line (as well as the Phase Isegment) are relatively
small, consisting mainly of modest reductions in transmission losses and increased short-tenn
capacity to serve growing demands in the Karaganda and southern Kazakhstan regions.
However, once all three Phases are completed, the benefits are both more substantial and more
broadly distributed.

Giventhat the overall transmission link has been established as the least-cost solution to serving
long-term demand growth in southern Kazakhstan, that the proposed line and substation
improvements have been established as optimal from the technical, economic and environmental
perspectives, and that KEGOC i s committed to completion o f (and is already well on its way to
arranging financing for) all three phases, the economic appraisal focused on the costs and
benefits o f the N/S transmission project as a whole.16 The quantifiable benefits o f the project
include (i)  benefits to consumers in southem Kazakhstan in the form o f access to sufficient
electricity to meet growing demands (conservatively valued at the observed willingness to pay as
measured by the tariff less the marginal cost o f generation); and (ii)              reduced transmission losses
throughout the KEGOC network. The analysis estimates the project's EIRR at 21.4% and the
Net Present Value (NPV) at US$204 million using a 10% discount rate. Sensitivity analyses
indicate that the project could absorb either an increase in capital costs of 111%or a decrease o f
upto 39% incustomer willingness to pay for incremental electricity supply (the maincategory o f
benefits) and still maintain an EIRR o f 10%.

Additional benefits of the project include (i)           reduced damage to customer equipment as a result
of fewer frequency and voltage fluctuations; and (ii)               benefits to customers arising from reduced
forced outages on the main power line. Inthe case o f the latter, KEGOC data indicate that the
loss of MWhis relatively small; however, frequent outages could lead to higher costs for backup
supply for institutions/enterprises that would be adversely affected by an interruption (e.g.,
hospitals, continuous process industries, entities heavily reliant on electronic equipment). Since
individual customer data are kept at the distributor level, and there is no record o f detailed
surveys o f customer responses to lack o f reliability, these benefits have not been included in the
quantitative analysis. The reduction in transmission losses will also lead to a reduction o f
approximately 600,000 tons per year in the amount o f fuel used in electricity generation, which
in turn will reduce environmentally harmful emissions.                     Finally, there are resource savings
associated with the reduced need to use REK transmission networks for bypass during line
maintenance. However, because it was not clear whether the financial charges levied by the
REKs corresponded to the economic price, these benefits were not quantified in the economic
analysis.

Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR). Quantifiable financial returns to KEGOC include the
transmission and dispatch revenue earned on the incremental flows o f electricity through the new

line, savings inpayments to the REKs for use of bypass during outages on the existing line, and
savings in transmission technical losses (which KEGOC purchases from generators). Additional
savings are likely to accrue through reduced revenue losses, repair costs and ancillary damages
attributable to a reduction in forced outages. However, KEGOC does not maintain separate
records of these expenditures, and as such the benefits were not included inthe analysis. Based
on available data, the project i s estimated to yield a FIRR (nominal) o f 8.0% before tax. By
comparison, KEGOCs weighted average cost o f capital (WACC) i s estimated to average 5.8%
over the next 10 years. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project could absorb an increase o f
up to 23% incapital costs or a decrease o f up to 21% inthe benefits associated with incremental
transmission revenues for supply to southem Kazakhstan and maintain a FIRR (nominal)
equivalent to the WACC. At a 5.8% discount rate, the project's financial NPV i s US$71 million.

The FIRR analysis assumes that the transmission tariff will be constant inreal terms after 2007,
but infact, under Kazakhregulation, tariffs are to be set on a cost-recovery basis, andthe ARNM
has consistently supported tariff increases sufficient to cover both operating and investment
costs. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties with respect to future interest rates (which are
largely tied to LIBOR) and the importance o f an adequate revenue base to the financial viability
o f the Borrower, the Guarantee Agreement includes a covenant requiringthe GOK to ensure that
KEGOC's tariffs are maintained at levels sufficient to fully cover the company's cash flow
requirements (operating costs, debt service and self-Jinancing of capital investments) as well as
a regulated rate of return on netfixed assets. This will ensure that the financial retums from the
project remain sufficient to cover the company's cost o f capital.

The financial projections indicate satisfactory performance in terms o f cumulative cash flow
(with deficits in 2005 covered by existing cash balances), self-financing, and liquidity (as
measured by the current ratio).          Year-on-year debt service coverage i s also satisfactory.
Performance with respect to the more demanding IBRD definition o f Debt Service Ratio (which
measures current net cash flow relative to maximum future debt service requirements) i s below
the 1.2-1.5 level generally mandated by the Bank; however, this ratio is primarily a guide to the
Bank and to KEGOC which allows them to monitor and update projected financial performance,
and decide on the feasibility and timing o f future borrowings.

Return on Net Fixed Assets also falls below generally accepted standards. However, to move
immediately to an acceptable retumwould require substantial increases in nominal tariffs over
the 2006-2009 period, followed by stable to declining tariffs thereafter. The more moderate
program o f tariff increases assumed in the base case analysis (Le., the program approved by the
ARNM, which corresponds roughly to tariffs increasing with inflation) yields relatively low
returns on net fixed assets in the near term, but rapidly increasing returns after 2010. The chart
below shows a comparison o f the base-case projected tariff versus the tariff required to yield a
5% annual Return on Investment (ROI)I7 and also shows how the return on net fixed assets
would change over time under the base-case scenario.

The financial projections assume that tariff discounts on transmission services will not affect the
financial viability of KEGOC. At present, discounts are granted primarily for electricity exports

and international transit to Russia, which are transmitted over under-utilized lines and which,
based on existing power prices in Russia, would not be viable at the full transmission tariff.
These exports are expected to decrease once the new N/S interconnector is completed, as surplus
generation capacity inthe north i s transferred to markets insouthem Kazakhstan. To ensure that
any future discounts do not threaten KEGOC's financial viability, a covenant in the Loan
Agreement provides that KEGOCshall not grant tariff discounts on transmission services except
for those that are based on commercial considerations of the company.              I n no case shall
discounts be granted for transmission volumes which would either displace higher-revenue
volumes or require new investments in transmission capacity.

Financial Performance Covenants. The following financial performance covenants are included
inthe Loan Agreement: (i)      maintain a current ratio o f 1.4; (ii)
                                                                    maintain a self-financing ratio o f
20% based on a three-year moving average o f the investment program; and (iii)refrain from
incurring additional debt unless the debt service ratio, as measured by current net revenues and
maximum future debt service requirements,i s at least 1.2.

2. Technical

The Phase I1 project involves standard technology for high-voltage transmission line and
 substation construction.     Specifications for equipment are consistent with the design and
structure o f the existing network and include all appropriate safety measures. The design
outlined in the feasibility study has been approved by the GOK. The company proposes to
 engage a single contractor for the detailed design, supply and installation o f the transmission
line, which will ensure accountability and facilitate project management.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management and Reporting Arrangements (Annex 7). As part o f regular financial
management (FM) supervision o f the ongoing Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project, a
review o f financial arrangements o f the implementing unit (Project Management Department,
PMD) was carried out in March 2005. These FM arrangements include systems o f accounting,
 financial reporting, auditing, internal controls, budgeting and staff capacity.         The review
 concluded that satisfactory FM arrangements are in place. The PMD has an accounting system
that satisfactorily tracks the resources and expenditures o f the existing project. The PMD has a
 fully dedicated FMstaff who are part o fKEGOC's regular staff. The project accounting system
 is based on the Oracle operating system that i s used to maintain books and records o f account.
 The database i s maintained on a network for both the project and the company. The Chart o f
Accounts i s common to both as Oracle includes sub-accounts that are project specific. However,
the existing version o f the software does not allow for generation o f the Financial Monitoring
Reports (FMR) required under the new project. All quarterly and annual financial reports are
 generated using EXCEL spreadsheets, while Oracle is used for supporting information only.
Despite the shortcomings, the accounting system is capable o f recording all transactions and
balances, supporting the preparation o f regular financial statements and safeguarding the assets
 o f the project. Staff will, however, need to gain familiarity with the FMRs and explore the
possibility o f these reports being generated by the accounting system.

Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment was also carried out and KEGOC's capacity
was found satisfactory (Annex 8).

4. Social

N o significant social impact was identified at or in the vicinity o f the project sites.       N o
resettlement i s required under the project.   In broader terms, improved access to low-cost
electricity in southem Kazakhstan will both improve the well-being o f the population and
alleviate the competitive disadvantage that the region currently suffers as a result o f costly and
unreliable electricity supply. This in tum should increase economic opportunities in the area,
and stimulate industrial and commercial growth to the benefito fbothworkers and entrepreneurs.

5. Environment

The route o f the N/S interconnector passes through four regions o f Kazakhstan: Pavlodar,
Karanganda, Almaty and Zhambyl, largely within existing corridors. The route for all three
phases will be on state-owned land o f no or low agricultural value. None o f the land to be
utilized includes protected areas or proven mineral deposits. Furthermore, it i s far removed from
populated areas and hence no resettlement is required. Almost the entire length o f the line i s
pasture land (steppe). The route o f Phase I1(the subject project) passes through two regions,
Pavlodar and Karaganda, within an abandoned corridor o f a 1,150 kV transmission line (which
was largely dismantledafter the breakup o fthe USSR).

The chief environmental issues associated with project during construction are: management o f
topsoil (transmission line), dust and noise associated with the movement o f people, material and
machines, potential impacts from access road construction, clearance o f vegetative cover
(transmission line), management o f construction wastes and prohibition o f purchasing any
equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, in substations).          During operation,
issues at the substations are limited to oil leaks, noise generation and electromagnetic field
strength. Along the transmission line route, the chief issues are electromagnetic field strength,
and interference with migratory birdroutes.

The project is in full compliance with environmental requirements o f both the GOK and the
Bank. The Ministryof Environment (MOE) reviewed the final feasibility study for the overall
N/S project and approved it as a preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Prior to
starting construction, the MOE will require a final EIA, based on the detailed project design,
prepared by an organization holding a license issued by the MOE. The final EIA should also
accommodate M O E comments and recommendations made on the feasibility study.

Inaccordance with World Bank Environmental Assessment procedures, the subject project was
classified as category B, indicating limited impacts (largely during construction) that can be
readily managed through sound engineering design and construction. Consistent with a category
Brating, KEGOC prepared an Environmental ManagementPlan (EMP) inaccordance with Bank
requirements, including a detailed description o f the expected environmental impacts, proposed
mitigation measures, monitoring plan and environmental capacity improvements in KEGOC.
Public consultation was conducted with affected stakeholders and NGOs on June 28, 2005 in

               KAZAKHSTAN: North-SouthElectricityTransmissionProject

CountryBackgroundandDevelopmentStrategy

Kazakhstan has made significant progress in its nation buildingefforts since the break-up o f the
Soviet Union. It has developed an active legislature, albeit with limited political diversity, and
an emergingjudiciary system. The country's recent economic performance has beenimpressive
and its reform record i s among the best inthe FSU. Growth has been buoyant at about 11% on
average since 2000, with income per capita expected to be above US$2,000 in2004, 65% higher
than in2000. Growth has been driven mainly-but         not exclusively-by     oil production and oil
prices. Many industries, including electricity, food, construction, and banking, have rebounded
strongly thanks to structural reforms, economic stability and demand generated by oil revenues.
The country's public and private savings levels have increased steadily since 1998, providing the
base for a sovereign investment grade rating by two international rating agencies.

Kazakhstan has also achieved a great deal in terms o f structural policy reform in privatization,
the financial sector, pensions, public resource management, and the energy sector. The country's
economic activity over the past few years has been driven almost exclusively by the private
sector, with nearly three-quarters o f all investmentcarried out byprivate companies.

Over the past several years the GOK has created a vision for its future built around two key
goals: to become a full member o f the global economy through the adoption o f international
standards for its productive, financial and public sectors and to diversify the economy away from
oil and minerals. To reach these objectives, a four-pronged policy agenda i s being designed and
implemented, as outlined inthe Bank's Country Partnership Strategy:

Reducing losses in competitiveness through prudent management of the oil windfall and
increased public sector efficiency. The GOK's Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, the three-year
rolling plan approved with each annual budget, has focused on the level o f public spending and
non-oil deficit, and ways to increase government spending efficiency. One aspect o f this agenda
i s the GOK's commitment to increase transparency inoil revenue management.

Promoting competitiveness by strengthening the government's capacity to identijj and reduce
barriers to businesses andprivate investors. To ensure sustainable economic diversification, the
Government i s committed to maintaining its liberal trade stance and to measuring the success o f
its non-oil companies against their presence in world markets and their competitiveness relative
to imports.

Building the foundation for future competitiveness by investing in human capital and basic
infrastructure. Recently, consensus has been reached in the GOK that to achieve its long-term
vision capital and labor productivity must be enhanced. The agenda is ambitious. It aims first to
maximize the transit potential in Kazakhstan and lower the cost o f moving goods and services
through the reform o f railways, road management, customs administration, telecommunications
and electricity markets. The agenda also includes the modernization o f the health, water and
sanitation and education systems.



                                                 21

Ensuring future growth will not harm the environment and past liabilities are mitigated.
Kazakhstan inherited significant environmental liabilities related to past military, industrial and
mining activities, land degradation and desertification and water scarcity.          The National
Environmental Action Plan for Sustainable Development prepared in 1999 sets out some
remedial investments that are now being undertaken by the GOK.                 The authorities are
reassessing and updating the environmental agenda to prevent additional environmental damage
resulting from the economic exploitation o f the country's vast natural resources, continue to
ameliorate past environmental damage and put in place systems to monitor the environmental
impact of future investment and growth. This will include introducing international practices in
establishing cost-effective and sustainable environmental remediation strategies in key sectors
and regions inKazakhstan, addressing bothtechnical as well as institutional aspects.

Sector Background

The country began reforming the power sector in 1996, with a view to introducing private
participation and establishing a competitive power market. By 1997, the electricity generation
plants were separated from the former Kazakhstanenergo (an integrated monopoly) and
privatized, a state enterprise, the KazakhstanElectricity GridOperating Company (KEGOC) was
formed to operate the high voltage transmission network and regional distribution companies
(REKs)were established to take over the functions o fregionalelectricity supply.

At present, the electricity market operates on the basis of bilateral contracts between generators
and large consumers or REKs for direct sale o f power. Provided that they acquire access to the
KEGOC-operated high voltage network, large electricity consumers can enter the market and
shop for power. The GOK has also established the legislative, technical and organizational
infrastructure for a functioning electricity spot market, which will increasingly replace the
bilateral contracts. Presently, there are more than 100 registered members on the spot market.
In2004, more than 3% o f the wholesale turnover in electricity was conducted through the spot
market.

The key issues facing the power sector at the present juncture are those which face many utilities
inthe FSU: (i)   growing demand coupled with outdated plant and equipment (especially at the
generation and distribution levels); (ii)  system designs focused on meetingregional rather than
national power needs; (iii)    rising costs as a result o f high capital investment, inefficiency in
system operations and high hydrocarbon prices. These issues are particularly manifested by
growing regional imbalances interms o f access to cost-effective electricity supply.

Strong economic growth and increasing diversification o f the economic base have led to a sharp
upswinginelectricity demand inKazakhstan inrecent years. Total consumption grew from 48.0
TWh in 1999 to 64.8 TWh in 2004 (about 6% per year), while generation increased from 45.0
TWh to 66.6 TWh over the same period. While Kazakhstan has sufficient capacity to meet
domestic power demand, four-fifth o f the country's power generation come from the northern
part of the country, from power plants located in the coal producing regions and hydroelectric
facilities located primarily along the IrtyshRiver. Generation facilities inthe south are limitedto
small hydro, combined heat and power plants, and a high cost oil-fired power plant at Zhambyl

which is operated (with government subsidies to cover fuel costs) to meet winter peak demand.
Currently, demand exceeds supply inthe south by approximately 966 MW (almost 50% of peak
demand) and the deficit is expected rise to 1,400 MW by 2010 (even when optimistically
assumingthat 470 MW o f new generation capacity will come on-line inthe south by 2010). At
present, the deficit i s met in part by supplies from the north (635 MW) and in part by imports
from Central Asia (330 MW). At the same time, surplus electricity from the northern plants i s
exported to Russia. The table below shows Kazakhstan's electricity balance over the 1998-2003
period.

Inthe south, the supply deficit is expectedto doubleby2015 (to reachnearly 10TWh), as shown
in the table below in capacity terms. However, supply in the south is limited to 3,000 MW of
total installed capacity (of which only 1,600 MW i s operational) with most o f the plants obsolete.
Investmentcosts inthe south are prohibitive incomparison with the north both for rehabilitation
o f existing capacity and for new generation. Therefore, major investments are unlikely in the
south in the medium term, although two small hydropower plants are planned with an expected
output o f 1.2 TWh per year. Net imports from Central Asia (currently about 1.2 TWh per year)
are not expected to increase in the near term as they are primarily dependent on the water
released for irrigation from the Toktogul reservoir inKyrgyzstan. Energytransmission from the
north i s technically limited. The existing 500 kV N/S interconnector is already operating at
capacity, and its reliability i s low because of its single circuit design. Major interruptions on the
line have increased from 6 in 1999 to 18 in 2003 and have led to cut-offs o f high voltage and
severe frequency fluctuations.

               KAZAKHSTAN: North-SouthElectricityTransmissionProject

Background

KEGOC operates the high voltage networks (at the 1,150 kV, 500 kV and 220 kV levels) and
highvoltage transmission substations, with a total o f 22,871 km o f lines and 69 substations of
33.2 GW o f total capacity. The network consists of three separate parts: (i)  the western grid
interconnected with Russia but isolated from the rest o f the network; (ii)the northern grid
interconnected with Russia; and (iii) southern grid connected with the northern grid and
                                         the
Central Asia.

The southern regions o f Kazakhstan experience an acute shortage o f electricity while low-cost
coal-fired power plants in the north have surplus capacity. The existing N/S transmission lines
o f 500 kV (one circuit) and 220 kV (two circuits) which transmit electricity from the northern
power stations to the south have a limitedtransmission capacity of 650 MW which is insufficient
to cover the 900 MW annual power deficit inthe south. With electric loads rapidly increasing in
the south, the power shortage i s projected to reach 1,900 MWby 2015.
According to the pre-feasibility study completed in 2002, construction of a second 500 kV A C
power transmission line is the lowest cost andmost economic alternative undervarious scenarios
to supply reliable power to the southern regions of Kazakhstan.        The second 500 kV N/S

ImplementingAgency

KEGOC will be responsible for project management and implementation for all three phases o f
the N/S project.    The organizational scheme for project implementation is shown below.
KEGOC has a functioning Project Management Department (PMD), which would be responsible
for the proposed project. The Director o f the PMD reports directly to the President o f the
company, and the unit i s staffed by specialists in technical, financial, environmental and
procurement matters. The PMD liaises closely with other major departments o f the company,
including Finance, Legal, Technical/Engineering and Planning. The main functions o f the PMD
are: procurement, financial management, work planning, organizational support and coordination
among all project participants. The PMD has been responsible for the implementation o f the
ongoing Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project as well as Phase I o f the N/S
Transmission Project (financed by EBRD and DBK).

KEGOC has gained experience with the previous loans and its PMD has performed well. The
PMD will closely coordinate with the Modernization and Capital Construction Department
(MCCD) which i s responsible for the modernization o f substations and construction o f the new
N/S line.   The main functions o f MCCD are: work planning, designingengineering, and
construction including erection and commissioning o f the works. KEGOC management will
ensure that sufficient personnel are in place to efficiently carry out the project. The project
personnel have undertaken to engage qualified technical specialists in high voltage transmission
lines and substations both in the P M D and MCCD. The services o f a competitively selected
consulting firm will provide KEGOC with advisory services inprocurement and management o f
the project for implementation o f the transmission line component. Qualified consultants will
also be hiredfor the transmission sector reform component.

Summary and Conclusions. KEGOC's Project Management Department (PMD), which was
established to manage the ongoing Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation Project, will
implement the proposed project. The PMD is located in Almaty, but is expected to move to
Astana where the corporate entity i s now located. As part o f regular financial management (FM)
supervision o f the Rehabilitation Project, a review o f FM arrangements o f the PMD was carried
out in March 2005. The review addressed systems o f accounting, financial reporting, auditing,
internal controls, budgeting and staff capacity. The PMD has established a project accounting
system that is capable o f recording all transactions and balances, supporting the preparation o f
regular financial statements, and safeguarding the assets o f the project. The P M D has a fully
dedicated FM staff, who are part o f regular staff o f KEGOC, and who are familiar with Bank
procedures for FM, procurement and disbursement. The P M D has been submitting Project
Management Reports (PMRs) as part o f regular project reporting, including audited financial
statements, which are satisfactory to the Bank.

Based on the March 2005 review o f the FM arrangements, a review o f audited financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, and considering that the P M D has
satisfactorily managed the disbursement function, including the Special Account (SA), the FM
arrangements established by PMD are satisfactory to the Bank. However, staff will need to gain
familiarity with Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) that will be required under the proposed
newproject. Format and content o fFMRswill be agreed with the PMD duringnegotiations.

Current andProposedFinancialManagementArrangements

Country Financial Management Issues.            A Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA) for Kazakhstan was completed in 2002 and was disseminated to the GPK in September
2002. The CFAA provided many recommendations for improving the country's public financial
accountability, including, among others, strengthening external audit and public oversight,
strengthening internal audit within budget organizations, improving accountability for state-
owned enterprises and improving governance and transparency in government programs.
Currently the Bank does not place any reliance on audits conducted by the Accounts Committee,
the Supreme Audit Institution, and audit o f Bank-financed projects in Kazakhstan is conducted
byprivate sector auditors that meet Bank criteria for eligibility to conduct audit o fBank-financed
projects. Use o f project implementing units i s still prevalent, mainly as a way o f mitigating
against risks associated with capacity limitations.

Implementing Entiv. KEGOC will be responsible for project management and implementation.
The company has a functioning PMD, which would be responsible for the proposed project. The
P M D i s headed by the Director who reports directly to the President o f the company. The PMD
liaises closely with other major departments o f the company, including Finance, Engineering and
Planning.    The P M D will carry out the day-to-day activities o f the project, including
procurement; project accounting and financial reporting; disbursement o f funds, including
administration o f the SA and withdrawal applications for disbursements; and external audit
arrangements.


                                                 38

Staffing.  In addition to the Director, the PMD is staffed with specialists in FM, procurement,
disbursement and technical matters. Responsibilities o f the head of FM include maintenance of
books o f accounts and records o f the project, preparation and dissemination o f financial
statements and PMRs, and timely audits o f the project financial statements. The head o f FMalso
manages an effective system o f internal control, ensuring adherence to established financial
procedures, and safeguarding the resources and assets o f the project.

Strengths and Weaknesses. The PMD has established and maintained satisfactory project FM
arrangements under the ongoing Rehabilitation Project and has been submitting satisfactory
financial reports to the Bank. Staff o f the P M D have gained experience with Bank procedures
for FM, procurement and disbursement. Audit reports, both for the entity and the project, have
been submitted on time and are satisfactory to the Bank. The only issue i s that project financial
statements have not been generated from the entity's accounting system, but have been
summarized manually on a spreadsheet. This means that the entity's accounting system will not
have capacity to generate FMRs unless some enhancements are made to the system. Although
the P M D has submittedPMRs on time, these have not been accompanied by explanations for the
large variances reflected in the reports. In addition, there has not been clear linkage between
physical targets and financial informationboth duringplanning and reporting. Staff o f the PMD
will also need to familiarize themselves with FMRs that will be required under the proposed
project, as these are slightly different and simpler than the currently used PMRs. It i s expected
that staff will require some training on the new reporting format.

Accounting Policies and Procedures. The PMD will maintain appropriate financial records and
accounts in accordance with procedures established by the accounting policy and normative
documents o f the company. These accounts and records will reflect the progress o f the project
and identifyits resources, operations and expenditures. Project accounts will reflect all financial
transactions during the project period separately for the IBRD loan and other resources, where
applicable, by project component and by expenditure categories. Accounts will be maintained
on an accrual basis and financial statements will be prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards.

Project Financial Reporting. As noted above, the PMD uses Excel spreadsheets to prepare the
quarterly PMRs. The most recent PMR (for the first quarter o f 2005) was submitted to the Bank
inMay2005. Underthe proposedproject, the PMD will prepare and submit on a quarterlybasis
FMRs that will be used for project monitoring and supervision. These reports will include (i)
project financial statements, including (a) Project Sources and Uses o f Funds, and (b) Uses o f
Funds by Project Activity; (ii)  physical progress reports (Output Monitoring Reports), in tables
and narrative form; and (iii) procurement reports, in formats acceptable to the Bank. The reports
will be submittedto the Bank within 45 days after the endo f each quarter. The first FMRwill be
submitted after the end o f the first full quarter after disbursements commence. Formats o f the
annual financial statements and the FMR will be agreed with the Bank during negotiations, and
will incorporate all components, categories and output indicators that are appropriate for
monitoring performance o f the project.

Planning and Budgeting. The P M D will prepare annual budgets in line with the Procurement
Plan, and these budgets will form the basis for spendingand requestingfunds from the company
for counterpart contributions, where applicable. These budgets, prepared in accordance with the
FMR format (disbursement categories, components and activities, financial sources, account

                                                 39

codes, and broken by quarter), will establish physical targets to ensure linkage between
expenditures and physical progress, and proper comparison between actual and budgeted
performance. Review o f actual results against the budget will be a key managerial tool for
monitoring financial performance o f the project.         Variance analysis will include narrative
explanations for significant variations betweenbudget and actual results.

Information Systems. The project accounting system i s based on the Oracle operating system
that i s usedto maintain books and records o f account. The database i s maintained on a network
for both the project and corporate entity. The Chart o f Accounts i s common to both as Oracle
includes sub-accounts that are project-specific. However, the existing version o f the software
does not allow for generation o f the FMRs. All quarterly and annual financial reports are
generated using EXCEL spreadsheets, while Oracle is used for supporting information only.
Despite the shortcomings, the accounting system i s capable o f recording all transactions and
balances, supporting the preparation o f regular financial statements, and safeguarding the assets
o fthe project.

Internal Audit. There i s an Internal Audit Division that i s accountable to President o f KEGOC
and to the Management Board. As part o f the continuous review o f internal control and
accounting systems activities, the project will be subject to periodic review by the internal audit
division o fthe company.

External Audit. There will be annual audits o f entity and project financial statements, and
separate reports submitted to the Bank. Audit o f project financial statements will cover all
aspects o f the project, including all funds irrespective o f source. Audits will be performed by
independentprivate sector auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (ISA) and the Bank's guidelines on auditing as stated in the guidelines
"Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World Bank-financed Activities" (June 2003) and
other guidance that might be provided by the Bank from time to time. The auditors' terms o f
reference (TOR) will be prepared by the PMD and cleared with the Bank before the engagement
o f the auditor. They will include both the audit o f financial transactions and an assessment o f the
operation of the FM system, including a review o f the internal control mechanisms. The annual
audit reports will be in a format in accordance with ISA and Bank guidelines, and they will
include a single opinion on the financial statements o f the project, incorporating the project
financial statements, including SA Reconciliation, and Statement o f Expenses Withdrawal
Schedule as well as a Management Letter. The audit reports will be submitted to the Bank not
later than six months after the end o f the fiscal year to which they relate. The PMD will provide
the auditor with full access to project-related documents and records and with the information
required for the purpose of the audit. A sample TOR for the project audit was agreed during
negotiations.

Financial Management Supervision Plan. The Bank will conduct risk-based FM supervision,
at appropriate intervals, to monitor progress o f project implementation. The FM supervision will
pay particular attention to: (i)project accounting and internal control systems; (ii)  budgeting and
financial planning arrangements; (ii)   review o f the project's FMRs; (iii) o f audit reports,
                                                                             review
including financial statements and remedial actions recommended in the auditor's Management
Letters; and (iv) disbursement management and financial flows, including counterpart funds.

Disbursementsfrom the IBRD loan will be transaction-based to finance eligible expenditures for
works and consulting services consistent with Country Financing Parameters for Kazakhstan. To
facilitate timely project implementation, the borrower will establish, maintain and operate a
Special Account (SA) denominated in U S dollars under terms and conditions acceptable to the
Bank. The SA will be held in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. Applications for
replenishment o f the SA will be made on a not less than quarterly basis. The SA will have an
initial allocation o f US$5.0 million.    Once cumulative disbursements under the loan have
reached US$l5.0million, the allocation will increase to US$lO.O million. Payments inexcess o f
20% o f SA will be made through direct disbursement from the Loan Account. Available loan
disbursement methods include reimbursements with full documentation, reimbursements on
basis o f Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs) for small expenditures within agreed threshold and
payments against Special Commitments.

SOEs will be used for (a) goods/works contracts estimated to cost less than US$l,OOO,OOO
equivalent each; and (b) for consulting services for firms estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO
equivalent each. Documentation supporting expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained
by the PMD and will be available for review when requested by Bank supervision missions and
project auditors. Detailed instructions on withdrawal o f IBRD loan proceeds will be provided in
the Disbursement Latter upon approval o f the loan.

The Borrower chose to pay the Front-End-Fee for the loan from its own funds.

                KAZAKHSTAN: NorthSouthElectricityTransmissionProject


General. Procurement for the PhaseI1project will be carried out inaccordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The various items under different
expenditure categories are described below.       During negotiations, for each contract to be
financed by the Bank loan, the procurement methods, prequalification and prior review
requirements as well as time frame and estimated costs were agreed between KEGOC and the
Bank under the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updatedat least annually or as
required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional
capacity.    Non-Bank project components will be procured in accordance with Kazakhstan
national procurement regulations.       A General Procurement Notice was published in UN
Development Business anddgMarket on June 30,2005, and will be updated at least annually.

Details o f the procurement arrangements involving international competitive bidding (ICB) are
shown inAttachment 1.

Procurement of Goods and Works. Goods and Works procured under this project, will
include: the supply and installation (turn-key) o f 500 kV A C overhead transmission line from
Ekibastuz to Agadyr (estimated at US$112.6 million) o f which the Bank will finance US$99.5
million. Pre-qualified contractordsuppliers will be invited to submit bids for this component.
Procurement will be conducted using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) for all
international competitive biddings. Procurement will be conducted using national SBD for non-
Bank financed contracts. The supply and installation o f equipment at the Ekibastuz and Agadyr
substations will be financed by DBK (about US$43.4 million) and KEGOC (about US$4.55
million), respectively.

Selection of Consultants. Consulting services would include advisory services to KEGOC in
project management of the construction o f the transmission line (about US$0.5 million). Short
lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract
may be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with provisions o f paragraph 2.7
o f the Bank's Consultant Guidelines. Consulting services related to transmission sector reform
activities will be financed by KEGOC.

Borrower'sCapacityto Administer Procurement

All procurement activities undertheproject will becarried out byKEGOC.

An assessment o f the capacity ofKEGOC to implement procurement actions for the project was
carried out during the preparation mission in M a y 2005.          The assessment reviewed the
organizational structure for implementingthe project. The mainfindings are as follows:

KEGOC has an established Project Management Department (PMD) that would be responsible
for the proposed project. The Director o f the PMD reports directly to the President o f the


                                                 42

company, and the unit i s staffed by specialists in technical, financial, environmental, and
procurement matters. The PMD liaises closely with other major departments o f the company
including Finance, Engineering, Construction and Planning. The P M D has been responsible for
the implementation o f the ongoing Transmission Rehabilitation Project as well as Phase Io f the
proposedN/S project.

KEGOC i s a second-time borrower from the Bank and has gained substantial project
management experience under the ongoing rehabilitation project. The PMD will manage the
procurement, erection of equipment/materials and commissioning, and will closely coordinate
with the Modernization and Capital Construction Department (MCCD), which will be
responsible for the construction o f the new transmission line and extension o f the substations. A
source o f possible risk is that these staff may not be fully dedicated to the Bank-financed project
and are also involved in other procurement/contract management activities in KEGOC. To
minimize this risk, KEGOC will (under Bank-financing) engage an international consultant to
assist with procurement and project management for the implementation o f the transmission line
component. In addition, KEGOC should ensure that a fully operational and adequately staffed
PMD is inplace for this project. Inthis regard, KEGOC undertook to hire (and provide training)
to two additional procurement specialists to reinforce the PMD's procurement capacity.

The overall project risk for procurement is rated as average.

ProcurementPlan

During pre-appraisal, KEGOC developed a Procurement Plan for project implementation that
provides the basis for procurement methods to be applied. It will be disclosed on the Bank's
external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Bank's Project
Team annually, or as required, to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Attachment 2 below shows the procurement schedule for the overall Phase I1project, which also
includes non-World Bank-financedprocurements.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f KEGOC has recommended at least one field supervision mission to carry out post
review o fprocurement actions.

                             Annex 9: EconomicandFinancialAnalysis
                 KAZAKHSTAN: North-SouthElectricityTransmissionProject

Approach

Taken in isolation, the benefits o f the Phase I1segment o f the N/S line (and also o f Phase I)                    are
relatively small, consisting primarily o f the ability to reduce line losses and outages on the
upgraded segments and provide limited increased capacity to serve growing demands in the
Karaganda and southern Kazakhstanregions. However, once all three Phases are completed, the
benefits are more substantial andmore broadly distributed.

Giventhat the overall transmission link has been established as the least-cost solution to serving
medium-term demand growth in southern Kazakhstan, that the proposed line and substation
improvements have been established as optimal from the technical, economic and environmental
perspectives, and that KEGOC i s committed to completion o f (and i s already well on its way to
arrange financing for) all three phases, the economic and financial appraisals focused on the N/S
transmission project" as a whole. The approach entailed estimating the economic and financial
benefits o f the project and comparing them with the associated incremental capital and operating
costs on a with/without project basis to determine the expected internal rates o f return.

ProjectCosts

Costs considered in the analysis include the capital costs o f construction, incremental labor and
materials costs for line and substation maintenance, major equipment overhauls, losses on
incremental transmission volumes, and, for the financial analysis, property taxes and VAT. The
specific assumptions with respect to each o fthese cost categories are as follows:

Capital Costs of Construction. The estimated capital costs o f Phase Iand I11o f the line are taken
from the feasibility study prepared by Energiya, and updated by KEGOC's Department o f
Development. The estimated financial costs for Phase Iare US$90.5 million and the costs for
Phase I11are US$95.7 million. Capital costs for Phase I1are based on the estimates provided in
Annex 5, which total US$161.1 million. For the economic analysis, the financial costs were
adjusted to exclude VAT (15% o f total expenditures).

Incremental Operation and Maintenance Expenditures.                     Incremental costs for operations and
maintenance o f the new line are estimated based on data provided inthe feasibility study, which
inturnwere based on detailed cost analysis carried out by KEGOC. Incremental labor costs are
based on an increase o f 71 operating staff, at an average wage o f KZT 430,00O/year.                            Social
taxes o f 14% are added to the basic wages. Additional materials were estimated at US$115
million per year plus 15% VAT. Major overhauls o f the new facilities are assumed to be carried
out at five-year intervals. The cost for major overhaul i s assumed to be 0.2% o f capital cost for
transmission lines and 1% o f capital cost for substations.




   Throughout the balance of this section, the term "project" refers to the totality o f the N/S transmission project,
including boththe Phase I1works to be partially financed by the Bank, and the Phase Iand I11works to be financed
by other lenders andKEGOC.

Transmission Losses. Transmission losses on the incremental electricity carried on the entire
new N/S line are included at an estimated rate o f 6.5%, valued at the cost to KEGOC o f
purchasing losses (recently, K Z T 1.1 per kWh). The 6.5% loss percentage i s based on the
estimated average rate o f losses anticipated on the N/S interconnector once the entire new line
has been completed. However, the cost o f these incremental losses i s partially offset in the
benefits calculation which anticipates an overall reduction in system losses as a result o f the
completion o fthe N/S line.

Property Taxes. Inaccordance with Kazakh legislation, property taxes are included at an annual
rate o f 1% o f net book value o f the incremental fixed assets. Net book value in each year was
calculated based on a 25-year depreciation period.

ProjectBenefits

Financial Benefits. The primary financial benefit to KEGOC will be the revenues earned for
transmission and dispatch o f the incremental power transferred over the new line. Inaccordance
with the 2005-2007 Development Plan, and the recent ruling o f the ARNM, transmission tariffs
to southem Kazakhstan were assumed to increase by 8.9% in 2005, 4% in 2006 and 4.5% in
2007, while dispatch tariffs were assumed to increase by 9.5% in 2005, and by 10% in each o f
2006 and 2007.           After 2007, both tariffs were held constant in real terms.                  Incremental
transmission volumes were taken from the planned electricity balance for southem Kazakhstan.

Once the new line i s completed, KEGOC also expects to save approximately KZT 210 million
per year which they currently pay to local REKs to provide bypass services during major line
maintenance.

Finally, it i s projected that completion o f the N/S line will lead to reduction intotal transmission
losses throughout the KEGOC system. The analysis assumes that transmission losses will be
reduced by 0.5 percentage points by 2008 (completion o f Phase I), by 1percentage point by
                                                                                  and
completion o f the overall N/S project."           Because KEGOC i s responsible for purchasing these
losses (KEGOCs transmission tariffs are based on energy delivered to the customer), reduced
losses will yield a benefit to the company equivalent to the amount o f the reduction multipliedby
the average purchase price (currently, KZT 1.l/kWh).

Economic Benefits.          Economic benefits are estimated based on the observed willingness o f
customers in southern Kazakhstan to pay for transmission services, valued at the average retail
tariff in the region (currently KZT 3.9/kWh). At full loading o f the line, the annual value o f this
benefit is estimated at KZT 14,040 million per year. However, because the additional demand
can only be served by incremental domestic generation or imports, the costs associated with this
benefit are assumed to include not only the capital and operating costs o f the new transmission
line but also the marginal cost o f additional generation. Given that there is significant surplus
capacity at coal-fired plants in northern Kazakhstan, this cost was assumed to be the short-run
marginal operating cost o f these plants -approximately KZT 1.1per kWh.




l 9This is consistent with the improvements anticipated inthe project monitoring programinthat it relates to total
system losses whereas the monitoring indicators relate to losses solely on the NIS line.

Additional economic benefits were assumed to accrue from the reduction intransmission losses.
The economic value o f loss reduction was assumed to be equivalent to the financial price
(currently equivalent to the short-run marginal cost o f generation), although over the longer term
an argument could be made for assigning a higher value which would take into account the fully
allocated cost o f new generating capacity. There are also economic benefits from avoided use o f
REK lines for bypass. However, it is uncertain as to whether the resource savings bear any
relation to the financial price. Since the amount was small, these benefits were not included in
the analysis.

Real versus Nominal Prices. While the Internal Rate o f Return analysis is generally based on
real prices (both economic and financial), the macroeconomic situation in Kazakhstan i s
currently in a state o f flux. Inflation, at 6% to 7%, i s higher than in OECD countries, but high
prices for oil exports, together with high levels o f direct foreign investment have led to large
inflows o f foreign exchange. As a result, the tenge is expected, at least in the mediumterm, to
maintain its nominal value against major currencies despite the relatively higher levels o f local
inflation. It i s difficult, however, to presume that this situation is sustainable over the longer
term. Either Kazakh inflation rates will approach those o f the developed countries or the tenge
will depreciate against foreign currencies. Inorder to address these complexities, it was decided
to calculate the nominal, rather than the real, FIRR o f the project.                 A combined
inflatiodexchange rate index was developed which assumed that the tenge would maintain its
nominal value through 2010 (ie., would appreciate in effective terms), and would thereafter
revert to the Purchasing Power Parity level whereby its value would be determined based on the
difference between local and international inflation. This index was then applied to the financial
revenues and operating costs o fthe project to calculate the nominal FIRR.

Internal Rates of Return. Based on the above assumptions, the pre-tax Financial Internal Rate o f
Return (FIRR) o f the project i s estimated at a nominal rate o f 8.0% and the Economic Internal
Rate o f Return (EIRR) at 21.5%. Table 1presents the details o fthe calculations.

Sensitivity Analysis. Switching values for the key cost and benefit categories were calculated to
determine the degree of change in the underlying assumptions that could be accommodated and
still allow the project to meet minimum standards with respect to rate o f return. For the
economic analysis, the minimumEIRR was assumed to be 10%. For the financial analysis, the
minimumFIRRwas assumed to be 5.8% (the estimated average cost o f capital to KEGOC over
the next 10 years). The table below summarizes the findings.

Non-Quantified Benefits. A number o f potential benefits were excluded from the financial and
economic analysis owing either to insufficient data on current cost levels or to their intangible
nature. On the financial side, these include savings to KEGOC inthe costs o f emergency repairs
and ancillary damages associated with forced outages on the existing N/S transmission lines.
While KEGOC does not maintain separate financial records o f these costs, it is likely that the
costs o f maintaining and dispatching an emergency response team are higher than those that
would be associated with routine maintenance o f the line, and hence that savings are likely to
accrue as a result o f the availability o f a back-up transmission line. On the economic side, non-
quantified benefits include (i)                                 reduced damage to customer equipment as a result o f frequency
and voltage fluctuations; (ii)                                   broader trade-creation benefits stemming from closer regional
power integration; and (iii)                                   benefits to customers arising from reduced forced outages on the
main power line. In the case o f the latter, KEGOC data indicate that the loss o f MWh i s
relatively small. However, frequent outages could lead to higher costs for back-up supply for
institutiondenterprises that would be adversely affected by an interruption (e.g., hospitals,
continuous process industries, entities heavily reliant on electronic equipment). Since individual
customer data are kept at the distribution level, and there i s no record o f detailed surveys o f
customer responsesto lack o freliability, these benefits have not beenincluded inthe quantitative
analysis. The reduction in transmission losses will also lead to a reduction o f approximately
600,000 tons per year in the amount o f fuel used in electricity generation, which in turn will
reduce environmentally harmful emissions. Finally, there are resource savings associated with

the reduced need to use REK transmission networks for bypass during line maintenance.
However, because it was not clear whether the financial charges levied by the REKs
corresponded to the economic price, these benefits were not quantifiedinthe economic analysis.

Projected Financial Performance of the Borrower

KEGOC's financial position has improved steadily since the company was established in 1997.
Profitability from operations has risen from a loss of KZT 4.9 billion (US$40.8 million) in 1999
to a profit o f KT 2.2 billion (US$16.1 million) in 2004.         According to audited financial
statements, the company had KZT 7.9 billion in cash reserves (US$58.6 million) at the end o f
2004.    Current assets exceeded current liabilities by a ratio of 2.5:l.       The company has
undertaken an ambitious capital investment program over recent years. From 2000 to 2004, it
invested approximately K Z T 33 billion (US$236 million) in upgrading and rehabilitating the
transmission network, and i s expected to invest a further KZT 12.9 billion (US$72.4 million) in
2005. Approximately 41% o f these investments have been financed from internal cash flow.
The remainder has been financed by IBRD and EBRD loans o f US$140 million and US$45
million, respectively.

KEGOC's tariffs for transmission and dispatch are set by the ARNM based on three-year rolling
Corporate Development Plansprepared by KEGOC and approvedby the GOK. The ARNM has
already approved a program of tariff increases that are projected to provide sufficient revenues to
cover operating costs and also to finance planned capital investments, including the N/S line.
KEGOC's record on collection of revenues has been excellent, averaging in excess o f 100% o f
billingsover recent years.

The key assumptions used inprojecting KEGOCs financial performance are as follows:

     In accordance with recent rulings o f the ARNM and the projections contained inKEGOC's
     2005-2007 Development Plan, transmission tariffs are assumed to increase by 8.9% in 2005,
     4% in 2006 and 4.5% in 2007, while dispatch tariffs increase by 9.5% in 2005, and by 10%
     in each of 2006 and 2007. After 2007, the base case assumes that both tariffs are held
     constant inreal terms. A switching value analysis was also carried out to determine the level
     of future tariffs requiredto fully cover cash flow requirements as well as a suitable regulated
     retum on net fixed assets.
     Wage and materials costs, as well as the cost o f purchasing losses are assumed to increase in
     proportion to growth in transmission volumes and are adjusted for inflation. However, cost
     savings associated with reduced transmission losses resulting from the project are also taken
     into account. Repair expenditures are assumed to increase inproportion to the increase inthe
     gross value o f fixed assets. Depreciationis calculatedbased on the value o f fixed assets, and
     the depreciation rates allowed under Kazakh legislation.
     Future inflation and exchange rates are based on recent (mid-2005) projections o f the
     MinistryofEconomy, supplementedbyanalyses bythe Bank's country economists.
     Growth in transmission and dispatch volumes are taken from KEGOC's Development Plan
     for 2005-2007. Longer term forecasts are based on KEGOC estimates which reflect both
     overall growth indemand andthe incremental impact of the N/S project.

   Apart from the ongoing major projects (transmission rehabilitation and N/S line), KEGOCs
   capital investment program is limited to small investments in system rehabilitation
   (approximately KZT 1.5 billionper year).
   The costs o f Phase I1 construction which are not covered by the IBRD, KDB and EBRD
   loans are to be covered by internally generated funds. Phase I11construction will be fully
   debt-financed by DBK (underterms already arranged for the Phase I1loan), andby EBRDon
   terms similar to those granted by EBRD for Phase Iconstruction (12 years repayment,
   including 3 years grace, at LIBOR plus 4.5%). The same terms are assumed for the EBRD
   Phase I1financing.
   LIBOR forecasts are taken from recent estimates prepared by Bloomberg. Projected annual
   debt service is calculated based on the interest and repayment terms o f KEGOC's existing
    and planned long-term loans.
   Discounts are limited to existing agreements and will not increase beyond the forecast 2005
    level o f KZT 3 billion.

One concern regarding KEGOC's projected financial performance relates to the proportion o f
transmission services that are provided at tariffs below the regulated level. Under the ongoing
rehabilitation project, transmission tariff discounts were restrictedto those that could bejustified
on a commercial basis (e.g., to ensure that power surpluses generated in the north were
competitive in export markets).       With the recent rapid growth in electricity exports and
international transit, there has been a significant growth in the volumes o f electricity transmitted
at discounted rates (11TWh in2004). KEGOC's justification for the discounts i s that electricity
exports would be uneconomic at full tariffs.        Furthermore, it i s argued that even with the
discounts, the export and international transit revenues more than cover the marginal cost, and
hence make a contribution to overhead and profit. At present, exports and international transit
are primarily serviced by under-utilized lines from Ekibastuz to Omsk in the north. Finally, a
portion o f the discounts (covering 1.8 TWh o f transit from eastem to western Kyrgyzstan) i s in
fact incremental revenue which KEGOC receives from the integrated operation o f the Kazakh
and Kyrgyz systems inthe south, which was previously serviced at no charge.

In the view of the ARNM and KEGOC, Kazakh electricity exporters are price-takers in the
Russian market, where import prices are set by the Federal EnergyCommission (FEC) of Russia.
Currently, the price i s 28 kopekskWh (approximately K Z T 1.3/kWh), which i s close to the
marginal cost o f generation and hence leaves little room for higher transmission charges. It i s
KEGOC's understanding that the Russianmarket i s not supply-constrained and that the import
price set by FEC reflects the marginal cost o f incremental domestic power. Since Kazakhstan
currently has surplus generation capacity, it is argued that the discounts are both commercially
and economically justified. KEGOC expects discounts to decline substantially (by about 23%)
in 2005. BetweenMarch and May 2005, KEGOC refused to grant discounts for exports from
Ekibastuz GRES I1on the premise that there was sufficient domestic demand to absorb excess
capacity.

Nevertheless, insofar as the proliferation o f discounts might be detrimental to KEGOC's future
profitability and debt-servicing capacity, the Loan Agreement includes a covenant limiting
discounts to those that are based strictly on commercial considerations of KEGOC. In no case
shall discounts be grantedfor transmission volumes which would either displace higher-revenue
volumes  OP  require new investments in transmission capacity.

Table 2 below presents the highlights of KEGOC's recent financial performance as well as
projected performance based on the assumptions outlined above. Pro forma financial statements
are in Tables 3-5. The financial viability assessment indicates that KEGOC's projected cash
flows, together with existing cash accumulations, are sufficient to cover both cofinancing and
debt service associated with the proposed project.

           KAZAKHSTAN: North-SouthElectricityTransmissionProject

Environmental assessment i s the only safeguard issue identified by the Bank for the
project.

The N/S interconnector passes through four regions o f Kazakhstan: Pavlodar, Karaganda,
Almaty and Zhambyl, largely within existing corridors. The route for all three phases
will be on state-owned land o f no or low agricultural value. None o f the land to be
utilized includes protected areas or proven mineral deposits.      Furthermore, it i s far
removed from populated areas, and hence no resettlement i s required. Almost the entire
length o f the line is pasture land (steppe). The route o f Phase I1(the subject project)
passes through two regions, Pavlodar and Karaganda, within an abandoned corridor o f a
1,150 kV transmission line (which was largely dismantled after the breakup o f the
USSR).

The chief environmental issues associated with project during construction are:
management of topsoil (transmission line), dust and noise associated with the movement
o f people, material and machines, potential impacts from access road construction,
clearance o f vegetative cover (transmission line), management o f construction wastes and
prohibition o f purchasing any equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, in
substations). During operation, issues at the substations are limited to oil leaks, noise
generation and electromagnetic field strength. Along the transmission line route, the
chief issues are electromagnetic field strength, and interference with migratory bird
routes.

The Project is in full compliance with environmental requirements o f both the GOK and
the Bank. The Ministry o f Environment (MOE) reviewedthe final feasibility study for
the overall N/S project and approved it as a preliminary Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). Prior to starting construction, the MOE will require a final EIA,
based on the detailed project design, prepared by an organization holding a license issued
by the MOE.        The final EIA should also accommodate M O E comments and
recommendations made on the feasibility study.

Inaccordance with World Bank Environmental Assessment (EA) procedures, the project
was classified as Category B indicating limited impacts that can be readily managed
through sound engineering design and construction. Consistent with a category B rating,
KEGOC prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) in accordance with Bank
requirements, including a detailed description o f the expected environmental impacts,
proposed    mitigation   measures,    monitoring    plan  and   environmental     capacity
improvements inKEGOC. Public consultation was conducted with affected stakeholders
and NGOs on June 28, 2005 in Astana and the Russian language EMP was posted on
KEGOC's website on July 7, 2005. The Bank received a satisfactory Englishversion o f
the EMP on July 6,2005, which was submitted to the Bank's InfoShop on July 7,2005.
