                         KEGOC has continued to operate the electricity Balancing Market (BM) in trial mode. Under this regime, the BM is undergoing comprehensive performance testing using the software
                         products Commercial Metering System, BM Siemens (internet-based) and Oracle E-Business IMS. The balance providers receive #test# invoices for the balance electricity bought on
                         the BM. Trial operations provide useful information on the expected balance amounts to be traded and the pricing range for balance electricity. Based on feedback from BM
                         participants, the market rules and softwares are continuously updated. Under GOK order, the BM will start live operations on Jan. 1, 2012.
