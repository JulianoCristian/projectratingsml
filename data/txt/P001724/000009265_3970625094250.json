Urban Development Project\n            aims to help the District of Bamako to improve urban\n            conditions in several areas.  It will first: (a) help remove\n            some of the major citywide infrastructure constraints to the\n            efficient functioning of Bamako; (b) facilitate private\n            sector housing and construction activities; (c) improve\n            local resource mobilization; and (d) strengthen the capacity\n            of key urban institutions.  The project, itself, will\n            finance several components. They include: (a) road\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction both in the city center\n            and the main access roads to the city center; (b) land\n            development and tenure regularization in various locations\n            totalling about 2,000 ha and 30,000 plots; (c) technical\n            assistance, training, studies, and equipment for the\n            District of Bamako, the Ministry of Interior and the Project\n            Unit.  This last component will help achieve improvements in\n            resource mobilization, garbage collection, and overall\n            coordination of the project."}, "docdt": "1986-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
