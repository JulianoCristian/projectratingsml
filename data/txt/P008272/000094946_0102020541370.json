Lessons address the\n            importance of continuity in project leadership, and staff,\n            for although the project suffered during preparation, and\n            implementation due to the constant changes of the Director\n            of the Tax Department, the continuity of top officials in\n            the General Directorate of Taxes (GDT), benefited project\n            outcomes. In addition, partly due to the lack of support by\n            the Ministry of Finance, the work of the Project\n            Implementation Unit could have been seriously hampered, had\n            it not been for its valuable professional staff, who were\n            able to assist GDT implement the last phase of the project,\n            including international competitive bidding, under severe\n            constraints. This leads to GDT management levels, where\n            priorities should be carefully managed, so as to ensure\n            that, given the limited human, and financial resources, the\n            most important activities are implemented. Nonetheless, the\n            project scope rightly focused on the implementation of the\n            new functional organization, and on procedures for a single\n            tax - the Value Added Tax (VAT) - to prod the success of GDT\n            by limiting the objectives, but retaining its capacity as\n            the new tax administrator, and, certainly the Bank's\n            approval on the use of cost savings to expand VAT systems,\n            allowed GDT to test its own (successful) managerial\n            capacity. However, incentives to retain qualified personnel,\n            be it training, or enhanced challenging work, remain essential."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
