      Project's objective is to assist the authorities to\n            sustain and enhance revenue collection in the short-term and\n            to improve tax and customs administration in the long-run.\n            This objective is to be achieved by institutional and\n            technological strengthening of administrative units in\n            charge of national taxes.  The strategy includes defining\n            the roles of the various entities, the collection and\n            taxpayer auditing areas, the improvement of taxpayer\n            services for the current tax structure, preparation for the\n            implementation of the value added tax (VAT), as well as\n            measures to improve the efficiency of the Customs\n            Directorate.  The project has five major components:  (a)\n            technical cooperation to implement the short/medium-term\n            measures to sustain revenue collection, and to reorganize\n            the tax and customs administrations; (b) technical\n            cooperation for the development and implementation of a VAT\n            that would replace the current turnover tax in 1995; (c)\n            technical cooperation for the setting up of two pilot units\n            to implement a computer-based system for monitoring\n            compliance with basic tax obligations; (d) training for both\n            tax and customs officers; and (e) purchase of vehicles,\n            equipment and materials and any necessary refurbishing of\n            buildings to accommodate the equipment for both tax and\n            customs directorates."}, "docdt": "1994-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
