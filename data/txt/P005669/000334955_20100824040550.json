The loan closing date was extended by one year to\n            June 30 1989 (one year behind schedule). The last\n            disbursement was made on October 17, 1989, at which time the\n            loan account was officially closed. Probably the most\n            critical determinant of the success of the ASAL was the\n            Government's commitment to the adjustment process.\n            Financial and technical assistance supports from the Bank\n            were welcome, and the reforms probably went faster and\n            farther than they otherwise would have because of Bank\n            participation, but the medium-term program always belonged\n            to the Government. Other lessons learned from the\n            implementation of this loan were less important, but useful\n            to bear in mind for the preparation of future loans. For\n            example, requiring legislation to be passed by the National\n            Assembly is risky because the Administration cannot control\n            the political process. Also, conditions should be easily\n            verifiable. Requiring full cost recovery when there is no\n            cost accounting systems in place makes evaluation difficult,\n            if not impossible. Finally, the loan agreements should be\n            written to allow for flexibility in the case of unforeseen\n            events (requiring price adjustments to world prices instead\n            of price increases would avoid-problems if local price\n            suddenly become higher than world prices)."}, "docdt": "1991-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
