within the framework\n            of a general macroeconomic restructuring program. The\n            principal objectives of the sector adjustment program are to\n            maintain the growth rate in agriculture in order to reduce\n            the sector trade deficit, within the overall macroeconomic\n            constraints on public resources. To achieve this objective,\n            actions would be taken, in both the short and medium term\n            to: (i) improve the prices and incentives framework; (ii)\n            re-orient the public investment program in agriculture; and\n            (iii) strengthen agricultural support services including\n            rationalizing the role of the private sector. Further to\n            this, actions would be taken to (iv) improve management of\n            natural resources of land, forests and fisheries; and (v)\n            build up institutional capacity for sector performance\n            monitoring and policy analysis. The foreign exchange\n            provided by the Loan would be used to finance general\n            imports based on a negative list and agricultural inputs\n            needed to stimulate agricultural production and raw\n            materials for the manufacture of irrigation pipes and\n            fisheries inputs."}, "docdt": "1986-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
