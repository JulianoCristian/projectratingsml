discusses\n            the impacts on the various environmental components, due to\n            the implementation of the Third National Highways Project.\n            The impacts have been identified based on secondary, and\n            primary data, and, further analysis carried out for the\n            project. It assesses potential impacts on climate,\n            topography, and natural drainage systems, indicating no\n            significant changes are expected in these areas. Conversely,\n            the loss of productive soil, natural habitats, and\n            bio-diversity, are major direct, and adverse long-term\n            impacts, but it is proposed that acquisition of fertile land\n            be minimal. Similarly, careful project design would avoid\n            adversity to cultural, and archaeological sites.\n            Nonetheless, during construction, it is expected that\n            temporary adverse impacts will occur on human health, due to\n            rising pollution levels, and vector borne diseases. An\n            analysis of alternatives is provided, and, mitigating\n            measures include slope stabilization through borrow pits, to\n            prevent soil erosion, and sedimentation. Measures will be\n            taken to minimize soil contamination due to oil spillage,\n            and selected waste disposal sites will be available.\n            Suitable design will minimize impacts on surface waters,\n            and, other mitigating measures include noise abatement, air\n            quality control, afforestation, as well as drainage, and\n            sanitation infrastructure improvements."}, "docdt": "2001-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
