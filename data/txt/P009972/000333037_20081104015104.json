      Project for India were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            lack of attention to human resource development in a period\n            of rapid change in the highway sector can constrain project\n            development implementation. The current shortage of\n            qualified manpower is out of phase with the enormous demand\n            of large infrastructure projects. The Government and\n            industry need to create incentives and facilities for\n            systematic training to increase the number of qualified road\n            engineers, and technicians. There is also a need for\n            competent environmental officers, an important career track\n            not yet widely recognized in the road sector. The assignment\n            of responsibility for sector studies and technical\n            assistance to the implementing agency instead of the sector\n            ministry can reduce the attention to a highway projects\n            broader institutional and sector development aspects.\n            National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was primarily\n            concerned with implementing the Ministry's policy by\n            building roads. It is not clear that the organization had\n            the capability to concentrate on monitoring and evaluating\n            the various institutional studies. Also, policy and planning\n            in the roads sector are the responsibility of the ministry\n            and the studies under the project were more in line with\n            this mandate than that of NHAI."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
