C. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
C.1   INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring and
institutional measures to be taken up during the design, construction and operation stages of the project
to eliminate adverse environmental impacts, to offset them, or to reduce them to acceptable levels. The
plan also includes the actions needed for the implementation of these measures.
The major components of the Environmental Managenment Plan are
• Mitigation of potentially adverse impacts
* Monitoring during project implementation and operation
* Institutional Capacity Building and Training
* Implementation Schedule and Environmental Cost Estimates
i Integration of EMP with Project planning, design, construction and operation.
C.2   OBJECTIVES OF THE EMP
The main aim of the Environmental Management Plan is to ensure that the various adverse impacts are
mitigated and the positive impacts are enhanced. The objectives of the EMP at various stages of the
project planning and implementation are as follows:
C.2.1  Design Stage
*  To have minimum impact on roadside trees, forestation and ground cover
a To keep land acquisition and building demolition at a minimum
l To provide maximum safety to the highway users and roadside communities as well as
segregation of local and slow moving traffic in the congested areas
l To develop a design that incorporates environmental safeguards and
* To provide mitigation measures to all expected environmental degradation
C.2.2  Construction Stage
To prevent and reduce the negative environmental impacts of the project by implementable
mitigation measures, to be carried out by the Contractor.
. To ensure that the provisions of the EMP are strictly followed and implemented by
strengthening implementation arrangements.
C.2.3  Operation Stage
* To prevent deterioration of natural environment components of air, water, soil, noise etc.
* To improve the safety of the highway users and road-side communities

F.    MONITORING. i-; u 4';AMME
The purpose of the monitoring programme is to ensure that the envisaged purpose of the project is
achieved and results in desired benefits to the target population. To ensure the effective implementation
of the EMP, it is essential that an effective monitoring programme be designed and carried out. The
broad objectives are
• To evaluate the performance of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP
•  To evaluate the adequacy of Environmental Impact Assessment
*  To suggest improvements in management plan, if required
*  To enhance environmental quality
* To satisfy the legal and community obligations.
F.1    PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (PIS)
The physical, biological and social components identified as of particular significance in affecting the
environment at critical locations have been suggested as Performance Indicators (Pls), and are listed
below.
*  Air quality w.r.t SPM, RSPM and CO
•  Water quality w.r.t DO,BOD and Coliform count.
*  Noise levels around sensitive locations.
*  Replantation success / survival rate
*  Erosion indices
* Restoration of borrow pits
*  Sedimentation rate in the downstream where bridges, culverts, etc are built
* Vital statistics on health
*  Accident frequency
F.2   SELECTION OF INDICATORS FOR MONITORING
Listed below are the environmental parameters that may be qualitatively and quantitatively measured
and compared over a period of time. These have been selected as Performance Indicators (PIs) due to
their importance and the availability of standardised procedures and expertise.
*  Air Quality
*  Noise levels

* Flora
Following sub-sections describe each of these Pls in detail.
F.2.1 Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) Monitoring
Ambient air quality parameters recommended for monitoring road transportation developments are
Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Carbon Monoxide (CO),
Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Hydro-Carbons (HC), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Lead (Pb). These are to be
monitored at designated locations starting from the commencement of construction activity. Data should
be generated over three days at all identified locations in accordance to the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards formulated by MoEF in 1981.(Table 4) The location, duration and the pollution
parameters to be monitored and the responsible institutional arrangements are detailed out in the

F.2.3 Noise level Monitoring
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be carried out at all designated locations along all
contract packages in accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards, given in Table 6. formulated by
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 1989. Sound pressure levels would be monitored on twenty-
four hour basis. Noise should be recorded at a 'A' weighted frequency using a " slow time respon se
mode' of the measuring instrument. The location, duration and the noise pollution parameters to be
monitored  and the  responsible  institutional arrangements are  detailed  out in the  Environmental
Monitoring Plan (Table: 7)

F.2.4 Success of Revegetation
To ensure the proper maintenance and monitoring of the compensatory afforestation being carred out,
a regular maintenance and monitoring of the survival rate of the planted trees is being proposed upto a
period of 3 years from the operationalisation of the project. (Table 7).
F.2.5 Soil Contamination
Contamination of the soil, especially due to increased levels of Pb, Cd and Cr are likely due to the
increased traffic movement on the project corridor. The comparison of the concentrations of these
parameters before and after the project coming up would aid in arriving at the increase in
concentrations of these heavy metals, if any.
F.3   MONITORING PLAN
The monitoring plan for the various performance indicators of the project in the construction and
operation stages is summarised in Table 7 below.
