         objectives are to bring the economy out of its long\n            depression and to correct serious structural weaknesses by\n            putting unutilized capacity to work particularly in those\n            sectors that will produce quick and substantial incremental\n            foreign exchange earnings and initiating adjustments in\n            industrial and agricultural policies that provide a basis\n            for expansion of productive capacity. The Government relies\n            on the private sector as the main engine of growth, and has\n            attributed a greater role to market mechanisms, creating an\n            environment in which private initiative can prosper. The\n            loan would finance imports of raw materials, intermediate\n            goods, non-luxury consumer goods, capital equipment and\n            spare parts. Counterpart funds would be used for economic\n            development related expenditures in the public sector's\n            investment program."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
