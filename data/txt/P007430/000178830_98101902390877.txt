JAMAICA
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SULM'ARY
Borrower:            Jamaica
Amount:              US$76.2 million equivalent, including a capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms:               Payable in 17 years, including a grace period of 4
years at 11.6% interest per annum
Loan Description:   The loan would be in support of the Government's
program of structural adjustment as outlined in the
Development Policy Statement that it has submitted to
the Bank. The Government's principal objectives are to
bring the economy out of its long depression and to
correct serious structural weaknesses by putting
unutilized capacity to work particularly in those
sectors that will produce quick and substantial
incremental foreign exchange earnings and initiating
adjustments in industrial and agricultural policies
that provide a basis for expansion of productive
capacity. The Government relies on the private sector
as the main engine of growth, and has attributed a
greater role to market mechanisms, creating an
environment in which private initiative can prosper.
The loan would finance imports of raw materials,
intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer goods, capital
equipment and spare parts. Counterpart funds would be
used for economic development related expenditures in
the public sector's investment program. The Government
has requested Bank technical assistance to support its
structural adjustment program. A separate loan for
this purpose is being proposed.
Disbursement
Estimates:          The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.  It is
anticipated that the first tranche of US$50 million
would be disbursed within sixty days after loan
effectiveness. The second tranche of US$25 million
would be released subject to a review of the structural
adjustment program scheduled to be held in June 1982.
Disbursements for the entire loan are expected to be
completed within eight months of loan effectiveness.



- ii -
Risks:               Whether the Government will command the needed
administrative capacity to execute the Structural
Agreement Program is one type of risk that is present.
Another important risk is whether it will have the
needed national support to carry out the program .
These risks are acceptable given the administrative
reforms that the Government has begun to implement and
the willingness it has already demonstrated to take
politically difficult, but necessary, economic actions.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR
*P                                      STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$76.2 million to Jamaica for a structural
adjustment loan. The loan which includes a capitalized front-end fee of
1.5% would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 11.6% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A. Introduction
2.        An Economic Report entitled "Development Issues and Economic
Prospects" was distributed to the Executive Directors in February 1982.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.        After almost a decade of sustained decline, the Jamaican economy
is beginning to resume growth. A new government, elected in October 1980,
is following policies designed to bring the economy out of its long
depression, and to correct serious structural weaknesses. According to
preliminary data, the Government has halted the deterioration and the
economy may have registered some growth in 1981.
4.        The fact that the Jamaican economy deteriorated over nearly a
decade is particularly striking as the country is endowed with natural
resources, has well-educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the advantage of
proximity to the large North American markets, and possesses a relatively
developed financial system. By the same token, however, it also suffers
from considerable disadvantages. The openness of the economy makes it
highly sensitive to international price and demand changes. In particular,
the lack of domestic energy resources makes the economy very vulnerable to
increases in the prices of oil; imports of this fuel provide about 99% of
Jamaica's commercial energy consumption. Its labor and capital are
internationally mobile, and massive outflows of both have occurred.
Recently, the burden of the external debt at variable rates has also made
the economy more vulnerable to increases in interest rates in international
capital markets. In the face of these external pressures, the careful
management of the country's resources simultaneously to promote short-term
economic recovery, financial stability, and structural reform, is the
central challenge to the new Government.

B. The Jamaican Economy to 1980
5.        The economy of Jamaica was affected by severe disturbances during
the 1970s. The first years of the decade had repeated the brisk growth
performance of the 1960s, but the trend was abruptly reversed as a result
of external shocks and the impact of domestic policies. As a result, per
capita GDP declined every year from 1973 to 1980 and the cumulative decline
reached 26% by the latter year. On the external front, the increases in
energy costs in 1973-74 and 1979-80, the mid-decade recession in the
industrial countries that provoked declines in export volumes and in the
price of sugar and aluminum, and the increase in interest rates in
international capital markets, all affected Jamaica negatively. On the
domestic front, the Government's programs to tackle unemployment and
redistribute land coincided with the deterioration in the external
environment and eventually led to an overextended public sector and the
disruption of production; at the same time an increasingly populist image
of the Government destroyed the confidence of the private sector, both
domestic and foreign, contributing to reduce productive investment and to
increase the outflow of capital and skilled migrants.
Output, Unemployment and Inflation
6.        In 1980 total GDP stood 18% below the 1973 peak.  The expenditure
components of GDP (for which estimates only date back to 1974) show the
impact of the policies pursued; consumption expenditures increased their
relative importance at the expense of investment expenditures.   The share
of public consumption expenditures increased every year, from 18% in 1974
to 25% in 1980; the share of private consumption expenditures also
increased initially, from 68% in 1974 to around 74% in 1976 and 1977, but
it declined thereafter, fluctuating between 63% and 65% in 1979 and 1980;
on the other hand, the share of investment expenditures decreased from 22%
in 1974-75 to 12-15% in 1977-80.
7.        The agricultural sector was one of the few sectors whose output
did not decline during the decade. Overall agricultural production
increased at a trend growth rate of .7% per annum from 1970 to 1980. The
major components, however, showed contrasting trends: while export
agriculture (sugar, bananas, citrus, coconuts, coffee, cocoa, and spices)
declined at a rate of 4.0% per annum, domestic agriculture (other crops)
increased at 3.8% per annum; these trends, to a large extent, reflected a
shift in the use of agricultural land: while between 1970 and 1979 the area
devoted to export crops decreased 27%, the area planted with domestic crops
increased 54%. The remainder of the agricultural sector (livestock,
fishery, and forestry) declined at a rate of .4% per year.
8.        The poor performance of the export sector was heavily influenced
by developments related to sugar and banana production. Sugarcane output
declined throughout the decade, from 4.2 million MT in 1970 to 2.7 million
MT in 1980. The failure of the 23 sugar workers' cooperatives, created in
1974 to cultivate the land that belonged to the sugar estates purchased by



- 3 -
the Government in 1970 (45,000 acres, or about one-third of the sugarcane
area) was an important factor; these cooperatives were never endowed with
the managerial resources needed to operate effectively, and as time went by
cultivation practices and discipline deteriorated sharply. Other factors
contributing to the decline were inadequate prices leading to the diversion
of lands to other activities, the deterioration of cultivation practices
leading to the spread of plant disease and reduction in yields and, in
recent years, the unavailability of inputs due to the foreign exchange
shortage. Furthermore, the sugar factories that were bought by the
Government (80% of factory capacity was eventually Government owned) were
managed deficiently and were progressively run down, compounding the
problems of the subsector. Output of bananas fell from 384,000 MT in 1971
to 69,000 MT in 1980. A major reason for the decline was the diversion of
banana lands to agricultural production for the domestic market, also a
result of inadequate prices. In addition, yields fell as a consequence of
the deterioration in the quality of services provided by the state-owned
Banana Company, the scarcity of inputs and equipment due to the foreign
exchange shortage, and--in 1980-the devastating impact of Hurricane
Allen. The problems affecting the production of sugar and bananas were, to
a large extent, similar to those affecting other export crops. Farmgate
prices were regulated by the external marketing organizations and, in an
inflationary environment, they lagged behind farmgate prices for domestic
crops. Besides, productive activities related to export crops took place
in an increasingly regulated environment characterized by the expansion of
the non-marketing functions of the external marketing organizations, that
now include direct involvement in production, supply of inputs, credit,
insurance, extension, and research.
9.        The role of the bauxite/alumina sector as a leading force in the
economic development of Jamaica came to an abrupt end in 1974. Between
1970 and 1974 the sector grew at an average real rate of 9.7%, continuing a
pattern established in the 1960s. Bauxite/alumina real value added fell by
37% in 1975-1976. Output recovered, particularly in 1977 and 1980 but even
in this last year sectoral value added was still 15% below the 1974 level.
Three major factors account for the decline in Jamaica's bauxite/alumina
industry: the tendency of aluminum producers to diversify their sources of
alumina supply, the 1975 recession in the industrial countries, and the
bauxite levy imposed by the Government of Jamaica in 1974.
10.       The most important factor was the imposition by the Government of
Jamaica of a bauxite production levy in 1974. Some--but not all--of the
other major producing countries followed suit; as a result, Jamaica's
competitive position deteriorated while Australia, Brazil and Guinea
improved theirs. Jamaica's share in the world bauxite and alumina trade
declined from 18% and 10% in 1974, to 13% and 7% in 1979. On the credit
side, the bauxite production levy increased more than fivefold the
Government revenues originating in the sector, from an average of US$33
million in 1969-73 to US$170 million in 1974-79. In late 1979, the
Government of Jamaica negotiated an agreement with the companies that
resulted in a reduction of the levy rates.



- 4 -
11.       Total manufacturing production peaked in 1973; by 1980 the
sector's output was 31% below the 1973 peak. The general decline of the
economy caused, and was fed by, the contraction in manufacturing; although
the apparent cause was the unavailability of imported inputs due to the
shortage of foreign exchange, the root of the problem lay in the shocks
,undergone by the economy. Frequent labor unrest, unavailability of skilled
manpower (caused by intensified emigration) and the deterioration of the
country's infrastructure, compounded the sector's problems. The
unfavorable investment climate led producers to shelve expansion plans.
Although manufactured exports registered some growth during the period,
they did not compensate for the decline in the domestic economy. The
import-substituting-oriented industries set up in the 1950s and 1960s were
ill prepared to face the challenge of world markets. Besides, the
structure of incentives, resulting from a protective system based on
quantitative restrictions to imports, made sales to extraregional markets
less profitable than sales to the sheltered but limited CARICOM market, and
these in turn less profitable than sales to the domestic market.
12.       The decline in economic activity increased unemployment from 22%
in 1973 to 27-28% in 1979-80. Joblessness is even more acute for some
groups; the 1980 unemployment rates for youths aged 14 to 19 and for women
were, respectively, 60% and 39%. However, Jamaican statistics overestimate
unemployment compared to data from other countries because both the labor
force and the unemployed include non-seekers of work (those persons who
although not looking for work, wanted work and were in a position to accept
work during the survey week.) If this group is netted out, the official
unemployment rate for 1980 would be nearly halved.
13.       Inflation was moderate in 1970-72, but increased to 27%in 1973.
After a period of generally improved price performance, in 1978 the
December to December inflation rate jumped to 50% reflecting the impact of
the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar during that year and the elimination
of subsidies on some consumer goods. In 1980 the inflation rate was 29%.
Public Finances
14.       The financial performance of the Jamaican Central Government was
weak during FY73/74 - FY80/81, deteriorating sharply between FY74/75 and
FY76/77. Large increases in both current and capital expenditure--
associated with the Government's new social programs-- outpaced revenue
growth. As a result, the current account, which had registered a surplus
in FY74/75, showed a deficit equal to 6% of GDP in FY76/77; the overall
deficit increased from 8.6% of GDP to 19% of GDP in the same two year
period. As financial performance declined, the Government relied
increasingly on domestic financing, mostly from the banking system. During
FY77/78 and FY78/79 the Government took a number of measures to increase
revenues and control expenditures in order to correct the fiscal imbalance
and stabilize the economy. By FY78/79 the current account deficit had
decreased to 2.6% of GDP and the overall deficit to a share of 13.7%



15.       In spite of a program which in FY79/80 aimed to improve further
the financial performance of the Central Government, the fiscal position
weakened. The current account deficit rose to 4% of GDP and the overall
deficit increased to 12.4%. Current expenditures were higher than pro-
jected, in part owing to higher interest payments that reflected conditions
in international capital markets but also because of the Government's
inability to restrict wage increases and spending on goods and services,
some of the latter to repair flood damage. The financial performance of
the Central Government deteriorated further in FY80/81.  The growth of cur-
rent expenditures was 20%, while revenues rose only 5%. Thus, the current
account deficit increased to 8.1% of GDP and the overall deficit rose to
about 18.1% of GDP.
External Sector
16.       In 1973-1980 Jamaica's balance of payments was under continuous
pressure. The reasons were: poor export performance reflecting
unfavorable conditions in the international economy as well as the impact
of domestic policies; a sharply rising oil bill provoked by higher oil
prices and a lack of exploited domestic energy resources; mounting debt-
service caused by increased recourse to public capital inflows aggravated
by the surge of interest rates in international capital markets; and pri-
vate capital outflows caused by the deterioration in private sector confi-
dence. By 1976, an acute scarcity of foreign exchange became apparent and
in 1977 and 1978, stabilization policies adopted by the Government and the
refinancing of commercial debt eased the shortage, although the situation
remained serious. But in 1979 and 1980 the balance of payments position
deteriorated significantly again, after the stabilization efforts
weakened,and the foreign exchange shortage became ever more serious.
17.       The current account of the balance of payments showed a
deficit every year during the decade. The deficit reached a high of US$335
million, 11% of GDP, in 1976. The principal reasons for this
deterioration were the decline in volume of the major export commodities
and the increase in the oil import bill. The volume of exports of goods
showed a declining trend after 1974. Primarily as a result of the
producers' reactions to the bauxite levy, by 1976 the volume of bauxite and
alumina exports had dropped 25% below the 1974 level, when they had
accounted for about two-thirds of export value. In spite of some recovery,
1980 export volumes of bauxite and alumina were still significantly below
the 1973 levels. In 1980 the volumes of sugar and banana exports were off
by more than one-half and more than three-fourths the peak levels of 1970.
The volume of imports contracted sharply during the decade, reflecting the
poor export performance and the adverse movement in the terms of trade.
Import controls were progressively tightened in an attempt to allocate the
increasingly scarce foreign exchange to priority uses. The volume of
nonoil imports in 1980 had fallen 61% below the 1970 level, and shortages
of imported goods, particularly inputs and spare parts were crippling the
economy.



- 6 -
18.       The large and sustained current account deficits in the balance
of payments were partially offset by inflows of official capital and losses
of international reserves. As a result, Jamaica's external debt increased
from US$349 million (17% of GDP) at the end of 1973 to an estimated
US$1,209 million (46% of GDP) by the end of 1980, of which the Bank held
,14%.  The debt service ratio increased to 16% by 1979.  The ratio dropped
to 12% in 1980, largely because of the deferment of about US$100 million in
payments due. Losses in net international reserves also financed the
current account deficits; at the end of 1980 these stood at US$-532
million, including US$114 million of commercial arrears, compared to US$37
million at the end of 1973. Gross reserves had been reduced to about one
months' imports by the end of 1980.
C. Economic Performance in 1981
19.       In 1981 the Jamaican economy grew for the first time since 1973.
Real GDP growth is preliminarily estimated at 1.3%. Most major productive
sectors increased in response to the general improvement in business
confidence and the increase in the availability of imports. Construction
(6%) was the leading sector, but important gains were also registered by
domestic agriculture and manufacturing. The sectors that did not grow were
export agriculture where output (and exports) of sugar continued to decline
reflecting the lack of easy solutions to the deep structural problems that
affect this crop (paras 58-63); electricity and water, where the frequent
power outages resulted in outputs lower than demands; and Government
services, where a reduction reflected the Government's policy of reducing
public sector employment to the extent of the attrition rate of the labor
force.
20.       Unemployment and inflation have decreased, the former modestly
but the latter dramatically. In April 1981 the unemployment rate stood at
26.2%, that is 1.7 percentage points less than a year before; during the
twelve month period 40,000 new jobs were created.   The inflation rate
declined substantially in 1981 as a result of the increase in the
availability of goods, both imported and domestically produced; the
December to December increase in the All Jamaica Consumer Price Index was
6%, compared to an increase of 29% in 1980.
21.       The fiscal position of the Central Government is improving in
FY81/82. Tax revenues would increase about 20% over the previous year.
The increase would reflect the growth in economic activity and better tax
administration, in particular increased collection efforts. At the same
time, receipts from the bauxite levy are expected to increase
substantially, in the last three months of the fiscal year, as a result of
increased bauxite production related to the US Government's decision to
increase its stockpile. Current expenditures are expected to increase less
than 10%, as a result of the Government's strict incomes policy, the
reduction in real subsidy levels and other expenditure control efforts.



Accordingly, the budgetary deficit would decline from about 8% of GDP in
1980/81 to about 4.0% in FY81/82. Despite some increase in capital
expenditures, largely reflecting an increase in capital transfers to meet
the financial requirements of the nonfinancial public enterprises, the
overall deficit is expected to drop from about 18% of GDP, in 1980/81 to
about 15% in 1981/82. The Government is financing the deficit primarily
through external sources (special balance of payments assistance,
commercial banks, and project-related inflows) and through other domestic
sources. In keeping with the IMF program the level of banking system
support will have been substantially reduced from J$485 million in FY80/81
to about J$140 million in FY81/82.
22.       In contrast, balance of payments performance has sharply
deteriorated in 1981 with a near doubling of the current account deficit to
US$410 million, or about 14% of GDP. This deterioration had been partially
anticipated, but export performance fell short of the projections made at
the beginning of the year. Exports of goods and non-factor services only
increased by 3% in nominal terms. Exports of bauxite and alumina grew
marginally because of the depressed world market. Production (and exports)
of the two major export crops, sugar and bananas continued the declining
trend of the last decade. Tourism, in spite of some growth, still shows
the continued effects of the adverse climate of 1980 and the depressed
levels of economic activity in most source countries. Imports of goods and
nonfactor services rose sharply, increasing by nearly 20% in nominal terms
and by 14% in real terms. Liberalization of licensing and foreign exchange
restrictions facilitated an inventory buildup, the satisfaction of pent up
consumer demand and the availability of the inputs needed to support
economic recovery. The volume of food and other consumer goods imports
rose by 41% and 35% respectively. Capital goods imports increased by 38%
in real terms and imports of raw material were also up sharply. The value
of fuel imports remained constant at the 1980 level; volume declined mostly
because of continued conservation efforts.
23.       Net capital inflows are estimated to total about US$325 million.
At the March 1981 meeting of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in
Economic Development donor countries and international financial
institutions pledged in special balance of payments assistance for the
Jamaican FY81/82. In addition, foreign commercial banks agreed to
refinance the Government's maturities due in FY81/82 and FY82/83 and made a
new loan of US$71 million to the Government of Jamaica. In spite of a
sharp increase in amortization payments, net public capital inflows are
expected to total US$277 million. Inflows of other capital have also
increased, primarily reflecting the sharp rise in no-funds import
licenses. As a result of the higher capital inflows, the loss in net
international reserves was held to the 1980 level, about US$75 million. At
the end of 1981 net international reserves stood at US-$607 million.

24.       As described in the previous section, the Government elected in
October 1980 faced grave economic problems. The cumulative effects of past
policy decisions and the evolution of the international economy since 1973,
had led to a severe balance-of-payments crisis that reflected serious
structural deficiencies. This situation impeded the utilization of productive
capacity and clouded prospects for its expansion as well as for employment
creation. By late 1980, the crisis had pervaded all areas of the economy.
25.       The main problems that demanded the new Government's attention
included, inter alia, a productive structure which needed to be repaired and
reoriented, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors; a
potentially dynamic tourism sector damaged by social and political unrest, a
decline in service quality, and the international economic situation; an
acute scarcity of skilled managerial and technical personnel, particularly in
the public sector, mainly as a result of massive emigration in recent years;
an unfavorable investment climate for domestic and foreign capital provoked by
a high level of political rhetoric coupled with trade union activism and a
deterioration of law and order; and persistent and large deficits in both
public finances and the balance of payments.
26.       The Government's overall strategy is export-oriented and relies on
the private sector as the main engine of development. The strategy was
designed and adopted in two partly overlapping stages. The first contained
priority actions that could be begun within two or three months and was
supported by an Extended Agreement reached in March 1981 with the IMF. This
program focused on the need to reverse the economy's decline and gradually to
restore financial viability. Total IMF support amounted to SDR 536 million.
The second and longer term program is related to the proposed SAL. It
emphasizes actions to overcome the deficiencies in Jamaica's economic
structure.
27.       The first stage of the strategy is described in the Economic Policy
Memorandum attached to the Statement on Development Policies (Annex V), and
was prepared in connection with the March 1981 agreement with the IMF. The
main objectives of this first stage were:
(a) To promote immediate increases in exports through the fuller
utilization of capacity in the bauxite/alumina industry, steps
toward the rehabilitation of tourism and of the sugar and banana
subsectors, and an increased emphasis on manufactured exports.
These goals were to be achieved by assuring the availability of
foreign exchange; reaching agreement with private sector firms
operating (or interested in operating) in these areas; reaching
agreement with foreign governments in areas such as double taxation
and bauxite stockpiling, and undertaking an active tourism promotion
campaign;

(b) To increase the utilization of existing capacity in industries
producing for the domestic market by providing the foreign exchange
required for importing inputs and replacement capital goods;
(c) To promote private investment, both domestic and foreign, through
the simplification of existing regulations and procedures governing
such investment, and the formation, on a bilateral basis, of joint
business groups with industrialized countries;
(d) To reduce inflation and to achieve financial stability by inter
alia, limiting wage increases; freezing public employment at the
March 1981 level; limiting monetary expansion and following an
appropriate interest rate policy; and maintaining a realistic
exchange rate, adjusting it if and when it becomes necessary to
ensure the competitiveness of Jamaican exports;
(e) To reduce the Government's involvement in directly productive
activities, except in the field of public utilities. To this end,
the Government has created a Divestment Committee that will seek the
orderly transfer to the private sector of productive enterprises
that are now Government owned.
Section I. C above, described the results obtained in 1981 through the
implementation of this first stage of the new economic strategy.
28.       The Government has also prepared the second, and in many respects
farther reaching, part of its economic strategy, that addresses the structural
reform of the Jamaican economy. As the formulation of the required policy
measures advanced, the Government began their implementation in a number of
areas. By the end of 1981, a substantial part of this second phase, the
Structural Adjustment Program, was already being executed.
29.       The program is described below under two main headings.  The first
-summarized in the following table-concerns aspects of the Program linked
explicitly to the proposed SAL; the second consists of other important planned
measures and objectives not directly linked to the proposed loan.

TO THE PROPOSED SAL
Savings and Investment
30.       As a middle-income developing country with a well-developed
financial system, Jamaica has the potential to generate savings to cover a
substantial portion of its capital accumulation effort. National savings
rates around 20% of GDP were not uncommon in the early 1970s; even in the
depressed conditions of 1977-79, private savings were always about 11% of
GDP. The rate at which the public finances are strengthened and confidence in

economic management is restored will largely determine whether the national
savings rate increases. Under the aegis of the program agreed to with the IMF
(Annex V-B) the Government is already taking steps to increase budgetary
revenues and limit the growth of public expenditures (para 33-35). Other
measures to strengthen public sector finances and mobilize increased levels of
private savings form part of the structural adjustment program. Under another
action program the Government seeks to increase after tax real returns on
financial assets and to eliminate obstacles to the development of capital
markets (paras 40-41).
31.       Gross domestic investment also faltered during the eight years of
Jamaica's economic decline. Decreasing levels of investment reflected
declining investor confidence, a shortage of domestic counterpart funds and
foreign exchange constraints. As private investment slackened, the public
sector was unable to fill the gaps. Financial, managerial and technical
shortfalls led to project delays which exacerbated cost overruns .
Accordingly, measures to rationalize the public investment effort, and to
stimulate private investment have been included in the Government's program.
Ca) Current Savings of Public Enterprises
32.       The Government is committed to improve the savings performance of
the public sector. In connection with the Central Government, the
Government's objective is to turn an estimated deficit on current account of
3.5% of GDP in FY81/82 to a surplus of at least 1% of GDP in FY83/84. There
is also scope to increase the savings performance of public enterprises
considerably, through tariff and price adjustments and cost reduction
measures. In FY80/81, the cash surplus generated by the 16 major nonfinancial
public enterprises was zero; eight ran current account deficits, the aggregate
of which represented over 1% of GDP. At the beginning of 1981 most deficit
enterprises were projected to continue generating dissavings.
33.       Action Program.  The Government is committed to eliminate the
current account deficits of selected enterprises in FY82/83 and to eliminate
all current account deficits in FY83/84. This will be achieved through the
implementation of specific programs to reduce costs and/or increase prices and
through divestment of unprofitable operations. Some measures have already
been taken. As of August 1, 1981, Jamaica Public Service Company instituted a
tariff increase in electric power rates of about 6% on top of the 1% monthly
escalation. On December 15, 1981 the Government decided to increase the
domestic price of sugar by an average of about 50% and further price action
will take place before the release of the second tranche. Significant
cost-reduction measures were taken in Air Jamaica, including the
discontinuation of unprofitable routes. The Government has prepared specific
action programs for Air Jamaica, Jamaica Public Service Co., Sugar Industry
Authority, National Sugar Corporation, National Hotels and Properties, and
National Water Authority.   Prior to the release of the second tranche the
Borrower will have prepared and approved programs for the Banana Company,
Jamaica Omnibus Service, and Jamaica Railway Service.  The action programs for
the Sugar Industry Authority and the National Sugar Corporation will be
reviewed then, considering possible changes in the international economy
(mainly the EEC sugar price and the exchange rates of the importing European
countries). In addition, and as part of the program to achieve the financial



- 17 -
rehabilitation of public enterprises, pricing decisions have been left to the
managers of those enterprises (excluding utilities), and the Government has
stated its intention to reduce the relative importance of the budget's
contribution to financing capital expenditures. In this connection, a
quantitative target has been defined: the enterprises will be expected to
generate surpluses large enough to pay corporate taxes, debt service, and
contribute 30% of the cost of investment programs after 1984. Overall, public
enterprises have been targeted to generate current account savings equivalent
to 2% of GDP in FY83/84.
(b) Establishment of Functional Medium-term Lending Institutions
34.       A major factor limiting the recovery of indigenous private
investment is the lack of mediumr-term credit. Existing institutions have been
ineffective. The Jamaica Development Bank was created in 1969 as the
successor to the Development Finance Corporation, which had become
decapitalized through poor lending practices. JDB was supposed to be the
Government's principle institution for providing term capital to the private
sector for industry, tourism and agriculture. It was capitalized with
financing from the Government and external sources, including the Bank.
Unfortunately, JDB fared not much better than its predecessor organization.
Its poor record on loan recovery forced the Government to suspend all new loan
commitments in October 1981. JDB's function now is to administer its own
portfolio and that of several smaller moribund Government institutions that
lent for small business like SIFCO, formerly Development Venture Capital
Financing, and SEDCO, which was merged with the Small Business Loan Board.
The record of Government development lending to the private sector indicates a
long standing tendency in Jamaica to treat Government loans as
non-reimburseable financial assistance.
35.       Action Program.  The economic program attaches high priority to the
establishment of lending facilities that will make medium-term credit once
again available to the private sector. The Government has created two new
institutions, the Agricultural Credit Bank and the National Development Bank,
which will operate as wholesalers channelling their resources through the
commercial banking system. The Government believes that the repayment record
for medium term loans will be improved by placing the credit risk on
commercial banks. The Agricultural Credit Bank will become fully operational
before the National Development Bank. It has taken over the agricultural
operations of the now quasi-defunct Jamaica Development Bank. An operational
program has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Agricultural Credit
Bank. The National Development Bank is at an earlier stage of its
development. A Board of Directors and a general manager have been appointed.
An operational program will be prepared and approved by its Board before the
release of the second tranche. Preparation and adoption and satisfactory
program of operating policies and procedures which allow NDB to function as an
effective financial institution, capable of meeting the term credit needs of
the industry and tourism sectors, will be a condition to the release of the
second tranche. Terms of Reference for the preparation of an NDB operational
program, to be financed under the TA Loan, have been prepared.



- 18 -
(c) Public Sector Investment Program
36.       Public sector investment activities will need to play a
supplementary but critical role in stimulating economic growth over the next
few years. In keeping with the Government's focus on an expanded role for the
private sector, public sector investment will need to concentrate on providing
services and infrastructure that will facilitate expanded production.
Accordingly, the program aims primarily at stimulating nontraditional
agricultural activities, upgrading agricultural services, promoting the
expansion of industry and tourism through the construction of factory shells
and stepped-up promotional activity, and rehabilitating and upgrading basic
economic and social infrastructure.
37.       If the execution of the public sector investment program is to
proceed satisfactorily, a number of constraints need to be borne in mind.
First, the recent outflow of managerial and technical skills has weakened
project execution capacity in the public sector. Accordingly, most projects
need to contain a significant element of training and institution building,
while technical assistance available from external sources needs to be fully
utilized. In the past, the shortage of counterpart funds has constrained
project execution and contributed to cost overruns. It is therefore essential
that projects be selected against the background of a realistic financing plan
which takes into account the availability of budget resources as well as
likely external flows. In this regard, projects will be identified on a
reserve basis, so that the investment program may be quickly scaled down
should financing not materialize as expected.
38.       Action program.  The Government has prepared a public sector
investment program and financing plan for the three-year period
1981/82-1983/84 (Annex IV). The investment program, which amounts to
approximately J$2.7 billion and averages 14.4% of GDP, is consistent with the
development emphasis on export-oriented, employment-intensive sectors and the
development of domestic energy resources. The Government is committed to
maintain overall public investment expenditures below 15% of GDP in each year
of the program. About 23% of the program is devoted to investment in the
directly productive sectors and 46% to support economic infrastructure. About
25% of the program is allocated to essential investments in the social
sectors. In keeping with the Government's policy of reliance on the private
sector, investment in the mining, manufacture, and tourism sectors will be
left largely to private investors. The year-by-year allocations of
expenditures show the Government's attempts to reorient its investment; while
the proportion allotted to economic infrastructure increases through time, the
proportions devoted to directly productive activities and to social
infrastructure decrease.
39.       Of the total J$2.7 billion required to finance the investment
program, public sector savings 1/ would provide about 16%, or J$429 million;
on an annual basis, the proportion of public investment expenditures covered
1/   Includes capital revenues.



- 19 -
by public sector savings would increase from -8% in FY81/82 to +15% in FY82/83
and to +35% in FY83/84. This projection of savings assumes:
(a) real GDP growth amounting to about 4% in 1982/83 and about 5% in
1983/84;
(b) additional revenue measures in FY82/83 and FY83/84;
(c) nominal growth in Central Government current expenditures of no more
than 13% in 1982/83 and 7% in 1983/84; and
(d) substantially improved performance on the part of the nonfinancial
public enterprises, arising from rationalization of prices and
divestment of certain operations.
About 19% of the program, or J$522 million could be financed from other
domestic sources. Net external financing would be required to finance the
remaining 65% of the investment program. After taking into account
amortization requirements, gross disbursements of external capital on the
order of J$2.5 billion would be required over the three-year period.
Approximately 70% of this amount has been committed or is reasonably certain.
The remainder, amounting to about J$750 million, would need to be mobilized
largely in the form of quickly disbursing assistance. The Government has
stated the priorities of the investment program in Attachment "C" to the
Development Policy Statement (Annex V). When the public sector investment
program is rolled over prior to the release of the second tranche, it will be
extended to cover FY84/85 and FY85/86. The Government is also establishing a
monitoring system which will enable it to track project execution and external
inflows and forestall bottlenecks.
(d) Promotion of Private Savings
40.       In addition to the measures described above to strengthen public
sector savings, the Government hopes to increase the confidence of the private
sector and hence its savings rate. Moreover, the economic program provides
for the financing of the Central Government through open market operations;
interest rates, consequently, have increased and are expected to continue
doing so. In this context, the Government is also committed to ensure that
sufficient bank credit is available for the private sector. Given the
Government's emphasis on the dynamic role of the private sector, it would also
be appropriate to assess the functioning of capital markets, with a view to
introducing the reforms that may be required to strengthen them.
41.       Action program.  Given the high progressivity of the personal income
tax, there is scope for increasing after-tax real returns on financial
assets. The Government has partially exempted from personal income tax the
interest earnings on deposits of maturities of more than one year. In
addition, as part of the comprehensive reform of the tax system, the
Government is undertaking a review of the progressivity of the personal income
tax. The review is scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1982. If such



- 20 -
progressivity were to be reduced, after-tax real returns on financial assets
would increase. The Government will also carry on an assessment of the
functioning of capital markets in Jamaica emphasizing the analysis of factors
that reduce the availability of risk capital. The assessment will be done
through a study, with assistance from IFC, that would be completed before the
end of August 1982; satisfactory progress of this study would be made prior to
the release of the second tranche.
Balance of Payments Management
42.       The Government is aware that the balance of payments is likely to
continue being the binding constraint to economic growth for the next few
years. In this regard, the structural adjustment program addresses the issues
of foreign exchange policy and attracting additional private external
capital.
(a) Efficiency in the Allocation of Foreign Exchange.
43.       It is an already stated government policy to ensure the price
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.   If this competitiveness is eroded
through excessive domestic price increases and a departure from wage
moderation, corrective measures would be called for. Given the acute shortage
of foreign exchange, achieving greater efficiency in its allocation is of
major importance. In this connection, the Government seeks to move to a
market-oriented allocation process.
44.       Action program.  A first step in the Government's policy is to move
towards a general open-license system for imports. The Government has already
taken several measures to increase the efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange. All legal sanctions to transactions in the informal foreign
exchange market have been eliminated, and the Fiscal Intelligence Unit has
been eliminated. In addition, the Government has introduced a number of
modifications to the import licensing system: administrative procedures have
been simplified considerably; the value of no-funds licenses issued has
increased substantially and the issuance of such licenses is automatic for raw
materials, spare parts, and capital goods; a system of special retained
foreign exchange accounts has been established for importers, and those who
operate under this system do not need import licenses; import licenses are
issued automatically for exporters that operate under the Bank-supported
Export Development Fund. The Government wishes to analyze the possible
introduction of an auctioning system for import licenses for certain low
priority goods. A study of two to three month duration will be conducted in
order to analyze ways of increasing the efficiency of the import licensing
system; satisfactory progress in the preparation of this study would be made
prior to the release of the second tranche.



- 21 -
(b) Attracting Private Capital.
45.       Private external capital played an important role in the economic
development of Jamaica during the 1960s and early 1970s. In the last eight
years, direct foreign investment dwindled and capital flight occured. The
challenge now facing the Government is to create an atmosphere conducive to
renewed foreign investment. A further challenge, as well as opportunity for
the Government, is to find ways to induce the large numbers of Jamaicans
living abroad to remit part of their assets and income to Jamaica. Interest
rate differentials, as well as the possibility of providing convertibility
guarantees, will have to be viewed from this vantage point.
46.       Action Program.  In order to attract private capital, the Government
has set out to restore an atmosphere of confidence in the country and in the
quality of its own economic management, as well as to provide appropriate
stimuli. The Government's strategy in this respect should go a long way
towards the restoration of confidence: as to the overall approach, it has
unequivocally defined a leading role for the private sector--domestic as well
as foreign--in the economic recovery process; in connection with the quality
of economic management, the Government has entered into an extended agreement
with the IMF and has adopted a stern attitude in the wage negotiations in
which it participated, contributing to a mood of wage restraint that is
gradually spreading throughout the economy. In order to attract direct
foreign investment the Government has launched a vigorous promotional campaign
through the creation of bilateral groups of businessmen that will identify and
develop investment opportunities in Jamaica. On the domestic front, the
Government has created the Jamaica National Investment Promotion Co., a
one-stop' promotion agency that centralizes all relations with potential
investors. In order to facilitate the repatriation of Jamaican capital that
flowed out during the last decade, the Government has established a system of
foreign exchange accounts for importers, in addition to decriminalizing the
informal foreign exchange market. In order to attract migrants'
savings--potentially a major source of foreign exchange--the Government has
requested the Bank of Jamaica to analyze the options that are available. The
Bank of Jamaica is conducting a study that will be finished by the end of
March. A decision would be made subsequently and an action program would be
prepared before the end of September 1982.
Agricultural Sector
47.       The agricultural sector of Jamaica has the potential for rapid and
sustained growth. In the short run, the scarcity of inputs resulting from
the foreign exchange shortage is the limiting factor; but, like other
productive sectors, there are structural problems that will have to be solved
if recovery is to be transformed into sustainable medium-term growth.



- 22 -
(a) Land Use.
48.        Several complex issues related to land tenure and ownership
contribute towards the underutilization of Jamaica's agricultural resources.
The title situation of some private lands is unclear, partly as a result of
the inefficiency of the land administration system which is fragmented into
three agencies. Tenant farmers on government-owned lands are uncertain about
their future status and therefore postpone investment decisions. Another
difficulty arises from the fact that free-hold farmers cannot receive
appropriate guidance from the various extension services because land
resources have not been appropriately assessed and classified as to their
optimal uses. As a result, lands lie idle or underutilized. Finally, the
Government needs to announce its intentions with respect to the future
agricultural use of bauxite lands.
49.       Many small farms are located on hillsides.  These lands experience
soil erosion problems which require special cropping patterns and soil
conservation measures. The Ministry of Agriculture has introduced an
intensive soil conservation program, with support from FAO/UNDP. An important
element of the soil conservation program is the annual maintenance work that
follows the initial investment in conservation work. Unfortunately, very
little maintenance work is being done in the Jamaican mountains and
hillsides. Because of the heavy costs of the program and the urgent need to
help small hillside farmers, the entire soil conservation program needs to be
re-evaluated.
50.       The development of water resources is related to agricultural
development not only through its possible impact on agricultural production,
but also through its impact on living conditions in rural areas. Most
households in rural Jamaica do not yet have domestic water supply systems. To
date only some 85,000 acres are irrigated, and most systems are inefficiently
organized and poorly managed. Although the expansion of irrigation could be a
source of increased agricultural production, expansion of rainfed agricultural
areas would yield higher returns than expansion of the irrigation system. The
Bank's economic mission recommended that water resource development issues be
addressed in the following order of priority: (a) completion of water supply
systems for domestic use; (b) improvement of water management and more
efficient utilization of existing irrigation systems; (c) development of new
irrigation schemes for specific high-value crops where the supporting system
already exists; and (d) sewerage.
51.       Action Program.  In order to achieve a fuller utilization of
Jamaica's agricultural resources:
(i) The uncertainty faced by tenant farmers on government-owned lands
will be reduced through a program to sell or lease those lands to
producers. The Government has announced that it is preparing an
action program for the orderly sale or lease of government-owned
lands, and has started to implement aspects of it. Satisfactory
progress towards developing a policy for the sale or lease of these
lands to agricultural producers would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche. The program is expected to be in operation
by the end of the year.



- 23 -
(ii) The lack of information on optimal uses of land is being tackled
through the implementation of a program of land classification.
MINAG has already put in place a work program that includes the
review of previous soil studies (completed), the implementation of a
detailed land resource inventory, and eventually a capability
classification leading to the formulation of land use policy.
Satisfactory progress of the detailed land resource inventory would
be a condition for the release of the second tranche.
(iii)  Regarding the control of erosion of hillside farms, the Government
has decided on the main features of the program, the main thrust of
which is the adoption of lower cost methods; some works have been
stopped, and others are being redesigned. Before the end of
September 1982, the program would be fully developed and approved by
Cabinet; satisfactory progress in the development of the program
would be a condition for the release of the second tranche;
(iv)  In order to increase the agricultural area under effective
irrigation, the Ministry of Local Government in conjunction with the
MINAG is preparing a program to improve the efficiency of water
management and to develop new systems under well defined
priorities. The Ministry of Agriculture has chosen a strategy--in
line with previous Bank recommendations--that emphasizes the proper
use of microdams, and provides assistance to farm communities for
the development of small irrigation systems. The program will be
developed before the end of September 1982; satisfactory progress in
the development of the program would be a condition for the release
of the second tranche.
(b) Inefficiency of monopolistic external marketing organizations.
52.       Medium-term growth of the agricultural sector depends on the
provision of price incentives that make agricultural production profitable
vis-a-vis other economic activities. During the 1970s, agricultural prices
fell; within this declining trend, during the second half of the decade,
prices for domestic crops became relatively more favorable than prices for
export crops and, not surprisingly, export agriculture declined while domestic
agriculture grew.
53.       Two major factors can explain the movement of intra-sectoral
relative prices in favor of domestic agriculture: (a) the foreign exchange
rationing that led to reduced food imports, creating incentives for import
substitution in the agricultural sector, and (b) the differences in marketing
arrangements for export and domestic crops.   Export crops were marketed
through governmental or para-governmental entities that enjoyed monopsony
powers and regulated farmgate prices, while domestic crops were marketed
through a largely private system, in which farmgate prices were unregulated.



- 24 -
54.       Although the external marketing organization (EMOs) may still
have a part to play assuring a minimum return to small farmers, these
organizations seem to have grown beyond their optimal size, and their
dominant role over export crops is not consistent with an export-led
development strategy based on greater reliance on the private sector. The
functions of the external marketing organizations should be reassessed
with a view to: (i) eliminating their monopolistic privileges, including
their monopsony powers for external marketing, permitting competition of
private organizations; (ii) transferring their respective extension
services, to the national extension services; (iii) terminating their
involvement in the provision of credit as soon as the new system chosen by
the Government for this purpose (which includes the recently created
Agricultural Credit Bank as well as commercial banks) can take over this
service; (iv) reducing their involvement in the supply of agricultural
inputs and services, except when these cannot be provided through
commercial channels.
55.       Action Program.  Subject to conditions which are designed to
maintain minimum prices and preserve the quality of Jamaica's premium
export products, the Government has terminated the monopsony powers of EMOs
except those dealing with sugar and bananas, which are considered special
cases, and some specialized products in which Jamaica enjoys a de facto
monopoly. It has ordered management audits of all the EMOs. The
management audits for the coffee, cocoa, and citrus EMOs have been
completed. Since the proposed reduction in the non-marketing activities of
the EMOs must be accomplished in an orderly fashion to avoid
discontinuities in the provision of productive services or supply of
inputs, a series of studies will be undertaken on the sequence and timing
of the reduction of activities. Prior to the release of the second
tranche, satisfactory progress will have been made with respect to the
studies related to: (a) the orderly reduction of the non-marketing
activities of the EMOs; (b) the external marketing operations of the EMOs
for coffee, citrus, pimento, and coffee; and (c) the management audits of
the EMOs for sugar, bananas, and pimento. The studies of the EMOs will
take about three months to complete after consultants are engaged. The
management audits are underway and will be completed by September 1982.
(c) Assuring farmers rewards for their work.
56.       Praedial larceny has a long history in Jamaica, but has become
more acute during the last few years. Crops are stolen by large-scale
operators and sometimes productive assets are destroyed in the process.
The issue of praedial larceny is of importance, because the effects of
future incentives on production could be neutralized unless this peculiar
form of crime is reduced substantially. Unless the Government is in a
position to guarantee that the farmer who worked his land will also be the
one reaping the benefits, the production response to economic incentives
will be weak. The solution lies in a general improvement in the
administration of law and order in rural areas.



- 25 -
57.       Action Program.  The Government has launched a program to
eradicate praedial larceny. New legislation will shortly be submitted to
Parliament, introducing stiffer penalties. Measures have also been taken
to simplify administrative procedures and accelerate the process of
recovery of the stolen goods. The Government will also increase the
deployment of security forces in rural areas, including the institution of
a system of agricultural wardens, of which 200 will be operational before
the end of December 1982.
(d) Long-term decline in sugar production and exports.
58.       Sugar production has declined steadily over the last decade.  As
a result, output in 1980 was nearly 40% below the 1970 level. This decline
reflected the inefficient operation of the nationalized sugar factories as
well as falling production in the fields, resulting from the dismemberment
of the sugar estates and the creation of sugar cane workers' cooperatives
that never functioned satisfactorily.
59.       Over the longer term, Jamaica may need to diversify its
agricultural production away from sugar and towards other activities that
are more profitable. Over the short- to medium-term, however, there is
room to increase this subsector's efficiency and output, contributing to
foreign exchange earnings and to the improvement of living standards in
rural areas.
60.       Action Program.  The Government has recently taken two major
policy decisions concerning, respectively, the sugar workers' cooperatives
and the operation of the National Sugar Company's (NSC) factories. These
decisions shape the action program for the rehabilitation of the sugar
subsector.
61.       The registration of the cooperatives (which all were quite
insolvent) was cancelled and their affairs are now being wound up. The
land is now being leased to three sugar factories which they supply with
cane. With regard to the government-owned sugar factories, two are being
closed, one before the start of the 1981/82 crop and another before the
start of the 1982/83 crop. The largest factory will be retained under
management of the National Sugar Corporation. All of the remaining
factories will be leased to private firms. Discussions are already under
way with local and foreign groups. Given the condition of the factories
and cane fields, it may be a year or more before all the negotiations are
completed. There is, therefore, a considerable but unavoidable degree of
uncertainty about any plans for the factories that are the subject of
negotiation, along with the associated cane fields.
62. In line with the Government's objective to eliminate the current
account deficits of all public enterprises by FY83/84, while at the same
time providing greater incentives to farmers, the Government has increased
the domestic price of sugar by about 50% and the guaranteed price
to farmers by some 27%. An additional increase in the domestic price of



- 26 -
sugar is planned, before the end of June 1982, in order to limit the
deficit of the National Sugar Corporation/Sugar Industry Authority to J$25
million in CY82, and is a condition for the release of the second tranche.
Over the medium term, and in line with the desired deregulation of the
economy, the Government's objective is to phase out price intervention for
the sugar industry. By November 1982, the Bank and the Government will
conduct a review of the Government's program for the rehabilitation of the
sugar industry.
63.       Besides these changes in ownership structure, the Government has
prepared an action program to deal with the immediate production problem.
The main objective for the subsector, public and private, is to achieve an
annual production of 330,000 tons of raw sugar. This action program covers
three areas: field operations, including transport and tractors;
factories; and personnel. Its main characteristics are:
(i)  Field: The target of 330,000 tons of sugar will require some 3.5
millon tons of cane. This will be achieved by farming 120,000
acres to yield some 30 tons of cane per acre; this area would
only be marginally higher than the area under sugarcane in 1979.
Critical components of the action program are: (a) to guarantee
farmers a price that covers their debt service plus a 15 to 20%
profit margin; (b) a program to assure the timely availability of
fertilizer and chemicals in each estate; (c) a program to assure
that estates have their own land preparation equipment or
contractors to assist farmers; (d) a program to assure that
estates have some reaping and transportation equipment available
to assist farmers with their deliveries; (e) a program of road
repairs to improve the condition of cane roads for the harvest
season; (f) a program for the irrigation systems, especially in
Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Bernard Lodge, to be brought back
to their maximum efficiency; (g) a monitoring system by the Sugar
Industry Research Institute of the availability of seed material
to improve yields; (h) a monitoring system by the Sugar Industry
Research Institute of the cultural practices and reaping cycle
for the cane; (i) the implementation of an incentive scheme based
on sugar yield per acre; (j) a program to reduce the heavy
incidence of praedial larceny and also to reduce the destruction
of cane by stray stock; and (k) the availability of spare parts
for field equipment. All these areas are being addressed by the
Government in cooperation with the All Island Jamaica Cane
Farmers' Association, the Sugar Industry Authority, the Sugar
Industry Research Institute, the Sugar Producers' Federation and
other agencies.
(ii) Factories: The key components of the program for the sugar
factories are: (a) to plan the timing of the crop to take
advantage of the best juice period and weather pattern; (b) to
minimize lost time at the mill, through a system of planned daily
quotas, and also contributing to eliminate the use of oil as a
fuel through a more efficient use of bagasse; (c) to establish a
system to monitor the quality of cane; (d) a repair program with



- 27 -
adequate spare parts in place for the repair season; and (e) an
incentive scheme based on the planned throughput of each
factory. This program's measures will be reviewed within a year,
when the Government expects to have completed the reorganization
of the sugar industry and the subsector will have to find its
equilibrium at world market prices rather than guaranteed prices.
(iii) Personnel: The Government is aware that a sugar estates complex
can only operate successfully with on the spot dedicated and
efficient management. This is already borne out at the privately
owned Hampden, and Worthy Park factories. The National Sugar
Company will require some further upgrading in this area.
Regardless of any divestment, offers of assistance in the area of
technical and management personnel have been made by several
multinational corporations and international organizations. The
Government is identifying its requirements and will tap those
sources for assistance.
(e) Long-term decline in banana production and exports.
64.       Bananas are the second most important export crop in Jamaica, but
in recent years yields, output, quantity exported, and quality have all
declined. Exports have declined from 136,000 MT in 1970 to 33,000 MT in
1980 and an estimated 22,000 MT in 1981. This situation has resulted from
mismanagement of the Banana Company, shortage of inputs and materials,
deterioration of cultivation practices, insufficient protection against
plant disease, poor methods of fruit handling, an inefficient and costly
transportation system, and the effects of Hurricane Allen.
65.       Action Program.  The Government has developed an action program
for the rehabilitation of the sector. The objective is to increase output
and exports to a target (for the latter) of 150,000 tons per year,
which coincides with Jamaica's quota in the sheltered UK market (1981
exports will only cover one seventh of the quota). This export target
would be achieved with an increase in the area devoted to bananas of only
3,000 to 5,000 acres, that is about 5 to 8% of the area planted in 1979.
The Bank's Second Export Development Fund Project included a $4.0 million
component to finance inputs for the banana industry. The major components
of the action program are:
(i) To increase the supply of basic farm inputs: The Government has
allocated foreign exchange for this purpose. The Banana Company
imported fertilizers, spraying materials, and plastic sleeves.
These inputs are now being sold to farmers through the All Island
Banana Growers' Association.



- 28 -
(ii) To increase the quantity and quality of extension services
provided to banana farmers: Responsibility for the provision of
extension services to farms of less than 2 acres has been shifted
from the Banana Company to the Ministry of Agriculture. This
will allow the extension service of the Banana Company (14
extension officers) to concentrate on 3,000 banana farmers while
the remaining 18,000 banana farmers (most of which have mixed
stands anyhow) will be covered by the Ministry of Agriculture.
(iii)  To reorient the disease control system:  The Banana Company is
reorienting its disease control system emphasizing ground
spraying instead of air spraying. Ground spraying equipment has
been purchased and made available to farmers.
(iv) To divert banana output of exportable quality from the domestic
to the external market: There are two components to this
program. First, the Banana Company has increased the price paid
to farmers from J$.09/lb to J$.11/lb and, in addition, it has
instituted a quality premium of J$.02/lb. Second, the Banana
Company has begun to provide farmers plastic boxes, to encourage
cutting and boxing the banana fingers at the farm, thus hoping to
reduce the proportion of export rejects at the packing house
level and creating another incentive to exports as opposed to
supplying the domestic market.
(v) To market export rejects in the domestic market: Under the
existing system, export rejects are dumped. The Banana Company
will start to sell rejects--on an experimental basis--in the
domestic market. If the experience is successful, it will create
an additional incentive for farmers to market through the Banana
Company, while at the same time offsetting upward pressures on
the domestic price of bananas that are likely to be triggered by
the diversion of output from the domestic to the external market.
(vi) To expand planted banana area: The Banana Company has negotiated
an agreement with an international corporation to expand the area
planted with bananas by at least 3,000 acres. Output will be
organized in large farms, and expected yields are 8 to 10 MT per
acre (compared to the current average of 3 MT/acre).
(f) Governmental institutions dealing with the agricultural
sector
66.       The organization of the Ministry of Agriculture both at the head
office and at the regional level is adequate. The nucleus of a unit
to plan, coordinate, and monitor development programs already exists, and
some of its components have been developed independently with external
assistance. However, given the large number of projects being planned or
implemented, as well as the large number of Government agencies related to
the agricultural sector, there is a need to strengthen the planning unit
and to reorganize the system. More particularly:



- 29 -
(a) the agricultural extension services should develop methods and systems
to transfer knowledge and information to a larger number of farmers; (b)
the field extension agents, need stronger support from subject-matter
specialists and other senior extension personnel; (c) the multiple
extension services should be merged under the Minister of Agriculture; and
(d) the specialized research units for bananas, coffee, coconut, and
sugarcane should be merged with the research service of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
67.       Agricultural credit in Jamaica has been channelled through a
variety of institutions, including the Jamaica Development Bank. The
comercial banks play an important role in agricultural credit, a role that
could be expanded beneficially. In addition the agricultural extension
service should cooperate more closely with the commercial banks in
implementing the credit programs and a promotion scheme for the credit
programs should be initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and the
commercial banks.
68.       Action Program.  The weakness of agricultural institutions
severely limits Government's capability to design agricultural policies and
execute programs. The Ministry of Agriculture has already taken steps to
strengthen some of its units, particularly the extension service. The
Ministry of Agriculture has prepared an action program to strengthen
agricultural sector institutions; the program includes the provision of
extension specialists, financed under the First Rural Development Project
(Loan No. 1464-JM), to assist in the introduction of the Training and Visit
System; a program, partly financed under the proposed Technical Assistance
Loan, to assist local agents to prepare demonstration plots and train
extension agents at the local and regional levels; the redefinition of the
non-marketing functions of the EMOs, financed under the proposed Technical
Assistance Loan, possibly leading to the consolidation of their extension
services and research services under the Ministry of Agriculture; an
analysis of the trade-off between domestic crops and export agriculture,
which should be completed by September 1982; and finally, another program
financed under the proposed Technical Assistance Loan, will strengthen the
planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. Institutional aspects
related to the provision of credit will be covered by the action program to
develop the Agricultural Credit Bank into a viable financial institution
Industrial Sector
69.       The manufacturing sector has large unutilized capacity and can
make a rapid and significant contribution to GDP growth, employment
creation, and foreign exchange earnings. If, in addition, longer term
growth is to be viable, the deep structural problems that beset the sector
will have to be tackled. Measures to achieve the structural transformation
of Jamaica's manufacturing sector can only be implemented over the medium
term, but since an immediate output and export response is also needed,
additional policy measures consistent with the desired transformation of
the sector could assist the recovery. In addition, the lack of a
source of medium term credit hampers the chances of success of a growth
policy based on the leading role of the private sector.



- 30 -
(a) Lack of dynamism in manufactured exports.
70.       Manufactured exports (as well as other non-traditional exports)
have not performed dynamically during recent years, the main reason being
a structure of protection based on quantitative restrictions to imports
(QRs) that penalizes sales to external markets --particularly those outside
the CARICOM region -- and distorts the internal allocation of
resources. QRs apply mostly to consumer goods; of 364 items subject to QRs,
82% correspond to consumer goods, 7% to intermediate goods, and the
remaining 11% to capital goods. QRs do not affect significantly the
availability of producer's goods for export industries that, by and large,
have access to them at international prices. However, since domestic
production of protected goods can be sold to the domestic market at prices
substantially higher than international prices, the system of incentives is
biased against exports.   Effective protection coefficients, that measure
the extent to which domestic value added can exceed value added measured at
international prices, show that for the manufacturing sector as a whole
effective protection was 50% in 1978. A breakdown of this coefficient
according to the geographical destination of sales shows that sales to the
domestic market had the highest effective protection (68%), followed by
sales to the CARICOM market (19%), while sales to extraregional markets had
negative effective protection (-'O%).   Thus, although the existing
industrial structure could possibly supply a rapid output response until
capacity utilization is nearly full, it does not provide an adequate
foundation for longer-term growth, in view of the limited size of the
domestic and CARICOM markets.   The key issue is to undo the anti-export
bias of inward-looking policies while reducing the intersectoral
differences in effective protection.
71.       Action program.  The Government has already taken several
measures in support of the development of manufactured exports, such as:
(a) the creation of the EDF, financed by the Bank and the IDB, that assures
the availability of foreign exchange to finance imported inputs used by
exporters; (b) the creation of the Kingston Free Zone, providing economic
infrastructure, in a free trade environment, for the functioning of enclave
type industries; (c) the liberalization of the import licensing system,
including the provision of automatic licenses to EDF users; (d) increased
activity by two effective public sector organizations such as the Jamaica
National Export Corporation (a promotional agency) and the Jamaica Export
Trading Company (a trading house). The Government is also committed to
maintain a competitive exchange rate. The Government has also agreed to
terms of reference to prepare an action program on export incentives, to be
put in place in 1982.
72.       Over the medium term, instilling dynamism to manufactured exports
requires undoing the anti-export bias resulting from past policies. In
Jamaica, this calls for the elimination of quantitative restrictions to
imports--presently the main form of protection--and, instead, making the
CARICOM Common External Tariff fully operational. The Government considers
that the reform of the system of protection is a major component of the
shift to an export oriented development strategy, but wishes to effect it
gradually in order to avoid possible adverse consequences in the short run.



- 31 -
73.       The Government is committed to eliminating the QRs gradually over
a five year period. The following schedule has been agreed to:
Schedule for elimination of QRs
Date                  Number of
Items
February 7, 1982        64
January  1983           61
January  1984           61
January  1985           86
January  1986           46
January  1987           46
Total              364
74.       The Government has announced the policy of gradually phasing out
all QRs, except those related to national security or social reasons. The
Government feels that in order to go beyond the first round of elimination
there is a need to conduct studies to detect which domestic industries
might be severely affected and, in some cases, to introduce temporary
tariff surcharges or excise taxes, as well as to decide on the specific
sequences in which QRs would be eliminated. The criteria governing the
choice of the specific sequence will be: a) to achieve an even distribution
of the short term disturbances that the implementation of the new policy
might cause on production and employment levels; and b) to emphasize during
the early years of the program the elimination of QRs on intermediate and
capital goods. Completion of these studies would take place prior to the
preparation of the list of QRs to be eliminated in January 1983.
75.       The gradual elimination of QRs will only have an impact on
exports over the medium term. In the meantime, the Government of Jamaica
has agreed to the preparation of an action program for the promotion of
non-traditional exports (including agricultural goods), that will be
completed before the release of the second tranche of the proposed SAL.
The action program would include three classes of measures: (a) measures to
increase the availability of foreign exchange to exporters, possibly
through the extension of the system of retained foreign exchange accounts
to all exporters; (b) the provision of fiscal incentives to exports outside
CARICOM; and (c) possible modifications to the export financing systems.



- 32 -
76. In order to create sources of medium term financing for the
development of the manufacturing sector, the Government has created the
National Development Bank, that will function as a second-tier lending
institution. The action program to establish the National Development Bank
was discussed in paragraphs 34-35.
(b) Rationalization of specific industrial subsectors
(garments, footwear, construction materials).
77.       There is a need for the rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors. The Government has selected three: garments, footwear,
construction materials. The first two have been selected by the Government
because the country is believed to possess a comparative advantage in them
and the export drive would thus be reinforced. The construction materials
subsector is considered important in connection with the intensified
investment effort that the country will make over the next few years.
78.       Action Program.  The objective is to develop exports and, at the
same time, reduce the prices of these products for domestic consumers.
These subsectors would operate in a free trade atmosphere as far as access
to inputs is concerned, and would be allowed to compete in the domestic
market under the CARICOM Common External Tariff. The Government is
preparing specific programs for each subsector. Satisfactory progress in
the development of the specific action programs would be made prior to the
release of the second tranche and implementation of the program begun
before the end of the year. Depending on the results obtained in these
subsectors, the scheme might be extended to other subsectors.
C. THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND THE EXTENDED
AGREEMENT WITH THE IMF
79.       The policies and actions related to the proposed SAL are fully
consistent with the objectives and commitments undertaken as part of the
Extended Agreement between the Government of Jamaica and the IMF. The
overall objective is the same in both cases: economic recovery and
sustained growth through the adoption of an export oriented strategy that
emphasizes the dynamic role of the private sector. There is, however, a
difference in emphasis. The Extended Agreement with the IMF places
more emphasis on short to medium term issues, while the structural
adjustment policies adopted as part of the proposed SAL places more
emphasis on medium to longer term issues.
80.       Some of the action programs that make up the proposed SAL refer
to policy areas that were not covered under the Extended Agreement with the
IMF. The remainder are policy areas that were covered under the Extended
Agreement, but are now being defined with greater detail or more
specificity. The action programs that are entirely new under the proposed
SAL are: (a) establishment of functional medium term lending institutions
(paras. 34-35); (b) increasing efficiency in the allocation of foreign
exchange through the possible introduction of an auctioning system for
import licences (paras. 43-44); (c) attraction of private capital through
the possible establishment of a scheme to attract migrants' savings



- 33 -
(paras. 45-46); (d) fuller utilization of agricultural lands (paras.
48-51); (e) elimination of praedial larceny (paras. 56-57); (f)
rehabilitation of the sugar industry (paras. 58-63)!]; (g) rehabilitation
of the banana industry (paras. 64-65) 1/; (h) strengthening of agricultural
institutions (paras. 66-68); and rationalization of certain industrial
subsectors (paras. 77-78).
81.       In those policy areas that are common to both the proposed SAL
and the Extended Agreement with the IMF, the Government is now undertaking
further commitments, made possible because greater knowledge has been
accumulated, or because it is now possible to focus on longer term issues
and to identify measures with greater detail. For those policy areas the
EFF and SAL may be compared as follows:
(a) Savings of Public Enterprises
EFF. The Government stated its objective of requiring public
enterprises to operate efficiently and its intention to limit
budget support to these entities. The Government also set forth
its intention to divest itself of commecial-type public
enterprises and made reference to programs to rehabilitate Air
Jamaica and the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation.
SAL. Action programs for eight public enterprises have been
identified, five of which have already been prepared and are now
being implemented. The Government committed itself to
eliminate the current account deficits of all major public
enterprises and to restrict its share of investment expenditures
of public enterprises to no more than 30% of total investment
costs by its fiscal year 1983/84. Pricing decisions have been
delegated to managers of public enterprises other than utilities.
(b) The Public Sector Investment Program.
EFF. The Government stated that it would prepare a public sector
investment program with the assistance of the Bank.
SAL. A public sector investment program was prepared as part of
the SAL, a monitoring system is being put in place and the
Government is committed to rolling over the program annually.
1/   The objective of increasing output of this crop was stated under the
Extended Agreement, but no detailed action program was spelled out.



- 34 -
(c) Promotion of Domestic Savings.
EFF. The Government agreed to a thorough review of the tax
system, with a view to increasing revenues, as well as to remove
possible disincentives to savings.
SAL. An analysis is to be made of the obstacles to the
development of capital markets, particularly those that might
hinder private savings.
(d) External Marketing Organizations.
EFF. The Government agreed to the termination of the monopsony
powers of the external marketing organizations.
SAL. Provision is made to make six management audits of the
external marketing organizations, three of which have been
completed. In addition, a program of studies will be undertaken
to reduce the non-marketing functions of the external marketing
organizations.
(e) Quantitative Restrictions.
EFF. The Government made a commitment not to introduce any new
quantiative restrictions on imports.
SAL. The Government is committed to eliminate all QRs within a
five year period and to prepare an action program for the
development of non-traditional exports.
D. OTHER STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS
Bauxite and Alumina Industry
82.       Jamaica's endowment of bauxite resources, with reserves
equivalent to 130 years' output, permits further expansion of the bauxite
and alumina industry. But, over the medium term, export growth will have
to be mostly in the form of alumina, since international trade is now
geared towards taking alumina rather than bauxite, as a consequence of the
rise in shipping costs that followed the increases in energy prices during
the 1970s. In the short run, however, Jamaica's potential for increasing
the volume of alumina production and exports is rather limited, because the
existing reduction plants are operating close to their effective
capacity utilization limits, estimated at 92% in 1980. Therefore,
increased alumina exports will require substantial investments involving at
least a three-year gestation period. Output of bauxite, on the other hand,
could increase rapidly with only minor investments but the international
marketing of the bauxite might be difficult.



- 35 -
83.       Enhancing the competitiveness of Jamaica's bauxite and alumina
industry is a major Government objective. Presently, Jamaica has three
major advantages over other bauxite and alumina producing countries. One
is its proximity to the United States and Canadian markets, which account
for more than one-third of the world's bauxite and alumina imports. The
second is the ease of mining bauxite, with virtual absence of overburden.
Finally, Jamaica has a good inland transportation system and the mines are
close to ports.
84.       Jamaica's disadvantages--compared to other major producing
countries--are the lack of exploited indigenous energy sources, a higher
production levy, the lower alumina content of the bauxite, and the chemical
composition of the mineral which requires higher temparatures in the
refining process. Energy costs, which in Jamaica move pari passu with the
price of imported oil, are thus a major factor in the economic viability of
the local alumina industry. The bauxite production levy is another impor-
tant factor. From 1974, when the levy was introduced, through 1979, when
the levy was reduced, Jamaica became an unattractive location from the view
point of the industry: production declined and no new investments were
made. In 1980, with a lower levy, alumina production increased and in
early 1981, with a new domestic political and economic environment, new
investments were being planned.
85.       This suggests that, given the level of the levy, cost considera-
tions are of paramount importance for new alumina plants. Minimization of
energy costs, then, becomes a crucial issue; in this connection, the sub-
stitution of coal for fuel oil merits serious consideration. Such a sub-
stitution, if profitable, would enhance the attractiveness of Jamaica as a
location for the alumina industry. If coal is a more profitable energy
option for the new investments, retrofitting to coal the existing plants
could also be profitable, given the economies of scale involved in the
expansion of ports, in loading and unloading devices, and in the inland
transportation system. Preliminary studies comparing fuel-oil versus coal
in the expansion of an alumina plant indicate that at the relative prices
prevailing in early 1981, the coal option would have a payback period bet-
ween 4 and 5 years.
86.       Action Program.  The major objectives of the Government in the
bauxite/alumina sector are: (i) to increase bauxite production and find
suitable markets for it; (ii) to expand alumina production capacity and
exports; (iii) to develop new markets.
87.       Inasmuch as most of the world's bauxite is traded within
integrated companies, and international commitments assumed by the
Government of Jamaica under the International Bauxite Association preclude
an aggressive pricing policy, increasing bauxite exports in the short run
is a difficult task. The authorities are following a four-way approach.
First, they are negotiating with the bauxite companies to use more Jamaican
bauxite for their production of aluminum and also to increase their sales
to third parties. As yet, however, there is no indication that the
companies' policy of geographical diversification of mineral sources will



- 36 -
change, or that the processing capacity of their North American plants
will increase. Second, the Government is concentrating on the EEC Market,
where it benefits from the Lome II Agreement. Third, the authorities are
approaching international brokerage firms to place some of Jamaica's
bauxite. Finally, the Government has sought to sell bauxite to the United
States strategic stockpile. The US Government has agreed to purchase 1.6
million tons of bauxite in its FY81/82.
88.       The Government is holding discussions with the companies on an
individual basis with a view to increase alumina production capacity.
Priority is being given to the expansion of existing facilities as opposed
to new plants, so as to reduce the time lag involved in bringing new
capacity on stream as well as to minimize investment costs. The Government
is offering investment incentives in the form of a rebate on the production
levy to be granted on a case by case basis. Negotiations are now under way
to expand the Jamalco plant from 550,000 MT/Y to 900,000 MT/Y. The
restoration of Alpart's capacity from 1.1 to 1.2 m MT/Y is also being
negotiated. At the same time, the Government has deferred the decision on
a government-owned 600,000 MT/Y alumina processing plant at South
Manchester, until the negotiations with the alumina companies are
completed.
89.       With regard to the development of new markets, the Government is
closely monitoring the possible construction of an aluminum smelter in
Trinidad and Tobago, which could be partly supplied with Jamaican alumina.
In addition, the Government has already signed a seven-year contract with
the USSR for the supply of 250,000 MT/Y from 1984 through 1990. Other new
markets are being sought.
Tourism
90.       The tourist sector has large unutilized capacity and can make a
rapid recovery contributing to foreign exchange earnings and employment
creation. A major issue is the public ownership of hotel properties. It
is the expressed objective of the Government to divest as many of the
currently owned hotel properties as possible, in line with its general
objective of distancing itself from commercial operations.
91. Availability of medium-term credit--at nonsubsidized rates--is a major
factor affecting the growth prospects of the sector. During recent years
medium-term credit was available only from foreign commercial banks, in
small quantities and at high cost, since lenders were reluctant to increase
their exposure in Jamaica and the Jamaica Development Bank was inactive.
The establishment of an operational source of medium-term credit (paragaphs
34-35) is quite relevant from the point of view of the tourism sector.
92.       Achievement of the growth targets defined by the Government will
require a major advertising and promotional effort, particularly at the
beginning, when the negative impact of the turmoil of 1980 will have to be
overcome in the context of a less than buoyant market for international
tourism. The Tourist Board should be adequately funded for this purpose.



- 37 -
93.       Action Program.  The Government's strategy in the tourism sector
is directed at rapidly decreasing the Government's involvement in the
direct operation of hotel properties and creating an atmosphere conducive
to the private development of the sector. The Government is presently
conducting its strategy in two stages; in the first stage, the hotels are
returned to private operation through a lease or management contract;
in the second stage, after a few years, the hotels would be sold. This
approach avoids the sale of properties at a time when the depressed
condition of the tourism market would be reflected in prices. In addition,
the longer period would furnish domestic tourism operators more opportunity
to place competitive bids. The Government has also launched a major
promotional effort through increased funding to the Tourist Board. The
establishment of the National Development Bank should help meet the
sector's requirements for medium-term credit.
Energy
94.       Jamaica's effectiveness in tackling its energy problem will have
a large bearing on the medium-term performance of the economy. Presently,
bagasse is virtually the only exploited domestic energy resource; as a
result, imported oil must cover over 90% of the island's total energy
consumption, or 99% of commercial energy consumption (the remaining 1%
being hydroelectric power). Oil imports are therefore high; in 1980 they
totalled 15.6 million barrels, with a foreign exchange cost of US$470
million, or 39% of merchandise imports and 16% of GDP. Given that the
balance of payments is, and is likely to continue being, the binding
constraint to Jamaica's economic growth, the connection between energy
consumption and economic performance is inescapable.
95.       Jamaica's domestic energy resources have never been fully
assessed. The limited information now available suggests that Jamaica's
energy resources are modest, and even if exploitation turns out to be
economically feasible, long lead times will be involved before commercial
production reaches a substantial scale. Identified or possible energy
resources are: (a) the Blue Mountain hydroelectric scheme, (b) other
(micro) hydroelectric sources, (c) peat, (d), oil, both onshore and
offshore, and (e) non-conventional sources, like biomass, solar energy,
ocean thermal energy conversion, etc.
96.       Energy conservation through a major demand management effort is
the only approach to Jamaica's energy problem that can yield results in a
relatively short period. The Government's program attaches a major role to
energy conservation. The issues involved in a major conservation effort
comprise both pricing policies and other energy conservation measures.
Jamaica has already had some successful experiences in both aspects of
energy conservation.
97.       Action Program.  The thrust of the Government's development
strategy in the energy sector is to reduce reliance on imported petroleum
through the promotion of energy conservation and the development of
indigenous energy sources.



- 38 -
98.       In the area of energy conservation, the Government is pursuing a
policy of realistic pricing for energy products. All subsidies on
petroleum products have been eliminated, and, with the exceptions of fuel
oil and marine diesel, prices for petroleum products sold in the inland
market are controlled by the Government. Sales to the international sector
are made at international prices. At the final consumer level, price
differentials between gasoline and medium distillates have traditionally
been high, because of taxation. The Government determines inland prices
through a price fixation formula based on Caribbean quotations that has
permitted full recovery of costs. In order to even out short-term price
fluctuations of crude prices, a "stabilization" levy on all petroleum
products was introduced in 1977.
99.       With assistance of USAID, the Government has developed an energy
conservation plan that seeks to set up lines of credit for energy saving
activities, to assist consumers with energy auditing and retrofitting, and
to strengthen the capability of Ministry of Mining and Energy to plan and
monitor the program. The major sources of increases in energy efficiency
of the Jamaican economy would be in the energy-intensive industries. As
indicated above (Paragraph 85) the bauxite/alumina industry has the option
of converting to coal. The rehabilitation of the cement plant includes
improving fuel efficiency in heating processes and substitution of more
efficient fuels in electricity generation; the feasibility of retrofitting
to coal is also being considered. In addition, through the rehabilitation
and upgrading of transmission and distribution networks operated by the
Jamaica Public Service Company (JPSC), as well as through improved
maintenance, the Government hopes to effect substantial fuel savings. The
Bank is currently considering a loan to JPSC for this purpose. Such a loan
would continue the prc'grams finances under two earlier Bank projects.
100.      The Government is also attempting to develop indigenous energy
sources. In this regard, an onshore oil and gas exploration project
supported by the IDB is under way; offshore exploration is being supported
through a project that has received Bank financing. The Government intends
to undertake all oil and gas exploration activities through, or in
partnership with, private oil companies. The feasibility of hydropower
development at various sites, among them the Blue Mountain, is also being
studied. Finally, the development of nontraditional energy sources,
including peat, solar energy and other alternative sources are being
explored.
Tax Reform
101.      Reform of the taxation system would contribute to public resource
mobilization, to reduce inequities, and to increase economic efficiency.
There is scope to increase the buoyancy of the tax system; this could be
accomplished substituting ad valorem tax rates for specific rates (about
half of the revenue generated by indirect taxes results from specific
rates) and introducing periodic reassessments of property values. Some
excise taxes may be increased, particularly for goods whose imports are



- 39 -
effected by QRs. Tax administration could be improved to prevent
reportedly large evasion and arrears, in particular with respect to the
income tax. The income tax system has brought about certain inequities
through evasion encouraged by high marginal tax rates, negligible
penalties, and poor tax administration.
102.      Action Program.  The Government is planning a number of measures
during the next two years in order to increase receipts of tax revenues and
improve the fiscal position. First, a Board of Review has recently been
established with the purpose of overseeing administrative strengthening of
the tax system. In this regard, the Board has already initiated programs
to improve revenue collection and encourage compliance, recruit and train
staff, and to monitor the assessing activities of the Revenue Departments.
Second, steps are being taken to review the property tax sytem through
revaluation of land and revision of rates. It is expected that this
process will be completed by FY83/84. Third, the income tax system, both
personal and corporate, is being reviewed. Among other aspects, the rate
structure, allowances, and means of reducing tax avoidance and erosion are
being assessed. Fourth, the Government is planning to shift to an ad
valorem system of sales tax in order to increase revenues and improve the
efficiency of administration. Fifth, the Government is reviewing the
excise taxes applicable to goods whose imports are limited by quantitative
restrictions. Finally, computerization of the tax collection department
will strengthen the administration of a variety of taxes.
III. PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY, 1982-86
A. Directions of the Jamaican Economy
103       The economic policies of the new Government of Jamaica emphasize
the dynamic role of the private sector in pursuing an export-led
development strategy. They differ substantially from past policies that
stressed the leading role of the public sector and oriented production
towards the requirements of the domestic market.
104.      If the private sector is to become the main engine of growth, a
major effort will be needed in order to reestablish a propitious investment
climate. The Government's positive attitude towards investors, domestic
and foreign, has resulted in the creation of several bilateral business
groups through which numerous investment proposals and enquiries are being
processed. External private capital plays a major role in the Government's
program (paras 45-46). At the same time, efforts to increase the savings
of public enterprises and to rationalize and limit the investment
activities of the public sector (jointly with the increase in savings of
the Central Government) will reduce the public sector's claim on scarce
investible resources (paras 32-33). The creation of medium-term lending
institutions seeks to provide an adequate channel for private sector
financing (paras 34-35).



- 40 -
105.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism are likely to be the main
sources of output growth in the 1980s. The bauxite and alumina industry
also has a role to play, contributing to ease the balance of payments
constraint; such a role, however, is likely to be less important than in
the 1960s and early 1970s because of the lack of domestic energy resources.
106.      Agriculture, manufacture, and tourism hold the greatest promise
for rapid output growth, employment creation, and foreign exchange
earnings. In connection with agriculture, the Government's program
emphasizes better resource use (paras 48-51), the reconstruction of
commercial agriculture including rehabilitation programs for the sugar and
banana subsectors (paras 58-63 and 64-65), and the deregulation of the
sector through a revision of the role of the EMOs. The factors limiting
the growth of manufacturing production (such as availability of foreign
exchange and export incentives) are likely to be overcome faster and,
therefore, the sector holds the greatest promise in terms of dynamic output
growth and employment creation. However, rapid growth can only take place
if extraregional exports increase substantially; the Government's strategy
emphasizes redressing the balance of the incentives system, reducing the
profitability of production for the domestic market (through the
elimination of QRs) (paras 71-74) and increasing the attractiveness of
nontraditional exports (para 75).
B. Output, Income and Expenditure
107.      The stabilization efforts and the medium-term programs launched
by the Government of Jamaica are expected to put the economy once again on
a growth course. Real GDP growth has been projected at 3.8% in 1982, 4.9%
in 1983, and at rates fluctuating between 4.0% and 4.5% in 1984-1986.
These growth rates, to be attained through the adoption of an export
oriented development strategy, would imply a strong economic performance,
especially in view of the fact that the world economy is projected to grow
relatively slowly during those years. i/ These projections imply, given
a rate of population growth of 1% per annum, that per capita GDP in 1986,
would reach--in terms of US$ of 1980--a value of $1442, which would be 18%
over the 1981 level, but still 13% below the 1972 peak level.
108.      On the expenditure side, the macroeconomic projections reflect a
shift from consumption to investment; in this framework, private
consumption expenditures would attain modest gains. Measured at constant
prices, the share of investment expenditures in GDP has been projected to
1/   The World Development Report IV, for example, projects "midpoint" OECD
growth at 2.5% per annum during 1980-85; this compares to 5.1%
(1960-70), 3.3% (1970-80), and 1.3% during 1980.



- 41 -
increase from 14% in 1981 to 19% in 1986, reflecting the need gradually
to intensify the capital accumulation effort in order to achieve the growth
targets. The share of total consumption expenditures, private plus public,
has been projected to decrease from 89% in 1981 to 79% in 1986 reflecting
the need to limit the growth of consumption to rates consistent with the
expansion in investment. Public consumption expenditures were projected to
decline 3.5%, reflecting the Governments objectives of reducing public
expenditures relative to GDP and of also reducing public sector employment
to the extent of the labor force attrition rate. On the other hand private
consumption expenditures were projected to increase 15% over the projection
period, permitting some increase in the standards of living.

109.      The financing of the investment effort has been projected to
change its composition, in line with the Government's policies.
Investment--measured at current prices--is projected to increase as a share
of GDP, rising from nearly 17% in 1981 to about 24% in the last two years
of the projection period. Internal saving is expected to finance a growing
portion of the capital accumulation effort, while external saving would
finance a decreasing share. Internal saving are projected to increase from
3% of GDP in 1981 to 16% in 1986. The expected rise in public sector
saving from -1.2% of GDP in 1981 to 6% by 1984 reflects the Government's
commitment to strengthen the financial performance of the Central
Government and to increase current saving of major public enterprises.
Private sector saving is also expected to show a rising trend. External
saving, the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, is
projected to decline from nearly 14% of GDP in 1981 to 7.4% in 1986.

a/  Public Sector Investment Program and financing plan have not been
defined beyond FY83/84.
110.      Agricultural output is expected to grow 28% during the projection
period. During the initial years, the recovery of traditional export
crops--sugar and bananas--would constitute the major source of growth;
later on, other agricultural activities are expected to provide the main
impetus to growth. Sugar output has been projected to increase from
200,000 MT in 1981 to 330,000 tons in 1986, a level consistent with the
productive capacity of the sugar factories that will continue operating.
Output of bananas has been projected to increase from 70,000 MT in 1981 to
200,000 MT in 1986, a level that would be consistent with the Government's
objective of filling the quota in the UK market. For both products the
projected increases are steep; but in both cases, output is severely
depressed and the targeted levels only imply its recovery to previously
attained levels.
111.      The mining sector has been projected to grow 18% during the
projection period. The annual growth rates vary considerably reflecting
the specific hypotheses that were adopted. In the case of bauxite, output
levels reflect the recent decision of the US Government to purchase
Jamaican bauxite for its strategic stockpile in 1982 and 1983. In the case
of alumina, it was assumed that the existing reduction plants would
gradually approach capacity utilization, reaching it in 1985, and that the
Jamalco plant will be expanded by 350,000 MT/year with the new capacity
coming into operation in 1986.
112.      The manufacturing sector has been projected to increase by 46%
during the projection period. The projected output value for the terminal
year of the projections would be 2% higher than the peak level reached in
1973. Annual growth rates are higher during the first three years,
reflecting the existence of vast unutilized capacity in the manufacturing
sector, and/or the possibility of restoring productive capacity, degraded
during the last few years, through minor investments. The assumed pattern
of annual growth rates reflects increased availability of foreign exchange,
some expansion of domestic demand, and a substantial increase in
manufactured exports.



- 43 -
113.      Construction activity has been projected to increase 48% from
1981 to 1986; annual growth would be smaller during the first two years
than during the last three, reflecting the gradual pick up in private
investment. Gross Domestic Product generated in the rest of the productive
sectors has been projected to decline in the case of government services
and to increase in the case of the remaining sectors. The decline in
government services was projected at 3.5% with respect to the 1981 level,
reflecting the Government's intention to reduce public employment. The
rest of the productive sectors were projected to increase 25%, following
the increase in economic activity.

C.   The Balance of Payments
114.      The medium-term balance of payments projections are based on the
Government's export-led development strategy. Growth in export earnings
reflects the program's objective to put unutilized capacity to work in order
to generate foreign exchange quickly. The anticipated increase in economic
growth would need to be supported by increased imports, particularly of raw
materials and capital goods. In nominal terms, the current account deficit is
not projected to begin a gradual decline until 1985. The balance of payments
will continue to be the binding constraint on the economy; the projections
imply continued reliance on public capital inflows, but the estimated
requirements are somewhat lower in the latter three years of the projection
period. Consistent with the Government's objective of relying more on the
private sector, direct foreign investment is expected to be a significant
component of capital inflows, thus contributing to the gradual reduction in
the need for foreign official assistance.
115.      Growth of the volume of exports of goods and non-factor services is
expected to average 7.1% a year during 1982-86. Attaining this projected
rate, however, will entail a substantial effort, particularly if the world
economy only grows modestly as it is now expected to. The volume of exports
of bauxite is expected to attain substantially higher levels in 1982-84,
reflecting purchases by the US Government for its strategic stockpile. The
volume of alumina exports, on the other hand,is expected to decline nearly 12%
in 1982, but after this year, it is expected to grow   gradually to reach full
capacity utilization by 1985. In 1986, alumina exports would increase by 12%,
reflecting the completion of the Jamalco plant 350,000 MT/year expansion.
Volumes of the traditional export crops of sugar and bananas are also expected
to rise, in line with the Government's objective of exploiting fully its
guaranteed markets in Europe and the action programs for those sectors, Sugar
exports would begin to increase in 1983, rising from the 1982 projected volume
of 100,000 MT to 230,000 MT by 1986. The recovery of banana exports from the
depressed 1981 level of 22,000 tons would start in 1982 and by 1986 exports
would fill the quota in the UK market, 150,000 tons. Reflecting their pivotal
role in the Government's export-oriented program, manufactured exports are
projected to nearly triple from a 1981 nominal value of US$116 million to
US$331 million in 1986, representing an average real growth of 15% a year.
This growth assumes that the sector will undergo significant structural
changes during this period. Tourism is expected to achieve average real
growth of 9% per annum as capacity utilization gradually is increased to a
nearly 70% hotel occupancy rate by 1986. After taking into account projected
changes in international prices, the nominal growth of exports of goods and
non-factor services is expected to average 14.4% a year during the period,
rising from US$1.5 billion in 1981 to nearly US$2.9 billion in 1986.

116.      Growth in the volume of imports of goods and non-factor services
is projected at of about 5% between 1982 and 1986; the nominal increase is
expected to average 12.2% per annum, from US$1.7 billion in 1981 to
slightly over US$3 billion in 1986. Jamaica's fuel import bill would rise
from an estimated US$450 million in 1981 to US$724 million in 1986. Energy
conservation is expected to generate oil import savings in
the non-bauxite/alumina economy of about 20% by 1985, so that the volume of
fuel imports would increase by only 8% over the period. In line with the
expected expansion of output in the mining, manufacturing and construction
sectors, imports of raw materials and capital goods are expected to record
an average real increase of about 8% per year. Outflows of investment
income are projected to average about US$360 million a year given the rapid
increase in public external debt, and also reflecting higher private sector
remittances, particularly in the latter years of the projection period,
from the mining sector and other direct foreign investments.

117.      The share of the current account deficit in GDP is projected to fall
gradually from 14% in 1982 to 7.4Z in 1986.  The nominal current account
deficit is projected to peak at US$524 million in 1984; thereafter the deficit
would decline gradually to US$439 million by 1986.
118.      Net external capital inflows averaging about US$520 million, would
be required to cover the current account deficit, external debt amortization
and an increase in international reserves. External capital requirements
would peak at US$544 million in 1984, and would fall to US$469 million in the
last year of the period. About 30% of the requirements would be covered by
private capital flows whose importance would increase from a share of 14% in
1982 to 39% in 1986. A large share of the estimated direct investment
corresponds to the anticipated expansion of the Jamalco alumina plant. In
addition, the Government is trying to attract other foreign investments,
particularly joint ventures, and has set up an organization to manage
promotion efforts and to assist interested businessmen. Of course, the
projections for private direct investment (other than alumina-related) are
highly tentative. If they are less than anticipated, the requirements of
public capital would be correspondingly tigher or the growth targets would
have to be scaled down. The remaining 70% of external capital requirements
are projected to be filled by public capital disbursements averaging US$565
million a year. Disbursements would peak in 1982 at US$642 million, but
decline to lower levels, reaching US$533 million in 1986.

D. Creditworthiness
119.       Because of the rapid increase in public external debt in recent
years, Jamaica's debt service ratio has risen to 20.3% in 1981. The burden
will ease particularly after 1983, and the projected debt service ratio
would reach 16% in 1986. The continued requirement for public external
capital results in a rising ratio of public external debt to GDP, from a
projected 52.5% share in 1981 to a high of 61% in 1983 before gradually
falling in the following three years, reaching 56% in 1986.   Nevertheless,
the new Jamaican Government is implementing a program to end the country's
long period of economic decline and to initiate economic recovery which is
supported by a three-year agreement with the IMF. The Government has
defined a program for the structural transformation of the economy in close
consultation with the Bank. With the policies adopted by the Government,
the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments would decline
from 14% of GDP in 1981 to about 7% of GDP in 1986; this is a substantial
improvement but Jamaica will need to continue reducing this deficit in
subsequent years. On this basis, provided Jamaica successfully carries out
its economic stabilization and recovery program, it should be considered
creditworthy for continued external assistance, subject to close monitoring
of implementation of the action program described above.
PART IV - BANEK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
120.      The Bank has made 25 loansl:/ in Jamaica totalling US$330.2
million after cancellations. Of this amount, US$117.4 million (36%) has
been for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power,
water supply and sewerage; US$98.5 million (30%) for program-type lending
and for a revolving fund for financing of inputs for export industries; and
the remainder has been for agriculture and agroindustry (12%), education
(7%), sites and services (5%), forestry (4%), population and nutrition
(3%), small-scale enterprises (2%), and petroleum exploration (2%). At the
end of 1980, Jamaica's debt to the Bank stood at US$171 million, or 14% of
external debt outstanding and disbursed; debt service to the Bank during
the year amounted to US$16.7 million, or 10% of total debt service. These
shares are not expected to change substantially in the next five years.
The undisbursed amount of Bank loans as of September 30, 1981 amounted to
US$97.3 million. There have been four IFC investments in Jamaica, with the
most recent being a loan in 1981 to a flour mill company.
1J   Including a telecommunications loan made in 1967 to the Jamaica
Telephone Company and cancelled in the same year, but not including a
US$6.8 million Third Education Project for vocational education, which
was approved by the Executive Directors on December 15, 1981.



- 49 -
121.      Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized
infrastructure investment. Although financing for this purpose continued,
the emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housing and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In
response to the changing economic situation, a further shift in Bank
lending took place in Jamaica in the late 1970s. The priority needs of
this most recent period have been the country's critical short-to-medium
balance of payments and production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending
program contained a US$30 million program loan and an US$18 million loan
for the rehabilitation of sugar factories. The FY79 US$12 million forestry
project and US$31.5 million second program loan were directed at similar
needs. Most of the FY79 program loan proceeds were allocated to the
financing of import needs of export industries through the establishment of
a revolving Export Development Fund. Other FY79 lending operations
included a fourth highway loan of US$16.0 million and a small-scale
industry loan of US$7.0 million. In the absence of a medium-term economic
program no loans were made in FY80. In FY81, the Bank made a second loan
for the Export Development Fund and a loan for offshore petroleum
exploration.
122.      Project implementation difficulties have occurred in Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These difficulties have had three
principal causes: (i) shortage of key personnel; (ii) organizational and
structural problems in the public sector, including inadequacies in the
management systems used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii)
budgeting restraints resulting in shortages of local financing. The
difficult economic conditions of the last several years have affected and
intensified the problems in all areas. The Government has committed itself
to deal with these problems through the structural adjustment program that
it has undertaken, which includes specific measures for improved project
management, monitoring and financing.
123.      The Bank's lending program for FY82 includes--in addition to the
proposed structural adjustment loan--an already approved US$6.8 million
loan for vocational education, a US$6 million technical assistance loan
which would help support the structural adjustment program and a US$14.7
million loan to expand the Kingston Free Zone, directed at encouraging
additional foreign investment for export industries. Other projects
under consideration for Bank financing are a third power project, aimed at
rehabilitating the electric power system, and agricultural and industrial
credit projects, which would support new credit institutions and provide
medium- and long-term capital for private sector investment, particularly
in those areas which will result in increased exports. If the proposed SAL
is a success, i.e. if the Government Program is executed as projected and
has the expected results, a follow-up SAL may also be considered for FY83.



- 50 -
124.      Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies
has been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending
strategy. The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort
for the Caribbean called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development. The Group has met annually in Washington since 1978. The
Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries and the
recipient countries. Within the framework of the Group, individual country
subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative group meetings, have been
held. The subgroup meetings for Jamaica have provided an opportunity to
examine jointly the country's economic situation and policies, to consider
a country project list, and to coordinate overall assistance efforts. As a
result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of related donor
activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank and IMF
assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing of US$225 million in FY81 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. This assistance financed inter alia the local cost requirements of
several Bank-assisted projects. The Caribbean Group has also provided a
basis for cofinancing foreign exchange costs with the OPEC Special Fund in
the Bank-assisted Second Power Project. In addition to the close
relationship established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican
problems, the Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of
the Caribbean Group--the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean
Development Bank--as well as with bilateral aid agencies in several major
donor countries.
PART V - THE PROPOSED LOAN
Previous Related Lending
125.      The Bank has made three previous loans to Jamaica to provide
balance of payments support and expand exports. The first such loan was
approved in December 1977 and was in the amount of US$30 million.
Disbursement of the loan was conditioned on the country meeting specific
macroeconomic targets and the adoption of a three-year public sector
investment program satisfactory to the Bank. The loan financed a wide
range of imports and was completely disbursed within seven months of Board
approval. The loan played an important role in helping to alleviate urgent
fiscal and balance of payments problems. It also helped to intensify the
dialogue between the Bank and the Government on key economic problems and
institutionalize the preparation on an annual basis of a rolling three-year
public investment program. A second program loan of US$31.5 million was
made in May 1979 to support the Government's program to expand the value of
exports of non-traditional manufactured goods. Loan funds were used to
establish a revolving Export Development Fund, which provided foreign
exchange for the importation by exporters of raw materials. The Fund has
been successful in allocating scarce foreign exchange to those sectors in
the economy that are most important in alleviating the country's balance of



- 51 -
payments problem. Funds under the Second Program Loan for the Export
Development Fund have been completely disbursed and a US$37.0 million
follow-on loan was made in May 1981. Up to US$26 million of loan funds
have been made available under this last loan to the Export Development
Fund to provide a continued availability of foreign exchange to meet the
current import requirements of exporters. The balance of the loan has been
made available to provide medium-term financing (US$10 million) to
exporters and their suppliers for the importation of capital equipment, for
limited inventories of imported inputs, and for technical assistance (US$1
million). Access to the Export Development Fund was expanded under the
last loan to include banana exporters.
Loan Description
126.      The proposed loan amount would be US$76.2 million, of which US$50
million would be available immediately to finance a wide range of raw
materials, intermediate goods, capital goods and spare parts. US$25
million of loan funds would be available to be released for the same
purpose within six months after loan signing, provided that the Government
has satisfactorily completed or undertaken the actions referred to in
Section II.B and US$1.2 million which would be provided to finance the
front-end fee.
127.      The proposed loan represents about 5% of Jamaica's estimated
total import requirements over the next twelve months. It is part of a
package of external balance of payments support from the IMF, bilateral
donors and the commercial banks.  It would help support the Government's
program of structural adjustment described in Part II.
Policy Actions
128.      The table on pages 10-15 summarizes the policy actions that were
taken prior to Board presentation and those that will have to be taken
prior to the release of the second tranche of the loan. A discussion of
these actions is contained in Section II.B.   A Bank mission to review
progress made with respect to the actions required for the release of the
second tranche is scheduled to visit Jamaica in June 1982.
Disbursement and Procurement
129.      The first tranche of the loan is expected to be disbursed within
sixty days after loan effectiveness and the second tranche within thirty
days after it has been determined that the policy actions that have been
taken are satisfactory (subparagraph 2(2) of Schedule 1 to the Loan
Agreement). Disbursements for the entire loan are expected to be completed
within eight months of loan effectiveness.
130.      The loan would finance the CIF cost of eligible imports, subject
to documentary evidence that they had been paid on or after loan signing
(subparagraph 2(l)(f) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement). Luxury
products and armaments are excluded and petroleum products may not



- 52 -
constitute more than 25% of the amount of the loan (subparagraph 2(1)(b)(c)
and (e) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement). The Bank of Jamaica, the
country's central bank, would be responsible for the coordination and
collection of relevant documentation and preparing withdrawal applications
under the loan (Section 2.10 of the Loan Agreement).
131. -   Procurement would be limited to goods from Bank member countries,
Switzerland and Taiwan. Both private and public sector imports would be
eligible for financing. Imports are likely to be procured primarily by
private firms following normal commercial practice. Public sector imports
would be in accordance with standard government practices, which ensure
reasonable prices. All purchases exceeding US$5 million would be through
international competitive bidding. Procurement of goods financed under the
loan is to be governed by the provision of Schedule 3 to the Loan
Agreement.)
Use of Counterpart Funds
132.      The Jamaican dollar equivalent of imports financed under the loan
would be credited to a Special Loan Fund Account in the Bank of Jamaica
held by the Ministry of Finance and used to finance projects in the Cabinet
approved public sector investment program for FY81/82-FY83/84 (Section 3.01
of the Loan Agreement).
Proposed Technical Assistance Loan
133.      A proposed US$6 million technical assistance loan is to be
presented to the Executive Directors on or about the same date as this
proposed loan. The technical assistance loan would finance experts for
periods up to two years, short-term consultants and studies necessary for
the Government to carry out its structural adjustment program. The details
of this program are described in the President's Report for the Technical
Assistance Loan.
Risks
134.      There is little risk in the administrative arrangements that have
been made for the drawdown of the loan. The procurement, documentation and
disbursement procedures are similar to those used in the Bank's first
program loan which disbursed rapidly. Whether the Government will command
the needed administrative capacity is one type of risk that is present,
whether it will have the needed national support is another. The
administrative reforms begun by the Government and the technical assistance
the Government will receive from the Bank's technical assistance loan
should assist the Government in improving its capacity to administer the
structural adjustment program. The actions required by the program will
challenge the Government's political will and determination. Some
politically difficult measures have, however, already been taken. These
include especially the Government's announcement of its decision to



- 53 -
dismantle the sugar cooperatives, the increase in the domestic price of
sugar and the elimination of some of the quantitative restrictions on
imports. The Government's willingness to take these actions augurs well
for its determination to take future politically difficult actions. And
the fact that it has a large Parliamentary majority (52 seats out of 60)
suggest that it will be in a position to do so.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
135.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Jamaica and
the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the project are
listed in Section III of Annex III.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
136.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  Status of Projects in Execution as of September 30, 1981
Ln. No. 1003-JM: Sites and Services: US$15.0 million Loan of June 13,
1974; Effective date: September 9, 1974;
Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Project implementation is about 4-1/2 years behind schedule due
to delays in establishing and staffing the project unit and problems with
contractors. These delays resulted in a substantial cost overrun of the
original project. In view of the Government's budgetary constraints the
project has therefore been restructured to allow for some reduction in the
number of lots to be developed and for a significant reduction in housing
standards. The Government has recently proposed additional changes
involving the provision of shell houses on uncommitted lots and the
conversion of one site into an industrial estate. The Bank will study
these proposals but has not yet taken a position. The revised project is
expected to be completed by mid-1982.
2/   Loan of $11.4 million for Jamaica Flour Mills Ltd. approved, but not
signed.

Ln. No. 1032-JM: Third Highway Project: US$13.5 million Loan of July 26,
1974; Effective date: September 27, 1974; Closing date:
September 30, 1981.
Construction has been delayed due to shortages of engineering
staff, reliable equipment, cement and asphalt. The project is now
completed, about four years later than the appraisal estimate.
Ln. No. 1146-JM: Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project: US$15 million
Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective date: June 24, 1976;
Closing date:  December 31, 1981.
Project implementation is more than 3 years behind the appraisal
schedule but is now proceeding satisfactorily. The Borrower's financial
position has, however, continuously deteriorated. A 45% tariff increase
took effect August 1, 1981 but additional measures will be required of the
Borrower in order to comply with the Loan Agreement.
Ln. No. 1284-JM: Second Population Project: US$6.8 million Loan of june
12, 1976; Effective date: August 30, 1976; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation has progressed reasonably well. The civil
works on health center facilities are expected to be completed by the end
of 1981. Disbursements are however lagging behind. Completion of other
project components is expected to be delayed until early 1982.
Ln. No. 1464-JM: Rural Development Project: US$15 million Loan of June 29,
1977; Effective date: October 14, 1977; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Project implementation had initially been slow due to shortage of
funds, manpower problems and the difficult general economic situation.
Recent progress has however been encouraging; most project components are
now under implementation and are advancing satisfactorily. The first group
of settlers has been placed and a large share of the farm homes have been
completed.
Ln. No. 1516-JM: Second Power Project:  US$20 million Loan of March 6,
1978; Effective date:  June 1, 1978; Closing date:
September 30, 1982.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily after
considerable delays during the initial phase of project implementation, and
most of the loan proceeds have been committed. JPSC's operations have been
seriously affected by the limited availability of its most fuel efficient
generating units due to poor maintenance and operating procedures and a
lack of spare parts. The Government has requested a Bank loan for the
rehabilitation of these units, and for improvements to JPSC's transmission
and distribution system. Although JPSC's financial position has improved,
an increase in tariffs will be required to meet the agreed covenant.

Ln. No. 1517-JM: Sugar Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million Loan of March
6, 1978; Effective date: June 1, 1978; Closing date:
June 30, 1983.
Although some progress in the rehabilitation of factories has
been made, implementation slowed down during the last two years due to the
extremely difficult financial position of the National Sugar Company,
executor of the project. The Government is now planning the divestment of
the sugar mills owned by NSC and the dissolution of the sugarcane
cooperatives that supply the cane. The future of the project will be
decided in negotiations with the Government.
Ln. No. 1609-JM: Small Scale Enterprise Development Project: US$7 million
Loan of August 2, 1978; Effective date: December 27,
1978; Closing date: June 30, 1982.
Implementation of the program for modern small scale enterprises
executed by the Premier Investment Corporation (PIC) is ahead of schedule.
Implementation of the sub-program for very small scale enterprises has been
adversely affected by the uncertainty concerning the institutional
arrangements. Subject to Government confirmation remaining uncommitted
funds from this project could be reallocated to PIC.
Ln. No. 1715-JM: Second Program Loan: US$31.5 million Loan of June 8,
1979; Effective date: August 27, 1979; Closing date:
December 31, 1982.
Loan proceeds allocated to the Export Development Fund to finance
imports of raw materials and components for expansion of nontraditional
exports have been fully disbursed. Implementation of the technical
assistance components financed with loan proceeds is proceeding

THE PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND FINANCING PLAN
1.        The public sector investment program I/ reflects the
stabilization efforts of the Government of Jamaica as well as the new
emphasis on the private sector and the attempt to rationalize the
involvement of the public sector in numerous activities. It also seeks to
increase the supply and reliability of services that are crucial inputs for
the productive sectors. The program for FY81/82-FY83/84 projects total
expenditures of J$2.7 billion and implies an average annual rate of public
investment expenditure of 14.4% of GDP. In order to promote the timely
execution of projects and minimize cost overruns, the Government is
presently receiving technical assistance financed under the aegis of the
IBRD's second program to provide, inter alia, help in the formulation of
the investment program, and the control of both current and capital
expenditures. In the first stage, only Central Government capital
expenditures will be monitored; in a second stage, a reporting and
expenditure control system will be extended to the rest of the public
sector investment program.
2.        The program allocates about 46% of investment expenditures
to economic infrastructure, another quarter to directly productive
activities, and about 25% to social infrastructure. Almost 40% of total
expenditures correspond to new projects; the rest represent the
continuation of ongoing activities. The proportion of expenditures for new
projects increases throughout the program from 16% in 1981/82 to 62% in
FY83/84. The year by year allocations of expenditures in the public sector
investment program show the Government's attempts to reorient its
investment. While the proportion allotted to economic infrastructure
increases through time, the proportions devoted to directly productive
activities and to social infrastructure decrease.

Investment Corporation, Airport Authority, Air Jamaica, Broadcasting
Company, Merchant Marine, Omnibus Services, Public Service Company,
JAMINTEL, Montego Bay Bus Company, National Hotels and Properties,
National Sugar Corporation, National Water Authority, Port Authority,
Urban Development Corporation, Water Commission, Jamaica Telephone,
Sugar Industry Authority.

3.        Economic infrastructure absorbs about J$1.3 billion, or about 45%
of the investment program. The largest project is the Blue Mountain
Multipurpose Scheme, which in its first stage would provide water from the
Yallahs River and from the northern slopes of the Blue Mountains to
Kingston. With additional investments, 55 MW of electricity, or about 20%
of current consumption, could be generated, and water for irrigation could
also be provided. The total cost of the project over a 20-year period
would be about J$800 million. Investment in electricity generation
projects of the Jamaica Public Service Company total J$215 million, of
which J$127 million would be accounted for by new projects. These involve
upgrading of the existing oil-fired power plants and of the transmission
and distribution systems, the installation of slow-speed diesel generating
equipment, and several small scale hydroelectric projects. The Jamaica
Merchant Marine plans to acquire ships (most of them second hand) for a
total of J$105 million. Given the projected cash flow of the company, the
investment plan can be carried out with foreign credits without assistance
from the Central Government. The investment plans of the Port Authority of
Jamaica envisage expenditures of J$43 million. The major component is the
expansion of the port of Kingston to enhance its role as a central
transhipment port for the Caribbean region. The Kingston Free Zone will be
substantially expanded.
4.        Jamaica is also providing for two oil exploration projects.  The
IDB has approved a project for onshore oil and gas exploration amounting to
J$31 million, undertaken by the Petroleum Company of Jamaica. The Bank has
approved a project for offshore oil and gas exploration amounting to J$9
million over the period. Both projects have already begun execution.
5.        Directly productive activities account for J$627 million, or
almost one-fourth of the public sector investment program. Investments in
agriculture amount to two-thirds of that amount and include a large number
of ongoing projects, the most important of which are the World
Bank-financed First Rural Development, Sugar Factory Rehabilitation, and
Forestry; the AID-supported Second Rural Development, and the IDB-financed
Black River Upper Morass (BRUMDEC) drainage and irrigation. New projects
include the Hillside Restoration and Terracing, the Soil Conservation and
Watershed Management, the Small Farm Credit and a second BRUMDEC project.
There is only one project in the mining sector: the expansion of the
JAMALCO alumina refining plant, with a total cost of about J$1.0 billion.
The Government's direct contribution to equity would be approximately 17%
of that amount. The rehabilitation and expansion of the cement
plant--planned with support of the IDB--is the most important industrial
project in the program; investments during the three years would amount to
about J$30 million.

6.        Social infrastructure would amount to J$671 million, or 25% of
the public sector investment program. Housing would absorb two-thirds of
this amount, most of which would be construction financed by the National
Housing Trust. The health sector would account for J$46 million. Most of
the planned investments in the sector seek to upgrade the services of rural
hospitals and health centers with assistance of AID financing. A World
Bank-financed project is currently establishing a large number of rural
health centers in the western part of the island. Investments in education
would total J$80 million; the largest new project is a third World Bank
project that would start in 1982, concentrating on vocational training and
facilities. The Government will also launch a new youth development
program aimed at improving vocational skills of unemployed rural youth.
Financing Plan
7.        The public sector investment program amounts to a total of
J$2,734 million during 1981/82-1983-84. Of this amount, it is anticipated
that public sector savings (including depreciation funds and capital
revenues) will be able to finance approximately 16%; this implies an
increase from -8% of public sector investment in FY81/82 to about 35% in
FY83/84. Other domestic sources should be able to provide about 19%. The
remainder of the financing would need to be mobilized from external sources
(see Table 2).
Public Sector Savings
8.        The successful execution of the financing plan requires a
substantial increase in public sector savings, from an estimated -1.2% of
GDP in FY81/82 to about 5% in FY83/84. The Government hopes to achieve
this improvement through a number of measures. With regard to the Central
Government, the strategy focuses primarily on strict control of current
expenditures, improvement in tax administration and collection, a shift to
ad valorem rates for sales taxes, and the rationalization of the income tax
system. By these means, the Government hopes to increase current revenues
moderately from about 27% of GDP in 1981/82 to about 28.7% in 1983/84, at
the same time that current expenditures are curtailed from almost 31% in
1981/82 to less than 28% in FY83/84. These projections would imply a
movement in the current position of the Central Government from -3.9% to
+0.8% of GDP over the same period.
9.        The rest of the general government (National Insurance, Housing
Trust and JNIC) will continue to be the single most significant source of
savings in the economy. However, the net surplus generated by the National
Insurance Scheme and the Housing Trust is likely to decline as a percentage
of GDP, in reflection of a projected increase in repayments to companies
having contributed to the Housing Trust. Accordingly, the Government will
need to intensify its savings generating efforts in other areas.



ANNEX IV

10.       The Government is focusing considerable effort on improving the
finances of the nonfinancial public enterprises. In this regard, it has
undertaken or is planning tariff and price increases for the Water
Commission, the Public Service Co., National Sugar Co., and other selected
enterprises. At the same time, it is planning the divestment of
unprofitable commercial enterprises. This program primarily affects
National Hotels and Properties and the National Sugar Co. Finally, the
Government is attempting to reduce costs through efforts to improve
management. Based on these efforts, it is estimated that the surplus
generated by the nonfinancial public enterprises can increase from -1% of
GDP in FY81/82 to about 1.3% in FY83/84.
Net External Financing
11.       As the public finances strengthen, the Government hopes to reduce
its reliance on external sources of finance; gross external inflows are
projected to drop from an estimated 15% of GDP in FY81/82 to about 12% in
FY83/84. The public sector investment program requires about J$1.8 billion
in net external financing; after taking amortization into account, the
total external capital requirement is approximately J$2.5 billion.
Approximtely 40% of this amount has already been committed, in the form of
projected external inflows from ongoing projects, balance of payments
assistance, and commercial and suppliers' credit inflows. Another 30%
represents external inflows which are reasonably certain, including inflows
associated with projects or programs in advanced stages of preparation.
The remainder, amounting to about J$750 million, would need to be mobilized
largely in the form of concessional, quickly disbursing assistance. The
availability of external capital at this level will depend, to some extent,
on the Government's ability to continue to improve macroeconomic management
and thus maintain the confidence of the international community.
Other Sources
12.       During the next two to three years, the Government will need to
continue to rely on other domestic sources of savings to finance its
operations. It hopes to reduce its reliance, however, from an estimated
4.4% of GDP in FY81/82 to about 2.50% in FY83/84. The financing plan
assumes banking system borrowing of about 2% of GDP, a level which is
broadly consistent with the financial targets of the IMF extended
facility. Other domestic sources (insurance companies, building societies,
and other institutions) would provide the remaining resources.

Development Policy Statement
1.   The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) requests the World Bank (IBRD) to
provide an amount of US$75 million in support of structural changes in the
economy. The Government also requests that the IBRD capitalize the
front-end fee of 1.5% and add such amount to the requested loan so that the
total loan amount will be $76.125 1/ million. The Program is also
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Donor Countries and
their agencies, and External Commercial Banks. A summary presentation of
the action programmes undertaken to achieve the structural transformation
of the economy is presented in Annex "A". 2/
2.   The objectives and strategies for Economic Recovery set out in the
Government's Economic Policy Memorandum attached hereto (Attachment "B"),
outline a programme to be followed over the three year period
1981/82-1983/84 in order to return the economy of Jamaica to a path of
self-sustaining growth.
3.   The status of the Jamaican economy at the end of 1980 and the
circumstances related thereto have been fully documented and analyzed in
the IBRD Economic Report "Jamaica: Development Policy Issues and Economic
Prospects." In brief: since 1973 Jamaica has experienced sustained
economic decline with falling per capita real GDP accummulating to 27% by
1980. This contraction in output and the deterioration in balance of
payments can be associated with:
(a) The deterioration in terms of trade due mainly to the rapid
increases in oil prices and rising interest rates;
(b) Tapering off of foreign investment inflows to the mining and
tourist sectors following completion of ongoing projects in 1973;
(c) The reduction of migrant net inflows as confidence in Jamaica
receded;
(d) A depressed level of private sector activity as a result of lack
of confidence; an erosion of market incentives; and subsequently
the uncertainty of an adequate and reliable flow of production
inputs because of the dramatic reduction of foreign commercial
credit and the chronic shortage of foreign exchange;
1/   The Development Policy Statement was not adjusted by the Government to
reflect the rounding up of the capitalized front-end fee to $1.2
million. The Government has, however, agreed to the rounded figure
and a loan amount of $76.2 million.
2/   Annex "A" to the Development Policy Statement of the Government of
Jamaica is the same as the matrix appearing on pages 10 to 15 and has
therefore not been reproduced in this Annex V.



-73 -                         ANNEX V
Page 2 of 14
(e) Contraction of the pool of managerial professional and technical
skills through emigration;
(f) Increasing problems of public sector management as the public
sector grew, partly in pursuit of political and social
objectives, but also as a reaction to retranchment in private
sector activity;
By 1980 investment activity in the public and private sector had declined
substantially; unemployment had attained a peak of some 30%; manufacturing
and hotel capacity were substantially underutilized; and the public
utilities/Government services had markedly deteriorated.
4.   The mission of the Economic Recovery Program is to restore economic
activity to a depressed economy and reduce the current high level of
unemployment. The objectives are:
(a) To restore the confidence of the private sector and
reactivate existing unutilized plant and equipment;
(b) To expand the industrial sector through incremental domestic and
foreign capital formation;
(c) To increase the level of foreign exchange earnings from goods and
services, particularly through the expansion of non-traditional
exports;
(d) To restore trade credit to normal levels;
(e) To restore solvency to the Bank of Jamaica by eliminating arrears
of trade payments, and building liquid foreign exchange reserves
to a level of up to three months' imports; and
(f) To substantially improve the performance of the public sector by
eliminating current account deficits and accruing reasonable
levels of public sector savings to support the financial
requirements of the public investment programme.
5.   Generally, the strategy for economic recovery and development
spans the decade of the eighties in three periods--1981/82-1983/84,
1984/85-1986/87, and 1987/88 to 1989/90. The initial focus is on the first
period 1981/82-1983/84 when the emphasis will be to:
(a) put unutilized capacity to work with the emphasis on an
export-oriented programme encompassing tourism, bauxite/alumina
and agricultural exports;
(b) rehabilitate and restore existing social and economic
infrastructure which are supportive of economic activity;



- 74 -
ANNEX V
Page 3 of 14
(c) initiate policy and structural adjustments to facilitate
expansion of productive capacity largely with the agricultural,
manufacturing, mining, and energy sectors, supplement foreign
exchange earnings and generate increasing employment
opportunities;
(d) create a climate and environment which will encourage confidence
in the private sector, support inititiave and enterprise and
attract external direct investment, technology and skills; and
(e) develop and introduce programmes of social and community
development as a complementary and positive factor in the
development process.
6.   The second phase of 1984/85 to 1986/87 would consolidate many of the
programmes for structural adjustment and expansion of the agricultural,
manufacturing and energy sectors. The expansion of main agricultural crops
of cocoa, coffee, coconuts, citrus have gestation periods of five to seven
years and therefore span both the first and second subperiods of the
decade. Energy development is also a medium term programme and will only
fructify by the end of the second phase. The third phase 1987/88 to
1989/90 would see the realization of the prospective outturn of the basic
adjustment programmes initiated in the first phase and consolidated in the
second. In conclusion, the enduring solution to the foreign exchange
problem, economic development issues, and employment creation are long term
in nature and the current Economic Recovery Program must be seen within
this perspective. Subsequent paragraphs detail the specific programmes and
measures developed and implemented for the adjustment process.
Deregulation and the Market System
7.   A critical element of the Recovery Program is the efficient working of
the market system. The Government is committed to the elimination of
controls which inhibit the attainment of optimum efficiency and has
initiated programmes to liberalize the market system in the cases of prices
controls, import licensing and state marketing.  Firstly, it is agreed that
price determination should be left to the forces of the market; however in
present circumstances some price controls will need to be retained
particularly for essential commodities which make up the staple diet of the
low income groups. Further, prices should be monitored where monopolistic
and oligopolistic practices exist. As a first step seventeen items were
decontrolled and a number of items freed for price adjustment, subject to
notification and no objection within a prescribed period by the Prices
Commission. The Government has instructed the Commission that, within
their jurisdiction, product prices must be fixed to provide a reasonable
rate of return on capital employed.

Page 4 of 14
8.   Secondly, the progressive liberalization of import restrictions will
in time, and as experience dictates, lead to the elimination of all
licensing requirements. It is recognized that a return to an open general
licensing system must depend on the recovery of export earnings, the return
of normal levels of international trade financing, and net financing flows
from direct/portfolio external investment. While it is too early to judge
the pace of liberalization, measures now in force in that direction are:
(a) the establishment of special retained accounts for foreign
exchange within the domestic banking system to finance imports of
non-prohibited goods without import license.
(b) A more liberal issue of no fund licenses for non-prohibited
imports.
(c) the automatic grant of import licenses for transactions falling
under the Export Development Fund programme supported by World
Bank resources.
9.   In the third place, it is a commitment that Agricultural Commodity
Boards marketing export crops other than sugar and bananas will permit
growers, if they so wish, to market products independently of the Boards,
subject to control of quantum, minimum prices, quality and packaging
standards. The appropriate Government directions have been given to the
Boards and Associations concerned with coffee, cocoa, citrus and pimento.
10. Both the banana industry and the sugar industry are now being
evaluated as to their structure and organization for future operations. A
team supported by inputs from United Brands Co. is at present analyzing all
aspects of the production and marketing of bananas for exports. The
Government owns 8 sugar factories. Two are unprofitable;one has already
been closed and the objective is to close the other after the 1981/82 crop;
five are to be divested by lease to domestic and external sugar producers;
one factory will be retained by the Government for the time being. A
significant portion of sugarcane production was organized on a cooperative
basis on lands leased from the Frome Moneymusk Land Company--a government
owned company. This venture has not been successful and the Government has
terminated the existing lease.
Agriculture - Policies and Programmes
11.  Domestic agriculture has enjoyed favorable prices in recent years,
largely explained by the foreign exchange shortage that led to compressed
food imports. Programmes and action taken to consolidate this
position are:
(a) The introduction of a system for delivery of an effective service
of inputs and advice to the farmer. The agricultural extension
sevices of Central Government are now being reorganized on the
T.V.M. system; such services provided by Commodity Boards will be
assessed;



- 76 -                        ANNEX V
Page 5 of 14
(b)  Credit availability and the provision of an effective financial
institution and mechanism. An Agricultural Credit Bank has been
established to moblize resources and wholesale finance through
the existing commercial banking system and selected Peoples
Cooperative Banks. This will be a more effective way of
dispensing credit and optimising the collection of debt service
flows. As an initial resource an application for support funds
in amount of US$25 million is before IFAD and IDB.
(c) The provision of an enhanced system for marketing of domestic
foodstuffs. The Rural Development Project of the World Bank has
already provided eight rural markets. An IDB programme currently
contemplates an additional 16 rural markets. Further an ongoing
USAID marketing programme will establish wholesale marketing
facilities with appropriate arrangements for grading and
packaging.
12.       Export agriculture has not had sustained growth and in two
areas--bananas and sugar--there has been substantial decline in export
availabilities. In some areas the farmers have not received even the full
benefit of increments in world market prices or exchange rate adjustments
due to the monopsony arrangements undertaken by commodity boards. In
paragraphs 9 and 10 it is explained that action has been taken to permit a
farmer, if he desires, to market outstide of these Boards. It is the
objective that where Boards perform the function of marketing agent returns
to farmers should be optimised. Accordingly, a management audit programme
for these agencies has been implemented, and evaluation of operational
efficiency and pricing policies will be undertaken by the appropriate
Ministry based on the audit reports. Three audits are complete; three
other audits are under examination; and appropriate instructions deriving
from all six audits will be issued by June 1982.
13. Expansion programmes for export agriculture, both agency-directed and
private sector supported, are on stream:
(a) Coffee: Jamaica has a unique product in its high quality Blue
Mountain coffee. 3,000 acres coffee expansion by the Coffee
Board supported by funding from the Commonwealth Development
Corporation. In addition, 6,000 acres of land in the foothills
have been allocated for coffee growing and private sector
interests--both internal and external--are being explored by the
Investment Promotion Agency (JNIP).
(b) Coconuts: An expansion project for 4,000 acres is being planned.
(c) Cocoa: The Cocoa Industry Board has commenced expansion of 4,000
acres with commercial bank financing. Some 2,000 acres have
already been established.



-  77 -                       ANNEX V
Page 6 of 14
(d) Citrus: A consultant from the European Development Fund is
assisting in preparing the feasibility studies for expansion of
3,000 acres of citrus and 1,000 acres of Tahiti limes.
14. In paragraph 10, it was explained that the structure and organization
of both the banana and sugar exporting sectors were being examined and
evaluated to determine the scale and modalities of future operations.
Already, a joint venture for a major banana expansion project has been
agreed in principle, between the Banana Company of Jamaica, United Brands
and the Jamaica Banana Producers Association. 2,200 acres have been
identified and an additional 1,800 acres are being sought. The preliminary
project cost is estimated at US$25.0 million. United Brands has agreed to
undertake the management of the project; and to provide technical
assistance and expertise to the export industry covering all aspects of
banana production including field practices, selection and quality control
and internal transportation. The Government will ensure that the
technology introduced is appropriate to Jamaica's socioeconomic conditions.
15. Quality incentive schemes have been introduced to encourage farmers to
use modern banana production practices. Credit to support external inputs
of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides are available from the Export
Development Fund and Canadian bilateral aid programmes. It is estimated
that 14,000 acres of good quality land are now in banana production. When
combined with the joint venture project and the technical support of United
Brands, Jamaica will be assured of 21,000 acres of high yield banana
production and by 1985/86 an estimated 150,000 tons per annum compared with
the annual average of 60,000 tons between 1978-1980, and an estimated
25,000 tons for 1981.
16. The Government has also assigned responsibility for the under 2 acre
banana grower to the Ministry of Agriculture. This will allow the
extension services of the Banana Company to concentrate on the larger
growers from whom the bulk of the export fruit is expected to come.
Greater emphasis is also being placed on supplemental ground spraying for
leafspot control to complement aerial spraying. Meanwhile, increased
prices have been approved to banana growers (from 9 cents/lb. to 11
cents/lb. with a quality premium of 2 cents/lb.).
17. In the sugar industry some basic decisions have already been
implemented. The domestic price of sugar has been increased by about 50%
and the guaranteed price paid to cane farmers increased by some 27%. An
additional price incre4se on domestic sugar is planned in order to limit
the deficit of the NSC/SIA to not more than J$25M in FY82. The action
programme has been developed to ensure (a) the timely availabilitv of
fertilizer and chemicals, (b) that land preparation equipment is available,
(c) that reaping and transportation equipment is available to farmers when
required, (d) that a road repair programme to improve the condition of cane
roads is implemented before the harvest season, (e) that irrigation systems
in the major cane growing areas are brought back to maximum efficiency, and
(f) that spare parts are available for equipment used in the industry.
Action has also been taken to improve the efficiency of the
Government-owned factories and to upgrade the key personnel in the
industry.

Page 7 of 14
18. Praedial larceny has been a major deterrent to production and a
disincentive to incremental investment in agriculture. The Government has
approved the application of stiffer penalities by the courts, and
simplified procedures to ensure that justice is swift and sure. The
appropriate legislation together with a system of agricultural wardens for
policing selected areas is being prepared for introduction by December
1982.
19.  To determine land resources and capabilities, the USAID has provided
15 man months of technical assistance to develop a land resource inventory
for Jamaica. The Netherlands Government has also agreed to support the
complementary programme of assessing and evaluating the economic
capabilities of land within the inventory. Land under Government ownership
and control will be divested but, where retained pending divestment, land
shall be put to best use. Proposals for release to the private sector of
bauxite agricultural lands are being evaluated; and properties estimated at
20,000 acres now in the hands of the Government Agricultural Development
Corporation are being assessed urgently by a specific task force to
determine use and possibilities for divestment.  It is expected that these
programmes will be implemented by June 1983.
Industrial Protection and Incentives
20. The manufacturing sector was established on an import substitution
policy within a framework of protection from competing import and special
fiscal incentives. The Government has announced that:
(a) The basic thrust for the development of the manufacturing sector
must be along export-oriented lines.
(b) The existing quantitative restrictions on imports will be
dismantled on a timely basis to permit producers to adjust
to competing imports.
(c) During the adjustment period a new manufacturer will not be
allowed to establish operations within existing incentive
legislation unless there is proof of competitiveness with prices
of landed imports, and justification based on net foreign
exchange earnings and employment generation.
(d) Additional QRs will not be extended to any new industry or
product.
21. The Government proposes to announce the elimination of quantitative
restrictions on a year-to-year basis as they fall due within the policy
objectives stated in paragraph 20 and the implementation strategy set out
in paragraphs 22-24. Items scheduled for removal will be announced in
Janaury of each of the five years 1983-87.  Each announcement will be
accompanied by specific adjustment programmes relevant to those categories
within the manufacturing sector where products are likely to be affected by
increasing competition arising from the elimination of quantitative
restrictions. Each programme would aim at directing manufacturers to new
opportunities within the export field and outline the possibilities of



- 79 -
ANNEX V
Page 8 of 14
restructuring the manufacturing operations of the product group together
with such supporting inputs as may be necessary to make the product
competitive in external markets. To ensure that the implementation
programme progresses with all deliberate speed a monitoring unit has been
established by the Government under the direction of the Honorouable Prime
Minister to review and evaluate the timely implementation of the
elimination process for QRs and the restructuring, retooling and directions
of categories within the manufacturing sector towards export markets. New
applicants for incentives have been told that they will not be granted any
protection by way of quantitative restrictions.
22. The Government will progressively remove the protection element now
enshrined within the existing restricted list of imports, over a five-year
period. Ultimately the list will be confined to products which are
strategic to national and social policies, eg. arms and drugs. Sixty-four
items were released on February 7, 1982. It must be recognized that
release means that such products would qualify for import licenses within
the regime, described at paragraph 8, subject to applicable criteria and
priorities for allocating scarce foreign exchange.
23. 300 items will be released over the period 1983-87. Two action
programmes will be pursued to determine the pace of release. Firstly,
prototypes of a rationalization programme are being developed for the
footwear and textile industries and marketing studies are being conducted.
The objective is to encourage producers to focus on a range of products
competitive with imported substitutes and, where comparative advantage may
permit access to export markets. A quantum increase in imports will be
allowed progressively leading to ultimate removal of import restrictions.
24. Secondly, a detailed study of cost structures of specific and critical
segments of the manufacturing sector will be made to evaluate the
implications of eliminating import restrictions taking account of the
present tariff levels and the possibilities within the obligations of the
CARICOM trading arrangements and common tariffs, for shifting to higher
tariff levels where necessary. Terms of reference have been developed and
technical assistance to speed the studies will be required.
25. By international standards the existing range of fiscal incentives for
export encouragement, industry and the hotel sector are considered
adequate. However, there is some doubt that the type and quantum of
incentives are indeed necessary to attract a flow of external investment;
further it is possible that the present system involves unnecessary
sacrifice of public revenues. Accordingly, a complete evaluation of fiscal
incentives will be made within the programme for fiscal reform agreed under
the current Fund programme. Additionally, and consistent with the export
bias of the recovery programme the review of incentives will also evaluate
the scope for modifications in the incentives system, that would reduce the
current discrimination against exports to third country markets. Such
modifications should be consistent with the commitments under the CARICOM
agreements on incentives and would result from a comprehensive action plan
to be prepared with the objective of increasing non-traditional exports
(para 29 below).



-80-                          ANNEX V
Page 9 of 14
26. Given the existing incentive programme, the Government has established
a Committee of Ministers to ensure its administration along lines which
provide optimum benefits to Jamaica. Applications are now evaluated on the
basis of the contribution to employment, net foreign exchange
earnings/savings, the value added component and price competitiveness.
Export Promotion
27. The export orientation of manufacturing production is supported by
incentive legislation for exports and the dedicated foreign exchange
resources of an Export Development Fund fed by IBRD loans. This is
buttressed by an Export Promotion Corporation and Trading House which
spearheads export promotion in external markets and product sales. The
Government has implemented a three year action programme for export
promotion supported by financial resources from the European Development
Fund. In addition expansion of the Free Trade Zone is in the advanced
planning stage and a project of US$13.5 million has been presented to the
IBRD to construct factory shells and infrastructure. Some five companies
for manufacturing garments with investment potential of US$ 3.7 million,
have already sought permission to establish in the Zone.
28.   Non-traditional exports have not shown great buoyancy in recent
years, and further are biased away from third countries and towards the
CARICOM market. To secure any meaningful benefits from the expansion of
non-traditional exports, clearly, it is necessary to encourage their
diversification towards markets of third countries. Accordingly, the
Government has decided to evaluate and put into effect an action programme
to increase non-traditional exports which would be put into effect, if
deemed appropriate, not later than June 30, 1982. The terms of reference
to prepare and evaluate such an action programme include the designing of
mechanisms to enhance the availability of foreign exchange for exporters
and increase the profitability of exports outside CARICOM. Measures could
include an expanded and more flexible system of retained accounts for
foreign exchange and provision of transferable export tax credit
certificates for non-traditional exports to third countries.  In addition
to these, the Action Plan will also take into account other possible export
promotion measures including pre- and post-shipment financing.
Investment Promotion
29. Private foreign investment inflows are an important ingredient for the
expansion of the manufacturing sector and the export thrust.  The
Government has initiated discussions between the business community of
Jamaica, North America and certain European countries to evaluate
investment opportunities and establish new ventures particularly on a joint
basis. An agency--JNIP--has been established to lead investment promotion,
maintain contact with potential investors and act as a "one" stop point for
proposals; the agency "fathers" each proposal, coordinates bureaucratic
action and ensures speedy processing. To date 449 proposals have been
approved with potential investment of US$718 million and a foreign exchange
content of US$418.5 million. Proposals include activities in
manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, mining, and transportation.

Page 10 of 14
Tourism
30. Jamaica has accommodation capacity for over 800,000 visitors. In 1980
stopover visitors totalled 395,000 and the estimate for 1981 is 396,400
compared to 433,000 in 1974. The main obstacle to growth was the political
and social climate, and the current stable environment provides a chance
for recovery in an industry where 90% of demand comes from the North
American continent. There are three main strands to the action programme.
Firstly, a vigorous promotion and advertising programme has been
implemented to restore the image of Jamaica as a vacation spot. Secondly,
within the overall programme for greater private sector involvement,
experienced hotel operators are encouraged to lease or buy existing
government-owned hotels. This will bring in the managerial and technical
know how. The programme is almost complete. Four hotels have been leased;
four are currently under lease negotiations. Thirdly, the national air
carrier is being geared to provide the necessary air seats. Unprofitable
routes have been closed; staff retrenched; equipment requirements evaluated
for upgrading the fleet; and arrangements for joint operations with
external airlines are being negotiated.
Bauxite
31. The bauxite and alumina industry has suffered a setback in growth due
to a softening in the aluminum market. The Government has taken steps to
diversify bauxite and alumina markets towards South America and European
sources. Agreement has been reached with the US Government for the
purchase of 1.6 million MT of bauxite. The programme for expansion and
upgrading of existing plants has slowed down and the Government is
discussing the problem with the companies. The project for constructing a
new alumina plant at a cost of some US$700.0 million is being reevaluated
to take account of alternative energy sources and the current and
prospective state of the aluminum market.
Energy
32. Imported oil provides about 99% of Jamaica's commercial energy needs
and in 1980 the value of external suplies represented 48% of export
earnings compared with 17% in 1973. The Government places great emphasis
on the implementation of a national programme aimed at ensuring that energy
is used judiciously and effectively by domestic and commercial consumers,
and that indigenous sources of energy are identified, explored and, where
commercially feasible, developed. A national energy plan is now complete
and embraces all the possible action programmes which may be pursued for
the period to the year 2000 A.D. What follows focuses on the programmes
for the next five years.
33. Energy Development. A major programme for the search and development
of the country's indigenous energy potential is under way. Onshore and
offshore exploration for oil and gas have been implemented with the
assistance of multilateral financial institutions, bilateral aid, and the
participation of the private sector. Feasibility studies on the
utilization of peat (local, and coal), as alternative fuels to oil are
being pursued. All viable application of renewable energy resources have
been evaluated and their potential application in the national energy



-82 -                      ANNEX V
Page 11 of 14
supply mix. Solar energy with major emphasis on water heating, crop drying
and photovoltaics has either started to be widely utilized or is at its
feasibility stage. Biomass utilization with special reference to bagasse,
municipal waste, fast growing trees, forest residue and agricultural and
animal waste have been identified as being able to contribute significantly
to energy supply mix. Hydroelectric potential while significant to
electricity supply is very capital intensive. Funding for these major
programmes has already been identified through bilateral aid programmes.
34. Energy Conservation: In the short to medium term, energy demand
management will be the mainstay of the energy programme. The main elements
include the phased reduction in the utilization of petroleum products
through limits on importation; energy auditing to identify energy wastes
and inefficiencies associated with a programme for energy retrofitting to
replace inefficient equipment; fiscal measures to encourage the development
and utilization of alternative energy sources; and a public education
programme. This programme, now operational (with the exception of the
fiscal incentive schemes which are now in the planning stage) is being
significantly expanded in both the public and the private sector.
35. Energy Pricing: All direct budget subsidies on petroleum products
have been removed and the pricing mechanism transfers the full costs of
imported petroleum products to the consumer. The Government is committed
to a pricing policy which ensures the full recovery of such costs through
the domestic prices of energy products.
Public Sector Programme
36.       Central Government:  The major thrust will be prudent financial
management geared to increasing the level of public savings. The programme
objective is to turn an estimated deficit on current account of 3.5% of GDP
in 1981/82 to a surplus of at least 1% of GDP in 1983/84. The mid-year
financial review (September 1981) indicates that in absolute terms, the
deficit for 1981/82 will be reduced due to constraints on current spending,
including moderation in civil service pay awards, and enhanced revenue
flows from improvements in tax administration and the tax collection
machinery. It is recognized that a major adjustment will be required in
the fiscal period 1982/83 and 1983/84 to maintain growth in the level of
public savings. Consequently, the Government has initiated a programme for
the comprehensive review of the tax system and its administration to
achieve buoyancy in revenue flows, remove disincentives to production and
investment, and be supportive of the productive efforts of the industrial
and agricultural sectors. The programme elements include:
- Reform of tax administration and the establishment of a Revenue Board
to coordinate, supervise and monitor the management of collection
machinery for direct and indirect taxation.
- Land valuation system and procedures.



- 83 -                          ANNEX V
Page 12 of 14
A comprehensive tax burden study is being undertaken with a view to
the revision of existing personal income tax rate structure and of the
system of tax credits; the level of the adjustment being subject to
budget constraints. In addition the monetary limits of the super
annuation schemes, now rendered inappropriate by inflation are also
being studied.
- Corporate tax rates, annual allowances and anti-avoidance measures.
- Replacement of specific duties on commodities by ad valorem rates.
- Simplification of system of internal taxes.
- Tax incentives for agriculture, industry, exports and hotel sectors.
- Tax exemption of interest income with respect to savings in building
societies, credit unions and fixed term deposits of commercial banks.
Several administrative improvements are in place and a study of the
possibilities for shifting specific duty rates to ad valorem rates was
recently completed with Fund assistance; as a result a proposal is before
the Cabinet for decision.
37. Public Enterprises: It is a firm decision that the role of the state
should be limited largely to the traditional utilities of electricity,
water and sewerage, and the communications and transport sectors, except
where national interests and economic development considerations may
otherwise dictate. The private sector would be responsible for productive
and commercial activities and the state would provide the infrastructure
and policy environment to allow the market mechanism to work effectively.
The Government will divest itself of ownership and/or operations of its
commercial enterprises. As described in paragraph 30, the hotel
leasing and sale programme is almost complete. Other enterprises are on
offer to the private sector; two enterprises have been sold and
negotiations are in progress in respect of three other enterprises.
38.       Those enterprises which remain in public ownership and operations
will be required to attain financial viability as quickly as possible.
Central Government Budget support will not be provided for current account
operations and will be limited to capital expansion programmes where
necessary and consistent with national priorities. It is expected that by
1982/83 current account subsidies will not be required by Air Jamaica,
Jamaica Broadcasing Corporation, Jamaica Omnibus Service, National Hotel
and Properties. Other Enterprises such as the Jamaica Railway Corporation,
National Water Authority/Water Commission, the National Sugar Company, and
the Sugar Industry Authority must attain financial viability by 1983/84.
Pricing policies and action must generate surpluses equivalent to a rate of



ANNEX V
-84 -                        Page 13 of 14
return on fixed assets sufficient to pay corporate taxes,
service debt payments, and contribute (with depreciation flows) up to 30%
of the costs of prospective investment expansion programmes. In the
overall, public enterprises as a group should achieve by 1983/84 a rate of
savings of at least 2% of nominal GDP. Recently water rates were increased
by some 45%; and electricity heat rate increased to recover the full costs
of fuel.
39. En passant, public enterprises which remain with the Government after
divestment may fall into two parts: traditional utilities in the fields of
energy, transportation, communications, water/sewerage; and those which
undertake commercial operations. The pricing policy and mechanism for
traditional utilities will be governed by existing legislative provisions
subject, of course, to the guidelines set out in paragraph 38. Public
enterprises of a commercial nature will have the freedom to pursue pricing
policies guided by normal commercial considerations and subject to the
deregulated price control system applicable to the private sector outlined
in paragraph 7 above.
40. Public Investment Programme: In order to facilitate medium-term
financial planning to ensure an adequate pipeline of projects suitable for
external financing, and to promote rational decision-making, the
Government, with the assistance of the World Bank, has instituted a
three-year rolling investment programme, covering the period
1981/82-1983/84.  All projects in the programme pass through a preselection
process, in which they are evaluated according to strict financial and
economic criteria, development priorities and the availability of domestic
and foreign financial resources. The current investment programme, which
amounts to approximately J$2.7 billion during 1981/82-1983/84, is
consistent with the development emphasis on export-oriented,
employment-intensive sectors and on increased import substitution in the
areas of food and energy; the strategy of public sector investment is
stated in Attachment "C." Over 70% of the programme is devoted to
investment in the directly productive sectors and to supporting economic
infrastructure. About 30% of the programme is allocated to essential
investment in the social sectors, with emphasis on expanding the supply of
low income housing and upgrading educational, health and police
facilities. The public sector investment programme is described in more
detail in Annex
41. In FY81/82 the public sector investment programme represented about
15% of nominal GDP. The Government intends to maintain the 1982/83 and
.1983/84 programme at or below that percentage. The level of public sector
investment will be reviewed during the forthcoming negotiations with the
IMF for the FY82/83 EFF programme.

Balance of Payments Policies
42. In the negotiations with the IMF resulting in the Fund programme of
April 13, 1981, the Government maintained that its evaluation of the trade
weighted nominal exchange rate of the Jamaica dollar, indicated that export
competitiveness had not deteriorated and consequently the official exchange
rate should be maintained. Since that time the rate of inflation declined
substantially and wage awards have been relatively reasonable--being 10%
for the civil service and averaging around 15% for the private sector. The
pressures on domestic production costs do not appear to have appreciably
altered competitiveness with principal trading partners. We will however
watch very carefully the trends relating to Jamaica's competitive position
to determine the need, if any, for corrective measures to be taken.

ECONOMIC POLICY MEMORANDUM OF THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA
I. Objectives and Strategies for Economic Recovery
1. This Government has inherited an economy which, measured by almost
any indicator, is in a severely depressed state. Gross domestic product
has declined in real terms every year since 1973, and its absolute decline
was 18 per cent over this eight-year period. At the same time inflation-
ary pressures have been strong, reaching a peak in 1978, when domestic
prices increased by almost 50 per cent, but prices still rose in 1980 by
about 30 per cent. Unemployment reached 30 per cent of the labor force
by March 1980, the last month for which data are available, but there
are strong indications that it has risen even higher since then.
2. Investment activity declined substantially in both the public and pri-
vate sectors.  Gross fixed capital formation fell by 1979 to 13 per cent
of GDP, compared with 25 per cent in 1973.  Currently, utilization of
manufacturing capacity is below 40 per cent; hotel occupancy is at 45 per
cent of capacity; utilities and other government services have markedly
deteriorated. A dominant cause of the deterioration in the economy has
been the persistent and severe shortage of foreign exchange, which made
it impossible to provide adequate levels of imports of raw materials,
spare parts, and equipment to sustain economic activity.
3. The priority objectives will be to promote economic activity and re-
duce the level of unemployment; also, to return existing utility services
and social and economic infrastructure to levels of efficiency which will
support economic growth. The strategy falls into two parts: firstly, to
put unutilized capacity to work with the emphasis on those sectors that
will produce quick and substantial incremental foreign exchange earnings;
secondly, to initiate adjustments in industrial and agricultural policies
and so provide a basis for expansion of productive capacity with concomi-
tant increases in employment opportunities.
4. It will take at least three years to get the economy back on a path
to self-sustaining growth.  With the plant and equipment now in place,
real growth of 3 per cent can be achieved in FY 1981/82. For FY 1982/83
and FY 1983/84, the growth targets of 4 per cent and 5 per cent, respec-
tively, will require  adequate  incremental  capital  formation.   Conse-
quently, the Government will adopt measures to promote private domestic
and foreign investment in a major production effort.  Steps will be taken
to deregulate the economy so as to release private initiative, rebuild
confidence, and support the operation of an efficient market economy.
The activities of the public sector in industrial and commercial opera-
tions will be reduced; and the financial operations of the Central
Government will ensure that an appropriate share of national resources
is retained by the productive sectors.

5. The Government realizes that, to secure the initial push and momentum,
a substantial external borrowing program is inevitable in the first year.
This would include mainly special balance of payments assistance from
multilateral agencies and from countries friendly to Jamaica and their
agencies. It is recognized that it is not in Jamaica's interest to main-
tain external borrowing for balance of payments support at such levels
because the country's problems cannot be dealt with by such assistance
alone, but must  be solved by incremental earnings from trade in goods
and services and spontaneous capital inflows. This solution will be pur-
sued in the short term by fully utilizing the existing productive capa-
city of export earners with traditional markets; and subsequently by ex-
panding the export sector with the help of the development of new export
lines, and a strong external promotion and marketing effort.
II. Economic Management
Production Policy
6. The dominant task is the implementation of an export-oriented pro-
duction program to generate early incremental flows of foreign exchange.
Tourism can make a major contribution since this sector has substantial
underutilized capacity. In the first year of the program, hotel occupancy
is projected at 48 per cent of capacity generating mre than US$200 mil-
lion. The industry has an optimum capacity which can earn up to US$450
million at today's prices; and the objective will be to attain 70 per
cent occupancy by the third year, which should yield US$375 million, an
increment of some US$175 million. Measures to stimulate additional occu-
pancy include effectively employing national promotional programs, the
reintroduction of tour programs in association with North American and
European tour operators; the provision of additional air seats with the
participation of Air Jamaica and North American airlines; and the upgrad-
ing of domestic attractions.   State-owned hotels will be offered for
leasing or purchase by reputable hotel management groups in keeping with
the Government's divestment policy (see paragraph 30 below).
7. Agreements reached with the bauxite/alumina companies in 1980 have
restored the competitiveness of that industry.  Further, the Government
and the companies are pursuing, in cooperation with the appropriate U.S.
agency, the acceptance of levy payments to Jamaica as a tax credit against
U.S. income tax within double taxation arrangements. The companies are
undertaking upgrading programs for attaining rated capacity which will in-
crease production of bauxite/alumina by 10 per cent and exchange earnings
at current prices by US$45 million in FY 1983/84. One company is doubling
plant capacity on a joint venture basis with the Government of Jamaica
and private Norwegian interests. Investment in plant upgrading and expan-
sion will result in cash inflows of almost US$120 million over the second
and third years of the program.

8. The Government has initiated discussions with the companies to in-
crease exports of bauxite from existing mining operations by up to 6 mil-
lion tons per annum during the program period, and also to embark on a
program for further expansion of alumina capacity. A major alumina plant
project with a capacity of 600,000 metric tons a year is ready for imple-
mentation and could come on stream around FY 1986/87, in which case for-
eign exchange inflows to finance local investment expenditures would come
within the program period.  This is an intergovernmental venture, and
sources of its funding have been identified and some of the funds have
already been received.  However, the  Government is now reviewing  the
project to determine whether it should proceed as presently conceived.
9. The sugar industry has a potential market within the EEC regime and
an ISA quota of up to 255,000 tons, but current exports are only 160,000
tons. In the recent past cane cultivation was ravaged by smut and rust
disease, and in 1980 a program for replanting existing acreage with dis-
ease resistant cane varieties was implemented. The objective is to lift
the production of sugar from 260,000 tons to 330,000 tons and exports to
230,000 tons by FY 1983/84. Incremental receipts would be some US$30 mil-
lion.
10. The already depressed banana industry was devastated by Hurricane
Allen in 1980.  Programs for its  rehabilitation  supported  by external
financial sources, including the Inter-American Development Bank, the
European Development Fund, and bilateral agencies, are in place.  There
is a guaranteed market of 150,000 tons in the United Kingdom, but in 1980
exports attained only 33,000 tons, and the objective is to reach 120,000
tons by FY 1983/84.  The rehabilitation program includes the expansion
of cultivation under EEC and other bilateral assistance programs, the im-
provement of yield per acre, and the participation of the private sector
including foreign investment.  It is estimated that the FY 1983/84 earn-
ings will increase by US$15 million.
11. Exports of manufactured goods are already supported by World Bank
resources channeled through an Export Development Fund (EDF).  The EDF
will be replenished by the World Bank in an amount of about US$30 million
and its operations expanded to include the financing of capital goods
imports. The target is to double export earnings within three years.
12. During the program period a basis will be provided for production
expansions to generate incremental employment opportunities and also
satisfy requirements for foreign exchange after the program period. The
first step is an examination and evaluation of Jamaica's industrial and
agricultural policies to identify desirable modifications and structural
adjustments which may be necessary to support efficient production and
provide incentives for investment.  A World Bank team is assisting the
Government to determine the specific issues and also to provide technical
assistance for in-depth sectoral evaluation.

13. Private foreign investment flows, particularly on a joint venture
basis, will be an important factor for maintaining momentum. Already,
steps have been taken to bring together groups of North American entrepre-
neurs for the purpose of examining the opportunities for foreign invest-
ment. The World Bank is evaluating a project for providing infrastructure
within the Jamaica Free Zone area, and some 15 companies have expressed
interest in establishing new enterprises in lines such as textiles, elec-
tronics, chemicals, warehousing, and food processing.  Outside the Free
Zone area, 72 investment proposals are being processed, including 23 in
agriculture and agrobusiness, 36 in manufacturing, 4 in mining, and 7 in
tourism. To ensure speedy decision making, the Government recently ap-
proved procedures for channeling investment inquiries to the appropriate
agencies and coordinating their efforts.
14. The conservation of energy is of paramount importance both in the
short and medium term. Measures instituted in 1980 led to a 10 per cent
reduction in the volume of petroleum imports for domestic consumption.
In 1981, the import volume of all petroleum products is likely to increase
by about 5 per cent as domestic activity expands but the consumption of
gasoline will be held at last year's level.  All subsidies on petroleum
products were eliminated some time ago.  In January 1980, the adjustment
of petroleum prices exceeded those needed to match increases in costs in
order to anticipate future price increases. Consequently, it was possible
to hold prices stable throughout 1980.  It will be possible to maintain
existing prices for a time, and thereafter price adjustments will take
place to reflect cost increases. Efficiency in energy usage will be pro-
moted by programs which include the replacement of inefficient machinery,
building modifications, and the substitution of ceiling fans for air-
conditioning. External financial aid will provide resources of up to
US$12 million to support energy audits as well as the evaluation of alter-
native sources of energy--particularly the substitution of solar energy
and coal for oil. A program for onshore oil exploration is being imple-
mented with an IDB loan of about US$20 million. A joint venture between
the Government of Jamaica and Union Texas will undertake offshore oil
explorations; the World Bank is evaluating a request for a loan of about
US$7 million to fund the Governmentts share of these exploration costs.
Deregulation
15. The Government recognizes that the private sector is the main engine
*            of economic growth and increased production, and that an environment must
exist within which private initiative and entrepreneurship will prosper.
Consequently, steps will be taken to remove progressively all controls
that inhibit such an environment.
16.  Prices policy:  Ideally, the determination of prices should be left
to the working of market forces, but in present circumstances, some price
controls will need to be retained, particularly for essential commodities
which make up the staple diet of the low-income groups. Prices will also



- 90 -
Page 5 of 11
continue to be monitored where monopolistic and oligopolistic relation-
ships exist. The Government will decontrol 18 of 60 commodities now cov-
ered by price controls and permit the prices of 12 other items now under
specific price controls to be adjusted on notification to the Prices
Commission and barring its formal objection.  Where controls are still
retained, prices will be set at levels permitting an efficient enterprise
to generate reasonable rates of return on its investment.
17.  Rent controls:  Rent control policy will be directed to monitoring
rentals by low-income groups.  Policy guidelines will ensure that rents
accommodate the cost of repairs and maintenance at current prices, pro-
vide a return to the house-owner to cover his debt service, and yield
him rates of return sufficient to encourage the expansion of the stock
of low-income housing. The Government recognizes that the public sector
cannot alone satisfy the housing needs of the low-income groups and that
the private sector must be encouraged to invest in this area.
18.  Import licensing policy:  The Government is committed to a progres-
sive liberalization of import restrictions and in time, as experience
dictates, to an elimination of all licensing requirements. The existing
system cannot be dismantled at once, but steps have been taken to simplify
the administrative procedures, eliminate bottlenecks, and speed up the
issuance of licenses  to importers.   In  addition,  import  transactions
undertaken through the informal foreign exchange market will be exempt
from import licensing requirements (see paragraph 41 below).
19.  State Marketing:   The operations of the State Trading Corporation
will be restricted to purchases under commodity assistance programs of
foreign governments and to bulk purchases of commodities through interna-
tional tenders yielding price benefits to consumers.  Other food items
and building materials will be left to private distributors, provided
that imports are contracted through a tender process monitored by the
Corporation. Transactions estimated at US$140 million are to be trans-
ferred from the Corporation.  Agricultural Commodity Boards will be re-
organized to maximize returns to growers, and permit the latter, if they
so wish, to market products independently of the Boards, subject to con-
trol of quality and packaging standards.
Pay Policy
20. The Government believes that employers and employees should settle
pay claims by free negotiation. The imposition of ceilings on pay awards
is not acceptable to employers, unions, and staff associations; does not
improve the chances of industrial peace; serves to provide a floor for
pay negotiations; and encourages practices which shift the emphasis of
pay agreements from wages to fringe benefits excluded from the ceiling.
Instead, parties to industrial disputes should be encouraged to settle
claims based on the ability of an enterprise to pay, having due regard to
the implications for product costs and prices, the generation of company
earnings for investments in production expansion, and the creation of
employment opportunities.



- 91 -
Page 6 of 11
21. Where the parties to an industrial dispute are unable to arrive at
mutually acceptable terms, it is the responsibility of the Government to
provide appropriate conciliation and arbitration mechanisms, but not to
interfere with agreed awards.  To ensure that the Government's role can
be pursued effectively, the conciliation machinery of the Ministry of
Labor will be strengthened both as to numbers and quality of staff to
carry out the role of bringing parties together and providing relevant
documentation. Industrial tribunals will be assigned technical personnel
with the competence to undertake necessary and relevant financial analy-
ses; and rules for guiding the operations of such tribunals in assessing
and evaluating pay disputes have been developed for approval and imple-
mentation.
22. Public sector pay policy will be as follows: Firstly, public enter-
prises not supported by current account transfers from the budget would
negotiate pay adjustments based on the ability to pay criterion and the
procedures mentioned earlier.  Secondly, pay awards to employees of the
Central Government and public enterprises supported by current account
transfers from the budget would be based on a three-year pay plan subject
to the availability of budgetary resources.
23. The Government will encourage the establishment of profit-sharing
and productivity-linked incentive schemes, and will seek external tech-
nical assistance to help private and public enterprises develop and
implement such schemes.
Fiscal Policy
24. A program of adjustment and economic restructuring commenced in
FY 1978/79 and was heavily front loaded with exchange rate adjustments
(devaluation), fiscal measures, and wage/income compression.  On fiscal
account, overall expenditure moved steadily downwards from 40 per cent
of GDP in FY 1978/79 to 35 per cent of GDP in 1980/81; current expendi-
ture fell from 29 per cent of GDP to 26 per cent. However, the current
account deficit worsened from 2 per cent of GDP in FY 1978/79 to 5 per
cent in 1980/81 and consequently the overall deficit showed only a mar-
ginal improvement of 1 per cent of GDP over the period.  The lack of
improvement in the current account deficit was the result of a steady
decline in the revenue GDP ratio over the period. The underlying causes
were the continuing deterioration in the economy which fell in real terms
by an arithmetic average of 2 per cent per annum, the lack of buoyancy in
the tax structure arising from the large weight of specific duties in tax
yields, and the breakdown in tax compliance and the tax collection mecha-
nism. Consequently, there was heavy reliance on external sources to
finance the overall deficit and credit from the domestic banking system
also became a significant source of finance rising from 4 per cent of GDP
in 1978/79 to 6 per cent in 1980/81.
25. The Government is committed to prudent financial management, which
will be geared to achieving surpluses on current account for financing
capital expenditure. While external financial support will be significant



- 92 -
Page 7 of 11
in the first year, reliance on external financing must be reduced in the
medium term; and support from the domestic banking system must be re-
strained in order to release a significant portion of domestic financial
resources for the productive sector.
26. The objective over the program period is the continued reduction
of central government overall expenditures to a level of not more than
30 per cent of GDP; a turnaround of current account performance from a
deficit of 5 per cent of GDP to a surplus of at least 1 per cent by
FY 1983/84; and a narrowing of the overall deficit from 14 per cent of
GDP to around 10 per cent. Expenditure policies will be adapted to con-
strain the growth of consumption and shift the emphasis of expenditure
toward capital formation. The current account resources will be improved
by modifications to the tax system to restore buoyancy to revenues and
improve compliance and tax collection.   Also through a program for in-
creasing the yield of the Capital Development Levy from incremental sales
of bauxite.
27. The Government recognizes that an important element in the improve-
ment of fiscal performance will be the tax effort. The logical approach
in the present circumstances must be a comprehensive review of the tax
system, its administration and collection machinery to achieve buoyancy
in revenue flows, remove disincentives to production and investment, and
be supportive of the productive effort of the industrial and agricultural
sectors. The basis for such an action program would be the Fund Reports
of 1979 and 1980; and the current assessment and evaluation by the World
Bank of incentive policies and the requirements for structural adjustment
to facilitate economic growth and export-led economic recovery. The mea-
sures under review include the early reorganization of tax administration
and the compliance/collection mechanisms, the replacement of specific
duties on commodities by ad valorem rates, the replacement of frontier
taxes by an internal taxation system. Additionally, receipts from Bauxite
Levy, a major revenue component, will be augmented by the current program
for raising bauxite production by up to six million tons. The impact will
be felt largely in FY 1982/83 and FY 1983/84, but some benefit might be
obtained in FY 1981/82.
28. Total current account receipts from tax revenues and Bauxite Levy
are expected to continue to fall to some 20 per cent of GDP in FY 1981/82.
The objective will be to stem this trend and gradually reverse direc-
tion during the program period in order to attain 22 per cent of GDP by
FY 1983/84.  The Government will implement, not later than October 1,
1981, aspects of the comprehensive tax reform program to attain an in-
crease of not less than 1/2 per cent of GDP on estimated tax revenues for
FY 1981/82.  With the prospective increases in resources through fiscal
measures and incremental Bauxite Levy collections, the current account
deficit estimated at 3-1/2 per cent of GDP for FY 1981/82 should improve
to a surplus of not less than 1 per cent of GDP by FY 1983/84. The incre-
mental receipts by FY 1983/84 are estimated at some J$475 million (the
equivalent of US$266 million) and would assist in offsetting the expected
decline over the period in emergency concessionary budgetary support from
donor countries and multilateral agencies.



- 93 -
Page 8 of 11
29. Special attention will be paid to public debt management. The exist-
ing stock of external commercial debt will be refinanced in order to
lighten the debt service burden; and external borrowing, other than on
concessionary terms, will be limited to a reasonable proportion of the
financing program and related, by and large, to the external costs of the
public investment program.
30. It is the Government's policy to reduce the role of the State in
commercial activities and limit its ownership and operation of enter-
prises, mainly to the utilities and transport sectors.  The Government
may, however, also retain a measure of participation where the national
interest or economic development considerations so dictate.  Management
audits of some 14 government-owned manufacturing companies have been
completed and audits of others are ongoing. Criteria to guide divestment
decisions have been developed and a divestment committee has been estab-
lished to arrange for the sale or lease of selected enterprises.
31.  The operation of certain utilities has deteriorated markedly.  Some
face insolvency; others have serious maintenance problems which impair
efficiency and service to consumers; a few lack finance for ongoing invest-
ments. For example, the government-owned urban transportation system is
insolvent and alternative modes for providing urban transportation are
being studied. Unprofitable routes of the national airline (Air Jamaica)
have been closed down, its maintenance and ground handling operations
are being overhauled,  and possible  overstaffing   is being determined.
Adjustments of water and electricity rates are under review.  A program
for achieving viability of the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation has been
implemented and  staff  retrenched.   More  generally,  the  Government is
determined to make public enterprises operate efficiently and will essen-
tially restrict its budget support to capital expansion programs which
are consistent with national priorities and available financial resources.
32. A three-year Public Investment Program is now under review. A World
Bank mission is currently assisting the Government in completing the
Program and developing financing strategies.  For FY 1981/82 the Central
Government's capital budget includes ongoing programs and also certain
new projects at an estimated cost of about J$70 million.  Investment plans
and projects for the second and third years of the program will be evalu-
ated on strict financial and economic criteria, and the selection based
on national objectives and priorities, taking into account the availabil-
ity of domestic and external financial resources. The Government will
be in close contact with the World Bank, in its capacity of coordinator
of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development, concern-
ing the progress in the formulation and implementation of the Public
Investment Program and any subsequent change in its composition.
33. The level of government expenditure in FY 1981/82 will be held to
33 per cent of GDP. On reasonable expectations about the revenue perfor-
mance, such an expenditure level would yield a current account deficit of
3-1/2 per cent of GDP.  The overall cash deficit of the Central Govern-
ment (excluding debt amortization) in FY 1981/82 will, therefore, be held



- 94 -
Page 9 of 11
to J$945 million, which would represent about 13-1/2 per cent of GDP.
Compensation to employees represented 76 per cent of tax revenue in
FY 1980/81, and 61 per cent of current expenditure excluding interest.
Any policy for constraining consumption expenditure must come to grips
with this reality.   Firstly, the Government will develop a three-year
pay plan aimed at moderation in civil service pay awards subject to the
need to attract and retain skilled personnel.  For FY 1981/82 budget re-
sources for the pay plan will be limited to about J$65 million. Secondly,
although a cutback of staff would be unacceptable with the existing level
of unemployment, the number of employees at March 31, 1981, will not be
increased; subject to the maintenance of operational efficiency, existing
vacancies and those arising from future resignations and retirements will
not be filled; and the Ministry of the Public Service will undertake
audits of each Ministry and Department to help determine optimum staff
levels beyond FY 1981/82. The Special Employment Program will be rede-
signed to cover projects directed to the preservation of national assets
and to provide skill training.
34. Subsidization of the basic basket of commodities consumed by low in-
come groups will be retained at its FY 1980/81 nominal level, considering
that this subsidy has been substantially reduced since its introduction
in FY 1978/79. Any price increases over and above the subsidized level
will be passed on to the consumer.
35. The system for monitoring and controlling expenditure has been modi-
fied. Control procedures have been strengthened through instructions
which include the application of sanctions where bills are overdue for
two or more months. In each year, expenditure reviews will be undertaken
in July, October, and January by a Review Committee headed by the Minister
of State in the Ministry  of  Finance.   Financial management by Local
Authorities is now subject to detailed instructions, strict adherence to
legislative provisions relating to budgetary rules, model accounting sys-
tems and procedures, and observance of bank overdraft limits. Addition-
ally, a monitoring and expenditure review system is operated by the
Ministry of Local Government.
36. Financial assistance from donor countries and multilateral institu-
tions will be critical elements in the economic program for FY 1981/82.
A unit will be established in the Ministry of Finance, with World Bank
technical assistance, to improve the documentation for loan disbursements
prescribed by these countries and institutions.
Monetary Policy
37. During the program period, monetary policy will be directed toward
mobilizing savings and ensuring that sufficient bank credit is made avail-
able to priority sectors. It is expected that with increasing economic
activity the demand for bank credit will exert upward pressure on-inter-
est rates.



- 95 -
Page 10 of 11
38. The Treasury Bill discount rate will be the prime instrument for
influencing changes in the interest rate structure. Domestic bank credit
requirements of the Government will be met substantially from the issue
of such bills, and their yield will be determined by market forces. The
Government will offer Treasury Bills in amounts of not less than J$115
million each month, and averaging not less than J$140 million per month
over FY 1981/82.  To accommodate this volume of tenders, the legislative
ceiling on the outstanding issue of these bills will be appropriately
raised in the very near future.  The bank rate will be set at a level
not lower than the Treasury Bill rate. In order that building societies
can maintain their competitiveness in attracting deposits with the mini-
mum impact on their mortgage rates, the current tax concessions to their
depositors will be enhanced.
39. The mandatory liquid assets ratio applicable to commercial banks is
currently 29.5 per cent of their eligible obligations, but it was raised
in early 1979 to 40 per cent by voluntary agreement with the banks. This
latter ratio will be maintained but kept under continuous review to ensure
consistency with the requirements of the monetary program. Credit policy
will be used, along with fiscal policy, to keep domestic expenditure at a
level consistent with the programed balance of payments and price perfor-
mance. To support these objectives, ceilings have been set on the net
domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica and on net credit to the public
sector by the domestic banking system. Agreed ceilings on consumer cred-
its will be maintained to ensure that sufficient resources are channelled
into priority productive areas.
Balance of Payments Management
40. The major obstacle to economic recovery is the acute shortage of
foreign exchange, which cannot be corrected in the short run if Jamaica
were limited to its own exchange earnings.  In the early years of the
program, therefore, supplementary support from external sources on a large
scale will be needed.   The  Government has approached donor countries
friendly to Jamaica and multilateral financial institutions for special
balance of payments assistance of a concessionary nature. Foreign commer-
cial banks are considering a deferral/refinancing of the bulk of govern-
ment and government guaranteed debt to them maturing in FY 1981/82 and
FY 1982/83, as well as the provision of incremental credits.  The deferral
of maturities falling due in FY 1983/84 will be considered in the light of
progress made under the program.
41.  Some of Jamaica's imports have been financed in the recent past
through an informal  foreign exchange market.  About US$80 million was
financed in this manner in 1980 under a special import licensing regime.
While the informal market cannot by itself correct the shortage of for-
eign exchange, it can be a limited source for alleviating this shortage.
The Government, therefore, is about to implement the following procedures:
(i) It will designate items for importation which will be
exempt from licensing on the understanding that the
foreign exchange is the responsibility of the importer.



- 96 -
Page 11-of 11
(ii)  The existing Prohibited List will remain in place, but
items may be released from this list from time to time,
on the understanding that the foreign exchange is the
responsibility of the importer.
(iii)  Service payments may be made through the informal market
at the option of the payee.
(iv)  The Exchange Control Law will be suitably amended to
support the foregoing system.
42. An enduring solution to the foreign exchange shortage must rest on
a restoration of confidence in the economy and a quantum increase in
earnings from exports and tourism. The emphasis of the program must be,
therefore, on a gradual shift from emergency balance of payments support
to more sustainable current and capital inflows. The action program for
export oriented production will provide rising foreign exchange earnings
over the program period, and thus reduce the reliance on emergency balance
of payments assistance. It is estimated that by FY 1983/84 incremental
earnings from traditional sources (at FY 1981/82 prices) would amount to
about US$300 million, comprised of US$170 million from tourism, US$100
million from bauxite/alumina, and the remainder from bananas and sugar.
With the elimination of payments arrears, renewed confidence and econo-
mic buoyancy, trade credits should be restored to normal levels of about
three months of imports and assist in supporting the level of imports
required for economic growth.  Direct foreign investment, likely to re-
main at minimal levels in FY 1981/82, is expected to reach US$130 million
by FY 1983/84, given the current arrangements for encouraging such flows
and the interest already shown by foreign investors.
43. The financial support from the International Monetary Fund would be
directed primarily to restoring solvency to the Bank of Jamaica. Liquid
reserves of the Bank of Jamaica can be expected to attain a level equiva-
lent to three months of imports by the end of FY 1983/84, and arrears on
payments and transfers for current international transactions will be
eliminated within the program period. The scope of the related deposit
scheme introduced in early 1980 will be changed to allow a more precise
identification of arrears and hence a rational mechanism for their reduc-
tion.
44. The official exchange rate will be maintained at its present level
since Jamaica's exports are still competitive, but any erosion of this
competitiveness through excessive domestic price increases and a departure
from wage moderation would call for a review of exchange rate policy and
action.

PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT STRATEGY
The public sector investment program, which amount to approxi-
mately J$2.8 billion, is consistent with the development emphasis on ex-
panding export-oriented, employment-intensive sectors, rehabilitation and
expansion of public utilities, upgrading of social and economic infrastruc-
ture, and the deregulation of the economy to allow greater reliance on the
private sector and a reduction of bureaucratic controls. Since the availa-
bility of foreign exchange is the critical determinant of the level of
economic activity in the medium term, the investment strategy emphasizes
activities which improve the foreign exchange position or which mobilize
external financing. Over 70% of the program is devoted to investment in
the directly productive sectors and to supporting economic infrastructure.
The remainder is allocated to essential investment in the social sectors,
with emphasis on expanding the supply of low income housing, and upgrading,
educational, health and police facilities.
Sectoral Priorities
High priority is accorded the tourism sector, which has the
capacity in place to contribute quickly to the expansion of foreign ex-
change earnings and employment. In keeping with the Government's intention



- 98 -
Page 2 of 6
of encouraging increased private sector participation in the economy,
direct investment in the sector is left largely to private investors. The
programme provides for investments in the area of air and ground transpor-
tation as well as supporting a promotional campaign.
In the mining sector, bauxite and alumina are the most important
potential earners of incremental foreign exchange for the 1980s. It is
felt that development of the sector would proceed most efficiently if left
to the private sector. Over the medium-term, however, government minority
participation may be required to ensure adequate financing for the expan-
sion of alumina capacity, if such a project should prove to be technically
and financially viable. Accordingly, J$30 million has been included for
this purpose in 1983/4.
The development and expansion of agriculture is of particular
importance both to the foreign exchange earning and saving effort and to
employment generation. The markets exist to enable a large expansion in
the volume of traditional exports and the development of non-traditional
agricultural exports. There is considerable scope for the development of
linkages between agriculture and the tourism and manufacturing sectors.
The programme pays special attention to the development of export and food
crops, including bananas, coffee, cocoa, citrus, and coconuts. The upgrad-
ing of supporting services, including irrigation and drainage, disease con-
trol, and research, is emphasized. Expansion of the forestry and fishing
sectors is also planned.
In view of its potential contribution to development of non-
traditional exports and to employment creation, the manufacturing sector is

- 99 -                          Page 3 of 6
given high priority in the Government's development strategy. At present,
the sector has idle capacity, which, with increased availability of foreign
exchange, can be utilized to increase the production of goods both for
export and the domestic market in the short run. The investment programme
focuses on the provision of adequate support for private investment, in the
form of a program for the construction of factory shells and through provi-
sion of industrial credit. With the exception of the rehabilitation of the
cement company, direct investment in manufacturing is left largely to the
private sector.
While significant attention has been placed on fostering develop-
ment within the productive sectors, due consideration has also been given
to upgrading and expansion of the economic and social infrasture.
In transportation, emphasis is given to the improvement of the
rural road system, the completion of main roads under construction, the
improvement of international airports and the development of the port
facilities. Provision is also made for a number of water supply and sewer-
age projects throughout the island.
Special emphasis is being placed on the development and conserva-
tion of energy to relieve the strain which imported oil has placed on for-
eign exchange availability. Steps are being taken to increase the capacity
and improve the efficiency of the Public Service Company. Indigenous
sources of energy are being explored to determine their commercial feasi-
bility. These include onshore and offshore exploration for oil, the
possible utilization of peat, the use of solar energy and development of
the hydroelectric potential.

In the social sectors, the investment program focuses primarily
on housing for low-income groups. Emphasis is given to sites and services
development and upgrading of squatter settlements. The Government plans
to keep investment in housing at approximately the same annual level during
the three years of the investment programme. The programme also provides
for upgrading of education, health and police facilities.
Project Selection
The over-riding considerations in the selection of projects for
the Public Investment Programme are ensuring that priority is given to
projects which are designed to fulfil the Government's stated objectives
and that such projects satisfy criteria for economic viability. Priority
rating may also be given to projects on the basis of subjective assessment
of their social desirability. Top priority is given to projects which make
significant contributions to:
enhancing production;
earning (or saving) foreign exchange;
employment generation;
energy production or conservation;
attracting external financing.
At the same time, due consideration is given to public sector
programmes for economic infrastructure which are required to facilitate the
productive processes. Insofar as social infrastructure is concerned, em-
phasis is placed on securing more efficient use of resources in upgrading
existing facilities, rather than creating new ones.

Project selection is made against the background of the avail-
ability of resources for development financing and the priority accorded to
the various sectors. A major consideration is to exclude from the Public
*          Investment Programme any project proposal which is considered suitable as
an undertaking for private enterprise. For those projects included, not
only is consideration given to the fixed capital expenditure, but to the
implications for recurrent expenditures on the Government's budget on com-
pletion of the project.
The Ministry of Finance and Planning, the Project Analysis and
Monitoring Company (PAMCO) and the National Planning Agency work closely in
coordinating the development and articulation of the Public Investment Pro-
gramme. To enter the public sector project cycle, all discrete projects
costing $0.5 million or more must be submitted to PAMCO for preliminary
evaluation before submission to the Projects Pre-selection Committee (now
chaired by the Prime Minister) for a decision as to whether or not a pro-
posed project should go forward for further development. PAMCO serves as
the secretariat for this Committee, on which are represented senior
officers of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, the Ministry of the
Public Service, the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Mining and
Energy, Jamaica National Investment Company, National Planning Agency,
National Development Agency, Town Planning Department and PAMCO itself.
Projects selected by the Committee are subject to a feasibility study.
Such projects, after satisfactory appraisal of the feasibility report,
acceptance by the Cabinet and completion of arrangements for financing, are
then placed in the Public Investment Programme, which is a three-year
roling programme. Projects do not normally enter the programme unless they
show an economic rate of return in excess of 10%.



- 102-                            Page 6 of 6
Public sector programmes and projects costing less than $0.5
million normally enter the Public Investment Peogramme through the annual
budget exercise for capital expenditures. In this case, the capital
expenditure proposals of the various ministries are evaluated by teams
comprised of officials from the Ministry of Finance and Planning, PAMCO and
the National Planning Agency. These evaluations may not be subject to
rigorous financial and economic analysis, but selections are guided by the
several considerations listed above. The guiding principle in their
selection, and especially of social programmes, is to ensure that the
greatest benefit is provided for the largest number at minimum cost.
In the current three-year programme, 1981/2 to 1983/4, special
emphasis has been placed on the selection of projects related to
agriculture and tourism, as productive sectors, while, for the sectors
concerned with economic infrastructure, firm support was given to the
sectors dealing with the development of energy, transportation,
communication and water.
