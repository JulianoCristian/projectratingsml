The project consists of three basic\n            elements. The first is the Population Activities Fund (PAF),\n            which will provide grants to qualified collaborating\n            agencies (CAs) for subprojects they have prepared. Many of\n            the subprojects will focus on increasing family planning\n            (FP) practice through provision of services and intensive\n            information/education/communication (IEC). Other subprojects\n            will develop leadership commitment to NPP or help prepare\n            CAs to provide support functions for NPP in planning,\n            coordination, training, monitoring, evaluation, or research.\n            Second, the project will help develop a small PAF Agency\n            (PAFA) that will manage PAF in cooperation with the\n            Department of Population Activities (DPA). Jointly PAFA and\n            DPA will develop the capacity to assist CAs with preparation\n            of additional subprojects and to appraise and supervise\n            them. The third element of the project is designed to\n            stimulate intensive analysis of socio-cultural constraints\n            to fertility reduction, review relevant experiences from\n            other countries, and design innovative interventions for\n            adoption by implementing CAs."}, "docdt": "1991-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
