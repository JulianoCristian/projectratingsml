The\n            Bank's overall performance is rated deficient in\n            preparation, appraisal, and supervision while the borrowers\n            performance was considered deficient in both implementation\n            and covenant compliance. Major factors affection the project\n            implementation were political instability, unclear\n            institutional management responsibilities, lack of technical\n            capacity, complexity of project design, and suspensions to\n            the special accounts due to differing interpretations,\n            suspected corruption, and borrower noncompliance. Lessons\n            were learned in the following areas: a) hanging trends in\n            population management, policy, and practices; b) public\n            support and political commitment to population issues; c)\n            greater community involvement in family planning programs;\n            d) project design; e) inclusion of a contraceptive /\n            commodities component in any future population project; f)\n            Bank's supervisory role; and g) evolving donor\n            partnership and collaboration."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
