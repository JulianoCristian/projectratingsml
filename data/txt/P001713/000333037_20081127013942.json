The project's original objective was to\n            produce anhydrous alcohol (99 percent) in Mali for use in a\n            gasoline-alcohol blend that will help reduce the\n            country's dependence on imported gasoline. The project\n            was to upgrade and expand existing distilleries at sugar\n            mills then producing only industrial alcohol (95 percent)\n            from molasses. The project anhydrous alcohol production will\n            represent about 3 percent of Mali's gasoline\n            consumption. When the project was amended in 1987, its\n            objectives were broadened considerably, to incorporate steps\n            to improve the sugar enterprise. These included improving\n            the composition of fuel consumption at the two sugar mills\n            by reducing the use of imported gas oil and increasing the\n            use of bagasse, rehabilitating and improving the sugarcane\n            fields to increase yield and production, concentrating the\n            production of anhydrous alcohol at the newer of the two\n            mills at Siribala, and improving management systems to make\n            the enterprise better suited for future policy reforms and investments."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
