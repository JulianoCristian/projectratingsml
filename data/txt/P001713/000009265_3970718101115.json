   Project are : (a) to reduce Mali's dependence on\n            petroleum imports through production of anhydrous alcohol\n            (about two million liters annually) from surplus molasses to\n            blend with gasoline and through improved energy efficiency\n            in its two sugar complexes by better use of bagasse; and (b)\n            to help develop a coherent program of policy reforms and\n            investments to rehabilitate the Office du Niger.  The\n            project would include the following components: (a) biomass\n            alcohol production, storage, and handling; (b) energy\n            efficiency improvements; (c) gasohol blending and\n            distribution; (d)  technical assistance and training; (e)\n            biomass energy study; and (f) technical assistance for an\n            Office du Niger Rehabilitation Task Force (RTF) and urgently\n            required farm inputs."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
