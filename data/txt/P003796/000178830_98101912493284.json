The project\n            would assist in expanding the national family planning\n            program, supporting current program activities, and\n            strengthening basic health care services. In particular, the\n            project would include: construction of population centers,\n            warehouses for storage of contraceptives, and health center\n            in-patient annexes; provision of vehicles, audio-visual\n            materials, and instructional materials for population\n            education activities. In addition, the project makes\n            provision for technical assistance; fellowships; special\n            equipment; operating costs for training; and support for\n            study tours and training sessions."}, "docdt": "1980-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
