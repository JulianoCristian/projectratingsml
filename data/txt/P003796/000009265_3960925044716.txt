THIRD POPULATION PROJECT LOAN 1869-IND
PNOJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This project completion report-for Population Project III in
Indonesia (Loan 2529-IND) was prepared by Nydia Maraviglia, Principal
Population Specialist, ASTPH and Ms. Shirley Ross-Larson, Consultant, using as
a basis a project completion report dated October 1987 prepared by the
Government of Indonesia's National Family Planning Board (BOWKN) and findings
through interviews carried out by Bank staff during a supervision mission for
the Fourth Population Project in February-March 1988.
Its format responds to revised guidelines for project completion
reports of investment projects developed by a task force chaired by Mr. Antony
Cole, AS5AG, tested through this and a few other PCRs prepared during the
period March-July 1988. It consists of three parts, Part I contains the
Bank's analysis of the data presented in Part III, with reference to contrasts
between actual and expected outcomes, preliminary assessments of the direct
and indirect impacts of the project, as well as the lessons learned. Part II
contains a summary of project experience as seen by the Borrower. Part III
comprises an array of factual and quantitative information for a retrospective
analysis.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by aED staff. The draft PCR was sent to the
Borrower on November 1, 1988 for comments. No comments were received.
The valuable assistance provided during preparaticu of this report
by officials of the Government of Indonesia ls gratefully acknowledged.

THIRD POPULATION PROJECT LOAN 1869-IND
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Background
The project, the third in a series of IBRD population projects, was
intended to assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in its overall Sail of
reducing the 1971 total fertility rate (TFR' by 501 in 1990.  The two previous
Bank-assisted projects had helped establish the program's infrastructure. In
1979, at the time of the appraisal of Population III, a decentralized pattern
for managing the population program was fully in place in Java/Bali, and was
in the process of being established in the ten provinces of Other Islands I.
Population III was designed to complete decentralization efforts in the Other
Islay$s I, extend decentralization to the eleven provinces of Other Islands
II, I strengthen the existing IEC program in Java/Bali, and help improve MCH
services. The project included construction of population centers, warehouses
for storage of contraceptives, and health center in-patient annexes. Vahi-
cles, audio-visual materials, and instructional materials for population edu-
cation were to be provided. Technical assistance and support for training
were also included in the project. The project's objective was to help the
0O0 achieve its interim goal of reducing the TFR from 4.8 in 1979 to 3.5 in
1964.
Implementation
Except in site development and training of midwives and traditional
birth attendants, progress was slow during the first 18 months of the project.
The reasons for delays were (a) staff changes resulting from moving previously
temporary staff into permanent 8 m y positions; (b) the slow release of bud-
getary funds; (c) a new law (KEPPRESS 14A) which caused time-consuming con-
tracting delays; and (d) insufficient project preparation in building plans
and documenting bids. From mid-1982 on, however, project progress improved
markedly.
By May 1983, the Bank considered progress satisfactory in all compo-
nents except popult ion education. However, this progress was not reflected
in disbursements: fewer funds went for population education than orginally
planned, and the Ministry of Finance did not release funds for certain equip-
ment until 1984.
l/   The classification for Other Islands I and II is taken from the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 2912-IND), p. 6.



- iii -
Over the life of the project from 1980 to 1985, the rupiah fell 77Z
in US dollar terms. This included a 24% devaluation in March 1983. Due to
this devaluation, the Bank subsequently revised the total project cost from
US$72.6 million to US$62.6 million. It became evident in 1983 that as a
result of the decline in the value of the rupiah, over-estimates of construc-
tion costs at appraisal, as well as lack of completion of the population edu-
cation component, there would be considerable savings on the loan. Some of
the savings were later used for additional training of paramedical personnel,
procuring medical equipment, and planning the National Research and Training
Center for Population IV. At loan closing in March 1985, the total project
cost was estimated at US$39 million. The Bank had disbursed US$24.2 million,
or 691 of tho Appraisal Estimate of US$35 million.
Results
At loan closing, the civil works component (178 buildings), the pro-
curement of Bank-financed equipment, and the majority of paramedical training
had been completed. Thus the objectives to assist in the decentralizing of
family planning management, expanding of IEC efforts, and strengthening MCH
services were largely met. The population education component was not fully
implemented, nor were all the health center doctors trained. This project was
the first of the Population, Health, and Nutrition Department's portfolio to
be completed inside the appraisal closing date. When Population III closed in
1985, the TFR was 3.8, a 751 achievement of the goal to reduce it to 3.5 in
1984.
Sustainability
The likelihood of project sustainability was high for two reasons:
the incorporation under Population III of project staff into permanent BKKBN
positions, and the completion of the majority of the project's construction,
training, and procurement components.
Findings and Lessons
The main lessons from the project are as follows:
(a)  The Appraisal should identify physical infrastructure components
relevant to program needs in accordance with government regulations
and practices (para. 2.5),
(b)  If the project design incorporates extensive process and impact
indicators, as well as outcome indicators, project supervision and
assessment of progress will be more systematic (para. 2.8),
(c)  The greater the participation of staff at a local level, the greater
the project benefits (para. 3.4),
(d)  To avoid implementation delays, there needs to be sufficient project
preparation (para. 2.6).                 ,

Background
1.1       The Indonesian national family planning program, started in 1970,
has turned out to be one of the most successful in the world. At the time of
appraisal of the Third Population Project in 1979 .he program had recruited 15
million new contraceptive acceptors, the country's birth rate had declined
from 43 in 1970 to 35, and the annual rate of population growth had decreased
from 2.62 to 1.92. These achievements were remarkable because they had been
realized despite: a) a low average level of income normally not conducive to
the adoption tf family planning; b) a population which was 782 rural when the
practice of family planning is usually associated with a high degree of urba-
nization; c) illiteracy among half of adult Indonesian women when family
planning practice is often associated with a high degree of literacy; d) high
infant mortality (the 1980 infant mortality rate (IMR) was 105 per 1,000 live
births); and e) a wide diversity of religious and ethnic beliefs that might
inhibit family planning acceptance. The program's success was due to the com-
mitment of the Indonesian leadership, the effective management of the program
by the BKKBN, community support for the program, health providers cooperation
in family planning service delivery, and the commitment of substantial domes-
tic and external resources.
l.        rThe two previous Bank-assisted population projects had helped estab-
lish a large part of the infrastructure for the program. However, there was
still a need to improve MCH services, to expand family planning to the eleven
2/ Due to the March 1983 devaluation of the rupiah.



Other Islands not yet receiving services (Annex 1, 8k.-to-Of. Rpt., 8/15/79),
and to strengthen the existing program in Java/Bali and the Other Islands I,
as the number of new acceptors recruited had begun to show signs of leveling
off at the time of appraisal.
1.3       At the time this project was designed the Indonesian Government's
goal was to reduce the 1971 total fertility rate by 501 by 1990, corresponding
to a birth rate of 20-23 per 1,000. In Java and Bali, where the national
family planning (FP) program started in 1970, the fertility rate and the rate
of population growth had declined appreciably in the late 19709. However, by
1979 the number of new acceptors recruited had begun to show signs of leveling
off.  Greater motivation efforts were therefore needed in the six p wovxices of
Java/Bali, the cen provinces of the Other Islands I, and the FP program needed
to be introduced in 11 provinces of the Other Islands II.
1.4       Previous Bank-assisted population projects helped establish the
infrastructure for the program and develop the management, motivation,
research and tra. 4ng capabilities of the liational Family Planning Coordina-
ting Board (BKKBN)- Decentralization of management and training at the pro-
vincial and dis..rict levels was felt to be in great part responsible for the
success of Indonesia's family planning program. Decentralization involved
encouraging active participation in the family planning program of provincial,
district, sub-district and village level staff. For example, at the village
level, the KOI headman, the KHO  midwife, and the BKRBN fieldworkers recruited
FP acceptors and encouraged continuation of contraceptive practices. In 1979
this decentralized pattern was fully in place in the six provinces of Java/
Bali, and was in the process of being established in the ten provinces of
Other Islands I.
Project Description and Objectives
1.5       Population III was designed to encourage and complete decentraliza-
tion efforts in the Other Islands I and II, in addition to expanding informa-
tion, education and communication (IEC) activities, and strengthening maternal
and child health (ECl) services. The decentralization efforts were supported
by providing the necessary infrastructure including construction of population
centers, and of warehouses for storage of contraceptives, as well as the nec-
essarv training of personnel. Nealth center in-patient annexes were also to
be built. Instructional materials for population education, vehicles, and
audio-visual materials were to be provided. Technical assistance and support
for training in all components were also included in the project.
1.6       The Loan Agreement specified that 100Z of the following categories
would be financed out of the proceeds of tho IBRD Loan: civil works, consul-
tants' services, and fellowships (this included training and population educa-
tion progrms). The loan would finance 1001 of directly imported equipment,
95S of locally manufactured equipment, and 6S1 of equipment imported and
procured locally. All vehicles procured were to be totally financed out of
GOI funds.
1.7       The project's objective was to help the GOI achieve its interim goal
of reducing the total fertility rate (TFR) from 4.8 in 1979 to 3.5 in 1984 (in



order to attain the target TFR of 2.8 by 1990). This was to be achieved in
the following ways:
(a) Helping BKKBN to decentralize the management of the family planning
program by providing office, training and storage accomodation in
the Provinces and Districts;
(b) Expanding the information, education, and communication activities
begun under the first two projects; and
(c) Strengthening the maternal and child health services under the
Ministry of Health (M0H).
Components
1.8 (1) Construction and equipping of: 11 provincial and 107 district popu-
lation and family planning centers; 10 warehouses for storage of
contraceptives; and 50 in-patient annexes attached to health
centers;
(2) Provision of 1,500 motorcycles 3/ for family planning coordinators
and supervisors, and 50 mobile information units (MIUs);
(3) Provision of teaching equipment, instructional materials, and
fellowships for population education activities;
(4) Provision of IEC equipment, consultant's services, fellowships and
operating costs for media production centers, film production and
training;
(5) Operating Costs for the training in population education of 50,000
teachers, 4,200 school-supervisors, 1,600 non-formal education
supervisors, and 16,000 village workers;
(6) Provision of training materials and operating costs for the training
of 3,100 trainers of traditional birth attendants (TBAs), 20,000
TBAs, and the retraining of 47,000 TBAs;
(7) Provision of special equipment, vehicles,21 fellowships and support
for retraining expenses of 1,080 nurses and midwives;
(8)  Provision of vehicles,21 special equipment, fellowships, and support
for training expenses for 960 community health teachers training in
nurse training schools;
3/   The COI's policy restricting vehicle procurement to local manufactures
prevented the Bank from financing the cost of these items; the GOI
financed their purchase.



- 4 -
(9) Provision of support for fellowships for training of 50 staff doc-
tors who subsequently would be assigned to the 50 health centers
where construction of annexes was to occur;
(10) Support for study tours.
Bidding Procedures
1.9       Due to the scattered nature of the construction sites, packaging was
thought impractical and uneconomical; consequently 178 contracts were to be
awarded. Since none of these contracts were likely to exceed US$1.0 million,
international contractors were not expected to be interested in tendering.
Construction contracts were therefore to be awarded after competitive bidding
advertised locally under procedures acceptable to the Bank. The GOI's regula-
tions required civil works contractors to be prequalified. Foreign contrac-
tors would not be excluded from bidding. Contracts of US$300,000 and over
would be awarded after Bank review.
1.10      Equipment to be procured was diverse and specialized and could not
be bulked in packages suitable for International Competitive Bidding (ICB).
Although it was to be procured through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB), it was
expected that most of the equipment would be imported. Foreign bidders were
well represented in Indonesia, and were eligible to bid.
Fulfillment of Project Objectives
1.11      The objectives to decentralize the management of family planning, to
expand IEC activities and to help improve MCU services were largely achieved
in the last two years of the project. As was previously noted, this project
was designed to help the OI achieve its goal of reducing 1971 fertility (TFR
5.5) by 50S by 1990 (TFR 2.8). At appraisal, the GOI plan was to reduce the
TFR from 4.8 in 1979 to 3.5 in 1984. When Population III closed in 1985 the
TFR was 3.8, a 752 accomplishment. Although it is not possible to demonstrate
a direct relationship between project inputs and fertility decline, ir can be
said that the project increased significantly the resources of the family
planning program and the latter has been demonstrated to have a direct impact
on lowering fertility.
Project Design
1.12      The project as originally conceived was to focus on kabupatens in
the Other Islands which would be receiving transmigrants (Proj. Briei,
8/4/79). Focus later shifted to reaching populations in the 11 provinces of
the Other Islands II which the BKKBN was to cover with FP services during
Repelita III (Sk.-to-Off. Rpt., 8/15/79), and to strengthening ongoing family
planning activities and health services in JTva/Bali and the 10 provinces in
Other Islands I (Issues Paper, 7/2/79). In addition to the components even-
tually included in the Appraisal (i.e., civil works, prc:urement of equipment,
training, and population education), during the project preparation other pos-
sible components were considered. These included nutrition, health education,
diarrheal medicine production and distribution, regional population insti-
tutes, biomedital research, an effective information system (Bk.-to-Off. Rpt.



8/15/79) and income-generating activities for women. These components were
ultimately deleted after the post-appraisal mission (Memo, 3/17/80) due to
lack of sufficient information on certain aspects (Memo, 3/19/80), the risk of
over-extending BKKEN capabilities by diverting attention away from the primary
family planning task ,telex, 1/14/80) and, with regard to income-generating
activities for women, sAepticism that a population project was not an appro-
priate vehicle in which to mount an employment creation effort.
1.13      The project modifications that occurred at post-appraisal were
intended to make the project design congruent with BKKBN and MOH implementa-
tion capabilities and with their available financial resources for recurrent
expenditures. The designs originally envisaged for the project's 178 build-
ings were scaled down during project implementation mainly as a result of
building cost restrictions set by BAPPENAS in its role as reviewer of the
physical infrastructure plans.
1.14      Delays in project implementation and slow disbursements during the
first 18 months '3f the project can be attributed in part to insufficient proj-
ect preparation. Building plans and bid documentation would have been needed
earlier in the project cycle to achieve the proposed disbursement schedule.
The appraisal mission had proposed a dated covenant for the submission of
building plans. The Decision meeting did not accept this, stating that criti-
cal issues should be made conditions of negotiations or disbursements rather
than be linked to an implementation date shortly after Board consideration.
The loan agreement only required proof of site acquisition on a time:able
satisfactory to the Bank.
1.15      Another cause of delays may be attributed to the decentralization of
the tendering process. The local governments were given responsibility for
conducting the tendering of construction. Since they needed to follow fairly
complicated procedures requiring clearances with various offices of the
central government, BKKBN had to prepare detailed manuals; this was also a
time consuming exercise.
1.16      As stated in 1.11 direct relationships between project inputs and
fertility decline cannot be demonstrated. The appraisal stated that Popula-
tion III would assist the GOI to achieve its interim goal of reducing che 1979
TFR from 4.8 to 3.5 in 1984. There is an ongoing debate whether more monitor-
able and direct indicators should be used to assess project impact rather than
using outcome indicators such as reductions in fertility and mortality. It
may have been ambitious to expect a four-year project such as Population III
to have measurabJ7 fertility outcomes which often do not appear for long
periods of time._   The project design would have benefitted from a greater
emphasis on process indicators and a systematic listing of when certain indi-
cators should be monitored during project supervision. Additional impact

indicators to be included in the project design would be contraceptive preva-
lence rates and number of current users during each year of project implemen-
tation. A small survey towards the end of the project, focusing on knowledge,
attitudes and practices, and designed to produce results comparable to surveys
previously undertaken, woV,d have provided an evaluation of some aspects of
imediate project impact.-
Project Implementation
1.17      The parts of the project which were carried out to completion (i.e.,
civil works, procurement of equipment, and the majority of paramedical train-
ing) were adequate for the desired ends of program expansion. The institu-
tionalization of population education as envisaged at Apprdisal was not fully
implemented during this project nor were all the health center doctors
trained.
1.18      From the appraisal in 1979 until project closing in 1985, the Rupiah
depreciated by 77% (in US$ terms). This includes a 23.7Z Rupiah devaluation
(in USS terms) in March 1983. The Bank subsequently revised the appraisal
total project cost from US$72.6 million to USS 62.6 million. At project
closing, total project cost was an estimated US$ 39.1 million and total loan
disbursements amounted to US$24.2 million, or 69X of the US$35 million loan
estimated at appraisal. As mentioned, the large cost reductions were in civil
works (almost US$6 million); in addition, none of the US$3 million from the
category "unallocated" was utilized. At loan closing US$10.8 million was
cancelled. Thus, the Bank loan financed approximately 621 of total project
cost, compared to the 481 estimated at appraisal. The foreign exchange
component was 25%; the remainder of the loan covered local costs.
1.19      The main problem facing implementation were (a) weaknesses in proj-
ect management, particularly in the execution of civil works; and (b) delayed
release of budget funds which led to delays in project implementation.
BAPPENAS conditioned the release of budget funds on the results of a program
evaluation by t..e Godjah Mada University in Yogyakarta (Supvsn. Rpt. 7/17/82).
The report was made available in June 1982 during a Bank supervision mission
and funds were released by October. Again in mid-1983 another slowdown
occurred as no counterpart GOI funds had been made available for population
education activities for FY82-83 due to a revenue crunch.  (9/7/83 Supvsn.
Report). Once again a Bank mission obtained the release of the funds. In the
following year and a half, mid-1983 until 1985, the number of teachers, super-
visors and graduate students trained in population education increased
considerably.
1.20      The pace of civil works improved when four consulting firms and, in
1982, a senior officer for construction were recruited by BKKBU using project
funds. By May 1983, the third year of the project, the Bank considered prog-
ress satisfactory in all components ezcept population education. Some compo-
nents (i.e., the training of paramedical personnel) were even ahead of
5/   Ibid.

schedule. However, this progress was not reflected in the level of cumulative
-disbursements. This was in part due to the lack of funds for population edu-
cation. Another factor in the slow rate of disbursements was that the MOF did
not release until June 1984 budgetary funds for payments of US$4 million for
audiovisual equipment.  Lastly, there were delays in making payments for com6
pleted civil works due to lack of coordination between BKKBN and the MOH. For
example, a US$300,000 reimbursement application for the constrr tion of health
center annexes was considerably delayed because the necessary data had not
been forwarded from the MOH to BKKBN (7/29/83 Aide Memoire).
1.21      When it became evident that there would be considerable loan sav-
ings, a dialogue developed between the Bank and the GOI on possible realloca-
tions. In March 1984, the Bank staff decided to allow use of part of the
savings for additional activities within the framework of the existing proj-
ect, and for preparation of the subsequent project. This included procurement
of medical equipment (US$1.4 million), training of paramedical personnel
(US$2.1 million) and preparation of plans and designs for the proposed
Research and Training Center (US$0.9 million). The question of financing
vehicles through the loan was brought up again by GOI, but was not accepted by
the Bank.
Project Sustainability
1.22      Project sustainability of the BKKBN part of the project was highly
likely as the positions of Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff were regu-
larized under Population III and the majority of the project's components were
completed at project closing. For the first two 'projects, the PIU staff had
been temporary employees. The first two years of Population III coincided
with the integration of PIU staff members into permanent BKRBN staff posi-
tions. The staff changes that resulted initially delayed project management
and coordination (memo, 7/11/85). However, it was thought to be a sound long-
term choice, as it maximized the impact of institution building and transfer
of project management skills that had occurred during the Bank's supervisions
of the previous two projects and through consultants.
Bank Performance
1.23      In the long-term, the joint efforts of Bank and GOI officials paid
off as documented in the Project Implementation Table. Bank staff spent about
140-150 weeks for supervisions, this also included time spent on supervision
of three other projects and preparation of subsequent operations, which could
not be separated. The continuity of supervision was good with the mission
chief and architect remaining throughout the project period. After the first
year and a half the Bank became concerned about the exceedingly low rate of
disbursements and developed detailed action plans to improve the pace of
implementation. The GOI proceeded to act on these plans; BAPPAMAS and MOF, at
the Bank's urging, twice released previously withheld budgetary allocations.
These actions, a result of the persistent follow-through of supervision mis-
sions, greatly benefitted the project. The constant review of tender proce-
dures and evaluation of bids to ensure consistency vith the Loan Agreement,
required additional supervisory effort.



- 8 -
1.24      The Supervision Reports for Population III routinely had Consul-
tant's Reports, and Annexes with Key Project Indicators appended to them.
These appended reports were not systematic in detailing progress in component
activities as spelled out in the Staff Appraisal Report. Similarly, the Indi-
cators contained three unaccounted-for revisions of appraisal targeta and did
not report on several specific appraisal components. No data was ikept on
person-months of technical assistance.
Borrower's Performance
1.25      Despite slow progress in the first 18 months, the GOI deserves
credit for turning a potentially problem project into one that made substan-
tial contributions to the family planning program.
1.26      As mentioned, there were initial delays in project implementation
due to Borrower's performance (i.e., PIU personnel changes, withholding of
project counterpart funds). Second, new regulations (KEPPRESS 14A) governing
bidding and procurement procedures which required decisions to be re'erred to
the State Secretariat (SEKNEG) for approval before submission to the Bank also
caused time-consuming delays in the selection of civil works consultants
(Memo, 7/11/85).
1.27      As contracting got underway in late 1982, in the rush to implement
the project, the Borrower frequently did not adhere to procedures agreed to in
Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement. Questions arose from losing bidders. For
example, a US physician who was not awarded the contract for IUD kit steriliz-
ers in April 1985 appealed to the Bank for "evenhandedness." The Bank
referred the matter to BKKBN asking clarification. Although the winning bid
had been the lowest among the three leading contenders, it had also received
the lowest score on quality and quantity of kits.
1.28      The MOH construction component and most of the training were comple-
ted with delays. At completion not all the 50 health center annexes were
staffed due to a Government hiring freeze. Present evidence indicates these
facilities have low utilization in some areas close to larger health facili-
ties. This is in part a question of size-it is difficult for small in-
patient facilities to have a full complement of staff to provide complete in-
patient szrvices.
1.29      The project's population education component did not meet its tar-
gets due to initial implementation delays too large to compensate for during
the project period. Under Population IV progress towards institutionalization
of population education has continued with the MOE taking most of the respon-
sibility for program implementation.
Lessons Learned
1.30      Key Project Indicators.  In order to better monitor and evaluate a
project such as Population III, both process and impact indicators need to be
defined at appraisal (para. 1.16).



-9-
1.31      Infrastructure Needs.  Special attention should be paid to identify-
ing physical infrastructure needs, so they will be relevant to program needs
in accordance with government regulations and practices (para. 1.13).
1.32      Project Preparation.  At appraisal, project preparation steps need
to be defined and followed, and sufficient time should be allocated for their
execution. Otherwise, the initiation of activities that can be translated
into disbursements takes longer than anticipated (para. 1.14).

PART II
MAIN FINDINCS AND LESSONS LEARNED (BORROWER)
2.1       This section is based on a report submitted by SKIBN dated October
1987, complemented by comments obtained from BKKBN officials connected with
Population Project III during a Bank mission in February-March, 1988. The
Government's commitment to achieve fertility reduction while at the same time
improving the quality of life of individuals and socioeconomic conditions of
the population in general led to the establishment in 1970 of a sizeable
effort in family planning; in order to support this effort, the Government
invested considerable financial resources, but these funds had to be supple-
mented by foreign assistance in the form of grants, credits and loans. The
Bank assistance was used to provide the program with an infrastructure and to
extend rather expensive IEC and staff training activities to many more areas
than it would have been possible with national and grant funds.
Bank Performance
2.2       No ccments were given in the GOI report or during the meetings on
Bank performance.
Government Performance
2.3       The Government officials were of the opinion that the delays experi-
enced by the third Population Project were mainly related to the initiation of
decentralization for tendering of construction, delays in site acquisitions
and the fact that the project was approved late in the budget cycle with the
consequent lack of counterpart funds. Also, Bank procedures concerning
construction and procurement were complicated for FP administrative staff, who
were used to dealing with very different kinds of programs and issues. Once
this was understood, during the first part of this project, a PIU for
construction was established and staff qualified to deal with construction was
put in place, instead of relying on outside consultants for this task; but the
staff changes required to implement this decision caused further delays.
Lessons Learned
2.4       Indonesian staff believes that the lessons learned in project imple-
mentation during the first three Bank population projects (e.g., procurement
procedures, timely approvals of TORs, selected consultants and contracts by
GO and Bank, implementation of project activities in accordance with annual,
pre-agreed workplans) began to have beneficial effects only towards the end of
the third and during the fourth project. The approach of allowing more parti-
cipation of local staff in project implementation was also very useful. It
was only during the third project that construction comittees were estab-
lished at Provincial and Kabupaten levels and the system began to be decen-
tralized. Also supervision consultants were appointed to oversee construction
at various levels.



- 11 -
2.5       GOI staff interviewed considered that relations among BKKBN, MOH,
KOW and MOE were good throughout project impLementation. On the other hand,
budget problems in MOH and MOE were responsible for considerable delays in
implementation of program activities. Stow disbursements and incomplete
implementation of training on the part of MOH and MOE were caused by of lack
of counterpart funds; this in time led to lower utilization of the Bank Loan
than planned.
2.6       A final statement by staff in BKKBN concerning lessons learnt was
that in any future projects efforts to conform with project implementation
schedules need to start very early and remedial actions should be taken before
delays begin to be very serious and disbursements begin to lag behind.

3.2       Comments.  Since this Project was seen as an extension of Population
II, it was identified in conjunction with two supervision missions (in January
and July 1978) for Population II.
3.3       In January 1978 the  OI asked the Bank for assistance with a third
population project, and expressed the hope it could be effective by April 1979
to coincide with the third five yer plan, Repelita III. The Bank stated that
April 1979 was probably unrealistic. BAPPEAU subsequently produced a draft
proposal ("Integrated Family Planning Serviees for Transmigration,
Kabupatens") to ezpand and strengthen basic health/family planning services in
50 Kabupatens in the Other Islands, including transmigration areas. In May
1978, the Bank suggested the establishment of a task force to provide project
detail for a preparation/identification mission in July 1978. The July
mission found that no meeting of the task force had taken place. Meetings
were organized during the mission visit, and it was agreed at these meetings
that project objectives would be consistent with the policies of Repelita
III. Since the MOH's submission draft was not complete when the Bank mission
departed, and BKINM's translation not yet received, the first preparation
mission was thus delayed four months.



- 13 -
3.4       At appraisal, the mission did not complete appraisal of the project
because of inadequate information on some of the population components,
especially the "beyond family planning" components such as income-generating
activices for contraceptive acceptors and the districts to be selected for
location of ten-bed wards. A post-appraisal mission was undertaken in
February 1980.
3.5       The Third Population Project was the first in the Population, Health
and Nutrition (PHN) Department's portfolio to be completed inside the
appraisal closing date, although the loan account was kept open for a six
month period ending September 30, 1985 to permit disbursements against
commitments made prior to loan closing and there were three cancellations of
loan funds (see Comments, para. 8).

3.10      Comments.  At appraisal it was estimated that the Bank would finance
approximately 502-of the total project cost less the cost of vehicles. The
total disbursed was US$24,207,375.15. Three cancellations occurred during the
course of the loan as follows:
Revision 1:  October 19, 1985            US$2,392,624.85
Revision 2:  January 18, 1985            US$7,500,000.00

3.11      Due to the March 1983 devaluation of the rupiah, the Bank reviewed
the total project costs for this loan, and revised the Appraisal Estimate from
US$72.6 million to US$62.6 million (a 13.8Z reduction). The last three
project supervision sui=aries reported this revised figure as the estimated
total project cost.
