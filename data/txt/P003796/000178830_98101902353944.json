The project\n            would assist in expanding the national family planning\n            program, supporting current program activities, and\n            strengthening basic health care services. In particular, the\n            project would include: construction of population centers,\n            warehouses for storage of contraceptives, and health center\n            in-patient annexes; provision of vehicles, audio-visual\n            materials, and instructional materials for population\n            education activities.
