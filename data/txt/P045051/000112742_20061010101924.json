outcome negligible, and\n            the Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project: Strong political\n            commitment, a programmatic focus on targeted interentions\n            (TIs), good management with continuity of trained staff and\n            good surveillance. Successful implementation of TIs required\n            identification of high risk groups and coverage gaps through\n            comprehensive micro-site mapping that is repeated\n            periodically. Participatory mapping involving\n            community-based organizations has been a best practice.\n            Ensuring that baseline data is available and on record is\n            crucial and project preparation teams need to ensure that\n            the necessary technical assistance as well as time is made\n            available for this purpose. The need for a full contingent\n            of trained and skilled staff in key posts. Partnering with\n            NGOs with a strong track record of program implementation\n            has helped ensure quality as well as reach. The relationship\n            between NGOs and SACS is critical to successful scale-up.\n            NGO and CBO partnerships are essential, the program requires\n            inputs from partners to make this work, and more\n            dissemination of learning and technical strengthening is\n            needed as the program expands."}, "docdt": "2006-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
