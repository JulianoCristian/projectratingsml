Overview
Project Objective
In 1998, Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee identified HIV/AIDS as “India’s most
important public health problem.”1 At that time, it was estimated that four million
Indians were infected with HIV.2 If immediate steps to contain the epidemic were
not taken, the World Bank (Bank) assessed that India could “follow in the footsteps
of some of the worst affected countries in Africa, resulting in the erosion of many
of the past gains in human development.”3 Without successful intervention, it was
estimated that by 2005 HIV could infect five percent of the adult population—
more than 37 million people. 4 However, the epidemic was still in its early stages in
1998, so it was still possible to contain it if immediate action was taken. 5

     The World Bank had been financing HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment pro-
grams in India since 1992 through the first National AIDS Control Project (NACP
I). In 1998, the Bank was deemed to be the only donor with the capacity to assist
India on the scale and within the time frame needed to control HIV/AIDS nation-
wide.6 To continue the progress made by NACP I, the Bank funded the Second
National HIV/AIDS Control Project (NACP II), which had two aims: (1) to reduce
the growth rate of HIV infection in India and (2) to strengthen India’s capacity to
respond to HIV/AIDS.7

                            With respect to reducing the growth rate of HIV infection, the project sought
                      to change behavior through “targeted interventions” (TIs), under which high-risk
                      groups were identified and provided with counseling, condoms, treatment of sexu-
                      ally transmitted infections (STIs), and information, education, and communication
                      (IEC) programs.8 In addition to conducting TIs, the NACP II set out to improve
                      blood safety by, among other things, building and upgrading blood banks, estab-
                      lishing mandatory screening of all blood units, and training providers in the ratio-
                      nal use of blood products.9 In addition, the NACP II aimed to reduce the growth
                      rate of HIV/AIDS by providing low-cost AIDS care to those already afflicted with
                      the disease. 10 With respect to capacity building, the NACP II improved upon the
                      NACP I by significantly increasing the funds allocated towards strategic planning,
                      policy development, and program management.11


                      Summary of Findings
                      The DIR’s review of the NACP II found:

                             ■■    Indicators of corrupt practices in contract awards to non-governmental
                                   organizations (NGOs), such as fictitious NGOs receiving contracts and
                                   government officials receiving bribes, as well as and a lack of meaningful
                                   controls for tracking disbursements to NGOs;

                             ■■    Deficiencies in the implementation of test kit and blood bank equip-
                                   ment contracts, such as poorly performing test kits and non-functioning
                                   equipment;

                             ■■    Indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in the procurement of diag-
                                   nostic test kits and blood bank equipment—particularly when conducted
                                   through decentralized procurement—such as similar bid prices and affili-
                                   ated bidders; and

                             ■■    That while the Bank observed and initiated action on some issues subse-
                                   quently identified by the DIR as indicators of fraud and corruption, its
                                   observations and actions were not always timely and not classified as pos-
                                   sible signs of fraud and corruption.

   The DIR found that the NACP II’s selection and oversight of NGOs, which the
Bank relied on as the delivery mechanisms for services, lacked meaningful finan-
cial controls and transparency, thus creating the potential for corrupt practices.
Under the NACP II, USD 72.5 million was allocated to service-oriented activities,
such as targeted interventions and workshops, a substantial portion of which were
carried out by NGOs. These funds were typically disbursed in advance by local-
level officials in amounts that were less than USD 20,000. In certain cases, however,
these officials failed to track many of these expenditures, putting the distribution
and use of these funds at significant risk. The DIR received reports from NGOs
that procurement officials demanded and received bribes in exchange for award-
ing contracts to NGOs. The DIR found that many NGOs that received project
contracts were not qualified to perform HIV/AIDS prevention services, and some
did not even exist. Some NGOs also submitted falsified documentation to support
the work they were purportedly doing. The DIR’s findings were corroborated by
anonymous complaints to the Bank and news reports.

   The DIR’s examination of the implementation of diagnostic test kit and blood
bank equipment contracts revealed a number of problems. Regarding test kits, the
DIR found that some of the test kits supplied by particular companies often per-
formed poorly by producing erroneous or invalid results, potentially resulting in
the further spread of disease or in the wastage of blood. While the test kit distribu-
tion requirements were generally adhered to, the DIR discovered that inspection
and cold-storage procedures were not consistently followed, and that some test kits
were distributed near their expiration dates. This, along with external factors like
substandard facilities, poorly trained staff, and erratic quality assurance practices,
could have contributed to the test kit performance problems.

   Regarding the implementation of blood bank equipment contracts, the DIR
found that a number of contractors failed to properly install equipment at blood
banks; delivered faulty or non-functioning equipment; and/or failed to service the
equipment as required under their contracts. The DIR also observed that, in some
instances, NACP II procured what appeared to be superfluous equipment.

   The DIR’s examination of the NACP II’s international competitive bidding
(ICB) procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood bank equipment—which often
involved the same firms whose goods exhibited performance problems—revealed
a number of indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices, such as: (1) long delays
between the bid opening and contract award dates; (2) unusual patterns in prices
submitted by bidders; (3) apparent avoidance of the Bank’s prior-review process



                                         321
India DIR (NACP II)


                      by splitting tenders to fall below prior-review thresholds; (4) low bid submission
                      rates; (5) preferential treatment accorded to certain bidders; and (6) and unex-
                      plained expenses and possible self-dealing by the project Procurement Support
                      Agencies (PSAs).

                         The DIR also reviewed 217 locally procured contracts, valued at INR 118 mil-
                      lion (USD 2.6 million), and found that 82 percent by number and 88 percent
                      by value contained one or more indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices.
                      These contracts were primarily for the provision of diagnostic test kits, blood
                      bank equipment, and laboratory supplies. In addition to many of the indicators
                      detailed above, the local procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood bank equip-
                      ment exhibited other indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices, including:
                      (1) similarities in the language and presentation of competing bids; (2) separate
                      bidders with the same phone numbers and addresses; (3) the award of contracts to
                      firms that did not submit bids; and (4) substantial recordkeeping deficiencies.

                         Early in the project the Bank acknowledged its inability to gauge NGO per-
                      formance, but did not identify the lack of financial controls over NGO disburse-
                      ments until just prior to the project’s close. To its credit, the Bank has highlighted
                      financial controls over NGOs as a key area of reform in the NACP II’s successor
                      project, the Third National AIDS Control Project (NACP III). The Bank appeared
                      to pay limited attention to the performance and quality of the goods supplied to
                      the blood banks and testing centers, instead focusing on the number of such facili-
                      ties being erected. The Bank consistently identified delays in contract awards as a
                      significant procurement problem, but attributed these delays to insufficient pro-
                      curement agency capacity and did not appear to consider corrupt practices as a
                      possible contributing factor.

Project Background
Project Design

A.	 Components
As stated, the NACP II had two components: targeted interventions and capacity
building.12 The majority of project funding (78 percent of total project costs) sup-
ported targeted interventions that included a myriad of services, such as informa-
tion campaigns, counseling, condom provision, HIV testing, and low-cost HIV/
AIDS treatment.13 The funding for the NACP II’s targeted intervention component
was primarily channeled to NGOs to carry out these services. To enhance India’s
capacity to test for HIV infection and increase its supplies of reliable blood, the tar-
geted intervention component also funded the procurement—through both cen-
trally administered ICB procurements and decentralized local procurements—of
diagnostic HIV test kits and blood bank equipment, and distributed these goods
to blood banks and voluntary counseling and testing centers (VCTCs) throughout
India.

      The remaining 22 percent of the NACP II funding was devoted to capacity-
building, decentralizing implementation to semi-autonomous State AIDS Control
Societies (SACS) and Regional Circles to avoid bureaucratic disbursement bottle-
necks, encouraging management reforms within the SACS, and strengthening sys-
tems for monitoring, surveillance, and procurement.14

B.	 Implementation Structure
      1.	 Project Administration

      The NACP II was administered by the National AIDS Control Organization
(NACO), an agency within the Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Fam-
ily Welfare (MOHFW).15 Implementation of the project was decentralized, initially
to government-run State AIDS Control Cells, and eventually to quasi-governmen-
tal SACS.16 In some states, below the SACS were the District AIDS Control Societ-
ies (DACS) that were responsible, along with the NGOs, for making sure many of

                          the project’s activities were carried out.17 The Government of India provided grants
                          to the SACS on at least an annual basis.18 The government obtained the funds by
                          submitting claims to the Bank for reimbursement of actual expenditures incurred
                          by the SACS.19

                                2.	 Procurement of Goods and Services

                                There were two methods of procurement under the NACP II: (1) ICB and
                          national competitive bidding (NCB) procurements managed by NACO (through
                          an outside PSA, primarily for the procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood-
                          bank equipment; and (2) local contract procurements managed by the SACS and
                          Regional Circles, primarily for the procurement of NGOs, diagnostic test kits, and
                          blood bank equipment. The prior-review thresholds for NACP II are presented in

                              The DIR reviewed two other contracts that were above the prior-review threshold for the supply of HIV and
                          HCV ELISA Test Kits worth USD 514,239 and USD 442,138 respectively. These were not financed by the Bank
                          because the goods were delivered after the project closing date and therefore ineligible for Bank financing under
                          the NACP II.

      With respect to the procurement of NGOs by the SACS, NACO developed and
the Bank approved a set of guidelines to create a “transparent and competitive
selection process” that would “ensure that NGOs with skills, credibility, and rele-
vant experience” would receive contracts under the NACP II.23 In accordance with
these guidelines, NGOs submitted proposals to a Technical Advisory Committee
(TAC) set up by the SACS.24 If the TAC did not approve the NGO’s proposal, it
would either reject it outright, request that the NGO modify its strategy, or request
that it modify its budget.25 If the TAC gave initial approval of the NGO request, a
Joint Appraisal Team (JAT), comprised in part of a SACS officer and an NGO TAC
member, would be sent to conduct a field inspection of the NGO to examine its
facilities, discuss strategy with the NGO staff, and ultimately determine whether
the NGO had the capability and credibility to provide the services that the NACP II
required.26 From this inspection, the JAT would generate a field report that, along
with the TAC recommendation, would be considered and decided upon at the next
meeting of the SACS Executive Committee, a committee chaired by the Health
Secretary.27 If approved by the Executive Committee, the SACS would execute an
agreement with the NGO and, upon execution, 50 percent of the agreed–upon
annual budget would be disbursed to the NGO.28

C.	 Project Controls
      At the project conception stage, the Bank identified three “substantial” risks
to achieving project goals: (1) inadequate institutional and managerial capacity;
(2) weak procurement and financial management; and (3) the inability of local
organizations to deliver services. The capacity weaknesses were to be mitigated
by decentralizing HIV/AIDS prevention activities, promoting wider participation
of stakeholders, and allocating funds to capacity building. The procurement and
financial management weaknesses were to be mitigated by using an independent
procurement agency, relying on state and municipal AIDS Control Societies to
make disbursements to end users, and building capacity in the financial manage-
ment systems. The risk of poor service delivery was to be mitigated by establish-
ing competitive bases for funding, ongoing performance reviews, and prioritizing
target groups. 29

                      D.	 Project Costs and Timeline
                            The NACP II commenced on September 11, 1999, and closed on March 31,
                      2006. While the NACP II was intended to last for just over four years, in the end
                      it lasted for six and a half years, including one two-year extension due to expendi-
                      ture and disbursement lags, which the Bank believed to be caused by insufficient
                      allocations to the project by the Planning Commission and state-level capacity
                      constraints.30 The Bank allocated USD 193.7 million to the project as set out in

                      Reported Observations and Assessments
                      In its reviews of the NACP II, the Bank consistently rated the NACP II as satisfac-
                      tory, although noting a number of project weaknesses. The Bank’s concerns cen-
                      tered mostly around (1) project management, including high staff turnover and

vacancies both at NACO and in the SACS; (2) procurement, disbursement, and
financial management reporting lags; (3) weak NGO capacity; and (4) the Bank’s
own performance in monitoring and evaluating the project.31 In its 2006 Imple-
mentation Completion Report, the Bank found that risks to the project’s develop-
ment outcome were “low or negligible,” although a “[r]obust system need[ed] to be
established for monitoring performance of NGOs.”32




The DIR’s Approach to the
NACP II
The DIR included the NACP II in its review because (1) the Bank’s investigation of
the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) project identified it as at risk of expo-
sure to fraud and corruption; (2) its design and scope were similar to a Kenya HIV/
AIDS project that a past DIR found to exhibit indicators of fraud and corruption;
(3) it followed a design model that the Bank was replicating in many countries; (4)
it had a successor project (the NACP III) in its project pipeline; and (5) the Bank
had received complaints regarding the NACP II.

      The DIR’s review of the NACP II can be divided into four broad categories: (1) the
selection and oversight of NGOs, which provided services under the NACP II; (2)
the implementation of contracts for diagnostic test kits and blood bank equipment;
(3) international procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood bank equipment; and
(4) local procurement of diagnostic test kits and blood-bank equipment. The DIR
was unable to fully review the procurement of NGOs by the SACS because of inad-
equate documentation provided by the SACS. The DIR conducted its procurement
and performance reviews for the NACP II from October 2006 to April 2007.


Participation of NGOs
      The highest proportion of funds under the NACP II—63.5 percent—were allo-
cated to HIV prevention and intervention services (referred to as “Consultants/

                      to NGOs to carry out these services is unknown, NGOs played a central role in
                      these activities; indeed, the Bank referred to NGOs as the “engine of the entire
                      program.”33 At the project’s conclusion, the Bank’s database reported the following
                      funding breakdown, as set out in Figure 1.

                            Given that the majority of project funds were disbursed to consultants/train-
                      ing, and given that NGOs played a significant role in carrying out training and
                      intervention services, the DIR reviewed the selection and oversight of NGOs.
                      This review included an examination of relevant documentation, site visits, and
                      interviews with confidential witnesses. The DIR’s review was focused on four juris-
                      dictions: the states of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, as well as the
                      municipality of Mumbai.34

                            The DIR reviewed the NACP II DCA, NGO contracts, statements of expendi-
                      tures (SOEs), utilization certificates (UCs), NACO and SACS financial databases,
                      NACO procurement guidelines, evaluation and performance reports, complaints,
                      news articles, and other relevant documentation. On many occasions, the docu-
                      ments that the DIR requested were either incomplete or could not be located by
                      their custodians at the project level. On some occasions, officials refused or ignored
                      the DIR’s requests for documents. In all, the DIR was able to examine at least some

      In addition, the DIR visited the SACS’ offices and selected Bank-funded NGOs

                      Implementation of Contracts for Test Kits
                      and Blood Bank Equipment
                      In conducting its implementation review, the DIR sought to visit or meet with the
                      entities involved in the distribution, evaluation, and use of the goods procured
                      under the NACP II: the SACS, Regional Circles, VCTCs, blood banks, and National
                      Reference Laboratories (NRLs). The role of the SACS and Regional Circles was
                      to distribute diagnostic test kits to blood banks and VCTCs, which are located
                      at State District Hospitals (SDHs). The blood banks and VCTCs used the kits to
                      screen blood and test patients for HIV and other diseases. The NRLs performed
                      quality assurance testing for the test kits procured under the NACP II. The blood
                      bank equipment—primarily refrigerators and freezers—was delivered either by
                      the suppliers directly or through the PSA directly to the blood banks, which used
                      the equipment to store and screen blood. In total, the DIR visited five SACS, two
                      regional/district health offices,36 11 VCTCs, nine blood banks, and five NRLs in
                      five states.37

                            In each state, the DIR began its site reviews by visiting the SACS.38 The DIR met
                      with the Project Directors of the SACS and the staff officers with responsibility for
                      procurement, blood safety, and VCTCs. The DIR also examined the Stock Regis-
                      ters of the SACS and inspected the cold-storage facilities for the test kits.

                      38	
                           The DIR visited the following SACS: Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS); Maharashtra
                      State AIDS Control Society; Mumbai District AIDS Control Society; Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society;
                      Orissa State AIDS Control Society; and the Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society. In Karnataka, it is called
                      the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) to distinguish itself from the Kerala State AIDS Preven-

      The DIR, in accordance with NACO guidelines and with the assistance of three
medical consultants at different sites,41 performed the following tasks in its imple-
mentation review:42




at USD 824,238; (2) IFB 23 with eight schedules for 3,278,924 HIV ELISA tests valued at USD 729,694; (3) IFB
24 with eight schedules for 3,000,192 HCV ELISA tests valued at USD 599,327; (4) IFB 32 with two schedules—
one combined contract of eight schedules for 3,518,976 HIV ELISA tests valued at USD 514,239 and another for
351,800 HCV Rapid tests valued at USD 183,296; and (5) IFB 34 with one combined contract of eight schedules
for 3,518,976 HCV ELISA tests valued at USD 442,138.
40	
    Three of these contracts (IFB-32 (1-8), IFB-32-10, and IFB-34 (1-8)), totaling USD 1.1 million, were not
financed by the Bank because the goods were delivered after the project closing date of March 31, 2006, and were
therefore ineligible for Bank financing under the NACP II. The DIR included these in the contract implementa-
tion review for two reasons: First, the SACS and end users were more likely to have physical stocks of the goods
distributed under these more recent contracts than under the older contracts procured under the NACP II.
Second, reviewing these contracts afforded the DIR the opportunity to compare Bank- and non-Bank-financed
contracts for procurement and implementation differences.

    The DIR’s medical consultants were Dr. Usha Baveja (Lucknow, Kanpur, Amaravati, Cuttack, Nasik, Banga-
lore, and Bhubaneshwar); Dr. Kunal Saha (Mumbai and Bangalore); and Dr. Anil Gupta (Mumbai, Bangalore,
Hubli, and Raipur).

                      procured under two packages.44 These two packages included the following equip-
                      ment: (1) refrigerated centrifuges to separate cells from serum and plasma; (2)
                      refrigerators to store reagents, kits, and quality control materials requiring refrig-

                      neering consultant at three sites to lend technical expertise to the review.45

                            The DIR performed the following tasks in its review:

                            ■■   Assessed the equipment against the technical specifications and terms of

                           NACO guidelines recommend that blood banks and VCTCs follow a specific testing strategy: For blood
                      safety screening at blood banks, NACO recommends the use of ELISA tests but allows the use of Rapid tests in
                      special situations; VCTCs may use ELISA or Rapid tests as a screening test, with the samples testing positive re-

International Procurement of Test Kits and
Blood Bank Equipment

A.	 Review of Contract Documents
The DIR examined documents relating to NACO’s procurement (through the use
of PSAs) of diagnostic test kits for detecting HIV and HCV, and its procurement
of blood bank equipment, primarily refrigerators and deep freezers. The DIR also
reviewed NACO’s procurement of the two NACP II PSAs—National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC), which served as PSA from 1999 until 2005, and Hin-
dustan Latex Limited (HLL), which served as PSA from 2005 until the close of the
project.46 The DIR received the contract documents from NTPC and HLL in late
October 2006, completed its entry of the contract data into the DIR’s database by
mid-November 2006, and scanned and printed the documents for its review by
January 2007.

      The DIR examined all contracts procured by NACO through the PSAs. There
were a total of 95 such contracts amounting to USD 13.5 million, representing
seven percent of the total project funding and 31 percent of the funding allocated
for the procurement of test kits and blood bank equipment. NACO used ICB to
procure 94 of these 95 contracts.47 The breakdown of the contracts reviewed by
type of good is set out in Table 5.

B.	 Limitations of Contract Document Review
      The DIR’s review of contract documents was impeded by the fact that, in most
instances, the procurement files provided by the PSAs to the DIR were missing

46	
    NTPC managed the procurement for packages IFB 1 through IFB 31, while HLL managed the procurement
for packages IFB 32 to IFB 39.
47	
    Only one contract was procured under NCB: a March 12, 2002, award to Xcyton Diagnostics for the supply
of 450,048 HIV ELISA tests for USD 126,736 (CW-9213/NACO/IFB-NCB-1). It is not apparent whether this was
the only NCB contract, or why NCB was even used.

                      Local Procurement of Test Kits and Blood
                      Bank Equipment
                            In its local contract review, the DIR reviewed a sample of contracts procured
                      locally by the following seven entities: the Nagpur, Nasik, and Pune Regional
                      Circles48 in Maharashtra; the MDACS in Mumbai, Maharashtra; the Orissa State
                      AIDS Control Society (OSACS) in Bhubaneswar, Orissa; the KSAPS in Bangalore,
                      Karnataka; and the CGSACS in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.49 To the extent the documen-
                      tation was available, the DIR sought to review the 50 highest value contracts at each
                      location. In addition, the DIR spoke with officials at all seven locations.




                      Findings
                      Participation of NGOs
                      The DIR’s review of the participation of NGOs under the NACP II revealed a clear
                      example of how a broad-based lack of financial controls can lead to widespread
                      indicators of potentially corrupt activity.

                            The NACP II DCA allocated the majority of funds, approximately USD 72.5
                      million, to a collection of service-oriented activities, including “Training, work-
                      shops, fellowships, IEC, advertising and publicity, surveillance and research, stud-
                      ies, NGO and priority interventions services, consultant and professional services,


                      48	
                          Regional Circles are regional-level health services in Maharashtra that both procured local-shopping con-
                      tracts (along with the SACS) and acted as distribution points between the SACS and end-user facilities.
                      49	
                          The methodology employed by the DIR in reviewing contracts at the CGSACS differed from the general
                      methodology used by the DIR in reviewing local procurements at other locations. At the CGSACS, the DIR
                      selected contracts to review based on the findings of the Bank’s post-procurement review, which identified
                      deficiencies with respect to eight contracts directly related to diagnostic test kits and blood-bank equipment.
                      Accordingly, the DIR reviewed these eight contracts. The DIR also reviewed an additional six contracts that were

management information and monitoring and evaluation systems.”50 Hundreds of
NGOs were awarded contracts to provide many of these services.

      NACO and the SACS disbursed the funds to the NGOs, often in amounts that
were small relative to disbursements in other parts of the project. For example,
most grants were allocated to NGOs for targeted interventions, workshops, and
other services in amounts that were less than USD 20,000.

      The DIR found that, in overseeing the NGOs’ role in the NACP II, neither
NACO nor the SACS exercised any meaningful level of control over the tracking
of expenditures incurred in relation to advanced funds, putting the distribution
and use of these funds at significant risk.

      As a result, the broad-based lack of financial controls appeared to have created
an environment in which corruption could flourish. For example, the DIR’s site vis-
its and interviews revealed indicators that SACS officials demanded and received
bribes from NGOs, awarded contracts to NGOs that were not qualified or did not
exist, and awarded contracts to NGOs based on personal connections rather than
merit. These findings were corroborated by complaints and news reports.

A.	 Lack of Financial Controls over Disbursements to NGOs
      Both NACO and the SACS offices visited by the DIR lacked any meaningful
financial controls over the funds they disbursed to NGOs. NACO officials told
the DIR that the primary responsibility for tracking funds was in the hands of
SACS officials; accordingly, the DIR found NACO’s financial database to be largely
deficient. In the DIR’s site visits to four SACS offices, the DIR found that their
financial controls were even more lacking.

      1.	 NACO’s Incomplete Database

      Under the project, NACO created a database called the Computerized Pro-
gramme of Financial Management System (CPFMS) to track all expenditures
under the NACP II. The DIR’s forensic accounting team reviewed the database for
disbursements to NGOs and found deficiencies.

      The forensic accounting team was able to determine that at least USD 46 mil-
lion appeared to have been spent on NGOs: at least USD 36 million corresponds to
amounts recorded as expenditures under NGO-related accounting entries under
headers such as “NGO services” or “NGO Services for Preventive Intervention,”

                      and at least USD 10 million relate to advances to NGOs for which, as of March 31,
                      2006, the related expenditure had not yet been incurred.

                            However, the database suggests that NGOs probably received much more fund-
                      ing than this USD 46 million that was not properly recorded. For recorded trans-
                      actions relating to expenditures for services, a category in which NGO payments
                      would most likely appear, 85 percent of the transactions did not disclose the name of
                      the party to which the expenditure related. Some of the payee names that were listed
                      in these entries did not relate to an actual company or individual—one payee entry,
                      for example, said “12 NGOs” and another said “Dummy.” Based on this, it is likely
                      that NGOs received substantially more than USD 46 million in disbursements.

                            The NACO Director of Finance explained to the DIR that the SACS had the
                      primary responsibility for tracking funds allocated to NGOs. He explained that
                      NACO simply received biannual financial reports from these regional offices.

                            2.	 SACS Deficiencies in the Financial Tracking of NGOs

                            The DIR examined financial controls at four SACS and found similar wide-
                      spread deficiencies. The SACS’ tracking of NGO funds was often incomplete, hap-
                      hazard, and sometimes non-existent.51

                             ■■    For example, at the CGSACS in Chhattisgarh, the DIR found that the
                                   office had operated without a finance officer for five months. The office
                                   was unable to provide the DIR with any NGO expenditure receipts or
                                   other financial control documents, despite the fact that the office was cur-
                                   rently funding 20 NGOs. The office had files for only two of the 20 NGOs,
                                   and even those files did not include any documents relating to the NGOs’
                                   SOEs or other financial tracking information; nor did they include docu-
                                   ments pertaining to the work that these two NGOs had been performing
                                   during the last two years. Thus, the CGSACS did not appear to have imple-
                                   mented a system to track funds that had been allocated to the NGOs.

                             ■■    The DIR also reviewed the financial controls at the KSAPS in Karnataka.
                                   At the time of the DIR’s visit, the KSAPS was working with 23 NGOs that
                                   were funded by the Bank. The DIR reviewed the files for 14 of these NGOs
                                   and found that, in the majority of cases, the KSAPS was not tracking the
                                   funds it had disbursed. SOEs were altogether missing for four NGOs, were
                                   not certified for three NGOs, and were incomplete for three NGOs. While
                                   the remaining four NGOs appeared to have a complete set of expenditure

              documentation, the DIR found that some of this documentation was ques-
              tionable. For example, the People’s Education Society NGO had submit-
              ted a bank statement to the KSAPS reflecting that the NGO’s director had
              withdrawn more than USD 16,000—writing “to self ” in the withdrawal
              documentation—on various dates over a nine-month period. These find-
              ings call into question the accuracy and effectiveness of the KSAPS’ finan-
              cial controls system.

       ■■     Similarly, at the MDACS in Mumbai, the DIR found that funds were being
              provided to 20 NGOs, but the MDACS did not have any expenditure doc-
              umentation for eight of them.

      In addition, the DIR’s forensic accountants identified a number of large round
expenditure entries at multiple SACS. While it is typical for advances to be recorded
in round amounts, it would be unusual for expenditures to be so booked. This may
be indicative of instances in which advances to NGOs were incorrectly recorded as
expenditures prior to the submission of supporting documentation by the NGOs,
which was the conclusion reached in several external audit reports of the SACS.52
However, in some states, for example Chandigarh, this practice has been reversed,
as indicated in the Audit Reports of 2004 and 2006.53 The DIR’s findings are con-
sistent with the findings of the SOE Financial Reviews that had been performed for
the Bank. These reviews uncovered widespread deficiencies in the ability of SACS
offices to track their disbursements to NGOs.

       ■■     For example, the report for the CGSACS stated that the auditing and
              house-keeping procedures were “extremely poor” because, among other
              issues, SOEs and/or cash advances were not accompanied by support-
              ing documentation or authorization.54 This report noted that one NGO,
              SROUT often used cash payments to pay for its purchases, even for high
              value items like computers and medicines, and used invoice numbers that
              were not pre-printed but written by hand.55 The report also stated that
              another NGO, Atal Shishu Avam Mahila Kalyan Shiksha Samiti, made and
              received its entire payment one month in cash, though the NGO was sup-

                                    made purchases of medicines from the same company with invoice num-

                             ■■     In addition to highlighting specific accounting issues, the report identified
                                    systemic weaknesses within the CGSACS, such as inadequate segregation
                                    of management functions whereby the same individual served as training
                                    coordinator, finance officer, and NGO advisor; inadequate monitoring of
                                    advances to staff without settlement documentation for those advances;
                                    and inadequate internal governance structures.58

                             ■■     The SOE Financial Review for Karnataka reported that the office was not
                                    conducting audits of funded NGOs in accordance with NACO guide-
                                    lines.59 The report also noted an inadequate system for making adjust-
                                    ment entries, with ledger entries that could not be linked to supporting
                                    documentation and an absence of expenditure abstracts.60 For advances
                                    to NGOs, deviations existed between the expenditures approved in the file
                                    and the way that expenditures were recorded, expenditures were recorded
                                    prior to being approved, and the expenditures pertaining to financial year
                                    2004–05 had not been recorded at all even though they were approved
                                    prior to finalization of the accounts.61

                             ■■     For the MSACS, the SOE Financial Review reported that audit reports
                                    were missing despite the requirements of the NACO Guidelines.62 As of
                                    the date of the report, the financial records showed outstanding advances
                                    of USD 2.2 million of which USD 690,000 had been outstanding for more
                                    than one year.63 The report also noted that the MSACS received funds from
                                    different agencies other than NACO, such as the United Nations Develop-
                                    ment Programme (UNDP), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
                                    and the World Health Organization (WHO), and the office combined
                                    these funds into one account, making it difficult to monitor utilization

               of funds by donor.64 Similarly, for the MDACS, the SOE Financial Review
               noted problems with audit reports and records of advances.65

      Thus, the DIR found that, whether by NACO on the national level or by SACS
at the local levels, the financial controls over disbursements to NGOs were largely
deficient. While the DIR reviewed letters from the Bank raising these issues with
NACO, outlining actions to be taken and timelines to be followed, there is no indi-
cation that the Bank followed up to determine whether NACO took the suggested
actions.

B.	 Selection, Procurement, and Oversight of NGOs
      With respect to the procurement of NGOs, the DIR found several indicators
of fraud and corruption. The selection and oversight of NGOs was supposed to
follow NACO’s Procurement Guidelines. However, during the DIR’s site visits to
some of the NGOs that received NACP II funding, the DIR found that such pro-
cedures were often not followed. Instead, the DIR received repeated reports that
the SACS officials: (1) demanded and received bribes in exchange for awarding
contracts and disbursing funds; (2) awarded contracts and/or disbursed funds
to NGOs that were non-existent, performed no services, or had no experience in
HIV/AIDS prevention, thereby failing to conform to NACO guideline require-
ments; (3) seemingly disbursed funds to NGOs based on fraudulent or incomplete
accounting and reporting; and (4) awarded contracts to groups associated with
politically powerful, well-connected people even when the NGOs in question were
not equipped to provide the services they contracted to provide.

      1.	 NACO’s NGO Selection Guidelines

      NACO’s guidelines (the guidelines) governed the selection of NGOs. The guide-
lines outlined which NGO selections would be conducted by NACO officials and
which selections would be conducted by state and local officials. NGO contracts
above USD 100,000 were subject to competitive biddings and administered by
NACO.66 Contracts below USD 100,000 were selected at the state and local levels
based on single sourcing.67 The NACO Director of Finance informed the DIR that
the average NGO contract was valued at around USD 13,000, so the vast majority
of contracts were awarded at the state and local levels.

      The guidelines also provided the criteria by which NGOs should have been
selected.68 NGOs should have had: “(a) basic infrastructure in place; (b) stable
organizational structure; (c) established track record in community develop-
ment and credibility with the community in which the project is planned; and (d)
adequate financial management capacities.”69 Procurement officials should have
also verified that the NGOs were legally registered.70 Before awarding contracts to
NGOs, procurement officials were required to conduct due diligence to establish
that these criteria were met.

      The guidelines state that they have been approved by the World Bank and the
National Aids Control Board (NACB). The DCA and the PAD record the Bank’s
approval of the guidelines. The DCA provided that the selection of “Service Delivery
Contractors” would be governed by Bank-approved, project-specific procedures:

                  Targeting service for priority interventions, operational
                  research, cause of death and other studies estimated to
                  cost less than $20,000 equivalent per contract, up to an
                  aggregate amount not to exceed $28,870,000 equivalent,
                  shall be procured in accordance with the provisions of
                  paragraph 3.19 of the Consultant Guidelines and project-
                  specific procedures agreed with the [International Devel-
                  opment] Association and set forth in the Project Imple-
                  mentation Plans.71

India DIR (NACP II)


                              This notwithstanding, the DIR observed that the guidelines were inadequate in
                         ensuring effective selection and oversight of NGOs under the project. For example,
                         the SACS were required to select NGOs with a minimum of three years experience
                         and a well-defined structure. However, very few NGOs existed that would satisfy
                         these requirements. Accordingly, the SACS defaulted to the unregulated selection
                         of non-compliant NGOs. In addition, though the DCA provided an aggregate cap
                         of USD 28.87 million for the use of project-specific procurement procedures in
                         hiring NGOs, the fact that the disbursement of procurement funds was not prop-
                         erly tracked meant that this limitation could not be adequately enforced. The Bank
                         did not have the necessary data to indicate when the cap had been reached.

                              Thus, it appears that the selection and oversight of NGOs under the NACP
                         II operated pursuant to procedures that might not have received Bank approval.
                         Moreover, the inability of the SACS and NACO to track disbursements to NGOs
                         prevented the Bank from being able to determine whether the USD 28.87 million
                         cap had been reached. In addition, the DIR found that the SACS officials often did
                         not even follow NACO procedures when selecting and managing NGOs.

   2.	 Bribery of SACS Officials

   In its site visits and interviews, the DIR found indicators that SACS officials
often demanded and received bribes for the award of contracts to NGOs. Con-
fidential witnesses from several NGOs informed the DIR that SACS officials
awarded contracts to NGOs that paid bribes and terminated contracts of NGOs
that refused to pay bribes. Witnesses stated that SACS officials received bribes of
between 10 and 40 percent.

    ■■   Three confidential witnesses who worked at NGOs all stated that they had
         personal knowledge of corruption among CGSACS officials. They stated
         that the officials required bribes of 10 to 15 percent of the grant amount
         before the officials would reimburse the NGOs for project expenditures.
         The officials would telephone the NGOs to demand the bribes and would
         terminate the contract if the bribe was not paid. These confidential wit-
         nesses claimed that, while visiting the CGSACS office, they personally wit-
         nessed other NGOs, including the Swapnil Education Society and Atalshi-
         shu Avam Mahila Kalyan, pay cash bribes in exchange for grants.

    ■■   The DIR also interviewed one well-connected local politician in Chhat-
         tisgarh who believed that 90 percent of all NGOs that received contracts
         from the CGSACS had paid bribes to these officials. He thought that the
         bribes amounted to 20 to 40 percent of the value of the contract. The poli-
         tician claimed that he knew this because he was once approached by a
         number of NGOs to be a middleman to facilitate bribe payments. During
         the interview, the politician called the director of one of the NGOs and let
         the DIR team listen in on the conversation. The NGO head stated that he
         paid a 25 percent bribe to a CGSACS official.

    ■■   In Karnataka, the DIR learned of another bribery scheme involving the
         KSAPS from a discussion with another confidential witness. KSAPS
         officials would routinely use scheduled evaluation visits to the NGOs
         to demand money. Two officials would solicit 10 to 30 percent from the
         NGOs for the initial contract award and would again solicit 10 to 30 per-
         cent of the grant funds each year as the price for annual grant renewal. In
         addition, each time an NGO sought reimbursement of an SOE, the offi-
         cials would require that the NGO pay a facilitation payment of up to USD
         100. The witness said that there were recurrent delays in the reimburse-
         ment of expenditures to NGOs under the NACP II, due to the refusal of
         some NGOs to pay bribes to KSAPS officials. Other witnesses also stated


                                         343
India DIR (NACP II)


                               that a delay by KSAPS officials in disbursing funds was a way of putting
                               pressure on the NGOs to pay bribes.

                          ■■   An NGO representative in Karnataka informed the DIR that KSAPS offi-
                               cials would also make site visits to NGOs that were applying for contracts.
                               If the NGOs did not comply with the NACO guidelines, the officials would
                               tell the NGOs that they could “arrange compliance” if the NGO was will-
                               ing to pay between 25 and 30 percent of the value of the contract. The
                               witness named the following NGOs as those that received contracts in this
                               manner: Ujwala Vividhodeesha Sangha, Baswa Karya Samithi, Sri Shakthi
                               Association, People’s Education Society, Moolika Samvrudhi Arogyab-
                               hivrudhi Prathishtana, and Sri Shakthi Association.

                          ■■   The DIR received similar reports in Maharashtra and Mumbai. In Maha-
                               rashtra, NGO representatives told the DIR that several NGOs were receiv-
                               ing money from the MSACS but had not performed any work at all. In
                               Mumbai, the DIR was told that bribes were requested and paid through
                               the use of middlemen who approached NGOs and offered to prepare and
                               gain approval for grant proposals in exchange for 10 to 20 percent of the
                               value of the grant.

                         3.	 SACS Contract Awards Not in Compliance with NACO Guidelines

                         Despite the requirements in the NACO guidelines that NGOs have an estab-
                      lished track record in community development and credibility with the commu-
                      nity in which the project is planned, SACS officials selected certain NGOs that
                      appeared to have no experience in HIV/AIDS prevention or in any field related to
                      community healthcare and support. Indeed, some NGOs were awarded contracts
                      even though they did not appear to exist at all.

                          ■■   For example, one confidential witness who regularly conducted train-
                               ing programs for NGOs in Mumbai informed the DIR that the staff of at
                               least three NGOs that received NACP II funding was unable to describe
                               or discuss anything regarding their projects during training sections. In
                               another case, the MSACS awarded several grants to an NGO even though
                               the NGO’s contracting and performance documents showed that it did not
                               conduct any activities related to HIV/AIDS prevention. Instead, the NGO
                               conducted activities like tree planting, rural development, distribution of
                               school dresses, and craft education.

    ■■   In Maharashtra, the DIR visited the supposed address of an NGO receiv-
         ing funds and found nothing resembling an NGO office. Instead, the loca-
         tion was a large residence, and the owner said that the space had not been
         used by any NGO. (See Photograph 1 on page 410.)

    ■■   A confidential witness stated that, as a member of the KSAPS Joint
         Appraisal Team, he had experienced difficulties in arranging a meeting
         with an NGO that was receiving funds to assess its capacity. Because the
         KSAPS did not have correct information on the location of the NGO and
         representatives from the NGO did not often visit the KSAPS, the appraisal
         team had a difficult time arranging a meeting with the NGO to ensure
         compliance. When the witness finally met with a representative from the
         NGO, it was clear to the witness that the representative had no knowledge
         of health care and support work and was incapable of answering basic
         questions about the work. The witness complained to the KSAPS about
         the NGO’s lack of capacity, but officials took no action on the complaint.

   4.	 Incomplete and Possibly Fraudulent Reporting and Accounting

   Under the NACP II, NGOs were required to submit documentation, such as
utilization certificates and SOEs, to the SACS offices to allow SACS officials to
verify the type of work that was being done and the way that money was being
spent. In reviewing some of this documentation, the DIR detected incomplete and
possibly fraudulent reporting and accounting by NGOs to SACS offices.

   For example, NGOs appeared to have made false claims to SACS offices regard-
ing their activities and progress in the field.

    ■■   Two confidential witnesses from an NGO in Chhattisgarh stated that most
         NGOs had permanent lists of project “participants” that would be recycled
         so that the NGOs could appear to be performing their functions. The wit-
         nesses explained that NGOs that paid bribes of 20 to 40 percent had very
         little money to actually carry out their projects so they only did things like
         hire office staff to prepare books and records in case they were audited.
         Occasionally, such NGOs would arrange staged photo shoots or arrange for
         a journalist to write a story lauding the NGO. The NGO would send these
         reports to the SACS to show progress and justify further disbursements.

    ■■   John Paul Slum Development, an NGO operating in Maharashtra, reported
         that it had been working with truck drivers in Pune. But the DIR visited

                               the project site, where the NGO purportedly had an office, and found no
                               indication that the NGO was doing work as claimed.

                         The DIR also found indicators that some NGOs submitted apparently fraudu-
                      lent SOEs to SACS officials.

                          ■■   One NGO in Chhattisgarh submitted SOEs that stated it had paid almost
                               USD 400 a month for office space, when in fact the NGO was run out of
                               a home.

                          ■■   The DIR found that another NGO had submitted documentation claiming
                               to have paid more than USD 200 a month for an office in Raipur between
                               April 2005 and July 2005, but the NGO did not have an office in Raipur.

                         Moreover, several NGOs that the DIR visited misrepresented expenses in their
                      financial records or could not account for funds received under the NACP II.

                          ■■   In Maharashtra, the DIR confirmed allegations made by a confidential
                               witness that the director of an NGO was misrepresenting in the financial
                               books the amount paid to his staff. The books stated that employees were
                               paid INR 5,000 (USD 111) per month, but the DIR asked an employee
                               who stated that she and her colleagues each made INR 3,500 (USD 78)
                               per month.

                          ■■   Another NGO that had been awarded seven contracts from the MSACS
                               could not provide any SOEs or utilization certificates for a large portion
                               of the funds received. At first, the NGO’s director could not explain to the
                               DIR how the funds were used. Then the director stated that all funds went
                               to pay salaries, but provided no documentation to support this assertion.

                          ■■   Similarly, another NGO claimed to distribute condoms and run a mobile
                               clinic with an ambulance but had no documentation supporting the fact
                               that these activities were actually taking place.

                         5.	 SACS Contract Awards to Unqualified and Well Connected NGOs

                         The DIR learned that some of the project’s apparently unqualified NGOs may
                      have been selected due to their association with politically powerful and well con-
                      nected individuals, not on their merits or qualifications.

                          ■■   A complainant informed the DIR that eight NGOs that received about
                               USD 170,000 in funding from the CGSACS appeared to be selected for




                                                                346
                                                         Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


             their political connections.72 The DIR asked the CGSACS officials for
             the records for these eight NGOs, but the officials refused to provide any
             documents except meeting minutes that referenced the amount of funds
             that they had received. The DIR interviewed a representative from one
             of the eight NGOs. The representative told the DIR that the CGSACS
             first rejected his NGO’s proposal, but then his family’s political friends
             intervened, forcing the CGSACS to grant the contract to the NGO. The
             representative also informed the DIR that the NGO’s primary financial
             supporter was also closely tied to a political party in India and that the
             CGSACS gave the NACP II project in the support’s honor. The representa-
             tive admitted that, even though the NGO had been registered since 1990,
             it did not have any experience with working in the field of HIV/AIDS pre-
             vention. Apparently, the NACP II project was the NGO’s first experience
             working in the area.

       ■■    Similarly, the DIR found that an NGO with no experience in HIV/AIDS
             prevention, that was not legally registered, and that had no financial
             management structure was selected in Karnataka because of its director’s
             political connections. The DIR reviewed the KSAPS appraisal team’s min-
             utes, which stated, “Though the NGO does not have much experience on
             the development issues, the head of the organization has the perspective
             and leadership qualities to take up HIV/AIDS intervention.” The appraisal
             team reported that the director was a “prominent person within the soci-
             ety” and recommended that the NGO receive the contract, stating, “Some
             capacity building and hand holding initially will strengthen the NGO to
             implement programs as per the guidelines of KSAPS.”

       ■■    The KSAPS financial officer conducted a follow-up report of this same
             NGO after the NGO had received two contracts to treat STIs, and con-
             cluded that the NGO had no examination table, wash basins, or stocks
             of medicines to treat patients, the staff had poor knowledge of signs and
             symptoms of STIs, all expenditures like salaries and rents were paid in
             cash, and lists of patients were lacking.

                            1.	 Complaints

                            The Bank received three complaints in 2005 and 2006 alleging corruption
                      within the NACP II related to NGO selection. The complaints corroborated the
                      DIR’s many findings with respect to NGOs.

                             ■■    On June 29, 2005, the Bank received an anonymous online complaint
                                   about NGO procurements in Chhattisgarh, alleging the following:
                                   (1) the CGSACS project director was receiving bribes from NGOs and
                                   was improperly awarding contracts; (2) eight NGOs that had no experi-
                                   ence in providing HIV/AIDS related services were fraudulently selected
                                   after paying bribes of 40 percent of the contract value to the project direc-
                                   tor in advance of the contract award; (3) some NGOs that received grants
                                   did not do the work they were contracted to do; and (4) officials of the
                                   CGSACS terminated the contracts of three qualified NGOs because they
                                   would not pay bribes to the project officials.73

                             ■■    Another complaint alleged that the CGSACS demanded bribes of between
                                   25 and 40 percent of the value of the grants, the CGSACS terminated many
                                   NGOs without reason, and many NGOs with no experience in the field
                                   were selected for projects.74 As described earlier, the DIR noted similar
                                   problems in its review.

                             ■■    A third complaint, submitted in 2006, made claims regarding the MSACS,
                                   including that the MSACS required NGOs to pay at least 20 percent of the
                                   project grants in bribes, that many NGOs that had received funding over
                                   the years were not real, and that the government agencies exercised no
                                   financial control over the funds.75 Such allegations corroborated many of
                                   the DIR’s findings.

                            2.	 News Reports

                            The DIR’s findings were consistent with news reports about the NACP II with
                      respect to fraud and corruption related to NGOs in the project. These news reports
                      about the fraudulent and corrupt nature of the participation of many NGOs in
                      addressing HIV/AIDS in India support the findings made by the DIR in its docu-
                      ment reviews, site visits, and interviews.

       ■■     For example, in a 2002 India Today article entitled “The Mess,” the author
              alleged that large sums of money being provided by numerous donors,
              including the Bank, to combat HIV/AIDS in India were being allocated
              to fraudulent NGOs created solely for the purpose of cashing in on the
              funds.76 The author claimed that the NGOs were openly flouting NACO
              guidelines, and that, of the “1,800 NGOs claiming to work for AIDS pre-
              vention, nearly 80 per cent are suspect; many are bogus and others are run
              by an individual or family.”77

       ■■     Another India Today article entitled “The Deadlier Virus,” from 2001 made
              reference to “rampant corruption” in both the Maharashtra Government
              and NGOs:

                  While the question has been whispered in health circles
                  for a long time, it was only earlier this year that the Esti-
                  mates Committee of the Maharashtra Assembly started
                  looking for answers. In September, the Committee tabled
                  its findings in the assembly. The report is damning to
                  say the least ….The Committee found that almost 50 per
                  cent of the state’s 157 AIDS control NGOs were bogus. …
                  There are charges that officials in the MSACS [Maharash-
                  tra State AIDS Control Society] and the Mumbai AIDS
                  Control Society (MDACS) . . . take commissions of up to
                  20 per cent to sanction grants.78


Implementation of Contracts

A.	 Implementation of Test Kit Contracts
      The DIR observed two broad problems relating to the implementation of diag-
nostic test kit contracts procured under the NACP II: (1) poorly performing test
kits and (2) inventory mismanagement by the SACS, which acted as intermediate
distribution points between the test-kit suppliers and the end-user facilities.

      1.	 Poorly Performing Test Kits

      The DIR observed that a number of test kits procured under the NACP II per-
formed poorly by yielding invalid test results and/or unusually high false positive,

                      false negative, or otherwise discordant results.79 At blood banks, which screen and
                      store blood for transfusions, false negative results carry the serious risk of trans-
                      fusion-transmitted infections, while false positives result in the wastage of blood.
                      At VCTCs, which test patients for HIV, false negatives can result in the further
                      spread of HIV by infected persons, while false positives can impart a social stigma
                      and psychological distress on the patient. These performance problems were par-
                      ticularly prevalent in the kits supplied by three suppliers: Monozyme India Ltd.
                      (Monozyme), Span Diagnostics Limited (Span Diagnostics), and Zhongshan Bio-
                      Tech Co. Ltd (Zhonghsan).

                            Invalid, False Negative, and/or Discordant Results with Test Kits Supplied by
                      Monozyme. In late 2006, the Indian media reported that Monozyme had been
                      distributing expired diagnostic test kits in West Bengal, and had in some cases
                      been substituting pregnancy test kits for HIV diagnostic test kits.80 Given that the
                      MDACS awarded Monozyme two contracts for the supply of HIV rapid test kits
                      under the NACP II, the DIR, in light of these media reports, reviewed the perfor-
                      mance of the test kits supplied by Monozyme, which were received by 43 facilities
                      in Mumbai.81 The DIR discovered that five VCTCs had complained to the MDACS
                      that Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline HIV 1/2 Rapid test kits were producing
                      invalid, false negative, and/or discordant results.82

                             ■■    The head of the VCTC at KEM Hospital told the DIR that the procedural
                                   control line on Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits did not appear, thus pro-
                                   ducing invalid results. The VCTC official also reported that the Monozyme-
                                   supplied SD Bioline kits produced inconsistent and false negative results.83

                             ■■    The professor-in-charge of the VCTC at GT Hospital similarly told the DIR
                                   of invalid results from tests performed on patients with Monozyme-sup-
                                   plied SD Bioline kits, also because of the failure of the control line to light
                                   up. The professor also explained that the test kits often gave faint readings,

             making it difficult to discern the result. Finally, GT Hospital reported high
             false negative results with the Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits. This
             report of high false negative results was corroborated by the DIR’s analysis
             of two years of test results provided by GT Hospital, which determined
             that the Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits were indeed yielding a high
             false negative rate of 0.57 percent over a two-year period,84 much higher
             than the 0.2 percent level deemed acceptable by NACO for HIV Rapid
             tests.85 These results are set out in Table 9. GT Hospital reported the prob-
             lem to the MDACS and a company representative worked with the GT
             laboratory technician. The problem was attributed to technician error and
             GT continued to use SD Bioline kits without further reported problems.

        ■■   The KBB, Kasturba, and LTMMC & LTMGH Hospitals complained to the
             MDACS in July and August 2004 about the Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline
             kits. All three facilities reported that neither the control band nor the test
             line appeared when the tests were performed, thereby rendering the results
             invalid. The LTMMC & LTMGH Hospital further stated that 19 out of 219
             tests over a 24-day period had given such invalid results.86

    The false negative rate is calculated as the number of discordant results (28) divided by the total number of
samples tested during the period (4,920). The DIR did not have information on the final status of the patients,
but the false negatives are the cases that would have been missed if the Monozyme kits were used as the screen-
ing test.

                                  ■■   At JJ Hospital, Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits were used as the
                                       first supplemental test87 on reactive samples screened by either J. Mitra’s
                                       MICROELISA or Span’s ENZAIDS ELISA tests. The DIR reviewed partial
                                       test results data from JJ Hospital for a 10-day period for the month of
                                       October 2005. Approximately 80 percent of all samples testing positive
                                       from the screening HIV ELISA tests (139 out of 174) were subjected to
                                       supplemental testing with Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits. Table 10

                                 The results showed a concordance rate of 87.77 percent and a discordance rate
                          of 12.23 percent between the screening and supplemental tests. This discordance
                          could indicate either an initial screening test producing some false positive results
                          and/or a less sensitive supplemental test producing some false negative results.
                          Assuming the initial ELISA screening test results were correct, the false negative
                          rate for the Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline kits would be 1.95 percent. This false

                               Since results from the second supplemental “tie breaker” test were not available, the overall performance
                          of the Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline test kits could not be assessed from the partial results from JJ Hospital.
                          Furthermore, there were no formal complaints about Monozyme-supplied SD Bioline test kits by JJ Hospital, and
                          the test results records had consistently noted that the procedure controls had worked satisfactorily.

      Invalid, False Positive, and/or Discordant Results with Test Kits Supplied by Span
Diagnostics. A few facilities reported that two types of test kits supplied by Span
Diagnostics—Combaids and ENZAIDS ELISA—produced invalid, false positive,
and/or discordant results. 90

       ■■    At the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS)
             in Bangalore, Karnataka, the head of the Department of Neurovirology,
             who is also the officer-in-charge of the VCTC at NIMHANS, told the
             DIR that between 2002 and 2003, Combaids produced very faint read-
             ings, which created the potential for an incorrect diagnosis. The officer-
             in-charge also said that some of the Combaids tests yielded false positive
             results around the same time. The officer-in-charge said that he informed
             the company; however, Span Diagnostics reportedly did not take immedi-
             ate action to correct the problem.

       ■■    At the KIMS VCTC in Hubli, two medical officers told the DIR of a similar
             recent problem with Combaids producing faint readings.91 According to
             the officers, three other VCTCs informed KIMS of the same problem.92
             The medical officers believed the problem to be a manufacturing defect
             and made a verbal report to the KSAPS around December 2006, but said
             that no follow-up action had been taken.

       ■■    The medical officers at the KEM Hospital VCTC also reported unreadable
             results from Span Diagnostic’s ENZAIDS ELISA. They believed, however,
             that the problem was related to improper storage and transportation of
             the kits at higher-than-recommended temperatures.93 The KEM Hospital
             VCTC reported the problem to the MDACS in a letter dated July 19, 2004,
             stating that there was no color development in the wells of the internal and
             external positive controls.94


89	
    The DIR did not have information on the final status of the patients, nor were the Monozyme-supplied SD
Bioline kits used as the initial screening test at any of the VCTCs visited by the DIR.
90	
    The historical test kit results for Span Diagnostics’ Combaids rapid test were not available for the DIR’s
review.
91	
      This was for IFB 39, which was procured after the project closing and therefore not financed by Bank funds.
92	
      These reportedly were the Miraj, Sangh, and Dharwad VCTCs.
93	
     According to the DIR’s medical consultants, this also could have been due to inadequate antigens in the wells
of the positive controls, or a deterioration and/or contamination of the positive kit controls.
94	
   The complaints referred to two lots of ENZAIDS ELISA—Lots 5190 and 5243, expiring in Feb. and Mar.
2005 respectively; KEM Hospital VCTC letter to the MDACS (Jul. 19, 2004).

                             ■■   In addition, the DIR analyzed data provided from KEM Hospital where
                                  19,331 samples were tested with ENZAIDS ELISA over a two-year period
                                  from 2004 to 2005. The results showed a concordance rate of 42.86 percent
                                  and a discordance rate of 57.14 percent between the screening and two sup-
                                  plemental tests. This discordance could indicate either an initial screening
                                  test producing some false positive results and/or a less sensitive supplemental
                                  test producing some false negative results. More than half (2,640 or 57.14
                                  percent) of the initially positive samples (4,620) tested negative in the first
                                  supplemental test, leaving 1,980 (10.24 percent) testing HIV-positive. The
                                  1,980 figure was corroborated in the second supplemental test. Assuming the
                                  supplemental SD Bioline tests were correct—which appears likely because
                                  the first and second supplemental tests gave exactly the same results—the
                                  data show an overall ENZAIDS ELISA test result false positive rate of 13.66
                                  percent. This result is indicated in Table 11. The false positive rate of 13.66
                                  percent far exceeds the NACO-specified level of 2.0 percent for HIV ELISA

                      by Zhongshan. Two facilities—the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in Mumbai,
                      Maharashtra, and the Rastrotthana Parishad Blood Bank in Bangalore, Karnat-
                      aka—informed the DIR of false positive results with Zhongshan-supplied HCV
                      ELISA test kits, which resulted in the wastage of blood. In addition, the MDACS

informed NACO in March 2004 of various complaints about Zhonghsan kits
received from blood banks.95

       ■■    The IRCS reported to the MDACS in a letter dated January 3, 2006, that
             Zhongshan test kits were producing false positive results. The IRCS
             had previously reported similar problems with high false positives with
             Zhongshan HCV ELISA test kits in 2004 and 2005.96 However, the results
             of a comparative study of different HCV ELISA test kits, in which the
             IRCS retested the samples that were reactive with the Zhongshan kits with
             another supplemental test kit, indicated that the Zhongshan kits yielded
             false positive rates of 0.21 percent and 0.14 percent, which are within the
             acceptable false positive threshold of 2.0 percent established by NACO for
             HCV ELISA kits.97

Note: The total number of blood units tested during the year (2005) was determined from the
number of Zhongshan HCV ELISA test kits issued to the IRCS from the MDACS as per the MDACS
stock register. The IRCS received 15 Zhongshan HCV ELISA kits every month, so the total number of
blood units was estimated to be 16,200.

       ■■    At the Rashtrotthana Parishad Blood Bank98 in Bangalore, the chief medi-
             cal officer told the DIR that the blood bank had earlier encountered high
             sensitivity (that is, unusually high positive rates) with the Zhongshan
             HCV ELISA test kits, but that recent supplies were producing improved
             results. The DIR could not substantiate the reports of high sensitivity with

      MDACS letter to NACO (Mar. 22, 2004).

      IRCS letters (Aug. 11, 2004, and Aug. 5, 2005).

    Rashtrotthana Parishad is a non-governmental organization (NGO) engaged in mass education and service
to society. The blood bank activities began in 1980 with the identification and registration of blood donors, and
blood collection activities started in 1993. In addition to blood collection, Rashtrotthana has a blood component
separation unit to separate blood into packed red cells, platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate.

                                    Zhongshan kits because the blood bank did not perform any supplemental
                                    testing, nor did the blood bank report the problem to the KSAPS.

                              ■■    Finally, in January 2006, in response to NACO’s request for feedback
                                    regarding the performance of Zhongshan kits, the MDACS submitted
                                    complaints to NACO from a number of facilities. The Tata Memorial Hos-
                                    pital sent three letters between 2003 and 2005, noting high false positive
                                    results with the Zhongshan HCV ELISA test kits compared with other
                                    kits, as well as contamination in one of the wells of a sealed Zhongshan
                                    HCV ELISA test kit.99 The Rajawadi Hospital Blood Bank reported that
                                    the Zhongshan HCV ELISA test-kit controls did not function properly.100

                              	     The DIR visited the address listed in Zhongshan’s bid documents for its
                      local distributor, Spectra Pharma and Health Products, and found a Chinese res-
                      taurant called The Golden Dragon. (See Photograph 2 on page 410.) This raises
                      questions as to the legitimacy of Zhongshan’s supplier, and increases the possibility
                      that Zhongshan kits were not properly stored or transported.

                             Satisfactory Results with Test Kits Supplied by J. Mitra. Based on very low false
                      positive rates from tests performed with the MICROELISA test kits supplied by J.
                      Mitra and Co., Ltd. (J. Mitra) at two facilities, and in light of the absence of reported
                      complaints about MICROELISA from VCTCs and blood banks, it appeared that
                      MICROELISA performed satisfactorily. For example, based on results provided by
                      the KEM Hospital’s VCTC from samples tested by MICROELISA kits from June
                      through August 2006, the DIR calculated a false positive rate of 0.05 percent. The
                      DIR also calculated a false positive rate of 0.07 percent from samples tested with
                      MICROELISA at the Central Red Cross Society in Cuttack over two years.101 Both
                      results are quite low compared to the 2.0 percent false positive rate specified in
                      NACO’s guidelines for HIV ELISA tests.102 These results are consistent with the
                      feedback from the medical facilities visited by the DIR, which largely reported
                      overall satisfaction with the performance of MICROELISA.103

                          The lone exception was the Institute of Immunohaematology (IIH) in Mumbai. The medical officer-in-
                      charge of transfusion transmitted diseases told the DIR that some samples tested with MICROELISA kits sup-
                      plied in Nov. 2006 produced false positive results. The officer-in-charge explained that the IIH sent two letters to
                      J. Mitra describing this problem but did not receive a response.

       Other Factors Affecting Test-Kit Performance. A number of other factors, unre-
lated to the inherent quality of the test kits, could have contributed to the test kit
performance problems experienced by the blood banks and VCTCs, including:
(1) improper storage of test kits; (2) substandard facilities; and (3) understaffing
and/or poorly trained staff.104

        ■■    NACO’s technical specifications called for the supplier to maintain a cold-
              chain temperature between +2° C and +8° C during storage and transport
              of the test kits.105 In addition, the SACS were required to maintain cold-
              storage facilities to house the test kits. Although this cold-storage require-
              ment was generally adhered to, the DIR did find one instance of noncompli-
              ance. At the CGSACS in Raipur, the cold-storage facility was not properly
              maintained. A number of observations implied that the cooling system was
              turned on only because of the DIR’s presence. First, at the time of the DIR’s
              inspection, the temperature inside the walk-in cooler (+28° C) was well
              above the temperature range required in the NACO guidelines of +2° to
              +8° C. Second, the cold storage facility also lacked any alarm system to alert
              staff to any sudden temperature increases. Finally, the CGSACS officer who
              has been in charge of the walk-in cooler for five years admitted to the DIR
              that he does not maintain a temperature log. The high temperature inside
              the walk-in cooler could have adversely affected the quality of the test kits
              and their subsequent performance. (See Photograph 3 on page 411.)

        ■■    The 20 VCTCs and blood banks visited by the DIR varied in terms of their
              physical condition. Most buildings were old and in need of general main-
              tenance, repair, and/or renovation. A notable physical limitation observed
              by the DIR at four sites was the lack of air conditioning to maintain proper
              temperature, which could potentially affect the test results.106

        ■■    In most states the DIR generally found the medical staff to be experienced
              and well trained, and found that they followed proper testing procedures.
              However, at all four facilities visited in Uttar Pradesh, the DIR observed
              that the staff was not knowledgeable about the NACO-prescribed testing
              strategies. In addition, the DIR found a few facilities understaffed. At the
              SPM Civil Hospital in Lucknow, for example, there was only one formally

                                   trained technician who conducted the testing for the blood bank and the
                                   VCTC. Finally, the DIR observed inadequate recording of test results by
                                   the staff at five facilities,107 which hampered the DIR’s ability to assess the
                                   validity of test results.

                             Erratic Quality Assurance Practices. Under the NACP II, test kits were, in the-
                      ory, subject to two layers of quality assurance prior to being used by blood banks
                      and VCTCs. The DIR found, however, that the methods and frequency of test kit
                      quality assurance were inconsistent and erratic, possibly causing substandard test
                      kits to evade proper scrutiny.

                              ■■   According to officials at NTPC, test kits procured under the NACP II
                                   were subjected to a mandatory pre-dispatch inspection at one of the gov-
                                   ernment-approved NRLs.108 Based on its discussions with five NRLs,109
                                   however, the DIR found that the sample sizes used to evaluate the test
                                   kits were not consistent across the NRLs and were usually smaller than
                                   international standards.110 For example, NIMHANS used sample sizes of
                                   between 25 to 100 tests; the National Institute of Communicable Disease
                                   required at least 50 to 500 tests; and the National AIDS Research Institute
                                   used a panel of 100. In addition, because the NRLs only evaluated samples
                                   provided to them by the suppliers—the NRLs did not visit the suppliers’
                                   facilities to draw samples—the NRLs could not verify whether the samples
                                   evaluated derived from the same batch of test kits that were to be supplied.
                                   Thus, substandard kits may have escaped evaluation.

                              ■■   According to NACO guidelines, all facilities engaged in HIV testing have
                                   to practice quality assurance.111 This included testing serum panels with
                                   known results sent from the NRLs, sending representative samples to the
                                   NRLs for cross-checking, and testing control samples provided by the sup-
                                   plier. However, the DIR found that a number of facilities did not regularly
                                   practice these controls.112
                      107	
                           These facilities were USMH and GSVM Medical College in Kanpur; KEM Hospital and JJ Hospital in Mum-
                      bai; and Capital Hospital in Bhubaneshwar.
                      108	
                          The DIR understands that NACO introduced this pre-dispatch inspection requirement towards the latter
                      portion of the NACP II, after receiving complaints about test kit quality.
                      109	
                           The DIR visited the following five NRLs: Institute of Immunohaematology (IIH), Mumbai; National Institute
                      of Biologicals (NIB), Noida; National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), Delhi; National AIDS Research

       2.	    Stock Registration Lapses and Inventory Mismanagement at the
       SACS

       In accordance with NACO’s distribution scheme, test kit suppliers delivered their
goods to the SACS, which would then distribute the kits to the VCTCs and blood banks
within their jurisdictions. Accordingly, the SACS were required to maintain their
own stock registers and ensure that the test kits did not expire prior to distribution.
In general, the DIR found that the SACS visited kept well-maintained and accurate
records of test kits received. At a few SACS, however, the DIR found discrepancies
between stock records and inventory on hand, and discrepancies between the SACS’
stock records and the stock records of end-user facilities. In addition, the DIR found
instances of test kits being distributed very close to their expiration dates or, in some
cases, not being distributed at all. At best, these management lapses resulted in
wasted test kits, as the expired or nearly expired kits would have to be discarded. At
worst, this could have resulted in the use of expired test kits that may have adversely
affected test kit performance.

       Discrepancies between Stock Records and Inventory on Hand at Nasik Regional
Circle. From its stock register analysis at the Nasik Regional Circle in Maharashtra,
the DIR found a number discrepancies between the stock register entries and the
actual inventory on hand.113 These discrepancies are set out in Table 13.

                             Inventory Mismanagement and Stock Record Discrepancies at the KSAPS. The
                      DIR’s review of the KSAPS stock register found that the KSAPS distributed nearly
                      expired test kits and failed to distribute other test kits prior to their expiration date.
                      In addition, the DIR found discrepancies between the KSAPS’s stock records and
                      those of end-user facilities to which the KSAPS distributed test kits.

                              ■■    According to the KSAPS’s stock records, a total of 24 HIV Combaids-Rs
                                    kits (1,152 tests) were disbursed to four facilities on May 4, 7, 10, and 11,
                                    2004, in the same month of their expiration.114

                              ■■    In addition, the KSAPS failed to distribute 363 HIV Combaids-Rs kits
                                    (17,424 tests) by the expiration date of May 2004, but the KSAPS officials
                                    could not confirm whether the expired kits had been disposed of, nor
                                    could they initially locate the kits upon the DIR’s inquiries. The DIR ulti-
                                    mately found 168 of these expired kits (8,064 tests) on the rooftop of the
                                    KSAPS office building after the KSAPS’s former stock officer informed the
                                    KSAPS that they might be there.115 (See Photograph 4 on page 412.)

                              ■■    The DIR also discovered on the KSAPS rooftop 100 Zhongshan HCV
                                    ELISA test kits that had expired on January 12, 2006, roughly 16 months
                                    prior to the DIR’s visit.116 (See Photograph 5 on page 412.)

                              ■■    The KSAPS appeared to distribute Zhonghsan HCV ELISA kits to the Ras-
                                    throtthana blood bank very close to their expiration date. As shown in
                                    Table 14, Rashtrotthana’s records showed that the blood bank discarded
                                    almost half (48.49 percent) of its HCV ELISA test kit supplied by the
                                    KSAPS in January and October of 2005 because the test kits were not used
                                    prior to their expiration dates.

        ■■    With respect to stock record discrepancies, the DIR could not trace a
              quantity of 581 Zhongshan HCV ELISA kits (55,776 tests) that the KSAPS
              stock register recorded as having been “dumped”117 on NIMHANS on
              April 12, 2004, and then returned by NIMHANS on October 20, 2004.118
              The NIMHANS stock register, however, did not show any receipt or return
              of the kits from the KSAPS. The KSAPS officials explained that the test kits
              were being stored temporarily at NIMHANS because of insufficient stor-
              age space at the KSAPS. However, the staff at both the NIMHANS Blood
              Bank and VCTC119 ruled out the possibility of storing such a large one-off
              consignment for the KSAPS at their facility without their knowledge.

        ■■    The DIR also observed a discrepancy between the KSAPS stock register and
              actual inventory on-hand. The KSAPS stock register showed an increase of
              361 Zhongshan HCV ELISA kits between October 6, 2004, and October
              8, 2004, that was not attributed to any deliveries. The KSAPS stock officer,
              who joined the KSAPS during that period, told the DIR that he found
              those excess kits when he took inventory of the physical stock.120

B.	Implementation of Blood Bank Equipment Contracts
       From its site observations and review of field documents, the DIR found the
following implementation issues with respect to blood bank equipment contracts
related to the NACP II: (1) non-installation, late installation, and poor installa-
tion of equipment; (2) lack of consultation and delivery of superfluous equipment;

                      (3) faulty equipment with substandard components; (4) non-servicing and irregu-
                      lar servicing of equipment; and (5) discrepancies between invoices and contract
                      awards. These problems, in some cases, severely affected the blood banks’ ability
                      to maintain their blood stocks.

                             1.	 Installation Problems

                             The DIR found that blood banks encountered significant delays in the instal-
                      lation and commissioning of equipment, and that often equipment was poorly
                      installed or not installed at all. The most serious example involved the -80° C and
                      -40° C deep freezers supplied by NuAire Inc.(Nuaire) to the Central Red Cross
                      blood bank in Cuttack pursuant to IFB 2A-2 and 2A-3, respectively.121

                             The Central Red Cross blood bank in Cuttack received -40° C and -80° C freez-
                      ers in April 2001, but Nuaire’s servicing agent, Omega Instruments (India) Pvt.
                      Ltd., failed to install the freezers during its initial visit on June 12, 2001.122 The -80°
                      C freezer was eventually installed in December 2002,123 but the blood bank had to
                      acquire its own voltage stabilizer to operate it. Despite both freezers not having
                      been initially installed, the blood bank signed the acceptance documents on the
                      day of Nuaire’s servicing agent’s initial visit. Moreover, the acceptance documents
                      for both freezers were modified and lacked the standard provisions regarding the
                      supplier’s fulfillment of its contractual obligations for installation, commissioning,
                      and training.124 The -40° C freezer was eventually installed by a local engineer in
                      October 2004—more than three years after it was initially delivered.125

                             2.	 Premature Delivery and Delivery of Superfluous Equipment

                             The DIR found that most of the -80° C Nuaire freezers were of limited use
                      and would not have been requested had the end users been consulted, and that in
                      one instance, both Nuaire’s -40° C and -80° C freezers were delivered prematurely
                      before the end user was prepared to accept them.

                              ■■   According to the KGMU blood bank’s staff, the facility did not have the
                                   necessary space and blood component separation license when it received

              Nuaire freezers in June 2001.126 The hospital apparently repacked both
              freezers and did not use them until it obtained the license in 2005. By
              the time the equipment was put into use, the two-year warranty period
              had expired; thus, the cost of any repairs on the freezers would have been
              borne by the blood bank. The doctors at KGMU generally felt that NACO
              had “pushed” the equipment on the hospital.

        ■■    The senior medical officers at the National Plasma Fractionation Center
              (NPFC) in Mumbai told the DIR that their opinions were not taken into
              account when the freezer was distributed to the hospital. They considered
              the Nuaire freezers inferior to similar equipment available on the market,
              and stated that, if given a choice, they would have preferred using a hori-
              zontally placed freezer rather than a vertical one. The technical staff at the
              NPFC explained that they converted the -80° C freezer to -40° C to extend
              the useful life of the freezer.

        ■■    The staff at the KIMS Hubli blood bank explained that the blood bank
              used its -80° C freezer only to meet seasonal demand in August and Sep-
              tember.

       In addition, two facilities reported that water baths supplied by Spectrum Sci-
entific Pvt. Ltd. (Spectrum Scientific) were unnecessary.127

        ■■    The DIR observed that Spectrum water baths were not in service either at
              the Rashtrotththana blood bank in Bangalore or at the JNM College Hos-
              pital’s blood bank in Raipur. At Rashtrotthana, the water bath had been
              idle since May 2005. While the Rashtrotthana staff did not explicitly ques-
              tion the practical utility of the machine, staff at the JNM College Hospital’s
              blood bank clearly stated that they did not require the equipment.

       3.	 Non-functioning and Faulty Equipment

       During its site inspections, the DIR discovered that all of the freezers supplied
by Nuaire (under IFB 2-2 and IFB 2-3) and most of the refrigerators supplied by
Remi Instruments Ltd (Remi) (under IFB 2-5) had non-functioning temperature
chart recorders—essentially back-up temperature devices—which were required
by the technical specifications.128

                      The DIR found problems with the chart recorders on both the -40° C and -80° C
                      Nuaire deep freezers at seven facilities.

                             ■■   At the KGMU’s blood bank, the DIR learned that the chart recorders of
                                  both the -40° C and -80° C freezers had been out of order at least since the
                                  date when the freezers were put into operation in 2005. However, based
                                  on the installation reports and acceptance certificates signed by the blood
                                  bank officer, it appeared that the chart recorders were found compliant
                                  when the freezers were installed and tested in June 2001.129

                             ■■   At the Amaravati Civil Hospital in Maharashtra, the chart recorder in the
                                  -40° C deep freezer, which was broken at the time of the DIR’s visit, had not
                                  been working since December 2003. The temperature chart recorder on
                                  the functioning -80° C freezer was also out of order at the time of the DIR’s
                                  inspection. Because the hospital staff never reported it, the DIR was unable
                                  to establish when the problem occurred.130 (See Photograph 6 on page 413.)

                             ■■   The Janakalyan blood bank in Nasik first experienced a problem with the
                                  chart recorder on its -40° C freezer in August 2001—just two months after
                                  it was installed—but because the facility’s records were incomplete, the DIR
                                  was unable to determine whether the problem had been rectified at the time.
                                  A blood-bank technician told the DIR that the chart recorder of both freezers
                                  had not been operational for a long time. (See Photograph 7 on page 413.)

                             ■■   Finally, at four other blood-bank locations—the Cuttack Central Red
                                  Cross, the NPFC in Mumbai, the KIMS in Hubli, and the JNM Medical
                                  College in Raipur—the DIR observed that the chart recorders of both -40°
                                  C and -80° C freezers were provided with a single use battery, contrary to
                                  the technical specifications.

                             Remi Supplied Non-functioning and Faulty Refrigerators. In the technical evalu-

                      (Oct. 6, 2000). The non-functioning chart recorders were observed by the biomedical engineer, Mr. Srinivas Ta-
                      man, who provided technical assistance to the DIR on the site visits.

                      2001). The technician at KGMU did not maintain a temperature log. He told the DIR that he checked the tem-
                      perature by opening the freezers and “feeling” if the inside temperature was “right.”

                          At the Amaravati Civil Hospital, the technician maintained the temperature log but told the DIR that he
                      trusted the temperature readings but did not know if they were accurate.

and rechargeable battery pack were listed as optional accessories.131 Remi, however
agreed to supply both items during the pre-award meeting with NTPC on October
6, 2000.132 The DIR found these items to be either absent or not functioning in four
sites visited.

        ■■   The DIR’s biomedical engineering consultant verified that the Remi refrig-
             erators at the Cuttack Central Red Cross and the KIMS blood banks lacked
             battery back-ups. Additionally, the chart recorder of one of the refrigera-
             tors at the Cuttack Central Red Cross was out of order at the time of the
             DIR’s visit. The Cuttack Central Red Cross reported both malfunction-
             ing refrigerators to Remi on January 20, 2007, but the company did not
             respond either to this report or to a follow-up report of March 16, 2007,
             even though its annual maintenance contract (AMC) period extended to
             April 18, 2007.133

        ■■   At the Amaravati Civil Hospital in Maharashtra, the hospital staff
             explained to the DIR that the temperature chart recorder had been taken
             out of one of its refrigerators by a local technician when it was found to
             be irreparable. (See Photograph 8 on page 414.) The chart recorder in the
             second refrigerator also did not function, nor did the refrigerator itself.
             Both chart recorders also lacked a battery back-up.

        ■■   At the Janakalyan Blood Bank in Maharashtra, the DIR observed that the
             chart recorders did not function on either refrigerator. This was confirmed
             by the blood bank staff.

        ■■   Both of the chart recorders on the Remi refrigerators were out of order at
             the JNM College Hospital blood bank in Raipur. However, the staff did
             not know for how long they had been non-operational. In the absence of
             any further information or documentation that should have been main-
             tained by the blood bank, the DIR could not establish whether the supplier
             still had the AMC obligations under the contract to repair the faulty chart
             recorders.

                      in August 2001. Despite the faulty voltage stabilizer supplied by the company, the
                      blood bank signed the acceptance certificate, even though Spectrum Scientific’s
                      engineer had noted in his installation report that he could not demonstrate how
                      to operate the equipment without first replacing the stabilizer.134 The Central Red
                      Cross blood bank complained repeatedly to Spectrum as well as to the OSACS
                      from September 2005 until November 2006, but the defect in the cooling system
                      was never rectified.

                             4.	 Non-servicing and Irregular Servicing of Equipment

                             From the site visits, it was apparent that there was inadequate monitoring by
                      the PSA in ensuring that the equipment suppliers executed the AMC and warranty
                      obligations of their contracts. As a result, many blood banks ultimately had to use
                      their own funds to cover the cost of repairs, and often went long periods with non-
                      functioning equipment.

                             Nuaire -40° C and -80° C Deep Freezers Were Not Serviced. In its site visits, the
                      DIR learned of numerous unattended problems with Nuaire-supplied deep freez-
                      ers. Although Nuaire voided the warranty on both its -40° C and -80° C freezers
                      following NTPC’s termination of its contract on January 27, 2003, it appeared that
                      neither the PSAs (NTPC and HLL) nor NACO made alternative arrangements for
                      the servicing of Nuaire freezers.

                              ■■    The -40° C freezer at the Amaravati Civil Hospital had not been working
                                    since December 2003 due to a compressor problem, and the problem still
                                    had not been rectified three and a half years later at the time of the DIR’s
                                    visit in April 2007. The MSACS appeared unwilling to cover the cost of
                                    repairs to replace the compressor and gas filling, which was estimated at
                                    INR 35,200.135

                              ■■    The staff at the KGMU Hospital blood bank in Uttar Pradesh appeared
                                    uninformed of the Nuaire contract termination. From the blood bank’s
                                    records, the KGMU Hospital continued writing to Nuaire’s servicing
                                    agent, Nutek Instruments, up to April 2005 to carry out the AMC, years
                                    after Nuaire’s contract had been terminated. In April 2005, the blood bank
                                    arranged for the repair of its freezer through a locally identified firm and
                                    used their own funds to pay for the repair.

        ■■    According to staff at the NPFC of the KEM Hospital in Bangalore, the
              calibration and other preventive maintenance on the -80° C and -40° C
              freezers were performed by an outside third party at regular time inter-
              vals, usually twice a year. The NPFC paid for all the maintenance charges
              out of the proceeds of plasma component sales.

        ■■    According to the Janakalyan blood bank staff, the -80° C freezer had been
              out of order for more than a year as of the date of the DIR’s visit.136 The
              blood bank sent a request to MSACS and NACO for repairs, but had not
              received any response. All previous maintenance visits prior to the equip-
              ment breakdown were made by various local servicing companies at the
              expense of the blood bank.

        ■■    The equipment files at the Cuttack Central Red Cross blood bank in Orissa
              also showed that AMC obligations had not been carried out on either of its
              freezers since their installation. The OSACS asked NACO as late as March
              2007—six years after the delivery of the freezers—to clarify the status of
              the AMC on both contracts. The OSACS also asked to clarify whether it
              should make its own arrangements for the AMC.137 NACO appeared not
              to have taken any action as of the date of the DIR visit.

       Remi Failed to Service Its Blood Bank Refrigerators. Based on its visits to blood
banks that received refrigerators supplied by Remi and the documentation pro-
vided to the DIR, the DIR observed that Remi consistently failed to meet its AMC
and warranty obligations under its contracts.

        ■■    The Rashtrotthana Parishad blood bank experienced delays in servicing of
              the two blood bank refrigerators it received from Remi.138 The blood bank
              had asked Remi as early as May 2004 to replace one of the refrigerators, as
              the problems were affecting the operations of the blood component sepa-
              ration facility.139 However, the problem continued to persist through 2007,
              preventing the blood bank from storing blood during that time.140 At the
              time of the DIR’s visit, this refrigerator was not in service even though the
              AMC period was still in effect.

                              ■■    The staff of the JNM College Hospital in Raipur also reported a lack of
                                    proper servicing on its Remi-supplied refrigerators.141 They could recall
                                    only one visit by Remi’s representative to repair one of the two refrigera-
                                    tors since their installation in 2001. They told the DIR that on other occa-
                                    sions, the breakdowns were fixed by the hospital’s mechanic.

                              ■■    At the Amaravati Civil Hospital in Maharashtra, according to hospital
                                    staff, one of the Remi refrigerators had been out of order since at least
                                    October 2006.142 The lab technician at the facility for the last 10 years could
                                    not recall any visits by Remi after installation of the refrigerators, except
                                    for one visit in early 2004. The DIR could not verify this assertion because
                                    the equipment file did not contain any AMC service reports for either of
                                    the refrigerators.

                             Spectrum Scientific Failed to Service Its Water Bath. Based on its site visits to
                      two blood banks, the DIR observed that Spectrum Scientific failed to comply with
                      its AMC obligations pursuant to a contract for the supply of a water bath, which is
                      used to thaw plasma.

                              ■■    From verbal reports by staff at the Rashtrotthana blood bank and records
                                    from the institution’s equipment file, the DIR learned that a Spectrum
                                    Scientific representative has visited Rashtrotthana only once during the
                                    AMC period for preventive maintenance. Rashtrotthana wrote to Spec-
                                    trum Scientific reminding the company of the conditions of contract to
                                    provide maintenance.143 A third-party firm now carries out the preventive
                                    maintenance and equipment calibration for Rashtrotthana.

                              ■■    Staff at the Amaravati Civil Hospital stated that Spectrum’s representative
                                    only serviced its water bath once a year. From the hospital’s files, the DIR
                                    counted only one AMC visit in 2004 and two visits in 2006. However, the
                                    company appeared to have at least partially fulfilled its AMC obligations,
                                    as hospital staff reported to the DIR that the equipment had rarely broken
                                    down since installation.

                             Care BioMedicals Refused to Honor Maintenance Obligations. The DIR found
                      that one supplier of -80° C freezers, Care BioMedicals, refused to honor its AMC
                      obligations unless it was paid an additional sum. Specifically, the Rashtrotthana
                      Parishad blood bank, which had received a -80° C freezer from Care BioMed-

icals, informed HLL in January 2007 that Care BioMedicals had asked for INR
5,000 before “submitting its proposal for AMC.”144 Clause 2.1 of the Notification of
Award, however, provided for a four-year AMC schedule (after an initial two-year
warranty period) at no cost to the end user.145 Because Rastrotthana’s request for
service fell within this four-year period,146 Care BioMedical’s request for additional
compensation was in direct violation of its contractual obligations. The DIR could
not determine if HLL took any action against the company.

       Disincentive to Honor AMC and Warranty Obligations. The DIR observed that
the manner in which suppliers were paid may have created a disincentive for sup-
pliers to honor their AMC and warranty obligations. The director of the KGMU
Hospital in Lucknow explained that once the PSA made the 90 percent payment of
the contract value to the supplier upon shipment, the supplier had little incentive
to fulfill further obligations, including warranty and the AMC. This was because
the local servicing agents designated by the supplier received the remaining 10
percent of the contract value upon equipment installation—thus, there was no
incentive for either party to attend to its service obligations. The director added
that the five percent performance guarantee that the suppliers were required to
furnish to the PSA upon signing its contract did not serve as a sufficient safeguard
against the risk of poor or non-performance by the suppliers or their agents, as the
cost of the guarantee was already built into the 90 percent upfront payment, and
was easily recovered through the higher cost of equipment.

       5.	 Discrepancies between Invoices and Contract Awards

       The DIR noticed two instances where the amount billed in a contractor’s invoice
did not comport with the contract award.

       Remi Submitted an Invoice with a Unit Price that Exceeded the Contract’s Unit
Price. Based on its review of the records at the Amaravati Civil Hospital, the DIR
observed that Remi invoiced a greater amount for two refrigerators than was spec-
ified in its contract. Specifically, the unit price listed on the invoice Remi submit-
ted to the hospital was INR 77,662 (net of sales tax), while the unit price under its
contract was INR 69,450.147 Thus, for the two refrigerators supplied to the hospital,
Remi appears to have billed an additional INR 16,424 over and above the price it

    According to Rashtrotthana’s records, the freezer was installed on May 10, 2003. The letter of award provides
that the AMC period takes effect 24 months after the date of installation, or 30 months from the date of supply,
whichever is earlier. Assuming that the shorter 24-month period applies here, the AMC period for Care Bio-
Medicals under this contract was May 10, 2005, through May 10, 2009.

                      should have billed under the terms of its contract. Because the DIR did not have
                      access to NTPC’s payment records for this supplier, it could not verify the actual
                      amount billed.

                             Spectrum Scientific Submitted an Invoice with a Unit Price Substantially Less
                      than the Contract’s Unit Price. From its review of the records at Amaravati Civil
                      Hospital, the DIR noted that on an invoice submitted by Spectrum Scientific to the
                      hospital for the supply of a water bath, the unit price listed was INR 15,100 (net of
                      sales tax), despite the fact that the contract unit price was INR 51,000.148 Because
                      the DIR did not have access to NTPC’s payment records for this supplier, it could
                      not verify the actual amount paid.


                      International Procurement of Test Kits and
                      Blood Bank Equipment
                      Based on a review and analysis of contracts for diagnostic test kit and blood bank
                      equipment under the NACP II, the DIR found several indicators of problems in
                      the international procurement process, including, for example, questions as to the
                      procurement and credibility of the PSA, patterns of long delays between the bid
                      opening and the contract award dates, and unusual pricing patterns. The same
                      companies whose goods were found by the DIR to have performed poorly also suc-
                      cessfully participated in many of these problematic procurements. As explained
                      below, these procurement issues might indicate corruption in the procurement
                      process.

                      A.	 Questions as to the Procurement and Credibility of the
                          PSAs
                             The NACP II had two PSAs: NTPC, which was the project’s PSA during 1999
                      to 2005; and HLL, which was the PSA from 2005 until the close of the project.
                      The DIR found that NTPC was awarded its contract for an amount that included
                      additional reimbursable expenses beyond those accounted for in its bid submis-
                      sion, and that a number of companies questioned NTPC’s competency. In addi-
                      tion, the DIR found that HLL may have had a conflict of interest while serving as
                      PSA. Issues of credibility with respect to PSAs might reflect corruption in the PSA
                      selection process, and may have contributed to corruption in the procurements
                      managed by these PSAs.

       Unexplained Reimbursable Expenses in NTPC’s Contract Award and Complaints
as to Its Competency. NTPC appeared to have received unwarranted payments in
its award as a PSA. NTPC submitted, and NACO awarded, a contract to the com-
pany consisting of INR 68.2 million (USD 1.5 million) in lump-sum compensa-
tion, INR 133.3 million (almost USD 3 million) in reimbursable expenses incurred
locally, and a “foreign ceiling” of USD 150,000.149 However, NTPC’s bid submission
had already accounted for reimbursable expenses, so the reimbursable expenses
awarded by NACO—which amounted to more than double the contract’s value—
appeared to be an additional sum over and above the contract award amount.

       With respect to NTPC’s qualification, two witnesses interviewed by the DIR,
including an equipment distributor and a test kit supplier that had participated
in NACP II tenders, questioned NTPC’s competency. The equipment distributor
stated that NTPC lacked knowledge about the equipment to be procured, and were
often educated about the technical specifications by distributors. The test kit sup-
plier described NTPC as not being conversant in medical tests. Moreover, accord-
ing to the Minutes of the Meeting of the Technical Evaluation Committee, NTPC
had past experience on five Bank-supported projects, but did not have any health-
sector or AIDS-related project experience.150 Thus, the selection of NTPC as a PSA
appears to be problematic, both in terms of the payments it received and in terms
of its qualifications.

       Award of Local Contracts to HLL While Serving as PSA. On September 30, 2005,
NACO contracted with HLL to replace NTPC as PSA until March 30, 2006, the
closing date of the NACP II.151 NACO’s selection of HLL raises questions, since
HLL had already been a supplier of goods under the NACP II and since the Bank
had already expressed reservations with the selection of HLL as a PSA. The Bank
had previously asserted that serving as both a procurement agent and a supplier of
goods for the project would amount to a conflict of interest, in violation of Bank
guidelines for selecting consultants.152 Moreover, the Bank had previously recom-
mended terminating HLL in the RCH and Rajasthan Health Systems Develop-

                      ment Projects after an independent assessment found serious deficiencies in the
                      capacity of HLL to perform as a PSA.153

                             An NACP II project team member explained that there was a clear understand-
                      ing that HLL would not receive any Bank-financed contracts while acting as the
                      PSA on the NACP II. The DIR analysis of the NACO-procured contacts confirmed
                      that HLL was not awarded any contracts. Nonetheless, based on local procure-
                      ment information provided by three different SACS (Maharashtra, Karnataka, and
                      Orissa), the DIR determined that HLL won 10 contracts procured locally by the
                      SACS while it was serving as the PSA on NACP II, nine of which were awarded
                      before the project closing date of March 30, 2006.154

                             Thus, the DIR noted issues related to the selection of PSAs under the NACP II
                      that merit further attention.

                      B.	 Indicators of Fraud and Corruption in the Procurement of
                          Test Kits
                             In its review of diagnostic test kit contracts procured by NACO, the DIR noted
                      three indicators of fraud and corruption in the procurement process: (1) patterns
                      of long delays between bid openings and contract awards; (2) apparent avoid-
                      ance of prior-review thresholds; and (3) unusual pricing patterns. In addition, the
                      DIR notes that test kit contract awards were concentrated among a handful of five
                      companies, even though many companies in India appeared to be capable of pro-
                      ducing the test kits—for example, at least 20 diagnostic manufacturers are regis-
                      tered with the Indian Central Drugs Standard Control Organization. The DIR
                      notes that two of the five companies that won test kit contracts, Zhongshan and
                      Span Diagnostics, also exhibited substantial test kit performance problems, as dis-
                      cussed previously in this Chapter.

                             1.	   Patterns of Long Delays between Bid Openings and Contract
                             Awards

                             For the majority of test kit procurements, there was a noticeably long period
                      between the bid opening and the contract award dates. More than 50 percent of
                      contracts took more than 200 days to award. Given that the bid security validity
                      period was generally around 90 days, these 200-plus-day periods were consistently
                      longer than anticipated. While a delay in awarding a contract can be explained by

                      153	
                          Communication from Michael Carter to Mr. G.S. Sandhu, Principal Secretary of Health, Government of

                      154	
                          Among these 10 contracts won by HLL were MDACS/3339 for the supply of condoms, valued at INR
                      8,125,000; and KSAPS/DD-BS/6A/2005-06 for the supply of blood bags, valued at INR 2,964,870.

a host of factors—a lengthy technical evaluation, the need for further documenta-
tion from bidders, etc.—a pattern of consistent delays suggests potential corrup-
tion in the procurement process. Repeated delays provide procurement officials
and bidders time to devise and implement corruption schemes if the officials and
bidders are prone to such actions. These repeated delays in the NACP II merit
closer attention.

       Indeed, the DIR received reports from participating bidders that improper
kickback negotiations took place under the NACP II that may have caused these
long, periodic procurement delays. The DIR learned from a confidential test kit
supplier that the NACP II bidding process often involved “following up” by the
bidder after the bid opening in order to lobby for the contract. The witness claimed
that NACO frequently contacted companies with which it had good relationships
for what it called “bid clarifications” after the bid opening, but before the technical
evaluations. According to the witness, this was the bidder’s opportunity to try to
influence contract awards. An equipment supplier also mentioned such “negotia-
tions” in the process before the award of contract that sometimes involved “going
back and forth.” These witnesses stated that final payments were made to officials
only when the contract was certain. These statements further suggest that the pro-
curement delays observed by the DIR are the result of fraud and corruption.

       2.	 Avoidance of Prior-Review Thresholds

       In a number of tenders procured by NTPC, the DIR observed what appeared
to be split purchasing, which occurs when a quantity of goods and services are
divided or not consolidated for the purpose of evading a threshold limit or com-
petitive-bidding requirement. The DIR’s analysis showed that the cumulative value
of the separate schedules within six test kit packages procured by NTPC amounted
to more than USD 300,000—the amount that triggers prior review by the Bank—
and that one of these packages was valued at over USD 1 million.155 NTPC divided
five of these packages into multiple contracts that were each valued at less than
USD 300,000, and the Bank prior reviewed contracts from two of these packages.
The necessity for splitting these packages appeared questionable because an earlier
Bank-financed procurement (IFB 1-1) and later non-Bank-financed procurements
(IFB 32, Schedules 1–8, and IFB 34) were not consolidated. There was no informa-
tion available to the DIR to verify whether the Bank had approved the breakdown
of these packages into multiple contracts below the prior-review threshold, though


155	
       The six schedules were IFBs 10, 15, 20, 21, 23, and 24. IFB 10 was for USD 1.2 million.

                         Unusual Correlation between Zhongshan’s Bid Prices and the Cost Estimate. The
                      DIR observed a highly unusual pattern in the bid prices submitted by Zhongshan
                      for IFB 24, under which it won four of the eight schedules. Except for Schedule I,
                      Zhongshan’s US dollar bid prices were numerically identical to the Indian rupee
                      cost estimates divided by 100. Table 15 shows Zhongshan’s bid price against the
                      INR cost estimate.

       This consistently unusual relationship between Zhongshan’s bid and the cost
estimate suggests that the company may have communicated with procurement
officials before it submitted its bid and before the cost estimate was made public.
This finding indicates possible fraud and corruption in the procurement process.

C.	Indicators of Fraud and Corruption in the Procurement of
    Blood Bank Equipment
       The DIR observed the following indicators of fraud and corruption in its review
of blood bank equipment contracts: (1) low bid submission rates; (2) the awarding of
a contract at an inflated price; (3) unusual pricing patterns; and (4) preferential treat-
ment accorded to certain bidders by the PSA. As was the case with diagnostic-test-kit
procurements, two companies whose equipment performed poorly or was not prop-
erly serviced—Nuaire and Remi—won contracts in these problematic procurements.

       The DIR also notes that three equipment suppliers received the majority of con-
tracts in the NACP II: Kendro Laboratory Products India (P) Ltd. (Kendro) for
refrigerated centrifuges, Remi for blood-bank refrigerators, and Nuaire for -40° C
and -80° C deep freezers. These three companies were awarded a combined total of
13 contracts to supply 454 units of equipment, amounting to USD 2.1 million, with
each company winning the vast majority of contracts under the procurements for
its respective good. While a limited number of companies winning the majority
of contracts for a particular good can have a legitimate explanation, the virtual
monopolization by Remi, Nuaire, and Kendro of the tenders for their respective
goods seems unusual and merits further review.

                             1.	 Low Bid Submission Rates and High Non-responsive Rates

                             The bid submission rate is the rate at which companies that purchased bid-
                      ding documents submit bids. The non-responsive rate is the rate at which com-
                      panies that actually submitted bids are declared non-responsive by the contract-
                      ing authority. Low bid submission rates and high non-responsive rates can be
                      indicative of collusive arrangements, with non-cooperating bidders either being
                      dissuaded from submitting bids or being eliminated from consideration by the
                      contracting authority for a variety of technical reasons. The three centrifuge con-
                      tracts won by Kendro, the two refrigerator contracts won by Remi, and the two
                      freezer contracts won by Nuaire exhibited unusually low bid submission rates and
                      the exclusion of otherwise qualified bidders. While a low bid submission rate can
                      be expected on procurements of highly technical goods, the equipment procured
                      in these tenders—refrigerators and freezers—is not complex enough to warrant
                      such low bid submission rates, and thus indicates collusive arrangements.

                             Schedules Awarded to Kendro. Kendro was awarded three contracts to supply
                      a total of 88 refrigerated centrifuges totaling USD 1.3 million between 2000 and
                      2003.156 Although at least 14 bidders purchased the bidding documents on each of
                      the tenders, each time less than 20 percent of the bidders who purchased the bid-
                      ding documents actually submitted a bid. The procurements also exhibited high
                      non-responsive rates. The bid submission and non-responsive rates for three con-
                      tracts won by Kendro are outlined in Table 16.

                             The limited number of bidders on these tenders may have been a function of
                      restrictive technical specifications. For example, although the technical specifica-

                         These were CW9213/NACO/IFB-02/A/Item I, CW9213/NACO/IFB-17/Schedule I, and CW9213/NACO/

tions for IFB 2A-1 were subsequently amended, the Bid Evaluation Committee
(BEC) stated that “it is not expected to have better competitive bidding in case of
re-tendering with same specifications as there are only few manufacturers who can
meet this specification.”157 Prospective bidders on IFB 2A-1 queried the techni-
cal specifications, raising doubts as to the conventionality of the specifications as
stated in the bidding documents. Another bidder claimed that the specifications
were designed such that “all manufacturers except one specific German manufac-
turer should be specifically disqualified on specifications.”158

       Schedules Awarded to Remi. There were two contracts awarded to Remi for the
supply of 204 units (102 per contract) of blood-bank refrigerators.159 Both con-
tracts won by Remi had low bid submission rates of approximately 30 percent,
and high non-responsive rates of more than 50 percent, as indicated in Table 17.160
Again, such findings might merit further attention.

       Schedules Awarded to Nuaire. There were two contracts awarded to Nuaire in
October 2000 for 84 units of -40° C and -80° C deep freezers totaling USD 489,972.
Both procurements exhibited low bid submission rates and high non-responsive
rates. In both contracts, all of the bidders were eliminated except for Nuaire, which
did not submit the lowest bid price. The reasons for disqualifying other bidders
included insufficient bid guarantees, inadequate warranty periods, and non-com-
pliance with the technical specifications.161 The bid submission and non-respon-
sive rates on these contracts are illustrated in Table 18.

                         The presence of an apparent pattern of low bid submission rates and high non-
                      responsive rates suggests underlying problems in the procurement process.

                         2.	 Contract Awarded to Nuaire at Inflated Price

                         By comparing the unit prices on a freezer contract awarded to Nuaire in 2000 to
                      the unit prices on contracts awarded to other suppliers in 2002 and 2004, the DIR
                      observed that Nuaire may have been awarded the contract in 2000 at an inflated
                      price. Specifically, in 2000, NTPC awarded Nuaire a contract under IFB 2A-3 for
                      42 -40° C deep freezers at a unit price of INR 318,768 (USD 7,083); in 2002 and
                      2004 however, other suppliers were awarded contracts for significantly fewer -40°
                      C freezers at unit prices 23 percent (in the case of the 2002 contract) and five per-
                      cent (in the case of the 2004 contract) less than the unit price on Nuaire’s contract.
                      These lower prices were achieved despite inflation and despite the significantly
                      lesser quantities procured, raising questions as to the competitiveness of the pro-
                      curement for the contract won by Nuaire.

                         3.	 Unusual Pricing Patterns

                         As in its review of procurements for diagnostic test kits, the DIR detected an
                      unusual pricing pattern in a procurement for blood bank equipment. On IFB 2A-3,
                      which was awarded to Nuaire for the supply of -40° C deep freezers, an analysis
                      of the differential between the cost estimate and bid prices shows that the bidders
                      that submitted bids below the cost estimate were all disqualified, while the bidder
                      that submitted a bid close to the cost estimate was awarded the contract. This vari-
                      ance between the bid price and the cost estimate is illustrated in Figure 3.




                                                                    378

       The DIR observes that it is an unlikely coincidence that Nuaire submitted a bid
that was almost identical to the cost estimate and was awarded the contract.

       4.	 Preferential Treatment Accorded to Particular Bidders by NTPC

       The DIR found instances where NTPC appeared to have given preferential
treatment to certain bidders.

       Last-minute Change to Annual Maintenance Contract Obligations of Nuaire.
According to the BER, Nuaire submitted AMC prices for four years of service for
the contracts it won.162 The pre-award minutes, however, indicate that this four-year
requirement was changed to two years.163 This AMC period change was reflected in
the Letter of Award.164 It was unclear whether this change was initiated by Nuaire
or NTPC. However, the DIR notes that if Nuaire had proposed a two-year AMC
rather than a four-year AMC in its original bid submission, it should have been
disqualified for non-compliance with the bid specifications.

                             Reduction of Kendro’s AMC Obligations after Award of Contract. The DIR
                      observed that NTPC informed at least two blood banks—Amaravati Civil Hospi-
                      tal blood bank and the Cuttack Central Red Cross blood bank—that AMC service
                      visits by Kendro would be made every six months, as opposed to quarterly visits as
                      required by the Letter of Award.165 NTPC offered no explanation for this reduction
                      in Kendro’s AMC obligation. This change in requirements suggests favored treat-
                      ment in the procurement process.

                             Failure of Remi to Adjust Its Contract Price after Switching to Less Expensive Compo-
                      nents. In the minutes of the post-bid discussions for IFB 17-5 (under which Remi won
                      a contract to supply 102 refrigerators), Remi stated that, although its bid price included
                      the use of imported components, it could not ultimately include such components
                      because of importation difficulties.166 However, because of a lack of any further docu-
                      mentation, the DIR could not determine whether Remi ever provided NTPC with an
                      adjusted price reflecting the use of local components. The DIR notes that it appeared
                      that no such adjustment had been made, as the contract price in the Notification of
                      Award for IFB 17-5 was the same as Remi’s bid with the imported components.167 Thus,
                      it appears that Remi received favored treatment in the award of contracts.


                      Local Procurement of Test Kits and
                      Blood Bank Equipment
                             Because much of the procurement under NACP II was decentralized by NACO
                      to the SACS, the DIR reviewed the local procurement by the SACS of test kits and
                      blood-bank equipment. These local procurements were performed using either
                      NCB, national shopping, local shopping,168 or direct contracting procurement
                      methods. Local and national shopping are particularly susceptible to fraud and cor-
                      ruption because companies are invited by the SACS to submit quotations, thereby
                      limiting competition from the outset. In line with this concern, the DIR found
                      indicators of fraud and corruption in the vast majority of contracts it reviewed.

A.	 Summary of Findings
       Based on the information provided to the DIR, a total of 1,473 contracts169
for a value of INR 243 million (USD 5.4 million) were issued by the SACS and
Regional Circles in Maharashtra, Orissa, and Karnataka.170 The DIR reviewed 217
contracts valued at INR 119 million (USD 2.7 million), and found that 178 of them
(equivalent to 82 percent) had one or more indicators of fraud and corruption for
a total value of INR 105 million (USD 2.4 million), equivalent to 89 percent of the
value of the contracts reviewed. DIR findings in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa,
and Chhattisgarh indicate an elevated risk to local procurement funds. This risk
appears to have gone undetected by the Bank’s traditional supervision methods
and procurement post-reviews.

       Table 19 summarizes the number and value of the contracts reviewed by the
DIR in each location, the number and value of contracts in each location that were
associated with indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices, and the overall per-
centage of such contracts in terms of both number and value, as compared against
the universe of contracts reviewed.

                             1.	 Similarities in Language and Presentation in Competing Bids

                             In Nagpur, the DIR identified five contracts where bidders’ quotations dem-
                      onstrated strong similarities.172 In particular, the DIR found similarities in quo-
                      tations for contracts ultimately awarded to Gayatri Medicals Amaravati, Kiran
                      Agencies Nagpur, Chandrashekhar Agencies Amaravati, Priest Pharma. Amara-
                      vati, and Adroit Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. For example, quotations submitted by
                      Priest Pharma and Gayatri for the same contract contained a very similar item-
                      listing template and use of the same introductory sentence (and punctuation):
                      “with reference to your above letter we are pleased to quote our lowest possible
                      rates for supply of following items,” and the same closing sentence (and punctua-
                      tion): “Quoted rates are nett [sic] and inclusive of all taxes and FOR Nagpur.” The
                      DIR views it to be highly unlikely that the quotations of non-cooperating bidders
                      would exhibit identical language and punctuation.

                      or imported into the DIR database were assigned a WBCN that, in combination with the project acronym, is
                      a unique and standard identifier for each contract. For each WBCN where indicators were identified, the DIR

tific Corp. was awarded three contracts and Star Diagnostic Vasai one. The DIR
found that Sameer Scientific Corp. and Star Diagnostic Vasai share the same fax
number and Star Diagnostic Vasai’s envelope address shows the same street name
as Sameer Scientific Corp.’s address. The review team also found that Tirupati
Sales Corp. and Balaji Surgical share the same phone number. Other contract files
showed links between these companies, such as indicators that Star Diagnostic
Vasai designated Sameer Scientific Corp. and Tirupati Sales Corp. as its authorized
agents. These links are illustrated in Figure 4:

       Tirupati Sales Corp., Balaji Medical, Sameer Scientific Corp., and Star Diag-
nostic Vasai competed for numerous NACP II contracts. Data provided by the
Regional Circle showed 25 contracts for INR 1,698,850 (USD 37,752) in which
all four companies competed, and an additional 52 contracts for the value of
INR 2,449,305 (USD 54,429) in which Balaji Medical, Sameer Scientific Corp.,
and Star Diagnostic Vasai competed against each other between September 2000
and July 2003. The total amount for these 77 contracts is INR 4,148,155, equal to
USD 92,181.174




   Out of these 77 contracts, the review team analyzed seven contracts, namely WBCNs 10354, 12886, 12159,

                             The DIR identified eight contracts out of 27 indicating the use of incorrect
                      procurement methods, i.e., use of direct contracting or rate contracting175 instead
                      of local shopping.176 The value of these contracts is INR 1,364,902 (USD 30,330),
                      equal to 23.5 percent of the value of all contracts reviewed, and equal to 37 percent
                      of the 17 contracts with indicators.

                             Nasik Regional Circle contract data indicated that 114 local shopping contracts
                      were issued between December 1999 and August 2006, for total value of INR 7.5
                      million (USD 166,845). The DIR reviewed 25 contracts valued at INR 2.8 million
                      (USD 63,172) and found that 18 contracts (72 percent by number) had one or more
                      indicators, for a total value of INR 2.1 million (USD 46,715) (74 percent by value).

                             In Nasik, the DIR found identical formatting, calculations, spelling errors, or
                      abbreviation form in two or more quotation on 18 out of 25 contracts reviewed.177

                          Rate contracting is used under the Government of India’s procurement rules, whereby at the beginning of
                      a period (typically the financial year), the government officials solicit quotations from suppliers. The selected
                      contractor then agrees to supply the quantities that the officials may call for at a given rate.

The value of these contracts is INR 2.1 million (USD 46,715), equal to 74 percent
of the value of all 25 contracts reviewed.

       For example, the review team observed a number of similarities—such as
similar bid formats and identical phone numbers—in the quotations submitted
by Mohini Sales Corporation, Balaji Surgical, and Sameer Scientific Corp.178 In
addition, Balaji Surgical and Sameer Scientific Corp. have additional links to Star
Diagnostic Vasai and to Tirupati Sales Corp. These five companies participated
in 59 contracts for the supply of hospital and laboratory items. The links among
these five companies are set out in Figure 5.

       In addition, the DIR found indicators of affiliation among bidders in three
contracts for the supply of test kits.179 For example, Biolab Diagnostics (I) Pvt.
Ltd. and Biotron Laboratories submitted quotations under all these contracts, and
Biolab was awarded WBCN 11908. The DIR found a letter by Biolab indicating
that Biotron was authorized to supply its orders and to collect payments. The pro-
curement file also contained a delivery certificate issued by Biotron for the items
awarded under the contract to Biolab.

                             Bidding for Same Contract

                             The DIR identified eight contracts where companies submitting quotations
                      under the same contract were linked to each other by the same phone number.180
                      Under five of the eight contracts where bidders shared the same phone number,
                      bidders were also found to share the same address.181 These contracts were valued
                      at INR 721,937 (USD 16,043), equal to 25 percent of the value of all 25 contracts
                      reviewed and 34 percent of the value of the 18 contracts with identified indicators.
                      For example, under WBCN 10789, the bid documents for Biolab Diagnostics and
                      Biotron Laboratories showed the same phone number, 8088243.

                      D.	 Pune Regional Circle (Maharashtra)
                             The DIR team reviewed 47 contracts at the Pune Regional Circle, valued at INR
                      20.3 million (equivalent to USD 450,010). The review found indicators in 35 out
                      of 47 contracts (74.5 percent by number and 87.5 percent by value). The DIR notes
                      that a significant proportion of the contracts reviewed were sought by companies
                      whose quotations exhibited substantial similarities in language and presentation,
                      decreasing the likelihood that this oddity was merely overlooked by Regional Cir-
                      cle officials.

                             The frequency of indicators found in the contracts with indicators is set out in

       Examples of some of the indicators observed at the Pune Regional Circle are
discussed below:

       1.	 Similarities in Language and Presentation in Competing Bids

       The DIR identified 33 Pune contracts out of 47 where quotations from different
bidders had strong similarities.182 These contracts were valued at INR 15.2 million
(USD 337,887), equal to 75 percent of the value of all 47 contracts reviewed and 86
percent of the value of the 35 contracts with identified indicators.

       2.	 Contracts Awarded to a Company that Was Not a Bidder

       The review team found instances of contract awards to contractors that were
not invited to submit quotations and that did not actually submit quotations. On
September 21, 2002, the following five companies were invited to submit quota-
tions for 14 contracts183: Sameer Scientific Corp., Balaji Surgical, Mohini Sales
Corporation, Biolab Diagnostics, and Harmony Biomedicals. However, all 14 con-
tracts were awarded to Star Diagnostics Vasai despite the fact that the request for
quotation (RFQ) did not indicate that Star Diagnostics Vasai was invited to submit
quotations. Further, a comparative statement created by the Pune Regional Circle
for 17 blood bank items lists only Sameer Scientific Corp., Balaji Surgical, and
Mohini Sales Corporation as having submitted bids.

       3.	 Unit Rates Quoted by Bidders Were Related to a Common
       Formula

       The DIR identified five instances in which companies submitted quotations
where the unit rates quoted appeared to be related to a common formula.184 These
contracts were valued at INR 6.9 million (USD 154,755), equal to 34 percent of
the value of all 47 contracts reviewed and 39 percent of the value of the 35 con-
tracts with identified indicators. For example in the case of WBCN 11102, the DIR
found that rates quoted by the first three bidders—Balaji Surgical, Sameer Scien-
tific Corp., and Mohini Sales Corporation—increased in common increments of
INR 0.40, as set out in Table 24.

                             The DIR also analyzed the 47 contracts to identify instances where particular
                      companies appeared to be winning the overwhelming majority of contracts.185 The
                      analysis showed that Star Diagnostic Vasai and J. Mitra & Co. Ltd. (J. Mitra) were
                      awarded the vast majority of blood bag contracts from 2002 to 2003. Star Diagnos-
                      tic Vasai was awarded the majority of contracts in 2002, while J. Mitra was awarded
                      the majority of contracts in 2003. Indeed, Star Diagnostic Vasai and J. Mitra won
                      the vast majority of contracts for which they submitted quotations. In contrast,
                      Sameer Scientific bid on 34 contracts and was awarded only two. This analysis is
                      represented in Figure 6.

                          The DIR found that the data supplied were unreliable. Based on the data provided by the DACS, on Sep. 30,
                      2002, Mohini Sales Corporation and Balaji Surgical were awarded seven contracts each, and Sameer Scientific
                      Corp. was awarded two contracts. However, upon verification of the procurement file, the review team found

E.	 The OSACS
   The DIR team reviewed 51 OSACS-procured contracts in Bhubaneswar, Orissa,
valued at INR 21.6 million (equivalent to USD 479,940). The review found one or
more indicators in 44 out of 51 contracts (86 percent by number and 79 percent by
value) for a total value of INR 17 million (equivalent to USD 378,289). Of particu-
lar prevalence at the OSACS were inadequate record keeping and unreasonably
long delays between the bid closing and contract award dates.

   The frequency of indicators found in those contracts with indicators is set out
in Table 25.

   Examples of some of the indicators observed at the OSACS are discussed
below:

   1.	 Inadequate Record Keeping

   The DIR identified 28 contracts out of 51 where key documents—such as quo-
tations, RFQs, evaluation sheets, and comparative statements—were not in the
procurement file. The value of these contracts is INR 9.7 million (USD 216,850),




                                            391
India DIR (NACP II)


                      equal to 45 percent of the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 57 percent of the
                      value of the 44 contracts with identified indicators.

                             2.	 Inter-bidder and Intra-bidder Unit Prices Vary Substantially

                             The DIR identified 12 contracts where the unit prices offered by competing
                      bidders varied dramatically and/or the unit prices submitted by the same bidder
                      for the same item differed substantially across contracts.186 The value of these con-
                      tracts is INR 2.4 million (USD 53,104), equal to 11 percent of the value of all 51
                      contracts reviewed and 14 percent of the value of the 44 contracts with identified
                      indicators. An example of competing bidders offering substantially different unit
                      prices for the same item is set out in Table 26.

                      submitted by the same bidder for the same item differed dramatically across con-
                      tracts. This is set out in Table 27.

       3.	 Sequentially Numbered Bid Securities Issued by the Same Bank
       on the Same Date Presented by Separate Companies

       An indicator of collusion is the presence of sequentially numbered bid secu-
rities issued by the same bank on the same date and submitted under the same
contract by competing companies. The DIR identified six Bhubaneswar contracts
out of 51 possessing this indicator valued at INR 1.4 million (USD 30,828), equal
to 6.4 percent of the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 8 percent of the value of
the 44 contracts with identified indicators.187 For example, an examination of files
for five contracts for the supply of HIV kits showed that two companies submitted
sequential bid securities as shown in Table 28.

                             Dates

                             The DIR identified 23 contracts of 51 where there appeared to be an unrea-
                      sonable delay between the date of bid closing and the date of contract award. The
                      value of these contracts is INR 7.6 million (USD 169,834), equal to 35 percent of
                      the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 45 percent of the value of the contracts
                      with identified indicators.188 Examples of these unreasonable delay periods are set
                      out in Table 29.

                             5.	 Inadequate Advertising

                             The DIR team observed that the OSACS may have inadequately advertised
                      eight out of 51 contracts. The value of these eight contracts is INR 1.4 million
                      (USD 31,552), equal to 6.6 percent of the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 8.3
                      percent of the value of the 44 contracts with identified indicators.189

                             For example, for WBCNs 12463, 11898, 10794, and 10649 for the supply of
                      office stationery, the OSACS placed only one tender notice in English in “one lead-
                      ing Oriya daily” on May 30, 2005.190 There were a number of aspects to this notice
                      that may have limited the response by bidders. First, the procurement method was

                      11898, 14045, 10745, 14213, 10865, 10001, 12727, 13378, and 13638.
                      189	
                             WBCNs 15031, 12473, 12114, 10009, 12463, 11898, 10794, and 10649.
                      190	
                           From the procurement file, the DIR identified the newspaper as The Samaya, which is printed in Oriya only.
                      The tender notice failed to specify the procurement method, but requested a bid security of four percent, giving
                      the impression that this tender was following NCB procedures.



                                                                            394
                                                                       Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


not identified in the tender notice. Second, publication in an Orissa daily paper
written in the Oriya language would not reach a national-level audience. Third,
because the OSACS wrote the notice in English, it was also less likely to be read
by local companies in Orissa, as Oriya is the predominant language there. Finally,
the tender notice states that the list of items to be procured could only be obtained
from the OSACS office between 4 PM and 5 PM “of any working days.”

       6.	 Contract Splitting

       The DIR team identified four groups of contracts—totaling 12 out of the 51
that were reviewed by the DIR in Orissa—where contracts for the same items were
awarded to the same contractors around the same time. The value of these 12 con-
tracts is INR 2.4 million (USD 53,104), equal to 11 percent of the value of the
contracts reviewed and 14 percent of the value of the 44 contracts with identified
indicators.191

       For example, the OSACS awarded three contracts within a three-month span—
two of which were awarded within two days of each other—to the same contractor
(Sayoni Cuttack) for the supply of the same goods.192 The total amount for these
contracts was USD 42,556, which is above the USD 30,000 threshold established
by the Credit Agreement for local shopping. Individually, however, all of the con-
tracts were less than USD 30,000. It should be noted, though, that this was the only
group of contracts with a total value that exceeded the local shopping threshold.

       7.	 Inappropriately Low Number of Bidders

       The Bank’s Procurement Guidelines require that a minimum of three bidders
participate in local-shopping procurements. 193 The DIR identified eight contracts
out of 51 where only one or two bidders participated in procurements for off-the-
shelf drugs and test kits. The value of these eight contracts is INR 4.8 million (USD
107,004), equal to 22 percent of the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 28 per-
cent of the value of the 44 contracts with identified indicators.194

       8.	 Incorrect Method of Procurement

       The project agreement allows for direct contracting if the goods supplied will
cost USD 5,000 or less. The DIR identified five contracts out of 51 where direct

                      contracting had been utilized to purchase goods valued at more than USD 5,000.195
                      The value of these five contracts is INR 3.2 million (USD 70,466), equal to 15 per-
                      cent of the value of all 51 contracts reviewed and 19 percent of the value of the 44
                      contracts with identified indicators. For example, the OSACS issued a contract to
                      Span Diagnostics on December 18, 2002, for 350 HIV Rapid kits, which appeared
                      to be procured by direct contracting. This contract, valued at INR 537,500 (USD
                      11,946.7), exceeded the USD 5,000 direct-contracting threshold established in the
                      project agreement. In addition, the OSACS issued this contract just six days after
                      awarding a contract, under national shopping, to Span Diagnostics for 50 of the
                      exact same kits at the exact same unit price.196

                             9.	 Favorable Treatment Accorded to a Bidder

                             The DIR found indicators of favorable treatment toward particular contractors.
                      For example, LG Chemical Ltd. (LG Chemical) and J. Mitra were awarded separate
                      contracts for 250 test kits originating from the same tender for the procurement
                      of 500 kits.197 The review of the comparison sheet showed that seven companies
                      submitted quotations: J Mitra, LG Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, Ranbaxy, Sayoni
                      Cuttack, Stimulus Specialty Diagnostic, and Science ‘N’ Science. J. Mitra quoted
                      the lowest price of INR 2,496, while LG Chemical quoted a price of INR 2,527.
                      However, instead of awarding one contract for all 500 kits to J. Mitra, on January
                      10, 2003, the OSACS awarded one contract for 250 kits to J. Mitra, and another
                      contract for 250 kits to LG Chemical at the unit price quoted by J. Mitra.

                      F.	       The KSAPS
                             The DIR team reviewed 53 contracts at the KSAPS in Bangalore, Karnataka,
                      valued at INR 60.8 million (equivalent to USD 1.4 million); 50 out of 53 of these
                      contracts (94 percent by number and 94 percent by value) were found to have one
                      or more indicators, for a total value of INR 57.2 million (equivalent to USD 1.3
                      million). The DIR noted that problems with inadequate record keeping were of
                      particular prevalence at the KSAPS.

                             The frequency of indicators found in the contracts with indicators is set out in
                      Table 30.

       Examples of some of the indicators observed at the KSAPS are discussed
below:

       1.	 Inadequate Record Keeping

       The DIR identified 36 contracts out of 53 where key documents—quotations,
bid securities, comparative statement, and minutes of bid openings—were miss-
ing from the procurement file.198 The lack of such documents seriously hampered
the DIR’s contract review. The value of these contracts is INR 42.6 million (USD
946,729), equal to 70 percent of the value of all 53 contracts reviewed and 74 per-
cent of the value of the 50 contracts with identified indicators.

                             2.	 Sequential Bid Securities Issued by the Same Bank on the Same
                             Date Presented by Separate Companies

                             In Bangalore, the review identified three contracts out of 53 where bidders sub-
                      mitted sequentially numbered bid securities issued by the same bank on the same
                      date.199 The value of these contracts is INR 4.5 million (USD 100,808), equal to
                      seven percent of the value of all 53 contracts reviewed and eight percent of the
                      value of the 50 contracts with identified indicators. These instances are set out in

                      derived from a common formula. For example, as set out in Table 32, bidders for
                      WBCN 11350 for the procurement of nine items of consumables quoted unit rates
                      that appeared to increase in common increments.

      4.	   Substantial Variation in Inter-bidder Unit Price

      The DIR observed substantial variations in the inter-bidder unit prices of com-
peting bids for WBCNs 12800 and 12912, for the procurement of STD drugs.
Contract WBCN 12912 was awarded to Brawn Laboratories Limited (Brawn) for
eight items, while WBCN 12800 was won by Vijay Agencies. These variations are
set out in Table 33.

      Although the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines require a minimum of three bid-
ders for local shopping procurements, the DIR review identified two contracts out

                      of 53 where only one or two bidders submitted bids under local-shopping procure-
                      ments.200 The value of these contracts is INR 5,170,460 (USD 114,899), equal to 8.5
                      percent of the value of all 53 contracts reviewed and nine percent of the value of
                      the 50 contracts with identified indicators. Under these contracts, for the supply
                      of drugs, only two Bangalore companies submitted bids—Mars International and
                      Merrell Pharmaceuticals. The DIR found that two contracts were issued on Janu-
                      ary 18, 2002: the first to Mars International for INR 1,635,776 (USD 36,350); and
                      the second to Merrell Pharmaceuticals for INR 3,534,684 (USD 78,548).

                             6.	 Product Produced by a Different Manufacturer than the One
                             Indicated in Quotation

                             The DIR observed an instance where a winning bidder supplied HIV test kits
                      manufactured by a different company than was indicated in its bid submission.
                      Specifically, the KSAPS awarded a contract for the supply of HIV Rapid test kits to
                      Eswari Pharmaceuticals, which had indicated in its quotation that the kits were to
                      be manufactured by J. Mitra and had supplied an authorization by J. Mitra to the
                      same effect. However, the DIR found that Eswari Pharmaceuticals’ invoice stated
                      that the manufacturer for the test kits was Bio Inc.

                      G.	 The CGSACS
                             The DIR team reviewed 14 contracts at the CGSACS in Raipur, Chhattisgarh,
                      valued at INR 7.4 million (equivalent to USD 164,516), all of which were found to
                      have one or more indicators. Of these 14 contracts, eight had been post-reviewed
                      by the Bank.201 The DIR also visited some of the companies and was able to collect
                      additional information, such as admissions of affiliations among companies.

                             The frequency of indicators found in the contracts with indicators is set out in

   Examples of some of the indicators observed at the CGSACS are discussed
below:

   1.	 Affiliations among Bidders

   The DIR noted that Anil Medical & General Stores—which won the largest
value of contracts from the CGSACS between 2002 and 2006—Fair Enterprises, A.J.
Enterprises, and Muskan Medical Agencies appeared to consistently participate in
the same procurements and submitted bid documents that featured many similari-
ties. For example, under PO AIDS/CGSACS/PO/2005/23, two out of four bidders,
A.J. Enterprises and Fair Enterprises, appeared to share a common address at Kes-
wani Complex, 1st Street, Telibandha, Raipur; while Fair Enterprises and Muskan
Medical Agencies listed the same office telephone number (0771-2226527). The
DIR visited the listed address for A.J. Enterprises and Fair Enterprises and found
that there was no office for Fair Enterprises. Mr. Jagdish Keswani of A.J. Enter-
prises told the DIR that A.J. Enterprises and Fair Enterprises were the same com-
pany. When the DIR visited the offices of Muskan Medical Agencies, its proprietor,
Mr. Sunil Nihichlani, told the DIR that he is the cousin of Anil Nihichlani, whose
brother is the proprietor of Anil Medical & General Stores. These relationships are
set out in Figure 7:

                             2.	 Contract Values Identical/Close to the Cost Estimate

                             The DIR found that contract values awarded were identical or nearly identical
                      to the cost estimate in nine contracts, eight of which were post-reviewed by the
                      Bank.202 For seven out of the eight contracts post-reviewed by the Bank, the differ-
                      ential between the contract prices and the cost estimates was less than two percent;
                      four of the eight were 0.1 percent from the cost estimate; and on one contract the
                      contract price was identical to the cost estimate. Moreover, for the contract where
                      the total contract price was identical to the cost estimate,203 the unit prices for all
                      seven items quoted by the winning bidder, Central Scientific, were identical to the
                      CGSACS estimates, as set out in Table 35.

       3.	 Goods Supplied Not in Accordance with Specifications

       The DIR examined the documentation relating to purchase order number
AIDS/CGSACS/PO/2005/17 and found that the CGSACS had purchased HIV
Rapid test kits from Anil Medical & General Stores that did not meet the con-
tract’s specifications. A condition of the contract was that all test kits should have
a minimum shelf life of 11 months at the time of delivery. Yet Anil’s invoice to the
CGSAC showed that the 1,410 Antigen II kits (70,500 tests) had only five months
left before their expiration date. 204



       Case Study 1. Indicators of Fraudulent and Corrupt Practices on
       Local Contracts Won by Monozyme India Ltd.

       Based on its examination of the two local procurements under which the MDACS
       awarded contracts to Monozyme, the DIR found three indicators of possible fraud:
       (1) MDACS awarded Monozyme the first contract despite the fact that Monozyme’s
       bid appeared to be non-compliant with the contract’s technical specifications; (2)
       Monozyme submitted an apparently fraudulent document in its bid under the
       first procurement; and (3) under the second procurement, the MDACS apparently
       awarded Monozyme the contract despite another company’s submission of a lower-
       priced bid for the exact same product.

       Monozyme’s Submission Appeared to Be Non-compliant with the Technical Specifications

           The first contract won by Monozyme was under a tender issued by the MDACS
       on September 20, 2003, to procure HIV 3rd Rapid tests. Monozyme submitted a bid
       on behalf of Standard Diagnostics to supply SD Bioline HIV 1/2 Rapid test kits. Per
       NACO’s instructions in an earlier letter to the SACS, the HIV 3rd Rapid tests could
       not be a type of Rapid test known as “immunochromatographic” Rapid tests. SD
       Bioline HIV 1/2, however, is an immunochromatographic Rapid test. In addition,
       although Monozyme submitted a bid for Standard Diagnostics’ HIV Rapid test kits,
       the DIR found that Monozyme’s bid largely contained technical information per-
       taining to Standard Diagnotics’ HIV ELISA test kits.

       Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Submitted by Monozyme Appeared
       to Be Fraudulent

           There were a number of indicators of fraud with respect to the GMP certifi-
       cate submitted by Monozyme under the September 20, 2003, tender. First, there
       was no validity period on the certificate. Second, the document did not carry the
                                                                                             Continued

                      Project Reports and Assessments
                      The DIR reviewed the project’s reports and assessments (i.e., aides-mémoire, the
                      ICR, procurement post-reviews, and SOE financial reviews). These documents
                      and reports were reviewed for the purposes of assessing: (1) whether and when the
                      Bank was aware of the indicators identified by the DIR and (2) whether and when
                      the Bank responded to the problems it identified.

                      A.	 Oversight of NGOs
                         The Bank’s supervision missions generally identified NGO performance as the
                      key implementation weakness under the NACP II. For example, in its 2003 Mid-
                      Term Review, despite assigning a “satisfactory” rating to both implementation
                      and development objectives, the Bank communicated a concern that the key com-
                      ponent of the NACP II—targeting high-risk groups through NGO-led interven-
                      tions—was not being sufficiently implemented. The aides-mémoire reasoned that,
                      despite a six-fold increase in NGO projects since the NACP II’s inception, it was
                      “unclear” whether the NGOs were actually reaching the high-risk groups. Coupled
                      with the previously raised concern that many of the NGOs had “weak capacity”
                      and “no experience working on HIV/AIDS,” the Bank became concerned whether




                                                                 404
                                                                      Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


“project activities were taking place as planned.”205 In addition, the Bank deter-
mined that many SACS had vacant monitoring and evaluation officer positions
and performed inadequate and infrequent field visits, and thus lacked insight into
the quality of NGO services.206

       With respect to the financial management of NGOs, the Bank did not appear to
identify the absence of controls at the SACS to monitor and track disbursements
to NGOs until late in the project’s life. Specifically, in its review of SOEs from vari-
ous SACS conducted from June 2005 through 2006, the Bank identified serious
financial control weaknesses in a number of SACS. In Chhattisgarh, for example,
the Bank noted that auditing procedures were “extremely poor,” and that expendi-
tures and cash advances were not accompanied by supporting documentation or
evidence of authorization. The Bank also noted that two NGOs that had been per-
forming services for the CGSACS—SROUT and Atal Shishu Avam Mahila Kalyan
Shiksha Samiti—had been making payments for medical supplies in cash, contrary
to NACO’s guidelines,207 which hampered the SACS’ ability to discern whether the
NGOs were using project funds for proper purposes.208 Following its review of the
SOEs from the CGSACS—and after the NACP II had closed—the Bank recom-
mended to NACO that the SACS undertake a number of financial reforms, such as
the appointment of an auditor to review and verify NGO expenditures.209

       The Bank identified quite early on the inability of the SACS to monitor NGO
performance, and the resultant lack of information on NGO effectiveness. How-
ever, there was only minimal information available to the DIR to verify whether
any follow-up action was taken by the Bank to resolve these problems. In addition,
it did not appear to the DIR that the Bank considered the possibility that NGO
performance problems may have been caused by fraudulent or corrupt practices.

       Regarding the financial management of NGOs, even though much of the pro-
curement under the NACP II was decentralized to the SACS (primarily for the pro-
curement of NGOs), it was not until the latter stages of the project that the Bank
appeared to closely review the SACS’ financial management procedures. Instead,
the Bank’s review of financial management under NACP II appeared to primarily

                      focus on NACO. However, the DIR notes that the Bank has highlighted the finan-
                      cial management of NGOs as key reform to be instituted in the NACP III.

                      B.	 Implementation of Contracts
                             The Bank’s supervision reports devoted limited attention to the performance of
                      the goods supplied to blood banks and VCTCs, which were the recipients of the
                      diagnostic test kits and blood bank equipment procured under the NACP II. To
                      the extent this aspect of the NACP II was evaluated, the Bank appeared to focus
                      primarily on the number of such facilities being built.210 It was only in its 2003
                      Mid-Term Review that the Bank noted test kit and blood bank equipment quality
                      problems. Specifically, the Bank found that “[m]uch of the equipment procured
                      during Phase I of the project are unused because of poor maintenance,” and that
                      the “SACS are procuring test kits through local purchases which can adversely
                      influence quality and cost of the kits used in the program.”211 Thus, the problems
                      identified by the DIR—i.e., that test kits and blood bank equipment were not being
                      timely delivered and maintained, and that some of the goods were of substandard
                      quality—were accorded only limited attention by the Bank.

                      C.	 Procurement of Test Kits and Blood Bank Equipment
                             Throughout its supervision of the NACP II, the Bank identified many of the
                      same procurement problems observed by the DIR and reiterated those finding in
                      its ICR. In its 2003 Mid-Term Review, the Bank was primarily concerned with the
                      delays in the procurement process and rated procurement as “unsatisfactory.”212 In
                      its 2005 review of the project, the Bank noted that procurement delays persisted
                      under NACP II, and advised that procurements—most of which did not require
                      the Bank’s prior review—“should be expedited” in order to qualify for Bank fund-
                      ing before the project’s March 31, 2006 closing date.213 The Bank also expressed
                      particular concern about the hiring of HLL as the project’s PSA because it was
                      under investigation for fraudulent and corrupt practices under a previous Bank
                      project.214 In 2006, concerns about procurement delays—such as excessively long
                      bid validity periods and the length of time from bid closing to contract award—
                      were reiterated again by the Bank, which attributed these delays to a lack of capac-

ity at NACO and the SACS.215 The Bank also noted a number of procurement
deficiencies in its post review of local contracts. For example, in its post review
of contracts procured by the CGSACS in Chhattisgarh, the Bank found that the
CGSACS, in some instances, did not maintain adequate records, used incorrect
procurement methods, and allowed an insufficient amount of time for bidders to
submit bids. 216

       In general, the Bank’s primary concern with respect to the NACP II procure-
ment appeared to be excessively long delays in awarding contracts, as such delays
hampered the project’s implementation goals. However, the Bank did not appear
to view these delays as a function of possible fraudulent and corrupt practices,
but rather as a function of a lack of capacity by NACO and the SACS. Indeed, one
of the Bank’s recommendations to rectify this problem was simply for NACO to
“expedite” the procurement process. In contrast, the DIR found that these delays
may have either facilitated or been caused by corrupt procurement practices.

             Malaria Control
                 Project

Overview
Project Objective
Malaria is a disease of the poor: 58 percent of malaria deaths occur among the
poorest 20 percent of the world’s population, a higher percentage than any other
disease of major public health importance.1 In Southeast Asia, the greatest num-
ber of malaria cases is found in India, especially in the lowlands and the remote,
inaccessible peripheries of the country.2 To curb malaria, public health experts
advocate attacking the source of the disease—the mosquito infected with the para-
site Plasmodium.3 Vector mosquitoes can be killed by spraying households with
insecticide (individual residual spraying, or IRS) and by treating bed nets with the
insecticide.4

     India began to control malaria using IRS in the 1950s, initially with significant
success.5 But the disease began to resurge in the mid-1960s and, by 1997, India
was suffering from endemic, severe malaria punctuated by occasional epidemics.6
Ten states—Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharash-
tra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh—accounted for 85  percent of
malaria-related deaths and 75 percent of all malaria cases in the country.7

                        To reduce the deaths and losses that malaria was inflicting on India, in 1997
                  the World Bank (the Bank) approved the Malaria Control Project (MCP).8 The
                  project would introduce a better-targeted mix of malaria control methods—such
                  as localized spraying, insecticide-treated bed nets, and early detection and treat-
                  ment systems—to India’s existing National Malaria Eradication Program (NMP),
                  and it would provide capacity-building support to the NMP as it decentralized to
                  the district level and strengthened state-level supervision.9

                        The MCP targeted six of the 10 most affected states (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat,
                  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, and Rajasthan) and two others (Chhattis-
                  garh and Jharkhand).10 It was planned to cost USD 203.9 million, of which 85 per-
                  cent (USD  173.3 million) would be covered by the International Development
                  Association (IDA) Credit and 15 percent (USD 30.6 million) by the Borrower.11


                  Summary of Findings
                  The DIR’s review of the MCP found:

                          1.	 widespread indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices in the award of
                                MCP contracts for insecticides (pyrethroids), bed nets, and pharmaceu-
                                ticals, such as similar bid prices, use of fraudulent documents, and pay-
                                ments to government officials;

                          2.	 indicators of fraudulent and corrupt practices—such as rotation of con-
                                tract winners, bidders with identical phone numbers, and similarities in
                                the text and layout of bids—affecting the award of 73 percent (by volume)
                                and 50 percent (by value) of DIR-reviewed contracts procured through
                                decentralized procurement; and

                          3.	 that the Bank’s project reports and assessments did not fully identify, con-
                                vey, or address the widespread indicators of collusion and fraud affecting
                                the project.

                        The DIR found indicators of widespread corrupt practices in the award of MCP
                  centrally procured contracts, most notably indicators of bid rigging and collusion.
                  The indicators were pervasive throughout the project’s major areas of procurement—

pyrethroids, bed nets, and pharmaceuticals—and persisted for most of the years of
the project. Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited (Nestor) and Pure Pharma Limited
(Pure Pharma), two firms recently debarred by the Bank for collusive practices under
the Reproductive and Child Health Project (RCH), were found to exhibit indicators
of collusive behavior under the MCP. The DIR also found indicators of bid rigging,
payment of bribes, and other forms of fraud and corruption in the bidding process
and award of contracts, including contracts procured centrally by the project’s Pro-
curement Support Agency (PSA) and locally by the project’s various district malaria
offices. The indicators tend to show that fair and open competition for contracts was
adversely harmed and prices, at times, appeared to be inflated.

   In the procurement of pyrethroids, the largest component of the MCP in terms
of dollar value, the DIR found numerous indicators that four firms colluded to
divide more than 90 percent of the value of the contracts among themselves. The
indicators were consistent with those previously recognized by the Bank’s Sanctions
Board to be indicators of collusive behavior, such as the submission of identical bid
prices. There are indicators that suggest that the collusive behavior subverted open
competition, resulted in inflated prices, and likely involved individuals within the
project’s PSA. Noteworthy is the sudden disappearance of these indicators for the
final two pyrethroid tenders, the reasons for which are not entirely clear. The DIR
also found indicators that the Government of India’s Central Insecticide Board
(CIB) may have engaged in corrupt practices in the granting of licenses to sell
pyrethroids in India.

   Similarly, for the procurement of bed nets, the DIR found that five of the seven
suppliers either exhibited indicators of collusive or corrupt behavior or otherwise
performed in a manner that adversely affected project implementation. The DIR
found indicators that a group of four firms bidding for bed net contracts were
interrelated through familial connections and may have colluded (with the help
of two other firms) to receive contracts. It also found numerous indicators of poor
product quality in the bed nets supplied by the firms.

   In the procurement of pharmaceuticals, the DIR found indicators suggesting
that Nestor and Pure Pharma—as found in the RCH investigation—may have col-
luded in order to win the majority of contracts for chloroquine and combi-blister
packs.

   The DIR’s review of contracts procured by two district malaria offices found
widespread indicators of fraud and corruption affecting the procurement of 73
percent of the volume (50 percent of total value) of those two districts’ 50 largest


                                        417

                  contracts. The high indicator rate warrants attention because of the large amount
                  of project funds utilized in this manner (approximately 40 percent of the MCP’s
                  total project funds) and the low level of supervision by both the Borrower and the
                  Bank.

                        Finally, the DIR’s review of the project’s reports and assessments found that
                  the Bank and the Borrower did not fully identify, convey, or address the wide-
                  spread indicators of collusion and fraud affecting the project. Whenever indica-
                  tors of possible fraud or collusion were identified, it is unclear what, if anything,
                  was done by the Bank or Borrower to remedy the situation. More significantly, the
                  Bank’s project supervision systems largely did not detect the probable collusive
                  rings. While the Bank’s final project evaluation was forthright in belatedly not-
                  ing project implementation issues, the Bank’s reliance on epidemiological statistics
                  to evaluate project outcomes meant that the MCP’s overall success rating did not
                  reflect fully the project’s implementation difficulties, which may have been at least
                  partially caused by fraud and corruption.




                  Project Background
                  Project Design

                  A.	 Components
                  The MCP was engaged in malaria prevention, treatment, research, and institu-
                  tional capacity-building. The largest portion of project funds (47  percent) was
                  committed to the preventive selective vector control component, which consisted
                  of selective insecticide spraying in targeted locations and the introduction of envi-
                  ronmentally friendly larvivorous fish.12 To implement this component, the MCP
                  funded insecticides (synthetic pyrethroids), vehicles, and equipment, as well as
                  training, consultant services, and research.13 The MCP also included another,
                  smaller preventive component (six percent of project funds) which consisted of
                  the distribution of insecticide-impregnated mosquito bed nets.14

      The second largest amount of funds (27 percent) was committed to the early
detection and prompt treatment component, which aimed to improve the diagno-
sis and treatment of malaria and other vectorborne diseases.15 To implement this
component, the MCP financed rapid diagnostics kits; drugs such as chloroquine,
combi-blister packs, arteether injections, and diethyl carbamazine citrate (DEC)
tablets; laboratory supplies and equipment; and training and salaries.16

      Most of the goods and drugs purchased for the MCP were widely available
commodities on national and international markets. This allowed the MCP to
utilize international competitive bidding (ICB) or national competitive bidding
(NCB) processes for three-fourths of the project’s funds. These procurements were
administered on behalf of the Government of India by RITES, a government-
owned PSA.17

      The MCP also included components to finance epidemic response (2  per-
cent of total expenditures)18 and institutional strengthening (18  percent of total
expenditures).19 Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the division of expenditures:

                  PSA selected by the Government of India. For all project districts there was a reg-
                  istered entity “the District Malaria Control Society” chaired by the District Mag-
                  istrate which was responsible for the overall project implementation. The district
                  chief medical officer and malaria officer were members of this society.20 The Dis-
                  trict Malaria Offices (DMOs) were responsible for commodity distribution, train-
                  ing and education, and hiring of services.21 Because the DMOs did not exist at the
                  time of project appraisal, the Bank assisted the NMP in identifying, establishing,
                  and training the DMOs for the purposes of implementing the MCP. The NMP was
                  responsible for DMO oversight.22

                  C.	 Project Controls
                        At the time of project approval, the Bank identified several high risks to project
                  success, including: (1) excessive indoor spraying; (2) epidemic outbreaks; (3) the
                  non-use of mosquito nets; and (4) delayed project startup at the district level.23
                  Medium-rated risks included limited community involvement and procurement
                  delays.24 Fraud and corruption were not identified as risks in the Project Appraisal
                  Document (PAD).

                        To ensure proper implementation, the MCP’s design contained a system of con-
                  trols, including monitoring and evaluation commitments on the part of the NMP,
                  a series of reviews and audits, and Bank supervision. The MCP PAD and credit
                  agreement described the following control system:

                         ■■     The NMP’s monitoring and evaluation were to consist of:

                         ■■     “Routine data” collected monthly from the districts

                         ■■     Quarterly reports from districts on key performance indicators, with one
                                staff member at NMP accountable for each of the set of indicators

                         ■■     Qualitative feedback from local malaria societies and informal consulta-
                                tions from the Panchaya Raj Institutions (village counsels).25

                        Reviews and audits of the project were to consist of:

                  over the districts.

              thresholds.31

      The Bank would supervise the program by:

       ■■     Reviewing the project’s adherence to the National Policy Letter and
              Revised Insecticide Guidelines

       ■■     Evaluating the revised operational guidelines that were to be published in
              the second year of the Credit, the revised operational procedures drawn
              upon the Project Implementation Plan, guidelines for district implementa-
              tion plans, and key inputs such as social and environmental assessments

       ■■     Conducting a desk review of the project activities in two to five percent of
              all districts

       ■■     Making spot visits to certain districts implementing the program.32

      Based on documents obtained by the DIR from the Government of India and the
Region, it is unclear whether all these supervision methods were, in fact, used. The
DIR did not receive copies of any documentation demonstrating audits, reviews,
or analyses conducted other than the Bank’s standard supervision methods, i.e.,
periodic supervision missions; aides-mémoires and other reports generated from

                  D.	 Costs and Time
                        The MCP was extended four times to facilitate completion and finally closed on
                  December 31, 2005, 33 months after the original planned closing date of March 31,
                  2003.33 The MCP was originally planned to cost USD 203.9 million, of which 85 per-
                  cent (USD 173.3 million) would be covered by the Bank and 15 percent (USD 30.6
                  million) by the Borrower.34 However, the project cost only USD 129.3 million due to
                  the suspension of funds as described below, with the Bank providing only USD 113.8
                  million (88  percent of total actual expenditures), while the Borrower provided
                  USD 15.5 million (12 percent).35 An additional USD 14.7 million of project funds
                  were reallocated to the Polio Eradication Project in October 2005.36


                  Project Implementation

                  A.	 Initial Implementation Problems
                        The Board approved the MCP on June 12, 1997, and it became effective on Sep-
                  tember 30 of that year.37 In early 1998, however, the Bank’s aides-mémoire began
                  to note serious procurement bottlenecks and capacity issues.38 It quickly became
                  apparent that the initial, sole-sourced procurement entity, the central purchase
                  organization of the Government of India—the Directorate-General of Supplies
                  and Disposal—had inadequate capacity to conduct procurement.39 Two years into
                  the project, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare replaced the Directorate-
                  General of Supplies and Disposal with RITES, which it identified through a com-
                  petitive process.40

                        By mid term, four years into the project, only 25 percent of the credit had been
                  disbursed and the Bank rated the project unsatisfactory on all fronts.41 The Mid
                  Term Review reported inadequate implementation of bed nets, spraying, training,

and information, education, and communication (IEC) activities.42 It concluded
that, “in essence all states are still working with the same mix of strategies as when
the project started.”43

B.	 Suspension
      As a result of its initial implementation problems, on June 28, 2002—five
years into the project—the Bank suspended the project and cancelled 28 percent
(USD  46.5 million) of the credit.44 The Bank cited delays in disbursements and
program implementation, as well as the failure to comply with multiple Credit
Agreement covenants.45 The Bank conditioned lifting the suspension on the Bor-
rower conducting the independent review of the technical and administrative
aspects of the program that had been due by December 15, 2000.46 However, the
Bank did not appear to be aware of the role that fraud and corruption may have
played in the implementation problems, thus exposing the project to future threats
from suppliers exhibiting indicators of fraudulent behavior.

C.	 Implementation Performance
      On December 13, 2002, after a six-month pause, the Bank lifted the suspen-
sion and work resumed on the project.47 The Bank’s January 2003 project status
report identified renewed leadership and political commitment as keys to putting
the project on a road to recovery: “[N]ew leadership at the Health Ministry [was]
evincing keen interest in [the MCP] and made some sweeping changes to facilitate
better coordination and implementation. The Health Secretary has replaced the
Joint Secretary … with a more efficient and senior level Joint Secretary. Senior
Health Ministry officials are visiting all project states and are communicating with
the state health officials to accelerate project implementation.”48

      From 2004 onward, the Bank continually rated the MCP’s implementation
progress and development objectives as “satisfactory.”49 The Bank’s supervision

                  mission aides-mémoire identified only Jharkhand and Orissa as needing strength-
                  ening, for which they recommended preparation of monitoring and supervision
                  plans, technical and management assistance, and Ministry visits.50 Procurement
                  was identified as the MCP’s one problem flag, and disbursement delays were cited
                  as a cause of concern.51 Again, fraud and corruption were not identified as threats
                  to project implementation.

                        However, in 2005, as the Bank prepared for its ICR, it began to identify addi-
                  tional implementation problems. Supervision and management capacity were
                  cited as weak across all states: “Even in higher-performing states, such as Gujarat,
                  the ability and capacity of districts to supervise and manage malaria control is
                  limited.”52 The ICR review mission conducted detailed field visits to Gujarat and
                  Orissa that identified issues unnoticed by previous reviews. For example, (1) staff-
                  ing vacancies were repeatedly identified as a significant problem;53 (2) the poor
                  quality of IRS was discussed in detail and identified as a greater concern; (3) the
                  districts’ ability and capacity to supervise and manage malaria control were viewed
                  as limited; and (4) the data gathered from monitoring the MCP’s processes were
                  insufficient for assessment of the quality of project outcomes.54 Despite these find-
                  ings, the Bank maintained the project’s satisfactory ratings.

                  D.	 Suspicions of Collusive Behavior
                        About five years into the project, both the Bank and RITES had concerns
                  regarding the possible operation of a cartel in the pyrethroid tenders. In early
                  2002, RITES noted apparent collusion in prices submitted by four companies—
                  two of whom submitted identical bids—and requested explanations from them.
                  All of the companies denied the allegation and RITES, apparently satisfied by the
                  explanations given, split the schedule, awarded two separate contracts, and took
                  no further action to prevent the firms from bidding.55

E.	 Project Evaluation
      The ICR rated the MCP’s implementation and achievement of development
objectives as “satisfactory,” though its authors expressed their preference for a lower
“moderately satisfactory” rating because the project’s three-year lag and 63 percent
expenditure rate were inefficient.56 The ICR concluded that the project achieved its
purpose because of “the positive epidemiological trends and the strategic reorien-
tation of the national program for eradication and control.”57




The DIR’s Approach to the
MCP
The MCP was included in the DIR primarily because suppliers identified as exhibit-
ing collusive behaviors by Department of Institutional Integrity’s (INT) investiga-
tion into the Bank’s RCH Project were involved in this project. In keeping with its
risk-driven methodology, the DIR selected areas of the MCP to review based on an
analysis of the fiduciary and development risks of the project’s primary components.
By focusing on high-risk areas, the DIR maximized its ability to identify indicators
of corrupt schemes that could affect significantly the MCP’s outcomes. The DIR also
attempted to follow goods from procurement through delivery to identify causalities
between the two. The DIR’s risk analysis and areas of focus are listed in Table 1.

Contract Procurement

A.	 Centrally Procured ICB and NCB Contracts by RITES
       The DIR conducted a procurement review of all RITES-administered tenders.
These tenders involved 59 percent of the MCP’s expenditures and included all pro-
curements of pyrethroids, bed nets, and pharmaceuticals.58 The DIR reviewed 92
of the 94 ICB and NCB contracts identified by RITES covering all types of malaria
commodities as shown in Figure 3 below.59 The DIR’s analysis integrated infor-
mation extracted from the DIR’s contract database with information from bid
documents, bid evaluation reports (BERs), correspondence between the Bank and
RITES, and contracts.60 To detect patterns indicating possible fraud or corruption,
the DIR analyzed the information both within each tender and across tenders.

                  B.	 Locally Procured Contracts by States and Districts
                        The risk of fraud and corruption is significant when contracts: (1) are procured
                  by decentralized entities with weak capacity; (2) use less stringent methods of local
                  shopping and direct contracting; and (3) lack supervision such as prior-review.
                  And although the value of individual local contracts is small, the large volume of
                  such contracts means that persistent fraud and corruption affecting local contract-
                  ing can have large financial effects when multiplied across all such contracts.

                        The DIR reviewed a selection of contracts procured by the states and districts
                  for indicators of fraud and corruption such as improper sole sourcing, bid rigging,
                  preferential treatment, bid rotation, or bidders with identical addresses or tele-
                  phone numbers. This review did not include any end-use audit or physical inspec-
                  tion of these contracts.


                  Review of Contract Implementation
                        The DIR conducted field visits to review the implementation of MCP contracts.
                  In considering which sites to visit, the DIR focused on districts having received
                  the more recent shipments of goods (since shipments delivered earlier would have
                  already been depleted or past their shelf life) and having received the widest range
                  of goods from the largest number of contracts exhibiting indicators of fraud and
                  corruption from the DIR’s review of procurement. Accordingly, the DIR ultimately
                  chose to visit the following 15 locations within the following three states:61

                  Maharashtra
                        ■■   State malaria (SM) officer in Pune headquarters

                        ■■   A medical storage warehouse in Mumbai

                        ■■   The DMOs in Thane and Nagpur

                        ■■   A Primary Health Center (PHC) in Raipur, Maharashtra.

                  Chhattisgarh
                        ■■   The state malaria office (SMO) in Raipur

                        ■■   The DMOs in Durg, Rajnandgaon, Kanker, and Bastar

                        ■■   A Community Health Center (CHC) near Jagdalpur.

                  61	
                      The DIR limited its site visits to five states within India. Of these five states, the MCP was implemented in
                  only three of them: Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Orissa.



                                                                          428
                                                                            Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector



Orissa
      ■■   The SMO in Bhubaneswar

      ■■   The DMOs in Dhenkanal, Cuttack, and Mayurbhanj.

      At each site visited, the DIR focused on reviewing the receipt and distribution
of goods along their supply chain. It reviewed documentation, visited warehouses
and medical facilities, and spoke with DMO personnel to determine whether the
implementation of the goods exhibited indicators of fraud and corruption in the
form of shortened quantities or inventory leakage. For its selection of sites, the
DIR traced the distribution of the procured goods along their supply chain from
the supplier (who won the contract award), to the state headquarters, to the divi-
sion (if applicable), to the district, and—in two instances—to the PHC or CHC.

      To test for possible shipments of under-quality goods, the DIR aimed to collect
a sample of goods supplied under the MCP and have the sample tested by an inde-
pendent laboratory. However, due to the long period between the time most MCP
goods had been contracted and delivered (1999 to 2005) and the date of the DIR’s
review (2007), most of the insecticides, bed nets, and pharmaceuticals had already
been used, administered, or consumed.62

      Other matters that complicated and limited the DIR’s review of goods quality
were: (1) the DIR would be unable to collect large samples of items, which was pre-
ferred in order to optimize the effects of the test, given the very limited supply of
drugs available on hand at each location (i.e., a large sample would deplete totally
or in unreasonable proportions the stocks of drugs at some sites); (2) the chemi-
cal and hazardous nature of pyrethroids and how they are stored (in large drums)
negated the ability to collect the items and test them remotely; and (3) onsite test-
ing for purposes of the DIR was not practical.

      Consequently, the DIR collected and had tested a very small sample of phar-
maceuticals (DEC tablets and chloroquine). While the tests returned no indicators
of poor quality, as described further in this Chapter, the DIR cautions that the test
sample on its own was insufficient to render any meaningful conclusions about
the quality of goods supplied on the MCP. In fact some reports from the field and
correspondence indicated that there had been quality issues at one time for DEC
tablets, but the DIR’s testing was not representative enough to either corroborate

62	
    Another consideration caused by the time lag between the time the goods were delivered and the DIR was
that the goods from earlier contracts, if still available for testing, would be beyond their expiration date and thus
unsuitable for testing. However, and as was expected, the DIR did not find any instances of expired drugs at the
locations it visited.

                  the drugs.


                  Complaints
                  The DIR also obtained 63 complaints filed during the MCP.63 The DIR analyzed
                  these complaints to determine: (1) whether and how they overlapped with the
                  DIR’s findings; and (2) whether and how the Bank addressed them.


                  Project Reports and Assessments
                  Finally, the DIR obtained and reviewed the MCP design, supervision, and evalu-
                  ations documents. These included the MCP PAD, the MCP project implementa-
                  tion plan, aides-mémoire, project status reports and implementation status reports,
                  the MCP ICR, available procurement post-review reports, available project audit
                  reports, and available Statement of Expenditure Financial Review Reports. The
                  DIR analyzed these materials to understand how the Bank assessed fraud and cor-
                  ruption risks in the project’s design, and to determine whether the indicators of
                  fraud and corruption identified by the DIR were captured by the Bank’s supervi-
                  sion systems.




                  Findings
                  Pyrethroids
                  Synthetic pyrethroids—insecticides used in IRS and impregnating bed nets—were
                  an important component to the success of the MCP because these insecticides
                  were used in almost all of the project’s malaria prevention activities.64 The pro-
                  curement of pyrethroids represented nearly one-third of RITES’ ICB contracts by
                  volume, and 55 percent of RITES’ ICB and NCB contracts by value (approximately

                      The complaints were retrieved from the INT Information System; the RCH investigation; IRIS; the MCP
                  Project Portal; and the correspondence files provided by the India Procurement Hub. Based on the review of
                  the Procurement Hub complaints, it appeared that other complaints may be filed in IRIS but the DIR did not
                  identify and locate these complaints during its searches.

                      Pyrethroids were procured in both liquid and water-disposable powder forms. As discussed herein, the term

                     The DIR found multiple indicators that four of the seven suppliers of pyre-
                  throids colluded in order to circumvent the competitive bidding process and win
                  virtually all contracts awarded until the final two tenders in 2004, whereupon the
                  indicators stopped, suggesting that the four companies discontinued their collu-
                  sive activities at that point. Indicators of collusion included:

                      ■■   The quotation of identical or unusually similar bid prices

                      ■■   The rotation of contract awards within tenders

                      ■■   The splitting of contract awards between bidders

                      ■■   Inflated prices

                      ■■   Limited competition

                      ■■   Unusual patterns in complaints filed.

                  A.	 Indicators of Collusive Behavior Were Identified in the
                      Procurement Process
                     The DIR found that four companies—Aventis CropScience India Ltd. (Aven-
                  tis), Bayer India Ltd. (Bayer), BASF India Ltd. (BASF), and Zeneca AgroChemicals
                  Ltd (Zeneca, which was later awarded contracts as Syngenta)—won 94 percent in
                  value (or 18 of the first 21) of the pyrethroid contracts awarded before 2004 and



                                                                 432

91 percent of the total contract value for all tenders. As Figure 4 shows, each of the
firms won a similar proportion of the total number of contracts awarded.

      The other firms winning a combined total of six percent of the contracts were
B.R. Agrotech, Gharda Chemical, and Meghmani Organics.67

      By comparison, after 2004 pyrethroid contracts were distributed in a signifi-
cantly less symmetrical manner to a larger number of winners (Figure 5).68

    These charts are based on data extracted from the DIR database of RITES procurement data. The percentage
represents the portion of all pyrethroids contracts won by the company during the stated time period, and the
number is the number of contracts won by the company.
67	
     The MCP pyrethroid bid requirements included a qualification requirement requiring bidders to demon-
strate that, in the past, they had supplied 80 percent of the quantity required by the contract for which they
were bidding. See, e.g., BER of IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/03/2004, sec. 8.1. This requirement, combined with
the large contractual quantities, effectively excluded many small domestic suppliers from winning contracts.
As a result, despite frequently being the lowest-evaluated bidders, between 2000 and 2003 the Indian firms B.R.
Agrotech, Gharda, and Meghmani won only one contract each (all under tender 04/2002) because they could not
meet this specification. The specification may have been intended to identify suppliers who could guarantee de-
livery of a large volume of pyrethroids, but it caused only a few major international firms to win MCP pyrethroid
contracts.

   At that time, Bayer had in fact merged with Aventis as reported in the press release from Bayer AG dated
Mar. 8, 2004.

                        The other firms winning contracts were B.R. Agrotech (two contracts), Gharda
                  Chemical (two contracts), and Meghmani (one contract).

                        As described below, the DIR found multiple indicators that the four companies
                  winning the majority of the contracts prior to 2004 were operating as an apparent
                  cartel. The four members were: Aventis, Bayer, BASF, and Zeneca (later awarded
                  contracts as Syngenta). The operation of the apparent cartel appeared to have
                  adversely affected the competitive process for the tender and award of at least 18 of
                  the 21 contracts awarded during that period, resulting in less open and fair com-
                  petition for those contracts and inflated prices.

                        1.	 Quotation of Identical or Unusually Similar Bid Prices

                        The DIR found that the members of the apparent cartel frequently submitted
                  either identically priced bids (i.e., exactly the same price), or bid prices clustered
                  within less than 0.5  percent of each other. Due to the nature of the pyrethroid
                  product and how it is priced, this type of pattern is highly unusual.69 In further-
                  ance of this argument, the Bank’s Sanctions Board has found identical pricing to

                  4, 2007). In addition, the price disparity among bids for the tenders in 2004—tenders which exhibited none of
                  the indicators of collusive behavior as described elsewhere in the MCP Chapter, and thus are viewed by the DIR
                  as a competitively priced tender—was wide, even among the members of the previously operating apparent
                  cartel. See BER for IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/03/2004 sec. 4.3 for Schedule VII, for example.

mitted identically priced bids on three separate tenders:

       ■■   RITES/MSM/MCP/15/2000. Bayer and Aventis quoted the same unit and
            total price for this tender, which was only for one schedule.71 This unusual
            bidding result prompted RITES to split the schedule between the two firms,
            awarding each a contract for half of the original schedule amount.72

       ■■   RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2001. In this tender, the members of the appar-

further explained:
         The Sanctions Board considered as particularly compelling the evidence relating to an incident
         of identical pricing between the Respondents [Nestor and Pure Pharma] in a tender in Tamil
         Nadu, finding that the Respondents had failed to provide an adequate explanation for this
         incident and that the evidence supported the conclusion that it was more likely than not that

The original cost estimate for these contracts was INR 4 million (USD 88,888 at the exchange rate of INR 45 =
USD 1), which was far below the Bank’s prior-review threshold of USD 300,000. MCP Credit Agreement, Sched-

    According to the BER of IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2001, section 5.9, GSW was originally the lowest
bidder, but was declared nonresponsive. The BER stated that GSW submitted false performance certificates
regarding the past experience of its Chinese pyrethroids supplier. RITES concluded, based on its own due dili-
gence, that the supplier had not delivered pyrethroids in Kenya and Chile, as GSW’s certificates claimed.

                          ■■     RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002. In this tender, Bayer and Syngenta quoted an
                                 identical price of USD 741,666 for Schedules II and III.79 Bayer and BASF
                                 quoted identical bid prices of USD 593,333 for Schedule V.80

                         The DIR learned from representatives of UK-based Agropharm, a losing bidder
                  for Schedules I, V, and VIII of Tender 04/2002, that it is “impossible” for compa-
                  nies to reach the same final price for a product like pyrethroids, because of the
                  company and sub-contractor specificity of the various price components.81 Agrop-
                  harm’s internal costing sheets shared with the DIR revealed that the final bidding
                  price of pyrethroids is a combination of several components, including raw mate-
                  rials, containers, packing, freight, commissions, overhead, and margins.82 When
                  informed of competitors submitting identical bids, the Agropharm representatives
                  surmised that a pattern of similar prices on different tenders could result only
                  from a pricing agreement in which companies had prepared their bids together.83

                         Similar Bid Prices Submitted. In addition to submitting identical bids, the four
                  firms’ bid prices also frequently clustered within less than 0.5 percent of each other.
                  For example, as Tables 4 and 5 show, the price differential between cartel members for
                  Schedules I and IV of tender number MCP/08/2000 was near or less than 0.1 percent.

       2.	 Rotation of Contract Awards

       The DIR found indicators that the four companies in the apparent cartel sub-
mitted bid prices that would result in a rotation of contract awards among them.
As described further below, the bid rotation scheme became more pronounced
over time.

       Early in the project, under the first tender RITES/MSM/MCP/02/1999, it
appears that Zeneca, Bayer, and Agrevo (agent of Aventis)—the first three mem-
bers of the apparent cartel—were rotating similarly priced bids between them,
each taking turns at being the lowest, second lowest, and third lowest bidders.84 As
shown in Table 6 for contracts 106 to 109 under this tender:

        ■■   Zeneca was the lowest bidder for the first two of the tender’s four con-
             tracts—Contracts 106 and 107, barely edging out Bayer—whereas it was
             the third and fourth lowest bidder on the other two contracts.

        ■■   Bayer was the lowest bidder on Contract 108, but was second lowest on
             Contracts 106 and 107 and fourth lowest on Contract 109.



84	
    At this point, Aventis was represented by an agent, Agrevo, and may not have been a member of the newly
forming apparent cartel. BASF did not appear to join the apparent cartel until the second pyrethroid tender.

                             ■■   Agrevo (or Aventis), which was third lowest on the first two contracts and
                                  second lowest on Contract 108, appeared to be in line to win Contract
                                  109 by barely edging out Zeneca and Bayer. However, the apparent cartel’s
                                  plans were spoiled as Agrevo was significantly underbid by Acco Indus-
                                  tries (or Cyanamid), the only contract in this tender it bid on.85

                             In MCP’s next tender for pyrethroids, Tender RITES/MSM/MCP/08/2000 in
                       2000, all four members of the apparent cartel appeared to collude to evenly divide
                       the contracts between them.86 As shown in Table 7, the bidders rotated their bid
                       prices from lowest (L1) to highest (L3 or L4), allowing each one of the four bidders
                       to win exactly one contract within the tender.87

                       85	
                             Cyanamid, which was represented by Acco Industries for this tender, appeared to not be colluding with the
                       other firms at this early stage because it: (1) submitted a complaint alleging that these three firms were operating
                       in a cartel; and (2) bid significantly lower than these firms to win a contract under the tender. Complaint from
                       J.L. Chambers, Asst. Dir. for Int’l Project Funding, American Home Products (Cyanamid’s parent firm) re: collu-
                       sion on tender RITES/MSM/MCP/02./1999 (Mar. 15, 2000); BER of IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/02/99, sec. 4.3
                       (low bid for contract). Cyanamid was subsequently acquired by BASF, a member of the apparent cartel. RITES
                       itself later acknowledged that although Cyanamid submitted lower bid prices than the other three firms when
                       it first entered the market, its prices later aligned with those of the three firms when it was part of BASF. BER of
                       IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/04/01, p.11, para. 1. INT was unable to substantiate Cyanamid’s complaint of a cartel
                       at the time the complaint was made.
                       86	
                           Although Cyanamid bid on only one of the four contracts in Tender P08/2000, its bid’s close proximity in
                       price to the prices bid by the other three apparent cartel members suggests that it was operating as a member of
                       the apparent cartel for Contract 128.

      The MCP’s following pyrethroids tender, RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2001 in 2001,
consisted of only two schedules, for the award of only two contracts. As before, all
four members of the apparent cartel submitted bids that would result in a rota-
tion of contract awards. However, for this particular tender, which was limited
to two schedules, the members also submitted in pairs identically priced bids; a
scheme apparently designed to double the number of potential winners from two
to four. Splitting of contract awards between the two identically priced bidders
would enable each one of the four members of the apparent cartel to win a con-
tract, instead of only two members.

      As shown in Table 8, the apparent rotation and contract splitting schemes
worked—Bayer and BASF submitted identically priced low bids on Schedule I and
the contract was split between them.88 On Schedule II, Aventis and Zeneca, the
other two members, submitted identical lowest-priced bids—except that Zeneca
was disqualified by RITES for submitting a faulty bid security.89

                         Also an indicator of collusive behavior is the mathematically symmetric char-
                  acteristics of the supporting (i.e., higher-priced) bids submitted by the losing cartel
                  members, which is done to create the appearance of competition. For Schedule
                  I, Aventis submitted a losing bid that was 0.2 percent higher than the two lowest
                  identically priced bids. For Schedule II, Bayer submitted the losing bid, which was
                  also 0.2 percent higher than the lowest identically priced bids.90

                         Cartel Members

                         Over the course of the entire project, four companies won 91 percent of the
                  total value of pyrethroid contracts, as shown in Table 9. The DIR found that the
                  total number and dollar value of the contracts awarded to each of the four com-
                  panies were of similar values, suggesting that the companies conspired in some
                  manner to share the contract awards among themselves (Table 9).

                  their participation in possible collusion, but rather may indicate an attempt by the colluding firms to save costs
                  by minimizing the number of bidders for each contract.

      4.	 Inflated Prices

      The DIR found that prices of the pyrethroid contracts won by the members of
the apparent cartel were significantly higher than (1) the prices of the few contracts
won by other companies and (2) the prices of contracts awarded in 2004, simulta-
neous with the disappearance of collusive indicators.

      Wettable Powder Pyrethroid Contracts (Five Tenders). Figure 6 illustrates
the drastic differences in prices—upwards of 80 percent—between the contracts
for the wettable powder form of pyrethroid awarded to the members of the appar-
ent cartel and the prices of contracts awarded to non-cartel companies (1) prior to
2004, when the apparent cartel was operating; and (2) in 2004 after the apparent
cartel was dissolved.

                        As described previously, the members of the apparent cartel were again Aventis,
                  BASF/Cyanamid, Bayer, and Zeneca/Syngenta. The indicators of collusive behav-
                  ior among these members ceased for the 2004 tender (03/2004).

                        Tender RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002 (labeled as 04/2002 in Figure 6) best dem-
                  onstrates that the apparent cartel was successful at winning contracts with inflated
                  prices even in the face of limited competition from others. That tender offered
                  eight schedules for bid. Three local competitors—Agrotech, Gharda, and Megh-
                  mani—won three of the seven contracts91 by submitting bid prices 25–30 percent
                  lower than prices quoted by the four apparently colluding firms. However, because
                  these firms were small providers of the insecticide, they were able to win only one
                  contract each due to the high volume capacity requirements of each schedule bid
                  on.92 Having reached their maximum capacity limits after winning only one con-

                       Meghmani was awarded two of the eight schedules (Schedules I and II) that were under bidding in this ten-
                  der. These two schedules were grouped under one contract leading the total number of contracts signed under
                  MCP/04/2002 to seven for a total of eight schedules in competition.

                      The contracts required the successful candidate to have previously produced and marketed at least 80 per-
                  cent of the quantities bid for. The smaller local companies usually reached their maximum capacity limits after
                  winning only one contract, rendering them ineligible to be evaluated for other contracts, leaving as the only
                  remaining eligible bidders the members of the apparent cartel.

tract, the local firms could not compete for any other schedules, leaving as the only
remaining bidders the members of the apparent cartel, to win the larger contracts
at much higher prices. And as described previously, the apparent cartel—as in this
and other tenders—divided the remaining contracts between them by submitting
rotating bids.93

      Other findings to support the indicator of inflated high prices:

       ■■   Agropharm’s unsuccessful bids for three schedules under the 04/2002
            tender support the indicator. Agropharm was a new, foreign entrant into
            the Indian pyrethroid market and successfully proposed a technically
            responsive product and initially won a contract, quoting a price of nearly
            one-half that of the next highest bidder, Bayer.94 Yet despite the significant
            price differential, Agropharm was still estimating to make a profit margin
            of 25–30 percent.95 However, the Government of India ultimately denied
            Agropharm a license required to implement the contract, and RITES
            awarded the contract to Bayer instead, the next lowest bidder.96

       ■■   A comparison of contract prices before the 2004 tender with contract
            prices achieved with the 2004 tender further supports the indicator. For
            the 2004 tender of wettable powder—simultaneous with the disappear-
            ance of all other indicators of collusive behavior—the average unit price
            of a contract was 82 percent lower than the average price of all previous
            tenders combined, as shown in Figure 6.97

93	
    Under tender RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002, companies were bidding for eight schedules. However, Sched-
ules I and II were both won by Meghmani, so the two schedules were combined into one contract, reducing the
expected number of contracts awards by one to seven.

     BER of IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002, sec. 4.3; Supplementary BER of IFB No. RITES/MSM/
MCP/04/2002, sec. 4.3. The contract’s technical specifications called for a certain volume of a 2.5 percent
concentration of a certain type of pyrethroid, but firms could supply other concentrations with different active
ingredients if that the final volume and concentration were equivalent. In this case, Agropharm and Bayer bid at
different concentrations with different active ingredients. Accordingly, the DIR corrected for this difference by
adjusting Agropharm’s 2.5 percent concentration price (USD 7.9 per kg) to a 10 percent concentration. After this
adjustment, Bayer’s price was USD 47 per kg while Agropharm’s price was USD 25.1 per kg.

    According to the DIR’s calculations, the average price for a kilogram of 10 percent equivalent concentra-
tion pyrethroid dropped from USD 50.82 for the first four tenders (02/1999, 08/2000, 04/2001, and 04/2002) to
USD 8.98. The DIR was unable to identify the precise cause of this price decrease, in part because broader mar-
ket data was unavailable. But it seems unlikely that general market changes would cause the price to decrease this
greatly. In fact, one would expect the larger contracts—the ones awarded to the members of the apparent cartel—
to be bid at lower prices due to their inherent benefit of large economies of scale from being large producers of
large volumes. Yet here, the opposite occurred.

                        ■■   A representative of Global Spin Weave (GSW), a losing bidder that quoted
                             much lower prices than the four possibly colluding firms, told the DIR that
                             the winning bidders’ prices were not justified by any particular expertise or
                             technical specification because raw materials comprised a large percent-
                             age of the total cost of pyrethroids. He concluded that, based on GSW’s
                             cost structure, even after adding a comfortable profit margin and the cost
                             of additives and inert ingredients, the prices quoted by the winning mem-

                  Figure 7, there was a significant drop in price between the first two tenders and the
                  final tender, which occurred after the indicators of collusive behavior disappeared.

                        5.	 Limited Competition

                        The DIR found that from 1999 until 2004, the number of companies bidding
                  for pyrethroids other than the members of the apparent cartel was low. As shown
                  98	
                      At the time of GSW’s bid submissions under tender RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2001, it had identified a Chinese
                  supplier in Shenzhen which would deliver the raw materials at INR 120/kg. GSW’s quote was 38.7 percent lower
                  than Bayer and BASF, which quoted the same price for the contract 164 and each won half of the total contract,
                  and 63 percent lower than Aventis, the winner of contract 165.



                                                                       444

in Figure 8, although there was generally heightened interest in firms seeking to
bid, as evidenced by the firms that purchased bidding documents, the number of
bidders outside of the apparent cartel ultimately submitting bids was minimal, or
even zero, for the first five pyrethroid tenders. The number drastically increased for
the 2004 tenders (03/2004 and 04/2004 in the figure), when the other indicators of
collusive behavior vanished. At the very least, the presence of the cartel appeared
to adversely affect the fair and open competitiveness of the pyrethroid tenders.

       6.	 Complaints Corroborate Cooperation among the Four Firms

       During the MCP, the Bank received 24 complaints regarding pyrethroids ten-
ders, the largest number of complaints regarding any MCP component. Many of
these complaints corroborate the indicators of an apparent cartel by specifically
referring to either the operation of a cartel or obstacles to entering the Indian pyre-
throids market.99 The complaints alleged the following:

        ■■    Four companies—Aventis, BASF, Bayer and Zeneca—operated as a cartel
              to win contracts.100


99	
    In total, the Bank received 63 complaints under the MCP. Out of these 63, INT was the recipient of 10 and
the rest were addressed to the procurement hub in Delhi. Twenty-four of the complaints referred to the procure-
ment of pyrethroids.

                          ■■   Aventis, Bayer, and Zeneca were colluding on pyrethroids contract
                               tenders.101

                          ■■   Collusion was possible by Bayer and BASF, which quoted the same prices
                               on the tender for MCP/04/2001.102

                         A confidential witness also alleged that Bayer and Aventis were “pooling” under
                  the MCP for the award of pyrethroids spray contracts, and that a manager at Bay-
                  er’s office in India was making payments to Indian government officials.

                         The DIR also noted a pattern of complaint activity by the members of the appar-
                  ent cartel. The member firms—particularly Aventis, BASF, and Bayer—would
                  submit a battery of complaints against a competing bidder whenever that bidder
                  attempted to undercut the prices bid by the cartel (which were always similar in
                  amount, as described previously in this MCP Chapter). In contrast, and consistent
                  with their potential collusive interest, the four member firms of the apparent cartel
                  never submitted complaints against each other.

                          ■■   For example, in tender MCP/02/1999, Cyanamid had undercut the price of
                               the apparent cartel by 28 percent.103 At the time, there is no indication that
                               Cyanamid was a member of the apparent cartel. Aventis, who was a member
                               of the apparent cartel and was the next lowest bidder to Cyanamid, issued a
                               complaint against Cyanamid attempting to disqualify its bid.104 Cyanamid
                               responded by issuing two complaints of its own alleging that a cartel was in
                               operation and influencing the tender’s procurement process.105 However,
                               as noted previously, this was also the only time that Cyanamid complained
                               against the cartel. Following its purchase by BASF in 2001, BASF appeared
                               to join the colluding firms, quoted unit prices in line with their bids, and
                               never complained against the cartel’s other members.106

        ■■    As another example, tender number 04/2002 was the subject of 10 com-
              plaints, the largest grouping of pyrethroids complaints received during
              the MCP.107 As described previously, RITES initially awarded contract
              number 197 of this tender (Schedule VIII) to Agropharm.108 However,
              because Agropharm was not able to obtain a license from India’s Central
              Insecticide Board (CIB), RITES awarded the contract to Bayer, a member
              of the apparent cartel, whose bid was over twice Agropharm’s.109 Conse-
              quently, Agropharm UK and Mr. D.B. Jain, its agent in India from SSG
              Investment, complained four times to either the Bank or RITES. These
              complaints made allegations about multiple parties—including the four
              possibly colluding firms, RITES, and the CIB—and referred to the opera-
              tion of a cartel, the unduly excessive prices offered by the local compa-
              nies, discrimination against non-domestic producers, and the obstacles
              to obtaining a CIB license.110 In parallel, the four possibly colluding firms
              complained about Agropharm six times.111

B.	Indicators Ceased in 2004, Implying an End to Collusion
       As described previously, multiple consistent indicators of collusive behavior
appeared throughout the first six tenders of pyrethroids, which were offered from
1999 to 2002. As summarized in Table 10, however, the same indicators were not
present or as clear to discern for the final two tenders in 2004.

                         The DIR identified, but could not confirm, several potential explanations
                  behind the change in bidder behavior in 2004:

                          ■■    According to the project team, a number of local companies decided to
                                register with the CIB, making them eligible to compete for MCP pyre-
                                throids tenders. 112

                          ■■    The merger of two of the possible colluding firms—Bayer and Aventis—
                                may have disrupted the cartel and prompted its breakup.113

                          ■■    A RITES manager did not serve on RITES’ bid evaluation committee for
                                the last three MCP pyrethroids tenders. A confidential witness alleged that
                                Bayer and Aventis were paying bribe to this senior RITES official.

                         Nonetheless, the sudden, simultaneous disappearance of the numerous indica-
                  tors is itself a further indicator that the four firms may have been colluding from
                  1999 up to 2004.


                  Bed Nets
                  Medicated mosquito nets (bed nets) comprised 14 of the 92 ICB and NCB con-
                  tracts (15 percent) awarded through RITES and reviewed by the DIR. As shown in
                  Table 11, these contracts were tendered in five packages from 2000 and 2005 total-
                  ing USD 11.8 million and awarded to seven different suppliers.


                  112	
                         This analysis is empirical and is not the result of a documented survey.
                  113	
                      The merger between Bayer Cropscience and Aventis Cropscience was officially completed in March 2004 as
                  per Bayer AG. Press released dated March 8, 2004.

   The DIR found a variety of indicators of fraud and corruption and other prob-
lems associated with the procurement and implementation of the MCP project, for
example: (1) one supplier failed to fulfill its contract on time; (2) the project was
suspended in part due to procurement bottlenecks; (3) two contracts were canceled
due to fraudulent misrepresentations by two separate suppliers; and (4) the project
received numerous complaints about poor quality bed nets being supplied.

   More specifically, the DIR found indicators of fraud and corruption related to
five of the seven suppliers of bed nets:

    ■■   The “Agrawal Companies.” These represent a group of companies the DIR
         found to be related to one another through familial ties. They are contract
         winners GSW and EMCO Enterprises (EMCO)—which won four of the
         14 bed net contracts representing 44 percent of the total value of bed net
         contracts—and bidders Superior Fabrics (Superior) and HAL Offshore,

                              Ltd. (HAL). Superior was positioned to win bed net contracts, but was pre-
                              vented by the Borrower from doing so due to Superior’s history of supply-
                              ing poor quality nets. Nonetheless, despite the Borrower’s attempts to pre-
                              vent Superior from winning contracts, it appears that two other Agrawal
                              Companies were used to circumvent the “blacklisting” of Superior and
                              win bed net contracts for the group. The DIR found indicators that at least
                              one of the Agrawal Company suppliers, EMCO, did deliver poor quality
                              bed nets. Furthermore, the presence of multiple related companies bid-
                              ding on contracts likely affected the competitiveness of the bidding pro-
                              cess, contravening the Bank’s procurement guidelines.114

                         ■■   R.S. Industries. A winner of the second tender, R.S. Industries delayed its
                              deliveries for two years and ultimately supplied 60,000 fewer bed nets than
                              specified in the contract.115 This contract may have partially contributed to
                              the Bank’s temporary suspension of the MCP, which at the time was suf-
                              fering from critical procurement bottlenecks. In addition, the DIR found
                              indicators that R.S. Industries and another bidder, B.R. & Sons, colluded
                              with the Agrawal Companies to enable the Agrawal Companies to win
                              contracts by providing falsified supporting bids and by supplying them
                              with fraudulent performance certificates.

                         ■■   Vestergaard Frandsen. A winner of four bed net contracts, Vestergaard
                              Frandsen was found to have misrepresented the source of its manufac-
                              turing facilities. Consequently, its contract was cancelled during the fifth
                              tender by the Borrower resulting in no bed nets being delivered.

                         ■■   Chemicals International. A winner of three contracts, Chemicals Interna-
                              tional, was found to have submitted false performance certificates. Its con-
                              tract under the fifth tender was ultimately cancelled, resulting in no bed
                              nets being delivered.

                         Some of these problems were detected and dealt with by the Borrower (Chemi-

A.	 The Agrawal Family Businesses Exhibited Indicators of
    Engaging in Collusive Practices
       In 2000, Vestergaard Frandsen India Pvt. Ltd. (Vestergaard) complained to
RITES that Superior—the lowest bidder on three contracts for which Vestergaard
also bid—had supplied poor quality bed nets in a non-Bank contract and was asso-
ciated with two other bidders under the tender: GSW and EMCO.116 RITES inves-
tigated the allegations and declared Superior unresponsive because it supplied
poor quality bed nets in the past.117 However, RITES reviewed GSW and EMCO’s
bids and concluded that Vestergaard’s collusion allegation was not credible.118

       In contrast to RITES’ findings, the DIR found indicators strongly suggesting
that GSW, EMCO, and Superior were associated with each other, as the complaint
alleged. The DIR further found that a fourth firm competing for MCP bed net
contracts—HAL—was connected to GSW, EMCO, and Superior (collectively,
the Agrawal Companies).119 Sudhir Agrawal (Sudhir), Director of GSW, person-
ally admitted to the DIR that he, his cousins Sanjeev and Pradeep Agrawal, and
Sanjeev’s wife Deepti Agrawal were the owners of those four businesses.120 Sudhir
explained that textiles are an Agrawal family business that has been passed down
from generation to generation.121 Sudhir described to the DIR the relationships
among the family members’ businesses (Figure 9).

                         In addition to having close relatives owning seemingly competing businesses,
                  Sudhir also acknowledged that the Agrawal family had political connections.122
                  One of the connections was likely Sudhir’s uncle, the late M.M. Agrawal, who
                  was the father of the directors of Superior, HAL, and EMCO.123 M.M. Agrawal
                  had served as a Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) and had been a member of
                  the sub-committee for the Ministry of Small Scale Industries.124 However, Sudhir
                  downplayed any possible political benefits by explaining that M.M. Agrawal had
                  not been connected with GSW since 2000.125

                         Despite the businesses’ familial connections, Sudhir stated that the companies
                  did not engage in any collusive practices and, instead, regularly competed against
                  each other.126 Sudhir also asserted that Superior, EMCO, GSW, and HAL were
                  owned and managed separately with their own facilities and employees. Yet Sudhir
                  also admitted that he periodically provided professional support to Superior and

that all family members served on the boards of directors of HAL’s primary share-
holding companies.127 Sudhir added that the Agrawal family’s businesses also
occasionally shared infrastructure, such as phone numbers and office space.128 For
example, INT’s first interview with Sudhir was conducted at Superior House, 25,
Bazar Lane, Bangali Market, Ground Floor, New Delhi; this is both EMCO’s offi-
cial office address (according to its bid submission cover sheets) and the listed
residence of Prabha Agrawal, the mother of Sanjeev Agrawal, Director of HAL,
and Pradeep Agrawal, Director of EMCO.

       The DIR confirmed Sudhir’s explanation of the links among the Agrawal
family-owned businesses through a review of their bidding documents and
internet research. As described below, the DIR also found indicators that the
Agrawal family businesses did engage in collusive practices, including submitting
non-competitive bids to create the appearance of competing against each other.

       1.	 Superior and GSW Were Associated and Exhibited Indicators of
       Collusion

       As shown in Figure 10, the DIR found documentary evidence of the association
between Superior and GSW, which included the following:

        ■■   GSW and Superior’s bid cover letters both stated the same telephone num-
             ber (3915178).129

        ■■   GSW and Superior’s bid cover letters stated addresses that are neighbor-

             Road, Civil Lines, Delhi, 110054, and Superior’s administrative office was
             listed at 21, Sri Ram Road, Civil Lines, Delhi.130

        ■■   A HAL prospectus listed Sanjeev Agrawal as both a director of GSW and
             the proprietor of Superior Fabrics, Kanpur.131

        ■■   Sanjeev Agrawal, GSW’s executive director, and Sudhir Agrawal, Supe-
             rior’s executive director, were both co-defendants in a civil action filed

       Under the first tender, Superior and GSW submitted sequentially numbered
bid securities from Punjab National Bank, which indicates that they obtained the
securities at the same time, and likely the same person acting on behalf of both
companies.135

       2.	 Superior and EMCO Were Associated and Exhibited Indicators of
       Collusion

       As shown in Figure 11, the DIR found documentary evidence of an association
between Superior and EMCO, which included the following:

        ■■    Superior and EMCO’s bid cover letters stated the same address for both
              firms: 16/71 Civil Lines, Kanpur (U.P) 208001.136

        ■■    A HAL prospectus stated that the proprietors of Superior and EMCO are
              brothers: Pradeep Agrawal (EMCO) and Sanjeev Agrawal (Superior) are
              the sons of Prabha and the late M.M. Agrawal, a now-deceased Member
              of Parliament.137

        ■■    Prabha Agrawal’s name was listed on the nameplate for the building at
              EMCO’s stated address (25 Bazar Lane, Bengali Market, New Delhi) and
              the building at Superior’s stated address (21, Sri Ram Road, Civil Lines,
              Delhi 110054).138

        ■■    At various points throughout the tendering process for bed nets, EMCO

       4.	 Complaints against the Agrawal Companies Surged during the
       Final Tender for Bed Nets under the MCP

       Of the 21 complaints the Bank received regarding the bed net procurement,
62  percent (13 complaints) involved the fifth tender for bed nets. The Agrawal
Companies, which ultimately won 54 percent of the value of the fifth tender, were
the subject of five of these complaints. Complainants made the following allega-
tions against the Agrawal family businesses:

       ■■   “On the other hand [the Agrawal family-owned businesses] who are quot-
            ing rates in a cartel or even high rates in some cases, are given the orders,
            which is … encouraging cartel formation….”142

       ■■   Due to the presence of GSW and EMCO, Vestergaard, Chemical Interna-
            tional, Argas Consultancy, and B.R. & Sons, “genuine manufacturers are
            not taking part in the IFB [fifth tender].”143

       ■■   GSW submitted fictitious and forged performance certificates.144

       ■■   EMCO submitted false performance certificates and a “false client cer-
            tificate on [B.R. & Sons] letter” in support of its fourth tender bid pack-
            age.145

       ■■   EMCO, GSW, Argas, B.R. & Sons, Vestergaard, and Chemical Interna-
            tional, which were supplying bed nets, were “not at all eligible … on the
            basis of bunch of false and fabricated documents.”146

       By contrast, and consistent with possibly collusive practices, none of the
Agrawal Companies submitted complaints against each another.

                  B.	The Agrawal Companies May Have Received Collusive
                     Support from Two Additional Competing Bidders
                         As noted above, three of the complaints made against the Agrawal family busi-
                  nesses alleged that other bidders were colluding with the Agrawal companies. The
                  DIR found corroborating indicators that at least two companies—B.R. & Sons
                  and R.S. Industries—behaved in a manner indicating possible collusion with the
                  Agrawal Companies.

                         During the fourth tender, B.R. & Sons and R.S. Industries submitted compet-
                  ing bids against EMCO and GSW and other Agrawal family businesses. There are
                  indicators that the bids were submitted merely as supporting bids to the Agrawal
                  businesses so as to create the illusion of competitive bidding. B.R. & Sons’ and R.S.
                  Industries’ bid prices for this tender were about 16 percent higher than the prices
                  of the Agrawal Companies.147 Yet the two companies apparently aided EMCO’s
                  and GSW’s bid efforts by submitting performance certificates on their behalf.148

                         The DIR also identified two other bed net tenders exhibiting indicators that
                  B.R. & Sons and R.S. Industries coordinated with each other: the firms submitted
                  sequentially numbered bid securities from the same bank in the first and third
                  tenders.149

                  C.	The Number of Bidders per Contract Progressively
                     Decreased over the History of the MCP Bed Net Tenders
                         Over the five MCP bed net tenders, the number of companies submitting bids
                  for contracts progressively decreased, which is a possible indicator of increasing
                  inappropriate barriers to entry for competitors. As shown in Figure 12, the num-
                  ber of bidders per contract fell from a high of 18 for the first tender in 2000 to
                  between only four to five bidders for the final tender.150 The situation may have
                  been aggravated by the fact that all four Agrawal-owned businesses competed in
                  some capacity in the final tender.151

                  in the fifth tender, B.R. & Sons complained about the validity of its own performance certificate to EMCO, and
                  RITES’ procurement data stated that the two companies’ prices—B.R. & Sons and R.S. Industries—dipped to
                  .01 percent below the price of the Agrawal Companies. This may indicate a shift in the firms’ strategy vis-à-vis

D.	 Bidders Competing against the Agrawal Companies
    Exhibited Independent Indicators of Corrupt and
    Fraudulent Practices
       The DIR found indicators that the other major bed net contract bidders inde-
pendently engaged in corrupt or fraudulent practices. After the Agrawal Compa-
nies, the two recipients of the most bed net contracts were Vestergaard, which won
26 percent of the total value of MCP bed net contracts, and Chemicals Interna-
tional, which won 12 percent of these contracts’ total value. RITES and the Gov-
ernment of India found that both firms had submitted either fraudulent or likely
fraudulent bid documents related to these tenders.

       In eight complaints filed against Vestergaard, the complainants alleged that
Vestergaard engaged in fraudulent or corrupt practices. The complaints were as
follows:

        ■■    Vestergaard: (1) supplied nets under a contract from the third tender that
              did not comply with the technical specifications for weight and height;
              and (2) falsely stated that it owned the Ming Khai Textile Company when,
              in fact, the firm was owned by the Government of Vietnam.152 (The owner-

                                ship allegation is significant because Vestergaard won its contracts on the
                                grounds that the bed nets were sourced from an Indian firm.)153 The Min-
                                istry of Health and Family Welfare and RITES investigated the complaint
                                and found that Vestergaard had indeed “supplied the bed nets which were
                                not of Indian Origin,” and cancelled Vestergaard’s contracts under this
                                tender.154

                          ■■    Because of Vestergaard’s and other firms’ involvement in the tenders, “gen-
                                uine manufacturers [were] not participating” in the fifth tender.155

                          ■■    Vestergaard, among others, was “not eligible primarily because of false
                                performance.”156

                          ■■    Vestergaard submitted fictitious and forged performance certificates.157

E.	 Other Indicators
       In reviewing the first tender for bed nets (RITES IFB NO. RITES/MSM/
MCP/09/2000), the DIR found that nine of the 18 bids submitted exhibited unusual
or suspicious indicators. For example, two groups of companies—Bansal Industries
and Srijee Udyog, and Nath Chemicals and Super Standard Tools & Equipment—
submitted bids with identical unit prices, which is an indicator of collusion given
the disparity in firms’ cost structures, i.e., variable and fixed costs.

       Moreover, reviewing the bidding documents DIR found correspondence from
RITES to Superior, GSW, R.S. Industries, and B.R. & Sons indicating that Superior
and GSW together and R.S. Industries and B.R. & Sons together submitted sequen-
tially numbered bid securities. This also is an indicator of collusion.161 Similarly,
it appears as though both R.S. Industries and B.R. & Sons submitted sequentially
numbered bid securities from Punjab & Sind Bank.162

       In addition, in a letter from RITES to the World Bank’s operation adviser in
New Delhi, RITES informs the World Bank that the lowest responsive bidder,
Fanny Pharmaceuticals, misrepresented facts regarding its manufacturing capac-
ity in order to influence the procurement process.163

                  F.	       The Quality of EMCO’s Bed Nets Is Contested
                         In accordance with its methodology, the DIR reviewed a selection of bed net
                  contracts financed under the MCP. The DIR selected for its review two bed net
                  contracts awarded to EMCO, the winner of the largest and seventh largest bed net
                  contracts. The two contracts reviewed included the bed nets supplied by EMCO
                  under a contract awarded in the fourth tender to the DMO in Mayurbhanj, Orissa,
                  and bed nets supplied by EMCO under a contract awarded in the fifth tender deliv-
                  ered to the Orissa consignees in Cuttack, Mayurbhanj, Dhenkanal, and Bhubane-
                  swar.164 Emco was a member of the Agrawal Companies.165 The DIR’s review found
                  several indicators of poor quality bed nets:

                          ■■    The DMO in Mayurbhanj provided the DIR with two final acceptance cer-
                                tificates that stated that EMCO’s bed nets were of “inferior quality” and
                                not packed in a “proper manner.”166

                          ■■    Dr. D.N. Sarangi of the Cuttack DMO said that overall, the EMCO bed
                                nets were of bad quality, would tear easily, and were not as large as speci-
                                fied (providing room for only one-and-a-half people, instead of two). Dr.
                                Sarangi also reported that the DMO had received 375 damaged (not just
                                inferior) bed nets. Dr. Sarangi added that the DMO had complained ver-
                                bally to the Vector Bourne Disease Control Program Coordinator about
                                the nets, but had not complained in writing to RITES or the supplier. The
                                DMO repaired the bed nets by sewing them.

                          ■■    In Mayurbhanj, the DMO showed the DIR a group of 75 defective bed
                                nets that were packed and ready to be shipped back to EMCO. The DMO
                                added that EMCO had delivered these bed nets on April 3, 2006, more
                                than one year after the contract signing.167

                          ■■    In February 2005, Utkal Women Activists’ Forum complained to the Bank’s
                                Delhi procurement hub of “very poor quality mosquito bed nets supplied
                                with holes much bigger than specifications and a large number have been
                                supplied in damaged and torn condition.”168

                  165	
                      EMCO won 28 percent of the total value of the MCP’s bed net contracts. Vestergaard won 26 percent of their

       In addition, as described earlier, a contract awarded to Superior Fabrics was

Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceuticals procured under the MCP consisted of chloroquine phosphate
tablets, combi-blister packs, and DEC tablets.169 Nine contracts worth USD  4.3
million were awarded for the supply of chloroquine across four tenders. Twelve
contracts worth USD 4.1 million were awarded for the supply of DEC tablets across
five tenders. And five contracts worth USD 1.3 million were awarded for combi-
blister packs (chloroquine and primaquine) across two tenders.170

       The DIR found that two firms recently debarred by the Bank for collusive prac-
tices on the RCH Project—Pure Pharma Limited (Pure Pharma) and Nestor Phar-
maceuticals Limited (Nestor)—were awarded the majority of the pharmaceutical
contracts. In terms of value, Pure Pharma won 62 percent of the DEC tablets con-
tracts, and Nestor and Pure Pharma combined won 93 percent and 73 percent of
the chloroquine and combi-blister packs contracts, respectively. Due to the allega-
tions surrounding the collusive bidding practices of Pure Pharma and Nestor on
the RCH Project, the DIR focused its review of pharmaceutical procurements on
the tenders involving these two companies.171

       The DIR found indicators of collusive behavior between Nestor and Pure Phar-
ma—such as symmetrical pricing—in all four chloroquine phosphate tenders and
one combi-blister pack tender. The types of indicators were similar to these com-

for a follow-up interview in April 2007, but was unsuccessful.
169	
    Chloroquine phosphate is a common treatment for malaria. Combi-blister packs contain a combination of
drugs—usually either chloroquine and primaquine, or chloroquine and artesunate. DEC tablets are used to treat
the vector-borne disease filariasis.
170	
       These figures are based on the procurement documents that RITES provided to the DIR.
171	
     The DIR also reviewed four MCP tenders worth USD 2.3 million for the procurement of arteether injections,
which are a second-line drug used to treat severe cases of chloroquine-resistant malaria. All four contracts were
awarded to one company—Themis Chemicals/Medicare Ltd. (Themis). The DIR identified the following related
to these contracts: (1) Competition for the contracts was limited; the number of bidders for each contract ranged
from one to three, while the number of interested bidders purchasing bid documents ranged from three to six;
(2) Themis was connected to its competition in ways that potentially undermined the tenders’ competitiveness:
Ipca tested Themis’s arteether, and Norris Medicines, Ltd. manufactured Themis’ arteether; A.K. Jain, Execu-
tive Director, Ipca Laboratories Ltd., letter to B.K. Mandal, Director, Central Drugs Laboratory, Government of
India (Oct. 18, 1999); Arvind Gandhi, Themis Medicare, letter to The Commissioner, Food and Drugs Control
Administration, Government of India; and (3) RITES consistently disqualified Themis’ lower-priced competi-
tors for violations of the tenders’ technical specifications and/or qualification criteria; two companies (ACE
Pharmaceuticals BV by mail to Mr. Armando Araujo, Dir. OPCS by letter on October 26, 2004 and Skymax to
the World Bank Office Delhi and the Investigations Hotline by e-mail on February 8, 2005) complained that they
were disqualified or could not compete because of too stringent qualification criteria. Based on the documenta-
tion available, the DIR was not able to determine the outcome of such complaints reviewed by both the Bank and
RITES, except for the fact that Themis Chemical won all contracts.

                  time period.172 The DIR also found indicators of anticompetitive bidding practices
                  in the procurement of DEC tablets. Lastly, correspondence and reports from proj-
                  ect officials indicate that there were concerns about the quality of the DEC tablets
                  provided under MCP.

                  B.	 Concentration of Contract Awards among Limited Winners
                     Pure Pharma and Carewell Pharma, Ltd. (Carewell) dominated the award of
                  MCP DEC contracts (Figure 13). Pure Pharma won 33 percent of the total number
                  of DEC contracts representing USD  2.5 million, or 62  percent of total contract
                  value. Carewell won 42 percent of the total number of DEC contracts represent-
                  ing USD 0.88 million, or 21 percent of total contract value. The concentration of
                  award winners is even more prevalent for all DEC tenders prior to 2004. For those,
                  all of the contracts were won by either Pure Pharma (30 percent of total value) or
                  Carewell (70 percent of total value). Another supplier did not win a contract until
                  the 2004 tender, although only in small amounts beginning with that tender. Pure
                  Pharma won 70 percent of the value of the remaining tenders.

                     Similarly, in the case of both chloroquine phosphate and combi-blister packs,
                  Nestor and Pure Pharma dominated the award of contracts (Figures 14 and 15).
                  Nestor won 58 percent of the chloroquine contracts and 51 percent of the combi-
                  blister pack contracts (by value), and Pure Pharma won 35 percent of the chloro-
                  quine and 22 percent of the combi-blister pack contracts (by value). They ranked
                  first and second in contract value for both goods:

C.	 Indicators for Chloroquine Phosphate and Combi-Blister
    Packs
       1.	 The Price Differential between Nestor and Pure Pharma Was
       Symmetrical and Rotated

       When tendering for the second combi-blister contract package, RITES/MSM/
MCP/02/2004, Nestor bid a unit price INR  0.02 lower than Pure Pharma’s unit
price on Schedules I, II, VI, and VII.173 In contrast, Pure Pharma bid a unit price
INR 0.02 lower than Nestor’s unit price on Schedules II and IV.174 The two firms
engaged in this same practice in RCH procurements.175 The symmetry of their
bid price differentials and the rotation of their high and low bids between sched-
ules are both indicators of possible collusion to distribute the bid-upon contracts
between the two firms (Table 13).

                             Similarly, under the fourth tender for chloroquine phosphate, Nestor and Pure
                      Pharma submitted bid prices that differed by only 0.8 percent.176 Such similar pric-
                      ing is another indicator of possible collusion by the firms.

                             2.	 Nestor Won a Greater Proportion of Contracts than Pure Pharma

                             Nestor won a proportion of chloroquine phosphate and combi-blister pack con-
                      tracts that was almost twice as large as the proportion won by Pure Pharma. This
                      mirrored the contract award pattern present when the two firms colluded on RCH
                      tenders: Nestor won contracts worth USD 37.8 million, while Pure Pharma won
                      contracts worth USD 12.7 million.177 The fact that Nestor won a larger proportion
                      of these contracts indicates that, if Nestor and Pure Pharma were colluding, Nestor
                      likely was the leader of the collusive ring. This is consistent with: (1) the statements
                      of a confidential RCH witness, who claimed that Nestor was the leader of the RCH
                      collusion ring; and (2) the findings of the Bank’s Sanctions Board, which debarred
                      Nestor for three years for collusive practices but Pure Pharma for only one year.178

       3.	 Nestor and Pure Pharma Were Alleged to Have Tampered with
       Drugs to Undercut Competitors’ Prices

       During the second combi-blister packet tender, Endolabs Limited complained
to RITES that Nestor and Pure Pharma were providing low bid prices by overstat-
ing the amount of raw material they would need to import to manufacture the
drugs and selling the excess raw material on the Indian domestic market without
paying taxes and customs duties.179 This allegation does not regard collusion by the
two firms, but is a further indicator of possible fraud conducted by them.

D.	 Fraud and Corruption Indicators under DEC Contracts
       1.	 A Large Disparity Existed between the Number of Bid Purchases
       and Final Bidders

       With the exception of the final DEC tablet tender, the number of bidders for
DEC contracts was much lower than the number of bid document purchasers. The
average number of bid document purchasers across the five tenders was 8.4, but
the average number of bidders that bid on at least one schedule under each tender
was only 2.8. On average, two-thirds of the firms that purchased bid documents
did not submit bids, and the number of bidders ranged from as low as one to as
high as five (Figure 16).

                         The disparity between the number of bid purchasers and the number of bidders
                  is most apparent under the two earliest tenders: RITES/MSM/MCP/02/2001 and
                  RITES/MSM/MCP/08/2002.

                         For example, in the case of contract number RITES/MSM/MCP/02/2001/155, 12
                  companies purchased the bidding documents while only two companies—Carewell
                  and Maan Pharmaceuticals—ultimately bid on the contract.180 Although Maan’s bid
                  was 56 percent lower than Carewell’s, RITES disqualified Maan for non-compliance
                  with the post-qualification criteria.181 In effect, RITES awarded the contract to Care-
                  well, whose bid exceeded the contract’s cost estimate by 47 percent.182

                         For contract number RITES/MSM/MCP/02/2001/146, 13 companies pur-
                  chased the bidding documents but only two companies submitted bids: Carewell
                  and M/s Khard Soaps (Khard).183 Although Khard was disqualified for not submit-

                  contract in the last three years, nor had it submitted its Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certificate in the
                  format prescribed by the World Health Organization. Ibid., sec. 7.1. Under World Bank, Guidelines: Procurement

ting its bid security along with its bid, Khard would have lost to Carewell anyway
because Khard’s bid price was nearly triple Carewell’s bid price.184 RITES ultimately
awarded the contract to Carewell at 23 percent above the cost estimate.185

       2.	 Collusion Indicators Ceased in 2004

       As in the case of pyrethroids, while Carewell and Pure Pharma dominated the
2001–2003 DEC tablet tenders. Beginning in 2004, other companies began win-
ning contracts (Figures 17 and 18).

       In addition, the disparity between bid documents purchased and bids submit-
ted under tender RITES/MSM/MCP/01/2004 was not as pronounced as in previ-
ous tenders. In this tender, nine companies purchased the bidding documents and
five companies ultimately submitted bids.186

       Further, under this tender Carewell and Pure Pharma bid against each other
on Schedules I and II and behaved like genuine competitors. Carewell’s bid was
substantially lower than Pure Pharma’s bid for both schedules, and when RITES
disqualified Carewell, Carewell petitioned India’s Purchase Advisory Committee
to reverse the disqualification.187 This attempt to undo Pure Pharma’s contract

                  award reflects an acute competition between the two firms and is inconsistent with
                  a common collusive interest.

                         3.	 DEC Implementation Quality Is Contested

                         The DIR visited 13 locations that received DEC tablets under the five tenders,
                  and only two locations reported quality problems with the tablets. The DIR also
                  tested three samples of DEC tablets supplied by Pure Pharma, and none of the tests
                  revealed any quality problems. However, the World Health Organization (WHO)
                  received a complaint from the Nepalese government—to whom the Ministry of
                  Health and Family Welfare had loaned a supply of DEC tablets—that the tablets
                  were of poor quality.188 Further, the Government of India’s 2004–2005 audit of the
                  MCP stated that 80 million DEC tablets provided by Pure Pharma were found to
                  be substandard and replaced by the firm.189 In addition, in two instances, local
                  officials reported to the DIR that DEC tablet contractors supplied substandard
                  product. It is, therefore, unclear whether the winning firms provided DEC tablets
                  of the proper quality.

                  E.	 Similarities and Timing of Indicators with Collusive
                      Activities on RCH
                         The MCP collusion indicators occurred during the same years, and involved the
                  same companies as collusion under RCH. Nestor and Pure Pharma were debarred
                  for three years and one year, respectively, for engaging in collusive practices.190
                  Further, a confidential witness that admitted to colluding with Nestor and Pure
                  Pharma in a Nestor-led cartel on RCH also joined Nestor and Pure Pharma to bid
                  for MCP pharmaceutical contracts.191 Thus the same firms colluding on RCH bid
                  on MCP tenders at the same time as their RCH collusion; this is an indicator of
                  possible collusion on MCP contracts as well.

RITES
The DIR identified indicators of possible fraud and corruption that affected mul-
tiple ICB and NCB procurements of a range of goods that involved numerous
firms. But one common element linked these procurements: RITES was the PSA
in charge of administering them. To evaluate whether RITES may have engaged in
fraud or corruption, the DIR looked across the range of RITES’ tenders for indica-
tors regarding RITES itself. This review identified actions by RITES, inaction by
RITES, and complaints against RITES that all indicate RITES’ possible support of
collusive schemes affecting MCP tenders.

A.	 RITES May Have Shared Pyrethroid Bid Cost Estimates
    with the Four Firms
       A bid cost estimate is a Borrower’s pre-bid estimate of how much a contract
should cost; it is used to evaluate the reasonableness of firms’ bid prices.192 Because
they show what the PSA expects a contract to cost, and therefore could affect firms’
bid prices, bid cost estimates are not made public except for specific types of con-
tracts or in a limited number of jurisdictions and with the approval of the World
Bank. Based on the documentation available, the DIR did not find evidence that
the Bank had authorized the release of the cost estimates for MCP.

       The DIR found indicators that RITES may have informed four possibly col-
luding firms—Aventis, Bayer, BASF, and Zeneca—of the bid cost estimates for
the pyrethroid contracts on which they were bidding. The four firms’ prices were
unusually close to the cost estimate, ranging from 3–6 percent below the cost esti-
mate in the early MCP tenders. In contrast, throughout all the tenders, other bid-
ders submitted prices either 30–54 percent below, or up to 25 percent above, the
bid cost estimate. Tables 14 and 15 and Figures 19 and 20 highlight this difference
in the bids for Schedules III and VI of the tender RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002.193

                  officials (aside from the exceptions mentioned previously); therefore, the four firms
                  whose bids closely tracked the bid cost estimates likely obtained the cost estimates
                  in advance from one of these two sources. This is an indicator that RITES may have
                  colluded with the four firms for the award of MCP pyrethroid contracts.

                  B.	 Complaints Allege That RITES Improperly Supported
                      Certain Bidders
                         The DIR’s review of MCP complaints identified 14 complaints alleging that RITES
                  was limiting competition for tenders by including restrictive qualification criteria in
                  its bidding documents. For example, one complaint alleged that Vestergaard’s bed net
                  contracts as part of the third tender did not comply with the contract’s weight and
                  height specifications, and that within a day after the notification of contract award,
                  RITES relaxed the weight specification “under full knowledge of Shri Deepak Gupta,
                  Jt. Secy. Ministry of Health & F.W.” 196 The complainant further alleged that RITES
                  had tested samples of Vestergaard’s bed nets, noted the discrepancies, and then sup-
                  pressed the findings.197 The World Bank’s Acting Operations Adviser, Gus Litvak,
                  forwarded the complaint to RITES for “necessary action.”198 Documents provided to
                  the DIR do not state whether RITES acted on the complaint.

                         Another complaint related to the purchase of Rapid Diagnostics Kits. Rapid
                  Diagnostic Pvt., Ltd., submitted a complaint to INT dated April 6, 2005, in which
                  it alleged that its “bidding documents have been modified by the peoples of RITES
                  India Limited and bid validity extension letters have been removed from [their]
                  bid after submission, just to favor the bidder of their choice [Span Diagnostics
                  Limited and Orchid Biomedical System].”199

       In addition, a credible confidential witness to the RCH investigation alleged
that a senior manager at RITES was receiving kickbacks from Bayer and Aven-
tis, companies operating a pool system (i.e., cartel) for the supply of pyrethroids.
Another credible witness stated that both RITES managers and Indian govern-
ment officials involved in RITES-administered procurements would accept bribes
in exchange for contract awards.

C.	 RITES Acted Insufficiently to Impede Apparent Collusion
       The DIR reviewed the manner in which RITES managed complaints and alle-
gations of collusive behavior under the MCP. The DIR found that RITES appeared
to have taken only minimal steps to address possible collusive behavior.

       1.	 Indicators of Collusion in Pyrethroids

       Under the pyrethroids tender RITES/MCP/MSM/04/2001, RITES and the
Purchase Advisory Committee decided to split a contract between two bidders—
Bayer and BASF—that submitted identical bid prices for the contract, a bidding
pattern that indicates possible collusive behavior.200 Nonetheless, RITES requested
the Bank’s No Objection to splitting the contract between the two firms. To its
credit, the Bank’s Delhi office required clarification from RITES on this issue and
recommended that RITES revise its BER.201

       Following the Bank’s prompting, RITES’ revised BER concluded that it was
“obvious” that four bidding firms that had submitted pairs of identical bids “quoted
the prices with a mutual understanding for this IFB.”202 RITES’ BER stated that,
prior to recommending the contract split, RITES sought explanations from the
four firms for their pricing similarities and all four answered by: (1) vehemently
denying any pricing agreements with their competitors; and (2) providing assur-
ances that their prices were the result of independent internal pricing exercises.203
RITES reviewed these responses, performed a price comparison with similar ten-
ders, and—despite the “obvious” “mutual understanding” among the bidders—
recommended that the contract should not be rebid because:

                                 quoted on similar tenders (adjusted for inflation).204

                          ■■     The bidders were the only four major suppliers of pyrethroids that were
                                 registered in India, licensed with the CIB, and had bid on previous pyre-
                                 throids tenders.205

                          ■■     The procured pyrethroids needed to be delivered in time for the spraying
                                 season, so a re-bidding delay would be detrimental to the project.206

                         RITES recommended that the Borrower should address this collusion by send-
                  ing a letter to Bayer, Zeneca, BASF, and Aventis suggesting that they refrain from
                  sharing bid price information in the future; RITES did not recommend any stron-
                  ger action, such as a referral to India’s Vigilance Commission or any law enforce-
                  ment agency.207

                         2.	 Indicators of Collusion in Bed Nets

                         As detailed above, the DIR found numerous indicators that MCP bed net con-
                  tract bidders Superior Fabrics, EMCO, GSW, and HAL were interrelated. At one
                  point, RITES received an allegation that Superior was associated with EMCO and
                  GSW. RITES investigated the matter, but provided only a superficial denial of the
                  allegation, determining that EMCO and GSW:

                                       are managed by different set of people and there is nothing
                                       to prove that they are group companies of M/s Superior
                                       Fabrics, Kanpur. It would be worthwhile to mention here
                                       that M/s Superior Fabrics and M/s EMCO Enterprises are
                                       proprietary firms being run by different persons, and M/s
                                       Global Spin-Weave Ltd is a limited firm being managed
                                       by three Directors one of, [sic] which one director out of
                                       three is of the same name as the proprietor of M/s Supe-
                                       rior Fabrics and another director is by the same name as
                                       proprietor of EMCO Enterprises. Since the contribution



                  204	
                      RITES used previous MCP tenders won by the four possibly colluding firms as their “market price” reference
                  points. BER (Two) of IFB No. IFB No. RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2001, sec. 8.2, (p. 11). These prices are an inap-
                  propriate reference point because, if the four firms were colluding, one would expect these prices to be tainted by
                  that collusion in the same way that the instant tender’s prices were tainted.
                     At the time of these inquiries (January 2002), CIB Chairman Dr. S.P. Aggarwal was also Director General of

                   of all these firms is different, it is difficult to categorize
                   them.208

       RITES also appeared to address insufficiently other red flags in relation to bed
nets procurement. For example, in 2003, the Thai firm Akrungaroon Industry Co.,
Ltd., sent RITES a letter following its disqualification as the lowest bidder because
it had not responded to an amendment requesting bidders to increase their bed net
quantities and the amount of their bid securities.209 Akrungaroon argued to RITES
that it had never received the request and that, if it had, it “would have quoted
accordingly and would have given the revised bid security amount.”210 In a let-
ter to the Bank, RITES expressed surprise at having received Akrungaroon’s letter
and avoided the substance of the complaint. Instead, RITES dismissed the matter
by claiming that Akrungaroon’s letter had been “doctored” and that it “ha[d] no
further comments to offer in this regard.”211 Further, RITES did not appear to have
followed up on a complaint from Akrungaroon in February 2005, which alleged
that Indian companies were receiving undue favor.212

D.	Indicators of Collusion Ended at the Same Time on
    Multiple RITES Procurements
       As discussed above, the DIR found indicators of collusion on multiple RITES-
administered procurements. But in 2004, these indicators simultaneously appeared
to cease in procurements for pyrethroids and DEC tablets, while competition
increased for chloroquine phosphate contracts.213 The fact that two, and poten-
tially three, distinct groups of bidders changed their behavior during the same
period suggests that an outside source may have impacted their decision to cease
colluding. In one case for the procurement of pyrethroids, the DIR was able to par-
tially link the end of colluding activities to a change in key staff in RITES. Further
inquiries are needed to fully understand how this change in personnel and other
factors may have influenced the apparent collusive activities.

                  Competitive International Bidding Prevented
                  The DIR also found indicators that competition in ICBs was sometimes hampered
                  by the contract requirement that bidders for pyrethroid contracts be registered
                  with India’s CIB and licensed to sell pyrethroids in India.214 The Bank gave its
                  No Objection to this requirement. The requirement, however, had the apparent
                  effect of stifling competition for the pyrethroid contracts to the benefit of the
                  apparent cartel due to the difficulty of foreign firms in obtaining the registration.
                  For example:

                          ■■     UK-based Agropharm Ltd. initially won a contract under Schedule VIII
                                 of tender RITES/MSM/MCP/04/2002.215 However, the contract award was
                                 conditioned on Agropharm obtaining a CIB registration and license.216
                                 Agropharm and its Indian agent attempted for more than eight months to
                                 obtain a license, but was refused by the CIB on the grounds that licenses
                                 could be granted only to companies with operations in India.217 Conse-
                                 quently, RITES awarded the contract to Bayer, a member of the apparent
                                 cartel and the next lowest evaluated bidder with a unit price nearly twice
                                 that of Agropharm.218

                          ■■     Similarly, in a March 10, 2000, complaint to INT, Cyanamid alleged that it
                                 had attempted to obtain CIB registration since 1997, but the process had
                                 been delayed because of competitor interference and that its lack of license
                                 could prevent it from receiving MCP contracts.219

                         Further, it appears that the CIB’s license-issuance process was non-transparent
                  and tainted by corrupt practices. When interviewed by the DIR, Agropharm rep-
                  resentatives recalled that their local agent, D.B. Jain from SSG Investments, said
                  that the CIB registration process could be accelerated by making a facilitation pay-
                  ment, but would not discuss any details.220 Agropharm’s internal documents also
                  indicate that the company was unable to obtain a license because it refused to pay

the members of the CIB. Correspondence between Mr. Jain and Agropharm reveal
that on several occasions, Mr. Jain clearly indicated that the company would have
to pay a facilitation fee to receive a license:

        ■■     Just after the December 27, 2002 bid opening date, Mr. Jain sent several
               e-mails in which he indicated that the registration process with the CIB
               would be cumbersome and long but could be accelerated for USD 20,000.221
               In follow-up communications, Mr. Jain requested cash advances in order
               to ensure that the registration process moved swiftly and that “promises
               [were] kept by persons receiving payments.”222

        ■■     As the bid evaluation process progressed, the CIB’s pressure for bribes
               increased. Mr. Jain referred to between GBP 50,000 (USD 80,000223) and
               GBP 10,000 (USD  16,000) in “hush money” that should be distributed
               to the eight members of the CIB commission and “the rest of the team,”
               respectively.224

       Agropharm management flatly rejected Mr. Jain’s “hush money” proposal, and
Agropharm’s representatives only recalled paying Mr. Jain a five percent success
fee in exchange for Agropharm obtaining this registration.225 Agropharm’s repre-
sentatives noted, however, that Mr. Jain’s fee was high for obtaining a registration,
because fees for this work usually only ranged from USD 2,000 to 3,000.226

       MCP’s ICR highlighted the requirement for CIB registration as one of the two

                  problem, this solution potentially worsened the chance for increased competition
                  from non-Indian firms and ensured more opportunities for contract awards for
                  the apparent cartel.


                  Analysis of Supply Chain
                  The DIR visited sites associated with the first two links of the MCP supply chain
                  regarding the receipt and distribution of goods supplied under the project. In
                  doing so, the DIR visited a total of 15 sites across three states: Maharashtra, Chhat-
                  tisgarh, and Orissa, visiting:

                      ■■   Maharashtra. SMO in Pune; the medical store in Mumbai; the DMOs in
                           Thane and Nagpur; and a PHC in Raipur.

                      ■■   Chhattisgarh. SMO in Raipur; DMOs in Durg, Rajnandgaon, Kanker, and
                           Bastar; and a CHC (Lohandi Guda) near Jagdalpur.

                      ■■   Orissa. SMO in Bhubaneswar; DMOs in Dhenkanal, Cuttack, and Mayurb-
                           hanj.

                     During these site visits, the DIR viewed the SMOs and DMOs, storage facilities,
                  and stock rooms. The DIR also reviewed the inventory records and systems at each
                  of the facilities and how the facilities addressed the management of the incoming
                  and outgoing inventory stocks, expiry dates, quality testing and under-deliveries.
                  Within each state and district visited, the DIR also spoke with the state malaria
                  officers (SM Officers) and district malaria officers (DM Officers) and with various
                  individuals responsible for managing and/or administering the supply chain. The
                  DIR also conducted certain tests of the supply chain and inventory system pertain-
                  ing to the contracted supply, delivery, and distribution of primarily pyrethroids,
                  bed nets, and pharmaceuticals from 18 contracts identified from the DIR’s pro-
                  curement review as exhibiting some indicators of fraud and corruption.

B.	 District Malaria Offices
   The DMOs are usually located in the city centers or suburban areas and are
mostly dedicated standalone buildings. Occasionally, the DMO is housed in build-
ings or compounds that are part of the local health infrastructure, such as a district
hospital, or the chief medical officer headquarters responsible for all public health
activities in a district.

   The DMOs were usually found to be in a relatively fair state, with padlocks on
the doors and windows that are generally barred or protected with wooden wind-
shields. The DMO includes administrative offices and a laboratory for the process-
ing and microscopic review of blood smears.

C.	 Storage Facilities
    1.	 Organization and Layout

   Antimalaria commodities were stored in several places and scattered across
different rooms in the DMO building, a nearby warehouse, or sometimes in the



                                                  483

                  district headquarters hospital. At the district level, the storage room for pharma-
                  ceuticals was usually part of the DMO building, whereas bed nets and pyrethroids
                  were mostly stored in separate facilities because of the volume of these items and
                  the risk of storing hazardous materials. In many instances, the storage rooms for
                  antimalaria commodities were used to store various items not related to malaria,
                  in particular when the DMO was also in charge of other programs, such as for
                  leprosy, that were funded by other entities (the state, the Government of India, or
                  another international agency).

                     The DIR observed that the storage rooms always had padlock doors and win-
                  dows (with or without windows depending on the building) that were secured
                  with bars or inside/outside wooden shutters. In none of the sites visited did the
                  DIR perceive that the security of the storage rooms might be a serious issue as all
                  drugs appeared to be secured, and in some instances there was a guard at the ware-
                  house or the warehouse was part of a compound that benefited from permanent
                  security. In one instance (Nagpur district in Maharashtra), it appeared that the
                  overflow of pyrethroids had to be stored outside the storage area in the open air
                  with no precaution in terms of preventing theft or health hazards.

                     Antimalaria drugs delivered in bulk were stacked in their original packag-
                  ing on the floor without any shelving except in a few occasions. When in smaller
                  quantities and containers, most places had some kind of locked pharmacy cabi-
                  net to store drugs that could be delivered onsite at the DMO. The different stocks
                  appeared to be spaced and zoned in a separate area according to the type of drugs,
                  although there were no clear indications of which drugs were where except in the
                  case of one district for which the storage had obviously been staged for the DIR’s
                  site visit (Mayurbhanj district in Orissa) and one CHC (Lohandi Guda) whose
                  storekeeper appeared to be very meticulous in terms of labeling and could be com-
                  mended for this best practice.

                     Although there was usually an informal separation of storage zones by pro-
                  curing agency (Government of India, Bank, state, other international agencies),
                  it was not formally organized and there was no clear separation between projects.
                  Similarly, the stock registers did not contain any information pertaining to storage
                  location of the drugs. In several occasions the DIR found pharmaceuticals bought
                  under the MCP mixed with others bought under National Vector Bourne Diseases
                  Control Program, for example.

   2.	 Temperature Control

   In all of the warehouses visited, the storage rooms had no temperature and
humidity control systems. In some cases, there were ventilators, but they were not
sufficient to keep the rooms at a cool temperature. Also, the ventilators were usu-
ally left off and only switched on when staff were active in the store room.

   The DIR inquired about the storage of rapid diagnostic kits that should be kept
at a temperature below 30ºC (or 40ºC for the latest ones) and was told that most
of the DMOs and SMOs indicated that these kits were usually immediately dis-
patched to the PHCs, which will have the necessary equipment to store medicines
and vaccines at a cool temperature and therefore could keep the diagnostics in
proper conditions.

   However, the DMO for the Durg district in Chhattisgarh who had a limited and
cramped storage room with no ventilator indicated that such situation could lead
to the alteration of diagnostic kits as the temperatures could easily reach 47º–48ºC
during the summer. This same DMO commented that the state usually procured
poor quality equipment and procured pharmaceuticals that the DMO did not have
the capacity to warehouse.

D.	Inventory Systems Used by the SMO and DMO
   All facilities visited by the DIR had dedicated stock clerks whose level of educa-
tion varied from basic (such as in Dhenkanal) to pharmacist (Cuttack). The inven-
tory system is usually first expired first out and is based on a handwritten stock
book/register system with generally a color-coded system whereby receipts are
written in red ink and disbursements are written in blue ink.

   At the district level for antimalaria drugs, the DIR had to rely on the date of
delivery and quantities to be able to trace back to a specific contract the commodi-
ties delivered by the state because the registers did not include the name of the
manufacturer nor the reference to RITES. At the state level, the stock register usu-
ally incorporated the name of the manufacturer and the RITES reference enabling
the DIR to trace the delivery of commodities from the manufacturer to the state
and downwards to each district.

   At the time of dispatch to other facilities, the stock documented the quantities
issued to each location but did not list individual batch numbers delivered to the
district or the PHC. The stock registers were usually organized time-wise, indexed
by type of goods and numbered in numerical order from the oldest to the newest



                                        485
India DIR (MCP)


                  transaction. None of the stock registers had references to the storage zones in order
                  to easily locate the drugs physically in the warehouses. In most cases, considering
                  the size of the storage room, the DIR did not find it a critical issue, but in some
                  instances the commodities were scattered in several different rooms of the same
                  building or different locations (SMO for Orissa) and only the staff in charge of the
                  store was able to locate the commodities. The DIR needed to survey all the storage
                  rooms in order to be able to locate and account for all the commodities.

                     In nearly all stock registers at the district level, individual entries did not indicate
                  the procurement agency (Government of India, state, RITES, other international
                  agencies) or the RITES contract reference, which made it difficult for the DIR to
                  identify deliveries with respect to specific Bank-financed contracts. Furthermore, in
                  some instances, the entries commingled deliveries of state or Bank-procured drugs,
                  sometimes mixing deliveries also received from any additional divisions (such as in
                  Maharashtra), making it difficult to track the deliveries and verify inventories from
                  one level to the other for a specific Bank-financed contract.

                     Upon request for supporting documents for specific RITES contracts with
                  regard to direct deliveries from the suppliers to the districts—in particular, bed
                  nets and synthetic pyrethroids—the stock officer provided the DIR a file that con-
                  tained for an individual commodity (or grouped transactions of the same com-
                  modity at similar periods) copies of the RITES inspection certificate, acceptance
                  certificates, copies of any invoice from the supplier, various correspondence, and
                  copies of any delivery receipt issued by the transporter.

                  E.	Inventory Documents and Records
                     The DMOs and SMOs visited by the DIR in general had good records of the
                  receipts of goods except for the few issues described previously. However, in a few
                  instances the DIR came across stock officers who were not able to provide the
                  relevant supporting documentation. The DIR concluded that these few instances
                  were specific to the DMO and SMO rather than a systemic pattern of disorganized
                  files. For example:

                      ■■   Dhenkanal District, Orissa state. The DIR noted that the record keeping
                           was disorganized. According to the stock clerk, there was a register for
                           drugs for years 2003–2004, but it did not contain any reference to vouchers
                           for the distribution of drugs. Furthermore, a register for years 2005–2006
                           had been created by the previous stock clerk, but it had not been updated.




                                                             486
                                                                       Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


            Similarly, when the DIR surveyed the storage rooms the DIR could not
            find the drugs as listed according to the stock register.

       ■■   SMO Raipur, Chhattisgarh state. The store officer said that the SMO had
            not retained stock registers older than 2004. Thus, the records for several
            contracts were not available for the DIR to review or to trace further dis-
            tribution of the drugs.

       ■■   Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh state. The stock officer noted that the state voucher
            (recording the delivery to the DMO and being the basis for the stock regis-
            ter entry) was received separately by courier and sometimes arrived before
            the commodities. Such lack of coordination sometimes created discrep-
            ancies.229 In case of direct deliveries, the transporter’s document was the
            basis for the entry.

F.	Inventory Management
       At the SMO level, the warehouse was replenished by the suppliers of drugs, bed
nets, and pyrethroids on the basis of consignee lists established at the national level
by RITES and the national malaria officer based on historical data on the epidemi-
ology situation. Although the bulk of the bed nets and pyrethroids were delivered
directly to the districts, the SMOs could also store such items as a buffer stock in
case of emergency.

       Regarding the distribution down the supply chain, the three SM Officers
explained to the DIR that every month, they received a status report on the imple-
mentation of the MCP from the districts. The SM Officer then met with the DM
Officers of all districts to discuss the balance of all their respective stocks and
receive the requests of delivery updated for the next six months.

       At the district level, stock clerks could receive commodities either from the state
or division warehouse (where applicable, e.g., Maharashtra) for drugs, or directly
from the suppliers for the bulky items such as bed nets and pyrethroids.

       On the disbursement side from the districts, the PHCs gave their requirement
monthly to the DM Officer during a meeting at the DMO. In some cases, when
the epidemiology situation required it, the PHCs were supplied on demand. The
PHC could either pick up the drugs themselves at the time of the monthly meet-
ing or have them delivered by the DMO. The DMO or stock clerks would moni-

229	
     In the case of contract RITES/MSM/MCP/05/2003/272, the stock officer had recorded that he received 20
liters of synthetic pyrethroids manufactured by Gharda and delivered by the state, based on a voucher he had
received from the state. But as the commodities were not delivered, he canceled the entry.

                  tor the stock of the PHCs as the PHC staff submitted a monthly report listing the
                  balances (starting and ending) for each type of drugs to ensure proper utilization
                  of the PHC’s stocks by comparing the results with positive cases following blood
                  testing.

                  G.	 Quality Testing
                     1.	 Tests for Damaged Goods

                     Stock clerks for both SMOs and DMOs indicated that they received the goods
                  and conducted a cursory inspection of the physical state of the packaging boxes and
                  listed the batches in the stock register. All stock clerks asserted that they counted
                  the boxes received by the manufacturer before signing the acknowledgment
                  receipt. Except in one district (Bastar in Chhattisgarh, where the DIR observed
                  broken plastic jars of 5,000 DEC tablets), stock clerks and DM Officers indicated
                  no receipts of damaged products.

                     2.	 Tests for Quality and Damaged Items

                     SM Officers and DM Officers for all districts indicated that an inspection and
                  test of the quality of the commodities were not conducted at the time of dispatch,
                  as testing occurred centrally at the producer’s facility prior to the drugs being
                  shipped to the state warehouses. Stock clerks checked that the RITES inspection
                  certificate was attached to the deliveries of drugs (at the SMO level) or bed nets
                  and pyrethroids (at the DMO level). The MCP staff does not, however, retain a
                  sample for control purposes in case there was an issue on a drug. DM Officers and
                  stock clerks indicated that they do not have the resources to do so and could not
                  perform such tests with the limited amount of staff and equipment. Both Maha-
                  rashtra and Orissa also added that the inspector for the state health services also
                  took random samples in order to test the quality of the drugs.

                     In most cases, the DM Officers indicated that they had never received any com-
                  plaints on the quality and efficiency of the drugs received. DM Officers indicated
                  that there was a good clinical response when the drugs were administered and
                  positive feedback from the medical officers in the PHC. Some of the DM Officers,
                  who were doctors at the district hospital or public general doctors, said they were
                  able to witness themselves the efficiency of the drugs.

                     3.	 Observed Quality Issues

                     In contrast to the positive feedback generally provided to the DIR at the facili-
                  ties it visited regarding the quality of the antimalaria commodities, there were a

few instances where the DM Officers and stock clerks noted some issues on the
quality of the products delivered. In all cases, the staff was only able to recall the
defective product and the name of the supplier, but was not able to link it to a spe-
cific RITES contract reference. Furthermore, as none of the facilities visited had
the ability to conduct chemical tests of the drugs, the feedback provided related
more to the general aspect of the commodities delivered. For example:

    ■■   Mayurbhanj, Orissa state. The DM Officer indicated that the district had
         faced some problems with the delivery of bed nets from EMCO, but not
         with any other commodity. These issues are described further in the Bed
         Nets section of this chapter.

    ■■   Cuttack, Orissa state. The stock clerk and pharmacist indicated that the
         district had faced only two problems. One of them related to receiving
         verbal complaints from households receiving the DEC tablets received
         in bulk (5,000 tablet jars). The complaints alleged that the tablets would
         quickly crumble and lose their color once distributed. The person the DIR
         spoke to remembered that these were Pure Pharma tablets and that the
         Assistant DM Officer had asked to receive blister strips instead of loose
         tablets to avoid this problem. The other problem related to the receipt of
         defective and poor quality bed nets from EMCO, which is described fur-
         ther in the Bed Nets section of this chapter.

    ■■   Dhenkanal, Orissa state. The DM Officer indicated that he had also received
         verbal complaints from the households receiving DEC tablets to fight
         Philaria during the Mass Drug Administration. The complaints alleged
         that the loose tablets received in bulk (5,000 tablet jars) absorbed moisture
         from the air and quickly crumbled and lost their color once distributed.
         None of the staff could remember the manufacturer of the tablets, but the
         DM Officer had suggested the state officer to ask for blister strips instead
         of loose tablets to avoid this problem.

    ■■   Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh state. The DM Officer indicated that there
         had been some questions on the efficiency of some synthetic pyrethroids
         (Alphacypermetrin) and the level of concentration, but he had no details
         pertaining to the specific contract. He added that these were just percep-
         tions as there had not been any independent chemical testing besides the
         RITES certificates. The state malaria officer, Mr. Kataryia indicated that
         there had been a drop in the prices of these insecticides and it might have




                                         489
India DIR (MCP)


                          affected the quality. He gave examples of price variations between the
                          beginning of the project and its end.

                  H.	 Monitoring of Expiry Dates
                     The SM Officers explained that drugs did not stay more than three to six months
                  in the warehouse; therefore, it was unlikely that any drugs left the state warehouse
                  with an expired date. They explained that if some drugs would be close to the
                  expiry date, they would contact the local district hospitals and DMOs to enquire
                  whether they needed additional stocks.

                     Similarly, the DM Officers explained that the drugs were always used before
                  the expiry date, as there is a high demand and short supply. The stock clerks said
                  that they manage the stock carefully, remained aware of expiry dates, and provided
                  a monthly update of the stock to the DM Officer. If some drugs were close to the
                  expiry date, the DM Officers would contact other DM Officers, other divisions, or
                  the state health services directors to alert these entities that the drugs should be
                  reallocated to other facilities.

                     The DIR did not detect any drugs that had expired during its visits to the ware-
                  houses. None of the DM Officers and SM Officers indicated that they had faced
                  such situations for Bank-financed drugs, and they all indicated being fully aware
                  of the disposal policies in place. One DM Officer recalled that he had received a
                  consignment of 11,000 primaquine tablets procured by the state that had expired
                  and indicated he had refused the delivery.

                  I.	Issues of Under-Deliveries
                     According to the DM Officers and SM Officers, the stock clerks counted the
                  boxes received by the manufacturer before signing the acknowledgment receipt.
                  Staff responsible for the stock management consistently stated that they never
                  accepted any damaged products delivered or consignment with lower quantities
                  than expected. In the events such short supply occurred, these officials stated that
                  they would have signed the acceptance receipt for the actual quantities delivered.

                     In most of the cases, the DIR found that the stock registers were consistent
                  between the SMOs and DMOs and with the physical stock on hand. However, the
                  DIR detected some discrepancies as described on the following pages.

       1.	 Commodities Could Not Be Accounted For

       The DIR detected discrepancies between the documentation available for
review and the actual stocks available, such as commodities delivered in lower
quantities than what the documentation indicates.230 The most egregious example
is where none of the commodities are delivered from one layer of the supply chain
to the next. For example:

       ■■   On RITES/MSM/MCP/05/2004/243, 520,000 chloroquine tablets were
            to be delivered by Nestor Pharmaceuticals. The SMO in Bhubaneswar
            had documentation representing that the DMO Dhenkanal should have
            received 520,000 tablets. Accordingly, the corresponding entry in the
            DMO stock register listed 520,000 tablets received on May 20, 2005. How-
            ever, as the DIR surveyed the DMO storage room, there was no trace of
            any of these tablets, although according to the stock register, there had
            been no dispatch of such tablets. The stock clerk was unable to account for
            these 520,000 tablets.

       ■■   On RITES/MSM/MCP/05/2003/221, 1.2 million chloroquine tablets were
            to be delivered by Pure Pharma. According to the stock registers of the
            Orissa SMO, the DMO Dhenkanal should have received two deliveries of
            1 million tablets in May 2004 and 200,000 in January 2005 and the DMO
            stock register indicated a balance of 57,000. However, as the DIR surveyed
            the DMO storage room, there was no trace of any of these tablets although
            according to the stock register, there had been no dispatch of such tablets.
            The stock clerk was unable to account for these 57,000 tablets.

       In Chhattisgarh state, the DIR found delivery issues in four of the five locations
it visited:

       ■■   Raipur. In the SMO warehouse, the DIR observed anomalies on the contract
            reference RITES/MSM/MCP/09/2003/229 for the delivery of Rapid Diag-

230	
     These issues can be divided in two types: (1) when commodities are delivered directly from the supplier to
the malaria official, the discrepancies between the initial list of consignees listed in the contracts and the actual
deliveries or the differences between the acceptance certificates and the stock registers reflect a problem in the
supply chain. These discrepancies can be explained by amendments to the contracts, reallocations of shipments
by the Government of India to answer emergency situations, or underdeliveries by the supplier. The DIR tried
whenever possible and whenever the documentation was available to follow up on these matters. Such problems
could occur for direct deliveries of bed nets and pyrethroids from the manufacturers to the DMOs and for anti-
malaria drugs from the producers to the SMOs; and (2) when the DIR noted discrepancies between the records
from the SMOs and the DMOs supporting documentation, or between the stock registers and the actual inven-
tory in the various warehouses, such issues might have related to poor record keeping or be the results of reas-
signment of shipments by the SMOs. The DIR is not in a position to determine if such failures to update registers
at the receipts of goods or/and at the dispatch to DMOs and PHCs, or to document reallocation of commodities,
was intentional or the result of limited capacities of the local staff.

                              nostic Kits by Span Diagnostics. Documents reviewed by the DIR showed
                              that the SMO should receive 125,000 Rapid Diagnostic Kits according to
                              the consignee list provided by RITES and the SMO. However, the stock
                              register indicated that the delivery was only 123,750—a short of 1,250.

                         ■■   Durg. The DIR identified a minor issue regarding contract reference
                              RITES/MSM/MCP/08/2000/251 for the delivery of bed nets by Chemi-
                              cals International. Asked if he faced a situation where consignment was of
                              lower quantities than expected, the DM Officer indicated that he had faced
                              two similar situations for direct deliveries of bed nets where there were
                              discrepancies between the invoice and the actual deliveries. The company
                              Chemicals delivered bags of bed nets which would have a couple less bed
                              nets out of a hundred. The DM Officer complained to the company and
                              said he would provide the letters to the DIR.231

                         ■■   Kanker. The DIR had numerous difficulties in trying to reconcile the stock
                              registers and the actual inventory held in the DMO’s storage.

                         In Maharashtra state, the DIR also detected similar delivery issues in four of the
                  five locations it visited.232

                         2.	 Systemic Shortage Issues on Some Contracts

                         In the case of two contracts reviewed, the DIR identified the same issues in
                  several locations. Further review of the documentation made available by RITES
                  did not yield any explanations in terms of amendments of the contracts or reallo-
                  cations of consignment to other consignees. Due to this lack of supporting docu-
                  mentation, the DIR was unable to determine whether such short deliveries are the
                  result of intentional fraud by the supplier or poor record keeping by the various
                  DMOs and SMOs.

                         ■■   Contract RITES/MSM/MCP/08/2005/272 for the delivery of liquid pyre-
                              throids by Gharda. At some locations the DIR found short supplies in
                              comparison to the initial consignee lists. However, the final acceptance
                              certificates were issued consistently in accordance with the actual deliver-
                              ies. Nevertheless, the DIR was unable to locate any amendments of the


                  231	
                      Despite the DIR’s request to review this correspondence in India, waiting onsite while the clerk officer was
                  searching his records, and follow-up requests through the state officer, the DIR did not receive these letters.
                  232	
                      For example, RITES/MSM/MCP/15/2004/266 was for the delivery of chloroquine tablets by Pure Pharma.
                  According to the stock register from the SMO in Pune, the ADHS should have received 600,000 tablets in one
                  delivery. However, the stock register of the ADHS Nagpur listed two deliveries in October 2006 (78,000 tablets)
                  and November 2006 (480,000 tablets) totaling 558,000 tablets, i.e., a short supply of 42,000 tablets.

■■   Contract RITES/MSM/MCP/06/2004/257 for the delivery of Rapid Diag-
     nostic Kits by Orchid Biomedical Systems. According to the stock register
     of the SMO Chhattisgarh in Raipur, the state had received 190,000 of these
     kits. The DIR found issues in the further distribution of these kits in the
     following locations in Chhattisgarh:

     ❏❏   Kanker. The DMO should have received three deliveries for a total
          of 18,750 units in 2005, but the DIR was not able to trace any docu-
          mentation regarding the last one in November 2005 for 7,650 units.
          There was no entry in the stock register or any supporting voucher
          for receipt/dispatch of these Rapid Diagnostic Kits. Furthermore, for
          the first two deliveries in August 2005, there was no stock available
          although the stock registers indicated that there should be a balance
          of 60 available from each delivery. The DM Officer argued that the kits
          had been dispatched to the local hospital lab but there was no sup-
          porting documentation for this assertion and the hospital lab was not
          open at the time of the DIR’s visit, preventing the DIR to verify this.

     ❏❏   Baster. Out of the three deliveries received in 2005 by the DMO for a
          total of 37,250 Rapid Diagnostic Kits, there was a 50 unit discrepancy
          between the entry in the SMO register and the corresponding receipt
          in the DMO’s register for the last delivery in November 2005 (16,250
          delivered by the SMO but 16,200 recorded by the DMO).

     ❏❏   Durg. Based on the SMO’s stock register, the DMO should have received
          two deliveries in 2005 for a total of 31,800 units. However, according
          to the DMO’s stock register, the first delivery in August 2005 was only
          15,000 instead of 18,000 initially (it seems that there had been a cor-
          rection of the SMO’s register to make it consistent with the DMO’s
          one at 15,000). For the second delivery of 13,800 Rapid Diagnostic
          Kits in November 2005, there was no entry in the stock ledger nor
          any available supporting voucher or stock available. It seemed that the
          shipment was never received.

                  Procurement at The State and District Level
                  In its review of procurement at the state and district level, the DIR found indica-
                  tors that the DMOs reviewed utilized improper procurement methods in violation
                  of the MCP credit agreement and that bidders engaged in fictitious competition. In
                  Nagpur, the DIR found that the DMO improperly used direct contracting to award
                  contracts that were supposed to be procured using local shopping. Further, the
                  DIR found that one company—Surgimed Enterprises—won all of the contracts
                  awarded in this manner, raising the possibility of favoritism. The DIR also iden-
                  tified patterns indicative of collusive bidding behavior among Mediequip Enter-
                  prises, Surgimed Enterprises, Agrawal Scientific, and Advance Surgical & Scien-
                  tific. Almost 75 percent (by value) of the DIR-reviewed Nagpur contracts exhibited
                  indicators of fraud or corruption.

                         In Nasik, the DIR found that the DMO improperly utilized direct contracting to
                  award contracts of relatively high value. Further, the DIR identified three pairs of
                  allegedly competing bidders—Sigma Enterprises and Unique Enterprises; Manoj
                  Trading and Tushar Sales; and Raj Art and Jadhav Rubber Stamp—that were asso-
                  ciated with each other, e.g., by sharing the same address or phone number. Other
                  bidders submitted bid documents that: (1) exhibited near-identical layouts, for-
                  mat, and language; and (2) quoted bid prices that increased in equal increments.
                  A majority (by value) of the DIR-reviewed Nasik contracts exhibited indicators of
                  fraud or corruption.

                  A.	 Local Contract Review Methodology
                         Although the MCP ICR states that only four percent of the MCP’s expenditures
                  were spent through means other than ICB, limited international bidding (LIB),
                  and NCB procurement, both the DIR and the MCP Task Team Leader calculated
                  that 40 percent of MCP procurements were conducted through non–ICB, LIB, or
                  NCB procurement.233 This is in line with the PAD’s pre-project expectations.234

                         For the review of contracts procured by the states and districts, the DIR chose
                  to review the procurement of contracts procured by the Nagpur and Nasik DMOs
                  in Maharashtra. These two districts were chosen based on the volume of contracts
                  procured and in coordination with the local contract reviews of the other DIR

                  lated by deducting the ICB/NCB procured by RITES and which represented USD 61.3 millions from the total
                  disbursed under MCP according to the ICR was USD 103.8 million.

projects. Whenever possible, the DIR preferred locations other than state capitals,
as logistical and other difficulties of visiting such locations might have inhibited
Bank supervision and post-procurement review teams, meaning that these dis-
tricts were more apt to engage in corrupt practices if less supervised. The DIR
sorted by value all local contracts procured in the two districts and requested doc-
umentation regarding the 50 contracts with the highest value. The DIR focused
its review on local shopping procurement and reviewed direct contracting only in
cases when it was apparent that the DMO had utilized the improper procurement
method. The DIR did not conduct physical inspections and/or end-use audits of
any of the local contracts

B.	 Local Contract Data
       Under the MCP, the states’ and districts’ main procurements were for contrac-
tual services (spray workers wages, honoraria to Malaria Link Volunteers); consul-
tants (project director; IEC consultant; accountant; etc.); local IEC activities; and
supply of blood slide kits. 235 The DMOs were supposed to use direct contracting
for hiring consulting services, and use local shopping procedures for the supply of
IEC activities and goods.236

       The Nagpur DMO provided data indicating that, between January 1999 and
June 2006, it had procured 229 contracts through local shopping—primarily con-
tracts for laboratory consumables, office stationery, and printing of forms—and
procured 10 contracts through direct contracting. The local shopping contracts
had a total value of INR 2,466,880 (USD 54,820), while the direct contracting con-
tracts had a value of INR 217,740 (USD 4,839). The DIR reviewed 50 local shop-
ping contracts worth INR 1,308,338 (USD 29,074), representing 22 percent of the
district’s local shopping contracts by number and 53 percent of its local shopping
contracts by value.

       The Nasik DMO provided data indicating that it had procured 65 contracts
through local shopping between May 1999 and August 2006, and had procured
103 contracts through direct contracting between June 1999 and August 2006. The
local shopping contracts had a total value of INR  827,397 (USD  18,387), while
the direct contracting contracts had a total value of INR 3,039,884 (USD 67,553).
The DIR reviewed 51 local shopping contracts worth INR 778,997 (USD 17,311),

                         Based on documents provided to the DIR, it appears that: (1) only one contract in
                  Nasik was the subject of a Bank procurement post-review; (2) no contracts in Nag-
                  pur were post-reviewed by the Bank; and (3) no project audits were conducted in
                  either of these two locations. The DIR is, therefore, the first detailed review of these
                  procurements ever conducted by the Bank. Accordingly, it appears that the Bank’s
                  post-review system inadequately addressed these decentralized procurements.

                         Sixty-four  percent (by number) of the DIR-reviewed Nagpur local contracts
                  exhibited indicators of fraud or corruption, affecting 72.7 percent of the value of
                  the reviewed Nagpur local contracts.237

                         1.	 The DMO Improperly Sole-Sourced for Goods Early in the Project

                         The DIR found indicators that, early in the MCP’s life, the DMO sought quota-
                  tions through local shopping and then awarded subsequent contracts to the origi-
                  nal winning firm on a sole sourced basis, in violation of the MCP Credit Agree-
                  ment.238 The contracts reviewed contained procurement documentation justifying
                  the sole sourcing practice, which appears to be acceptable under Government of
                  India procurement rules.239



                     Thirty-two of the 50 contracts reviewed exhibited indicators of fraud and corruption. These contracts were
                  237	

                  worth a total of INR 933,230 (USD 27,738).

                       During DIR field visits, the DIR was informed that this was a generally accepted practice under Government
                  of India rules.

   For example, when reviewing the purchases of glass slides, the DIR reviewed the
documentation for the first and fifth through seventh contracts. The first contract
was procured through local shopping, but the latter three were procured through
direct contracting. A comparison of the DMO’s bid prices for all seven contracts
over time the DMO revealed the sole-sourcing practice because the DMO reported
the number of bidders and bid prices as constant for all the bids (Figure 22).

1999–2005




Note: The DIR reviewed the contract documents for the contracts shaded in lighter-colored boxes.

   Further, all of the improperly procured contracts—for two separate goods—
were awarded to the same company: Surgimed Enterprises. This indicates that the
DMO may have improperly favored this firm.

   While the DMO’s contract documents demonstrated that it used direct con-
tracting, the DMO initially informed the DIR that it had procured these contracts
through local shopping (Table 17). Given the clarity of the contract documents
themselves, this contradiction is an indicator of either negligence or misrepresen-
tation by the DMO.

                         2.	 Four Companies Engaged in Behavior Indicative of Collusion

                         Regardless of the DMO’s improper sole sourcing to Surgimed, the DIR found
                  indicators that Surgimed colluded with Agrawal Scientific (Agrawal), Mediequip
                  Enterprises (Mediequip), and possibly Advance Surgical & Scientific (Advance) on
                  contracts for glass slides, slide boxes, and fish ponds. These four firms ultimately
                  won 52 percent (by number) of all local shopping contracts in the district, repre-
                  senting 61 percent of the total value of the district’s local shopping contracts.240

                         Two Competing Companies Shared One Address. The DIR noted that, as of
                  2002, Surgimed and Agrawal listed the same address on their bidding documents.
                  These two firms competed against each other in 52 percent of Nagpur’s MCP local
                  shopping contracts. Their common address is an indicator of possible collusion.

                         Companies Engaged in Bid Rotation over Time and within Tenders.
                  Surgimed was awarded all of Nagpur’s glass slide contracts between 1999 and early
                  2000 through improper sole sourcing practices. For the next two years, however,
                  the DIR observed that Surgimed and Mediequip alternated winning additional
                  glass slide contracts by systematically rotating their prices between one contract
                  and the next. The winning bidder always quoted a unit price of INR 58, while the
                  losing bidder always quoted a unit price of between INR 61 and 63.241 In 2002, the


                     In total, these four firms won 119 of the 229 local shopping contracts worth INR 1,507,801 (out of
                  240	

                  INR 2,466,800 total).
                  241	
                      Between 1999 and July 2002, Surgimed won 10 out of 13 of glass slide contracts for glass slides at a constant
                  price of INR 58. On these tenders, Mediequip quoted a price of INR 61.75.



                                                                         498
                                                                          Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


roles of the two companies switched: Mediequip consistently won glass slide con-
tracts with an INR 58 unit price, while Surgimed quoted a losing price of INR 63.242
Procurement data further indicates that Advance and Agrawal (which appears
related to Surgimed) may have bid on these contracts to provide the appearance of
(fictitious) competition. Figure 23 summarizes these four firms’ bidding patterns
in four districts in Maharashtra:

       A similar pattern appeared in the four firms’ bids for slide box contracts, but in
this case Surgimed and Agrawal won the majority of contracts. As with glass slides,
the DIR found that the DMO improperly sole sourced all contracts to Surgimed
during the project’s first year.243 In 2000, the firms began alternating contracts and
bid prices, though the slide box contracts exhibited indicators of price inflation:
Surgimed and Mediequip raised their bid prices to Agrawal’s level, and Agrawal
replaced Surgimed as Mediequip’s alternating contractor. This pattern raised the


   There was only one occasion in which Agrawal won a glass slide contract that, by pattern, “should” have been
242	

won by Surgimed. Otherwise, Agrawal and Advance consistently bid higher prices.
243	
    From the outset of the project, Surgimed won all slide box contracts at the same unit price, while all other
bidders repeatedly bid the same losing unit prices.

                  winning contract price by 60 percent.244 In addition, Agrawal and Mediequip sys-
                  tematically alternated their bid prices by exactly INR 16 or INR 18 for contracts
                  between March 1999 and January 2000, and by exactly INR 7 or INR 8 for con-
                  tracts between April 2004 and December 2005. Figure 24 demonstrates these bid
                  price patterns.

                         Mediequip, Surgimed, and Agrawal also alternated contracts for fish food and
                  fish ponds and won a majority of the district’s MCP-funded contracts for those
                  products (Figure 25):




                  244	
                      The DMO-provided data indicates that in March 1999 (WBCN 13089), August 1999 (WBCN 12948),
                  October 1999 (WBCN 13163), and January 2000 (WBCN 12934) Surgimed quoted a slide box unit price of
                  INR 70, while Agrawal quoted a unit price of INR 119. Surgimed won all these contracts. However, in August
                  2001 (WBCN 12992), October 2003 (WBCN 13017), and February 2005 (WBCN 13130), Agrawal quoted a new
                  unit price of INR 112, while Surgimed quoted a unit price of INR 126. These prices are 60 percent and 80 percent
                  higher, respectively, than the firms’ earlier unit prices for the very same equipment. Mediequip’s prices followed a
                  similar pattern.

    Further, in addition to identifying rotation patterns over time per good, the
DIR also identified bid rotation across goods within two tenders. First, on Febru-
ary 1, 2005, the DMO awarded four contracts for four different items to the four
firms; each firm won one contract. Second, on May 18, 2005, the DMO awarded six
contracts for six different items to the four firms, with Surgimed and Mediequip
each winning two contracts and Advance and Agrawal each winning one contract.

                     3.	 Companies Submitted Bids Close to, or Identical to, the Bid Cost
                     Estimate

                     In 11 of the 50 contracts reviewed by the DIR, the final contract amount varied
                  less than one  percent from the DMO-determined bid cost estimate. In eight of
                  these 11 cases, the contract price exactly matched the bid cost estimate. Winning
                  bids with prices so close to the bid cost estimate are an indicator that the procuring
                  body improperly leaked the bid cost estimate, often to preferred bidders.

                     Of the eight contracts exactly matching the bid cost estimate, Surgimed won
                  four, Mediequip won three, and Agrawal won one. Table 20 shows the results of
                  the 11 procurements.

       4.	 The Filing System in Nagpur Was Adequate

       Nagpur DMO representatives were able to produce all documents requested by
the DIR. The DIR found these documents to be filed in a satisfactory manner, and
they could be retrieved with ease. It thus appears that the Nagpur DMO had the
capacity to properly file and maintain procurement documentation.

       5.	 Summary and Post-Review

       As noted above, 64 percent (by number) of the DIR-reviewed Nagpur local con-
tracts exhibited indicators of fraud or corruption, affecting 72.7 percent of the value
of the reviewed Nagpur local contracts. This demonstrates significant procurement
problems affecting a set of tenders that the Bank neither supervised nor reviewed.
Table 21 summarizes the frequency of the indicators that the DIR observed.

       Based on documents made available to the DIR, the Bank did not conduct a
post-review of the contracts procured in Nagpur. The Bank was, therefore, unaware
of the indicators of fraud identified by the DIR.

D.	Nasik
       Twenty-three of the 51 Nasik local contracts reviewed (or 45 percent) by the
DIR representing 50 percent of the contracts’ total values exhibited indicators of
fraud or corruption.245

    Contracts exhibiting indicators totaled INR 465,950 (USD 10,354), or 50 percent, of the total value of local

                         1.	 The DMO Improperly Sole-Sourced Goods Contracts throughout
                         the Project

                         The DIR identified 23 instances in which the DMO improperly utilized direct
                  contracting despite initially informing the DIR that the contracts were procured
                  through local shopping procedures. The total value of these contracts—INR 381,292
                  (USD 8,473)—constituted 46 percent of the value of the 65 local shopping con-
                  tracts, and 12.5 percent of the value of the directly awarded contracts, issued by
                  the Nasik DMO.246

                         Of particular importance is the improper procurement of two contracts:
                  WBCN 13463, an INR 104,000 (USD 2,311) contract for the procurement of IEC
                  oil paintings painted at the local/village level; and WBCN 13556, an INR 198,324
                  (USD  4,407) contract for the printing of forms.247 These contracts are important
                  because, combined, they represented a significant portion of the MCP funds spent
                  in Nasik: their combined value of INR 302,324 (USD 6,718) was 38 percent of the
                  value of the 51 contracts reviewed by the DIR and 37 percent of the total value of
                  all local shopping contracts issued in Nasik.248 When asked to explain their decision
                  to improperly directly contract these two tenders, DMO staff members were unable
                  to explain the first contract and defended the second by saying only that the direct
                  contracting was justified because the recipient was a state-owned enterprise.

                         In addition to these contracts, the DIR found that, in 10 cases, direct contract-
                  ing was used to procure goods such as steel cupboards and bags and to conduct
                  IEC activities. The DMO also used direct contracting for vehicle maintenance on
                  12 occasions for a total amount of INR 39,709 (USD 882). Six of these 12 expendi-
                  tures were for amounts above the DMO’s stated direct contracting limit and ranged
                  in price from INR 2,000 to over INR 8,000.




                  246	
                       The total value of the contracts reviewed by the DIR was INR 778,997, and the total value of all local shop-
                  ping contracts in Nasik was INR 827,397. The Nasik DMO awarded 103 contracts through direct contracting
                  worth INR 3,039,884. These calculations do not include the two contracts, WBCNs 13463 and 13556, discussed
                  in the next paragraph. Including these two contracts, the total value of contracts that were procured by direct
                  contracting (instead of local shopping) is INR 683,616 (USD 15,191), equal to 83 percent of the value of all 65
                  local shopping contracts issued by the Nasik DMO.
                  247	
                      The contractor for WBCN 13463 was not identified in the DMO’s procurement documents. WBCN 13556
                  was awarded to the Directorate of Government Printing and Stationery, a state-owned enterprise.
                  248	
                       This calculation includes the value of the two contracts in the count of 51. However, these two contacts
                  were procured through direct contracting. Therefore, the value of the remaining 49 local shopping contracts
                  is INR 476,673 (USD 10,593). The value of WBCNs 13463 and 13556—INR 302,324 (USD 6,718)—is equal to
                  63.4 percent of the value of all 49 local shopping contracts reviewed.

       2.	 Bidders with Identical Phone Numbers and/or Addresses
       Competed for the Same Contracts

       The DIR identified three sets of instances, affecting 16 contracts, in which firms
sharing the same phone number and/or address competed against each other for
the same contracts. This is an indicator of possible collusion among the firms,
which bid to create the appearance of competition. The three instances were as
follows:

        ■■   In nine contracts, two out of three competing firms—Manoj Trading and
             Tushar Sales—shared the same address.249 The nine contracts were worth
             INR 147,918 (USD 3,287), which was 19 percent of the total value of Nasik’s
             local shopping contracts. Manoj Trading won six of these contracts, while
             Tushar won one of them.

        ■■   In six other contracts, two bidders—Sigma Enterprises and Unique Enter-
             prises—shared the same phone number.250 Sigma won all six contracts,
             which were worth a total of INR 42,433 (USD 943).

        ■■   In another contract, two companies—Raj Art and Jadhav Rubber Stamp—
             that shared the same phone number and address bid against only one
             other firm, and Raj Art won the contract.251

       3.	 Competing Bids’ Language and Presentation Exhibited Strong
       Textual Similarities

       In 10 out of 51 contracts, multiple firms’ price quotation documents exhibited
strong textual similarities that indicate possible collusion among the firms when
preparing their bids. The total value of these contracts was INR 88,885 (USD 1,975),
equal to 11.4 percent of the value of the 51 contracts reviewed. Examples of simi-
larities between the quotations were:

        ■■   For contract WBCN 13509, two firms—Shree Printers and Praful Arts—
             submitted bid quotations with identical formats, layouts, language, and
             punctuation.252
249	
     The third bidder on these contracts was Mahavir Medical, which won two contracts. The nine contracts were
for a range of goods, including guppy fish plastic bags (WBCN 11767), latrine pipe nylon caps (WBCN 11780),
micro slides (WBCN 13441), rope with nets (WBCN 11822), potassium dichromate (WBCN 11657), and plastic
buckets (WBCN 11664).
250	
    Sigma bid on contracts WBCN 13536, 13603, 13498, 13445, 13566, and 13499. Trimurti Sales Corporation
also bid for all of these contracts.

     For example, the two firms’ price quotation layouts share the following features: “Quotation” is written in the

line contains the following script: “All types of Offset and Screen Printing.” Both quotations begin with, “Dear Sir,

                          ■■    For contracts WBCN 13472, 13577, and 13535, two firms—Sai’s and
                                Firozee’s—submitted bid quotations with the same format, font, and punc-

                                Sharada Enterprises and Bright Printers—submitted quotations that were
                                handwritten (in Marathi) in a hand-drawn table that contained the same
                                language, format, and punctuation as Firozee’s bid quotation.254

                          ■■    For contracts WBCN 13589 and 13450, the winning bidder—Boon—sub-
                                mitted its quotation on a pre-printed form that was completed by hand
                                in English. The quotations of the two losing bidders, Dream IT Solutions
                                and Reva solutions, were submitted on photocopies that: (1) appear to
                                have been generated by the same photocopy machine because they exhibit
                                matching printing errors (i.e., a section on the right side of the page that
                                did not print properly); and (2) were submitted in envelopes of the same
                                make and cream white color as Boon’s form.

                          ■■    For contract WBCN 13481, two firms—Parakh Appliances and Parakh
                                Enterprises—submitted bid quotations with multiple similarities, includ-
                                ing identical format, identical language, and neighboring addresses on the
                                same street.255

                         Amounts

                         The DIR observed five instances in which bidders’ prices appeared to be related
                  by a common formula. The five contracts exhibiting this indicator had a total value
                  of INR 44,458 (USD 988), which was equal to 5.7 percent of the total value of all
                  Nasik local shopping contracts. The contracts are as follows:

                          ■■    On contract, WBCN 13548, the bidders’ per-unit price quotations differed
                                by exactly INR 20 each. Uday Arts bid INR 240 per item; Mangesh Art bid
                                INR 260; and Brashman bid INR 280.


                  As per your esteemed enquiry, we are quoting our lowest for the same as follows [space]:”. The punctuation and
                  spacing of the two quotations are identical, with the only difference being that Shree wrote its name in italics.
                  The two firms’ addresses also are on the same street, with only slightly different numbers.
                  253	
                         For example, both firms’ quotations included the text “Receiver’s Sign.” and “Authorized Sign.”

                      Parakh Appliances’ quotation used a pre-printed quotation form and a printed envelope. Parakh Enterprises’
                  quotation, which appears to have been created on a word processor, replicates the format and the language of
                  Parakh Appliances’ quotation. For example, both quotation forms have the following sentence written above a
                  table of the firm’s prices: “We are pleased to quote our most competitive rates as follows.” Further, the envelope in
                  which Parakh Appliances submitted its bid stated three addresses; the second was 26, Sarda Sankul, M.G., which
                  appears to be one building over from Parakh Enterprises’ 25, Sarda Sankul, M.G. address.

   5.	 The Filing System in Nasik Was Adequate

   Nasik DMO representatives were able to produce all documents requested by
the DIR. The DIR found these documents to be filed in a satisfactory manner, and
documents—including requests for quotations, quotations, evaluation sheets, and
purchase orders—could be retrieved with ease. It thus appears that the Nasik DMO
had the capacity to properly file and maintain procurement documentation.

   6.	 Summary and Post-Review

   As noted above, 45 percent (by number) of the DIR-reviewed Nasik local con-
tracts exhibited indicators of fraud or corruption, affecting 50.3 percent of the value
of the reviewed Nasik local contracts. As in Nagpur, this demonstrates significant
procurement problems affecting a set of tenders that the Bank neither supervised
nor reviewed. Table 22 summarizes the frequency of the indicators that the DIR
observed.

                         Based on documents made available to the DIR, it appears that the Bank’s pro-
                  curement post-review examined only one contract in Nasik.256 The DIR identified
                  indicators of fraud that were not observed by the procurement post-review.




                  Project Reports and
                  Assessments
                  The Bank attempts to promote project effectiveness and safeguard projects from
                  abuse through supervision and assessment of project implementation. To assess
                  the effectiveness of this mechanism, the DIR reviewed the project’s reports and
                  assessments and analyzed: (1) whether they found issues similar to the ones identi-
                  fied by the DIR; and (2) how the Bank addressed these. The DIR also reviewed how
                  the Bank addressed complaints filed regarding the MCP, because such complaints
                  often provide strong indicators of problems with aspects of the project.

Supervision Documents

A.	 Audit Reports
       The MCP Credit Agreement required annual audits of the project’s finances.257
The DIR received 86 MCP audit reports, including:258

        ■■    Yearly Revolving Fund Special Account Audit Certificates, which opine
              whether “withdrawals from [the] Special Account were in accordance with
              the provisions of the … loan agreement and [whether the] special account
              statement … gives a true and fair view of the special account”;259

        ■■    Yearly Audit Certificates and Inspection reports prepared by the Office
              of the Director General of Audit, which opine whether “the expenditure
              statement/financial statements read with the observations [contained
              therein] represent a true and fair view of the implementation (and opera-
              tion) of the Project for the year”;260

        ■■    Yearly Audit Reports, Related Opinions, and Utilization Certificates, con-
              ducted by external auditors, on state consolidated financial statements and
              opine, in part, on whether expenditures were project-related and incurred
              in accordance with applicable rules;261 and

        ■■    Yearly Audit Reports, Related Opinions, and Utilization Certificates, con-

              part, on whether expenditures were project-related and incurred in accor-
              dance with applicable rules.262

       In its review of MCP audit reports, the DIR identified more than 50 instances
of stated weaknesses in internal project financial controls, which facilitate fraud
and corruption by permitting inappropriate or incomplete accounting entries that
can hide misappropriation of funds. The audit reports also note more than 20 spe-
cific indicators of possible fraud and corruption—such as bid tampering, contract
257	
       MCP Credit Agreement, sec. 4.01.
258	
     The DIR was provided only five external audits by independent auditors of national, state, or district project
finances. Prior to 2003–2004, state audit reports were not required to be sent to the Bank, but instead were sent
to the Malaria Project Directorate and reviewed by the CAG as part of its overall project audit. Consequently,
the first state- and district-level audit provided to the DIR was for the project year ending March 31, 2004—five
years after the project began. G.N.V. Ramana, Senior Public Health Specialist, letter to C.S. Aggarwal re: Malaria

                  splitting, and possible collusion—which are consistent with those identified by the
                  DIR’s MCP procurement reviews.

                         The MCP audit reports provided the Bank with information about many pos-
                  sible problems with the MCP’s implementation, although they do not indicate the
                  pervasiveness of these problems. Yet despite the identification of these problems,
                  the Bank’s supervision documents—such as implementation status reports and
                  project status reports—did not appear to address these issues or modify the proj-
                  ect’s performance ratings because of them.

                         To its credit, correspondence provided to the DIR indicates that the Bank’s
                  task team was proactive in obtaining and reviewing these audit reports, and in an
                  April 2006 letter the Task Team Leader told the Joint Director of the National Vec-
                  tor Borne Disease Control Program that, “The internal control framework needs
                  considerable strengthening in all states.”263 While correspondence provided by the
                  Task Team did evidence the fact that certain issues, such as the audit failure in
                  Orissa and the fraud in Koraput,264 were being addressed, the documents provided
                  to the DIR were insufficient to determine whether the Task Team systematically
                  addressed the many problems noted by the audits.

                         The MCP audit reports noted the following indicators of fraud that corroborate
                  and expand upon the DIR’s findings:

                         1.	 Internal Control Weaknesses

                         The most frequent internal control weakness was the lack of reconciliation of
                  project accounting records, which makes fraudulent transactions harder to iden-
                  tify by making the movement of project funds more difficult to follow. The DIR-re-
                  viewed audit reports noted more than 20 of these reconciliation failures, including
                  failures to confirm: (1) whether advanced funds were spent; (2) whether project
                  financial statements match the Statement of Expenditures submitted to the Bank;
                  and (3) whether the project’s financial records reconciled with its bank accounts.
                  These problems occurred in, among other states, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh,
                  Maharashtra, Orissa, and Rajasthan.265

       The audit reports noted at least 18 instances of incomplete or missing docu-
mentation, such as missing bills, receipts, or other evidence of payment.266 In nine
other cases, audit reports noted cash-handling problems such as payments above
approved limits, failure to record transactions, or lump-sum withdrawals for pay-
ment of specific invoices.267 And 10 audit reports, principally regarding districts in
Maharashtra, noted that physical verification of assets was not performed.268 All
of these problems can hide inappropriate expenditures or the misappropriation of
project physical assets.

       Noteworthy, auditors in Orissa were unable to express any opinion on the
financial statements of almost 50 percent of the state’s districts in 2003–2004, and
24  percent of its districts in 2004–2005, because of a range of problems—from
inability to create trial balances to failure to maintain ledgers—that created a lack
of sufficient auditable records.269 The auditor’s inability to render any opinion on
a district’s finances indicates a complete breakdown of the districts’ accounting
systems. The DIR notes that the Bank is currently in the process of evaluating
whether or not to seek reimbursement from the Government of India for expendi-
tures incurred in Orissa districts during the period 2005–2006.270

       2.	 Indicators of Possible Fraud and Corruption

       The bulk of the audit reports’ fraud indicators regarded internal control weak-
nesses. Because the DIR did not analyze project financial records, these indicators
expand upon and supplement the DIR’s findings. But the Government of India
and state auditors also noticed specific indicators of fraud and corruption which
overlapped with the DIR’s findings, including the following:

                          ■■    Lack of Competitive Bidding. Audit reports stated that, in seven districts in
                                Maharashtra, contracts were bid by seeking quotations from one or only
                                a few firms.271

                          ■■    Contract Splitting. Audit reports stated that, in 11 districts in Maharashtra
                                and two in Orissa, contract orders were split to avoid procurement bid-
                                ding requirements.272

                          ■■    Possible Misappropriation of Project Funds. The 2004–2005 audit report for
                                the Koraput district of Orissa noted that local project officials took out an
                                INR 500,000 loan on the same day when the project’s accounts contained
                                an INR  495,453 balance; the auditors concluded that “this phenomena
                                [sic] strengthens the indication of [the] non-existence of physical cash

              and its misappropriation.”276 Similarly, the 2004–2005 audit report for
              the Nawrangpur district of Orissa stated that INR 497,740 that had been
              booked as a project expense actually was transferred to a bank account in
              the name of “Zss-Social Marketing, MMN, Nawrangpur.”277 It is unclear
              whether this was a legitimate transaction.

        ■■    Possible Manipulation of Project Accounts. The 2005–2006 Madhya Pradesh
              audit report stated that a District Malaria Control Society’s office cash
              book contained “too much overwriting and use of whitener, which is
              against the principles of bookkeeping and may lead to manipulation in
              the accounts.”278

        ■■    Improper Expenditures. The 2004–2005 audit report for the Koraput dis-
              trict of Orissa noted that INR  100,167 was spent on vehicles unrelated
              to the MCP.279 It is unclear whether the Bank was reimbursed for these
              funds.

        ■■    Possibly Fraudulent Payments to Contractors. The 2004–2005 audit reports
              of 11 districts in Orissa note that payments to sprayer laborers were of
              “doubtful nature” because they were not properly documented, approved,
              and were “accepted” by the contractors before payment was made.280 A
              Bank procurement post-review in Orissa identified the same issue as a
              possible problem.281

        ■■    Contractor Payment without Acceptance Certificates. The Government of
              India’s 2003–2004 MCP audit report stated that the National Vector Borne
              Disease Control Program had directed RITES to release final 10 percent
              payment on a range of contracts even though project officials had not
              issued goods acceptance certificates for those goods.282

                  B.	 Procurement Post-Reviews
                         The Bank conducts procurement post-reviews to: (1) verify the procurement
                  and contracting procedures; (2) verify technical compliance and physical comple-
                  tion; (3) review contract management issues; (4) determine whether adequate pro-
                  curement, planning, implementation, and monitoring systems are in place; and (5)
                  identify remedies to correct any noted deficiencies.283 To assess whether the Bank’s
                  MCP post-reviews captured the procurement problems identified by the DIR, the
                  DIR reviewed six procurement post-review reports for 88 MCP tenders performed
                  in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and
                  Orissa.284

                         1.	 Indicators of Possible Fraud and Corruption

                         With only one exception, the post-reviews did not use a contract selection
                  methodology designed to obtain a representative sample of contracts to review.285
                  This may limit the reviews’ ability to identify patterns of procurement problems.
                  Despite this limitation, the post-reviews identified some of the same issues found
                  by the DIR—including improper sole-sourcing of contracts, contract splitting, and
                  unapproved tender document modifications—though they did not identify the
                  many indicators of possible collusive rings among bidding firms. The post-reviews’
                  findings included the following:

                          ■■    Use of Improper Procurement Methods. The post-reviews identified 12 ten-
                                ders, affecting contracts worth INR  4,160,775, in which procurements
                                were sole-sourced rather than procured through national shopping.286 This
                                corroborates the DIR’s finding of this practice in local MCP contracting.

                          ■■    Improper Bid Solicitations. The post-reviews identified 19 tenders in
                                Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Madhya Pradesh, affecting contracts
                                worth INR  4,426,607, in which bids were solicited verbally rather than
                                by letter.287 This practice violated the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines and

                      The one exception to this trend was the post-review in Jharkhand. See Procurement Post Award Review,

             risked permitting the procuring agency to notify (and thus prefer) only
             certain firms.288 Further, in five of nine contracts reviewed in Chhattisgarh
             (worth INR 6,257,000 in total), the bid documents omitted critical infor-
             mation such as quantities and delivery dates.289 This practice could permit
             the procuring agency to inform preferred firms of the missing informa-
             tion and thus ensure that only those firms’ bids are responsive.

        ■■   Orders Placed Prior to Bidder Selection. In three of the nine contracts
             reviewed in Chhattisgarh (worth a total of INR 3,915,000), the post-review
             noted that orders were placed with an eventual winning bidder before that
             firm had been selected to receive the contract.290 This practice suggests
             that the winning firm was pre-selected by the procuring agency.

        ■■   Bids Submitted Prior to Solicitation. In two contracts in Maharashtra,
             worth a total of INR 54,060, the post-review noted that bids were received
             before the procuring agency issued the solicitation letter.291 This suggests
             that the procuring agency contacted preferred firms in advance and pos-
             sibly informed those firms of the bidding requirements.

        ■■   Insufficient Time to Bid. In seven contracts in Andhra Pradesh, worth a
             total of INR 135,785, the post-review observed that the procuring agency
             gave bidders only one to three days to respond to a bid solicitation.292 Pro-
             curing agencies can use such short time frames to steer contracts to pre-
             ferred firms by informing those firms of bidding requirements in advance,
             thus ensuring that those firms submit responsive bids while other firms
             have insufficient time to prepare their bids.

        ■■   Contract Splitting. The Chhattisgarh post-review report noted one instance
             in which a tender was split into two contracts of INR 1,440,000 to avoid
             procurement threshold limits.293 The DIR also noted three other contracts
             in the post review that were awarded on the same day for identical amounts
             of INR 1,305,000.294

                          ■■     Unapproved Bid Modifications to Favor a Bidder. The Jharkhand post-re-
                                 view observed one case in which, contrary to Bank’s Procurement Guide-
                                 lines, a bidder was permitted to modify its bid price without Bank approval
                                 and thereby win additional contracts on a tender.295 This practice indicates
                                 favoritism of the procuring agency toward that firm.

                          ■■     Potential Misappropriation of Assets. The Chhattisgarh post-review noted
                                 that an INR 83,750 computer system was contracted for without a tender;
                                 lacked supporting documentation with the same contractor name and
                                 date as the contract; and was installed at the local minister’s home.296 The
                                 post-reviewer concluded from this information that the contract had been
                                 misprocured, and it is unclear whether the Bank obtained repayment for
                                 this expenditure.

                  C.	 SOE Financial Reviews
                         The SAR Financial Management representative provided the DIR with two
                  Statement of Expenditure (SOE) Financial Review reports related to MCP, for the
                  states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. These reviews were performed to verify that
                  claimed expenditures: (1) were used for their intended purpose; (2) were properly
                  supported by adequate documentation; (3) were properly recorded in the account-
                  ing records; and (4) were eligible for financing by the bank. Further, the reviews
                  were performed to assess whether the projects had adequate internal control
                  frameworks to support the accurate preparation of SOEs.297

                         While the SOE Financial Review reports did not include any direct references
                  to indicators of potential fraud and corruption, they did include several references
                  to internal control lapses that could have facilitated the occurrence of fraud and
                  corruption. These lapses included failure to perform bank reconciliations, inad-
                  equate recordkeeping,298 advances being claimed as expenditures,299 and the lack
                  of proper approvals of SOEs submitted to the Bank.300

D.	The Implementation Completion Report
       1.	 Project Rating

       The ICR rated the MCP’s implementation and achievement of development
objectives as “satisfactory,” though its authors expressed their preference for a lower
“moderately satisfactory” rating because the project’s three-year lag and 63 percent
expenditure rate was inefficient.301

       The ICR concluded that the project achieved its purpose because of “the posi-
tive epidemiological trends and the strategic reorientation of the national program
for eradication and control.”302 It based this assessment largely upon government-
provided epidemiological surveillance data, in particular a statistical analysis
reporting a decline in IRS and “impressive” progress in reducing malaria mor-
bidity in project-supported districts over the project period.303 This is in keeping
with the aides-mémoire, which evaluated project performance based on statistics
like the number of functioning treatment centers, the number of rapid diagnos-
tics kits used, or the number of bed nets procured and distributed.304 Given the
project’s development-impact focus, the use of government-provided statistics is
not inappropriate. But relying on such statistics without thorough accompanying
field inspections can prevent the Bank from assessing project quality and, as a
result, the project’s likely influence upon those statistics. It also can create evalu-
ation inconsistencies where projects with significant implementation problems
still receive satisfactory ratings because those implementation problems are not
weighed heavily in overall project evaluation.

       2.	 Identification of Implementation Problems

       Despite its positive project ratings, the ICR identified two project implementa-
tion problem areas, including several of the procurement issues identified by the
DIR.

       First, the ICR identified the quality of IRS as an issue because it was “highly vari-
able” and “not routinely monitored, which is likely to have reduced significantly
its effectiveness in vector control.”305 These problems included insufficient physical
implementation: “some state visits during and after the mid-term review revealed

and intersectoral collaboration, which was rated as moderately satisfactory. MCP ICR, p. 13.

                  that many number of houses are sprayed on the outside, which is unlikely to have
                  significant impact on the malaria burden.”306 The ICR attributed these problems to
                  insufficient quality control supervision, caused in part by the project’s decentral-
                  ized design.307 Indeed, the ICR noted concerns about the Borrower’s overall project
                  supervision capacity.308 The ICR rated the Bank’s performance as satisfactory, and
                  the Bank’s supervision as moderately satisfactory (because of low disbursements at
                  mid term), but rated Bank preparation as unsatisfactory due to poor planning that
                  did not consider Borrower capacity or prepare a sufficient monitoring and evalu-
                  ation framework.309 This evaluation appears to forego the possibility of reforming
                  project supervision mid-stream, an aberrant outcome given the Bank’s recognition
                  of the Borrower’s capacity constraints.

                         Second, the ICR identified multiple significant problems with both procure-
                  ment and the Bank’s reaction to procurement problems identified during project
                  implementation. These included the following:

                          ■■     RITES, often with the Bank’s approval, avoided prior-review ICB thresh-
                                 olds by tendering multiple contracts below these thresholds. In one
                                 instance the Bank returned draft bid documents to RITES and notified it
                                 of the “mistake” of submitting the documents when the individual sched-
                                 ules were for less than USD 300,000 (the total procurement was consider-
                                 ably larger).310

                          ■■     The Bank has a limited capacity to respond to procurement requests
                                 and monitor adherence to technical specifications. “Future projects are
                                 at severe risk of encountering similar delays if procurement supervision
                                 capacity is not improved, perhaps through contracting with a firm or
                                 technical agency (like WHO) to provide technical backstopping to Task
                                 Team Leaders to assist in clearances and adherence to technical specifica-
                                 tions. This could even be done at corporate level, rather than country-by-
                                 country.”311

                          ■■     “In general, it does not seem to be the Bank’s procurement procedures
                                 themselves that served as an impediment to smooth and timely procure-
                                 ment, but rather adherence to the agreed procedures by the client and pro-

               curement agent, which was perhaps compounded by inadequate supervi-
               sion by the Bank.”312

        ■■     The ICR noted project delays associated with firms’ difficulties in obtaining
               required corporate registrations. “Due partly to issues with the inability of
               one firm to receive CIB registration, the Bank withdrew the funding for
               Synthetic Pyrethroids and ultimately came to an agreement with the Gov-
               ernment of India that all future bidders must be registered with CIB at the
               time of bid and that future procurements be handled through NCB.”313

        ■■     The past performance criterion was increased from production of 50 per-
               cent of the contract amount of product to 80 percent and five years’ past
               performance. The ICR also noted, however, that in one procurement, a
               firm was awarded a contract with only three years’ past performance, in
               violation of this requirement.314

       While certainly the identification of these issues is admirable, the fact that they
were only first mentioned in the ICR is less helpful. Supervision mission aides-
mémoires made only vague reference to implementation problems, and did not
note the implementation problems identified by the ICR. For example, the aide-
mémoire of December 8–19, 2003, did not expound on the issue of implementation
in Orissa and Jharkhand beyond simply stating, “Jharkhand and Orissa require
immediate attention as the project implementation capacities are very weak and
National Anti-Malaria Programme (NAMP) and Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare should plan to develop a special package of technical and project imple-
mentation support.”315 In contrast, the ICR focused on Orissa because the state was
home to nearly 50 percent of India’s total malaria burden.316 It then made specific
implementation observations, such as the specific number of districts with full-
time malaria officers (three out of 30); the fact that no vector monitoring work
was occurring in the state because there was only one entomologist in the state
who worked in the state capital; and the one-third vacancy rate in certain project-
sanctioned posts.317

       The ICR team deserves credit for their specificity and candor, as well as for dis-
tinguishing between their sources of data (surveillance data, review of studies and

                  reports, or ICR team field visits).318 The ICR also deserves recognition for suggesting
                  a new focus on output-based supervision that the DIR believes is critical to identify-
                  ing and deterring fraud and corruption: “With increasing emphasis on link in inputs
                  to results, a significantly strengthened monitoring and surveillance system using
                  information triangulation and independently confirmed results, would provide the
                  program with a greater degree of confidence to target interventions to problem areas
                  and more accurately measure the relative impact of different activities.”319


                  Complaints Management
                  At the time of the MCP’s implementation, the applicable Procurement Guidelines
                  provided that communications from bidders sent to the Bank would be handled
                  as follows:

                          ■■   Communications received prior to the bid closing date “will, if appropri-
                               ate, be referred to the Borrower with the Bank’s comments and advice, for
                               action or response”; and

                          ■■   Communications received after the bid closing date will: (1) for non-pri-
                               or-review contracts, “be sent to the Borrower for due consideration and
                               appropriate action, if any, and these will be reviewed during subsequent
                               supervision of the project by Bank staff ”; or (2) for prior review con-
                               tracts, “be examined by the Bank, in consultation with the Borrower. …
                               The Bank’s review will not be completed until the communication is fully
                               examined and considered.”320

                         The Bank’s current Procurement Guidelines contain the same language as the
                  Guidelines applicable to the MCP.321 This language does not distinguish between
                  different types of communications, e.g., inquiries versus complaints.

B.	 INT Receipt of, and Action Upon, Complaints
       As noted above, INT only received 10 complaints related to the MCP, which
is only 16  percent of the total number of complaints received by the Bank as a
whole. Further, INT’s review of the complaints received by the procurement hub
indicates 63 percent of the received complaints—31 out of 49—regarded possible
fraud and corruption indicating that they likely should have been forwarded to
INT.322 But INT only received seven of these complaints, and INT was unable to
identify correspondence in either its or the hub’s files indicating that any of the
other 24 complaints were forwarded to INT.323 It should however, be noted, that
INT, formerly known as the Anti-Corruption and Fraud Investigations Unit, was
founded only in 1999.




322	
    Twelve complaints were related to non-fraud-and-corruption procurement issues, and six were general
inquiries or requests for clarification.
323	
    Correspondence about two complaints suggested that they had been forwarded to INT, but there is no
record of the forwarding correspondence.

                     While there was not a direct one-to-one correlation between a procured item’s
                  share of complaints and its share of project funds and contracts, in general items
                  receiving a larger share of project funds and contracts also received a larger share
                  of complaints. Thus Pyrethroids and bed nets, the items receiving 74 percent of
                  project funds and 46 percent of project contracts, received 71 percent of all com-
                  plaints. The exceptions to this trend are:

                      ■■    Artesunate, which was overrepresented with eight percent of complaints
                            but only one percent of funds and two percent of contracts; and

                      ■■    Chloroquine and DEC tablets, which received only three percent and none
                            of the complaints, while each receiving seven percent of project funds and
                            10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of project contracts.

                  D.	 Complaint Resolution Statistics
                     Documents obtained by INT indicate that 44 percent (28 of 63) of the MCP
                  complaints received by the Bank appear to have been resolved. INT is unable to

Overview
Project Objective
India’s National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTCP) has been in place since
1962. Historically, the basic feature of the program was drug treatment in the form
of long-course chemotherapy (LCC).1 Although very successful in its early years,
the NTCP saw diminishing gains over time.2 In 1992, a joint review of the program
by the Swedish International Development Agency, the World Health Organization
(WHO), and the Government of India recommended the introduction of a new
approach to tuberculosis control, namely the Directly Observed Treatment—Short
Course (DOTS) approach.3 Under DOTS, patients are diagnosed by high-quality
sputum microscopy, after which they receive appropriate medication and six to
eight months of strict follow-up, supervision, and monitoring.4 The new approach
was expected to enhance patient adherence to treatment and increase cure rates.

     The new DOTS approach was first tested in India through a series of pilot proj-
ects starting in 1993.5 The results of the pilots were very encouraging. Through
September 1996, the pilot projects had treated close to 16,000 patients in a popu-
lation of roughly 12 million, with cure rates as high as 92 percent in some of the
pilot sites and an average of 80 percent for all the sites.6 These cure rates were much
higher than those achieved using the LCC approach, which WHO had estimated at
approximately 35 percent in the public sector.7

                        In 1997, it was estimated that up to half of India’s population was infected with
                  tuberculosis.8 The Government of India decided that the new DOTS approach to
                  tuberculosis (TB) control would gradually replace the LCC approach throughout
                  the country, and it introduced the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program
                  (RNTCP) to implement the DOTS approach. The Tuberculosis Control Project
                  (TCP) was designed to assist in the expansion of the RNTCP. The TCP sought
                  to reduce TB-caused mortality, morbidity, and disability by expanding the DOTS
                  approach throughout India, thereby reducing the annual risk of TB infection, the
                  incidence of infections, and the development of drug-resistant TB.9 Initially, the
                  TCP aimed to reach 270 million people, or one-third of the Indian population.10
                  In 2002, the scope of the project was expanded and was ultimately introduced into
                  every district in India, making it possible to serve essentially the entire population
                  of India.11

                        The TCP became effective on April 14, 1997,12 with an original budget of
                  USD 176 million13 and a closing date of December 31, 2002.14


                  Summary of Findings
                  The DIR’s review of the TCP found that:

                         1.	 the implementation of pharmaceuticals and equipment purchased under
                                the TCP generally demonstrated proper supply, good quality, and few defi-
                                ciencies in the project’s supply and distribution chains. However, the DIR
                                observed significant indicators of collusion in the international competi-
                                tive bidding (ICB) procurement of pharmaceuticals that went undetected
                                by the borrower. These indicators included identical or nearly identical
                                unit prices, attempted bid rotation, and attempted division of the mar-
                                ket between two firms. This collusion was unsuccessful only because the
                                apparently colluding firms were deregistered on other grounds and dis-
                                qualified from the tenders;

       2.	 decentralized procurements revealed widespread indicators of collusion,
            fraud, and corruption, such as strong similarities between competing bids
            language and/or presentation, bidders with identical phone numbers, and
            related bid prices; and

       3.	 the Bank’s project reports and assessments revealed that while the Bank’s
            response to complaints was adequate, its response to the findings in other
            project reports15 was inadequate.

      The DIR’s review of TCP’s implementation and distribution of pharmaceuti-
cal and equipment purchases in four states and 12 districts—accounting for 40
percent of TCP Bank funds—revealed generally proper supply, good quality, and
few deficiencies in the project’s supply and distribution chains. In contrast, the
DIR uncovered a number of indicators of corrupt practices associated with the
centralized procurement of pharmaceuticals through ICB processes. In particu-
lar, the DIR found strong indicators of collusive behavior between two suppliers,
Nestor Pharmaceuticals Limited and Pure Pharma Limited—companies recently
debarred by the Bank for collusive practices on another India health sector project
ongoing during the same period. Because these collusive practices apparently went
undetected, and apparently were undertaken by the same players across multiple
projects, they signify a risk factor that needs to be monitored closely to ensure
program integrity going forward with respect to the TCP’s successor project and
other projects involving pharmaceutical procurements.

      Among the numerous indicators found, the DIR discovered indicators that
these companies engaged in collusive practices on at least five invitations for bids
through the submission of identical unit prices and complementary quantities that
would potentially lead to contract splitting or contract award rotation. Although
these companies were the lowest evaluated bidders on contracts worth millions
of dollars, an unrelated decision by the Government of India to “deregister” these
two companies because they provided substandard drugs prevented their schemes
from fully manifesting. Nevertheless, had the deregistration not occurred, it is
likely these companies would have succeeded in their scheme because the indica-
tors of fraud apparently went undetected.

      In contrast to the centrally procured pharmaceutical and equipment purchases,
the DIR’s review of procurement by the state and district tuberculosis offices
revealed a high percentage of procurements showing indicators of collusion,

                  fraud, or corruption (i.e., 100 of 143 local shopping contract files, or 70 percent
                  in number and 78 percent in value of the DIR-reviewed contracts). Among the
                  dozens of collusive indicators were strong similarities in competing bids’ language
                  and presentation, bidders sharing the same addresses and telephone numbers, unit
                  prices showing a common formula, and indicators of intent to split contract awards
                  among several bidders. Included among the indicators of fraud or corruption were
                  signs of potential document tampering, quotations submitted after the submission
                  deadline, and substantial recordkeeping deficiencies. Procurements conducted
                  under prior-review thresholds are particularly susceptible to fraudulent and cor-
                  rupt practices and, while the Bank’s procurement post-review identified a number
                  of indicators of fraud, collusion, or corruption, the DIR found no evidence that
                  the Bank had taken any affirmative action to address the indicators identified or
                  mitigate ongoing risks in this area.

                        The DIR’s analysis of the Bank’s project reports and assessments resulted in
                  both positive and negative findings. On the one hand, the DIR found that the Bank
                  appeared to have responded adequately to specific complaints from firms relating
                  to TCP procurement and implementation. In general those complaints were inves-
                  tigated and resolved. On the other hand, while TCP audit reports, procurement
                  post-reviews, financial reviews, and the ICR identified indicators of possible fraud,
                  corruption, and collusion, there is no indication that the Bank acted with rigor to
                  investigate or rectify those problems.

B.	 Implementation Structure
      The TCP was administered by the national institutions already implementing
the RNTCP. Specifically, the Government of India’s Central Tuberculosis Division
(CTD), located within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW),
oversaw the RNTCP (and the TCP) on a national level. The CTD was responsible
for (1) coordinating the program with the states; (2) ensuring the flow of funds; (3)
overseeing implementation of technical and operational policies, guidelines, and
procedures through frequent field visits and data analysis; (4) coordinating the

                  project’s procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals, vehicles, and equip-
                  ment; and (5) reviewing media services and program evaluation proposals.22

                        Procurement was conducted primarily at the national level, initially by the
                  MOHFW, then on an interim basis by the Hospital Services Consultancy Corpora-
                  tion (HSCC). In 2000, an independent professional procurement support agency,
                  Metallurgical & Engineering Consultants (India) Ltd. (MECON), was selected to
                  oversee procurements. When the project was extended in 2005, WHO’s Global
                  Drug Facility assumed the responsibilities for managing procurement under the
                  TCP.23 Throughout the project, procurement occurred at the state and district level
                  with respect only to relatively minor items such as small equipment, equipment
                  maintenance, vehicles, and the salaries of temporary staff.24

                        Initially, project funds flowed directly from the national CTD to districts, effec-
                  tively bypassing the state level. Diagnostic and treatment services were centralized
                  at the district level. This design proved to be flawed because states lacked owner-
                  ship over the process, and services did not reach sufficient numbers of people.
                  In response, the project was restructured substantially in 2002. Responsibility for
                  administrative support, financial management, flow of funds, and implementation
                  was shifted to semi-autonomous “societies” at the state and district levels. Respon-
                  sibility for planning, monitoring, and integrating was shifted to governmental
                  “state cells.” “District cells” became responsible for providing technical guidance
                  and logistical support, and for supervising implementation. Sub-district cells were
                  also created to further decentralize the TB control infrastructure. These sub-dis-
                  trict cells were responsible for quality control by reviewing patient registration,
                  diagnosis, case management, and reporting.

                  C.	 Project Controls
                        At the TCP’s initiation, and after a successful pilot project experience, the Bank
                  assessed that the common risks associated with primary health projects, such
                  as procurement deficiencies, late disbursement, and inadequate maintenance of
                  equipment, were fairly minimal.25 However, the Bank did identify several risks,
                  including that implementing agencies would be “unable” to provide the leadership
                  and services required to ensure proper implementation of the program, and that

supply of drugs would be “uneven” given the “spotty record of drug deliveries” and
the potential “misuse” of large quantities of drugs.26

      To address those risks, the Government of India agreed to maintain adequate
staffing for the duration of the project27 and to ensure that pharmaceuticals would
be supplied on a regular basis.28 The Government of India also agreed to develop a
patient registration system that would report case findings, test results, treatment
outcomes, and medication orders29 and that would assist in detecting inadequacies
in drug deliveries or misuse of drugs.

      The TCP also included specific controls designed to monitor issues relating to
procurement, implementation, and financial transactions.

      1.	 The Government of India’s Controls

      Implementation Controls. The Government of India instituted a number of pro-
cedures to monitor the success of the TCP’s implementation. Regional consultants
hired by the CTD conducted field visits and provided quarterly reports highlight-
ing major obstacles for project progress.30 Independent laboratories conducted
quality tests on pharmaceuticals delivered under the project, and an independent
annual audit of the drug procurement and distribution system was conducted.31
In addition, the CTD was responsible for monitoring and reporting to the Bank
with respect to (1) the progress of the TCP implementation plan; (2) logistics and
quality control (based on information received from the procuring agency, suppli-
ers, the Medical Stores Organization [MSO], monthly reports from Government
Medical Store Depots [GMSDs], and quarterly reports from the states and dis-
tricts); (3) progress in training and strengthening training institutions; (4) progress
in recruiting staff and filling staff positions; and (5) patient satisfaction with the
timing and availability of services, treatment by service providers, economic costs
involved, and availability of medicines.32

      The TCP also received support from WHO technical consultants, who moni-
tored implementation and assisted in improving the quality of services by assisting
in training, planning, monitoring, and surveillance.33

                        Financial Controls. In terms of financial controls, the CTD was responsible for
                  monitoring and reporting to the Bank on (1) expenditures and budget utilization
                  (based on a monthly expenditure report and information collected from the field
                  by visiting CTD officers); and (2) cost reimbursements. In addition, expenditures
                  were audited annually by independent auditors and chartered accountants, and
                  certified copies of the annual financial statements and statements of expenditures
                  (SOEs) were sent to the Bank, together with the auditor’s report.34

                        2.	 The Bank’s Controls

                        As noted above, the Bank received reports from the CTD with respect to
                  numerous implementation and financial issues. In addition, the Bank conducted
                  review missions twice annually and operational and technical reviews every two
                  years.35 Over the eight-year project implementation period, the Bank conducted 15
                  supervision missions.36 Review teams included specialists in public health, disease
                  control, epidemiology, social development, HIV/AIDS, financial management,
                  disbursement, and procurement.37

                  D.	 Costs and Time
                        The project closed on March 31, 2006, after being extended three times because
                  of (1) a two-year disbursement suspension caused by procurement delays (see dis-

                  gram to the TCP; and (3) the need to allow the project additional time to complete
                  its procurement of pharmaceuticals.38 As a result of substantial overestimation in
                  the original cost estimates and subsequent unexpected declines in the prices of
                  important items including drugs and microscopes,39 only USD 100.2 million of the
                  IDA credit was ultimately spent.40 The IDA credit covered 87.5 percent of the total
                  costs, whereas the Government of India covered 12.5 percent.41

Implementation

A.	 Initial Problems
      The Board approved the TCP on January 30, 1997, and the project became
effective on April 14, 1997. The MOHFW was to carry out procurement for the
first year of the project, with the understanding that continuation of that arrange-
ment would depend on the MOHFW’s successful performance during that year.42
Otherwise, the MOHFW would be required to hire the services of a professional
procurement agency.

      Procurement problems soon became apparent, resulting in long delays between
the opening of bids and awarding of the corresponding contracts.43 In late 1997,
the Bank recommended that the MOHFW immediately outsource procurement to
a professional procurement agency, and the MOHFW agreed that it would do so
by January 31, 1998.44

      On February 25, 1998, the Bank issued a letter to the Department of Economic
Affairs, advising that the Bank would be obliged to suspend the Borrower’s right to
make further withdrawals from the credit effective March 25, 1998, unless an inde-
pendent procurement agent, acceptable to the Bank, was appointed before this
deadline.45 The Borrower failed to meet the deadline, causing the Bank to suspend
further withdrawals from the credit effective March 26, 1998.46

B.	 Suspension
      The Bank informed the Borrower that the suspension would be lifted when the
Bank was satisfied that (1) implementation of the service delivery component was
proceeding satisfactorily; and (2) the Borrower appointed a procurement agent
on a competitive basis acceptable to the Bank. In October 1998, due to project
exigencies, the MOHFW was permitted to appoint (on a sole-source basis) HSCC
to serve as an interim procurement support agency.47

to avoiding burdening the TB unit with the task of procurement which can be done by a specialized agency.”

                        Thereafter, the MOHFW moved slowly on the competitive selection of a procure-
                  ment agent.48 On January 28, 2000—nearly two years after the suspension began—
                  the Government of India signed a contract with MECON for this purpose.49

                  C.	 Performance
                        On March 21, 2000, the Bank lifted the suspension after concluding that the
                  Borrower had satisfactorily met the stated conditions.50 Thereafter, the Bank gen-
                  erally assessed the status of project implementation as “satisfactory,” and gave a
                  “highly satisfactory” rating in 2004, approximately 18 months before the proj-
                  ect closed.51 The Bank assessed the relative success of development objectives by
                  examining coverage, detection, and cure rates, all of which regularly demonstrated
                  positive trends that exceeded expectations. The “highly satisfactory” rating was
                  based on what the Bank perceived as (1) employment of clear guidelines for pro-
                  curement, financial management, and technical aspects of the project; (2) strictly
                  enforced supervision; and (3) timely and regular monitoring and reporting.52 Dur-
                  ing Bank mission visits in 2003, it was noted that drugs were “universally available
                  in adequate quantities and records continue to be well maintained.”53

                        However, the Bank did note concerns with respect to procurement and dis-
                  bursement lags and certain aspects of financial management. For example, in late
                  2004 the Bank noted “with concern” the “significant delays in the procurement of
                  drugs and microscopes.”54 The manager reviewing this Bank mission report com-
                  mented that “[i]t [was] something of a puzzle that, in a project which has reached
                  a disbursement lag of 50 months, achievement in terms of the Key Indicators for
                  the PDO [coverage, detection, and cure rates] exceed the forecast at appraisal.”55
                  Procurement problems persisted through the last year of the project, during which
                  (as described in greater detail below) the Bank refused to provide a no-objection
                  to the award of contracts to a firm that had not been prequalified, as the tender
                  procedures required.56 Furthermore, there were persistent problems with obtain-
                  ing SOEs from the states for reimbursement.57

      Following the agreement to extend the project closing date in September 2005, a
further mission was conducted later in 2005.58 The supervision team sought to ensure
that further procurement delays would be avoided and that the government would
forward in a timely manner the disbursement claims to guarantee full disburse-
ment of the remaining credit.59 The mission reported that “issues to be addressed”
included (1) adherence to internal control procedures in states and district societies;
and (2) the need for consistency in accounting policies.60 The implementation status
report (ISR) nevertheless defended the recent “highly satisfactory” rating, stating
that it was justified given that “compared to other national public health programs in
India, this program is exceptionally well organized and managed.”61

D.	 Project Evaluation
      The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rated the TCP’s achievement of
its objectives as “satisfactory.”62 The Bank’s performance was rated “satisfactory”63
and the Borrower’s “moderately satisfactory.”64 For the reasons described above,
the ICR rated the Borrower’s presuspension performance as “unsatisfactory.”65




The DIR’s Approach to the
TCP
The TCP was included in the DIR because certain suppliers found to have colluded
in connection with the Reproductive and Child Health Project (RCH) also com-
peted for contracts under the TCP. These suppliers were competing for contracts
procured using ICB. As depicted in Figure 2, ICB procurements of pharmaceuti-
cals and equipment between 1999 and 2004 accounted for more than 40 percent of
the funds advanced by the Bank under the TCP.66 Accordingly, the DIR focused a
large portion of its review on those contracts.

                  Procurement of Contracts

                  A.	 Pharmaceuticals and Equipment
                        The DIR reviewed the procurement process relating to 80 contracts (69 ICB
                  contracts and 11 supplemental contracts awarded to some of the winners of those
                  ICB contracts),67 out of 81 contracts procured.68 To detect patterns indicating pos-
                  sible fraud or corruption, the DIR reviewed and analyzed hundreds of documents,
                  including:

                        ■■   Information extracted from the DIR’s contract database

                        ■■   Individual companies’ bid submissions

                        ■■   Bid evaluation reports (BERs)




                  IDA credit totaled USD 100.2 million. Since almost all contracts were paid in Indian rupees, the U.S. dollar
                  amounts cited in this chapter were calculated using a yearly average exchange rate for the year in which the
                  contract was signed.
                  67	
                       Under the original contracts, the TCP reserved the option of requesting up to an additional 20 percent of
                  goods, beyond the quantity called for by the contract, if the project later determined that it needed the additional
                  items. The suppliers were required to provide the items at the same price and on the same terms as the items
                  initially provided under the contract.
                  68	
                     The bidding process for procurement services (awarded to MECON) was not obtained for review by the
                  DIR.



                                                                         534
                                                                         Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


       ■■    Contracts awarded under the TCP69

       ■■    Correspondence among bidders, project officials, and the Bank.

      In addition to conducting a detailed analysis of the individual contract pack-
ages, the DIR performed an in-depth analysis across all of the data, looking for
indicators such as identical addresses of bidders; identical phone number of bid-
ders; multiple companies with the same officials; sequential bid securities; inad-
equate time to prepare bids; continuous membership on the Bid Evaluation Com-
mittee (BEC); and unreasonable delays in evaluating and awarding bids. The DIR
also looked for indicators of price inflation by examining prices paid by the TCP
and comparing those prices with prices published in the International Drug Price
Indicator Guide published by Management Sciences for Health.

B.	 Locally Procured Contracts
      The DIR also reviewed 143 locally procured TCP contracts, according to
the previously described general methodology used for other projects. The DIR
selected district sites in Pune, Maharashtra, and Bangalore, Karnataka,70 based on
DIR selection methodology. In Pune, representatives of the District Tuberculosis
Officer (DTO) produced most of the local shopping documents requested by the
DIR, and the DIR found those documents generally to be in good order. In con-
trast, the document filing systems in Bangalore were not always satisfactory. This
delayed and impacted the completeness of the DIR’s review. In many instances, key
documents, including bid evaluation reports, bids, or bid securities, were missing
altogether.


Project Implementation
      The DIR analyzed the project’s supply and distribution chain for indicators that
the goods were unaccounted for, undelivered, or of a lesser quality than what was
required by the applicable contracts. As noted above, the DIR focused on those
contracts associated during the review of contract procurement with indicators of
fraud, also taking into consideration the shelf life of the pharmaceuticals at issue.
With those factors in mind, the DIR focused on two procurements of pharmaceu-
ticals (a total of 33 contracts), three procurements of microscopes (a total of nine

     In some cases, the poor quality (or lack of completeness) of the available documents prevented a comparison
of the bid submissions with the information reported in the BERs. This limitation was significant when consider-
ing the propriety of declaring certain bidders as non-responsive, a frequent occurrence in the tenders at issue.

                     On the basis of the consignee lists relating to the selected contracts, the DIR
                  traveled to the states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Chhattisgarh
                  and visited multiple districts within each of those states. While there, the DIR vis-

   During those visits, the DIR spoke with numerous officials, consultants, doc-
tors, and others; reviewed stock registers and inventories; examined receipts;
inspected stockrooms; and observed treatment facilities.

A.	 Pharmaceuticals
   With respect to pharmaceuticals, the DIR’s implementation review focused
on three potential risks: undersupply, poor quality, and flaws in the supply chain.
To address those issues, the DIR (1) examined whether the pharmaceuticals were
provided in the required quantities; (2) collected samples of the delivered phar-
maceuticals for testing by an independent laboratory; (3) inquired with officials
in each of the districts about tests that the Government of India or others may
have conducted on the pharmaceuticals; and (4) reviewed each district’s records
to determine whether pharmaceuticals were actually delivered from the reception
points to patients in each district.

B.	 Equipment
   With regard to equipment, the DIR focused its implementation review on ana-
lyzing whether (1) the equipment was received by the consignees specified on the
lists provided to the DIR; (2)  the equipment satisfied the contractual technical
specifications; (3)  contractual clauses had been properly executed (guarantees,
technical service obligations, etc.); (4) the equipment was adequate for its intended
purposes; and (5) the equipment was fully functioning.


Complaints
The DIR also examined the complaints that were lodged with respect to the TCP
procurements discussed herein. The DIR obtained details of 21 complaints from

                  the Bank’s databases and correspondence files provided by the India procurement
                  hub to determine (1) whether and how they overlapped with the DIR’s findings;
                  and (2) whether and how the Bank addressed them.


                  Project Reports and Assessments
                  The DIR obtained and reviewed the TCP design, supervision, and evaluation doc-
                  uments. These included the TCP Staff Appraisal Report (STAR), the TCP Proj-
                  ect Implementation Plan (PIP), various aides-mémoire, Project Status Reports
                  (PSRs), ISRs, the TCP ICR, available procurement post-review reports, and avail-
                  able project audit reports. The DIR analyzed these materials to understand how
                  the Bank assessed fraud and corruption risks in the project’s design and to deter-
                  mine whether the indicators of fraud identified by the DIR were recognized by the
                  Bank’s supervision systems.




                  Findings
                  The DIR found numerous indicators of corrupt practices associated with the cen-
                  tralized procurement of pharmaceuticals for the TCP through ICB procedures.
                  However, the DIR notes that certain events prevented the collusive schemes from
                  flourishing. For locally procured contracts, DIR findings in both Maharashtra and
                  Karnataka indicate an elevated risk. This risk appears to have gone undetected by
                  the Bank’s traditional supervision methods and procurement post-reviews. The
                  patterns of indicators of collusion, fraud, and corruption discovered in Maharash-
                  tra and Karnataka were very similar and included indicators of collusive practices
                  among bidders and indicators of corrupt behavior between bidders and procure-
                  ment officials.


                  Pharmaceuticals
                  The DIR identified numerous indicators that Nestor and Pure Pharma colluded
                  in connection with their bids for a number of TCP contracts. Those companies—
                  which were previously found to have colluded in connection with other Bank-
                  financed contracts—submitted several bids containing identical or nearly identi-
                  cal unit prices. In addition, their bids were patterned in a way that suggests that


                                                         538

the companies may have intended to divide the number of contracts awarded to
each of them. Understanding these indicators—and the controls that may have
prevented a collusive scheme from succeeding—may provide valuable lessons to
Bank staff and government officials in attempting to prevent and detect such prac-
tices in the future.

      From 1999 through 2004, five of the TCP’s nine bidding invitation rounds were
for the supply of pharmaceuticals, which were assigned product codes (PCs) num-
bered from 1 to 13. PC1 through PC4 were described as “treatment boxes” and
contained the entire course of treatment for a patient under the DOTS program.
The remaining PCs were blister strips of pills used to reconstitute partly used treat-
ment boxes,71 to supplement a patient’s treatment course, or to treat a patient when
the DOTS regime was determined to be an inappropriate treatment method. A
description of the contents of each PC is provided at the end of this chapter.72
Some of the tenders involved bidding on multiple lots of certain PCs, and qualified
suppliers were permitted to participate for multiple lots. Table 1 summarizes the
number and value of TCP contracts bid on and won by Nestor and Pure Pharma
between 1999 and 2004.73

 	 As discussed in greater detail below, the BEC initially recommended awarding USD 10.1 million of
   contracts to Nestor under this tender, but the Bank refused to give its no-objection to that award,
   because Nestor had not prequalified, as required by the rules governing the tender.

      Boxes were reconstituted when, for example, a patient died.
72	
    For some ICB tenders, the project chose not to purchase items bearing certain PCs because it did not require
these items at that specific time. As a result, there may be gaps in the numerical sequence of PCs for some tenders.
73	
    According to Pure Pharma’s website, that company was established in 1955. Together with its sister company,
Promed Laboratories, Pure Pharma boasts annual sales exceeding USD 12 million, in India, Sri Lanka, the Phil-
ippines, Bangladesh, Ghana, and other countries. According to Nestor’s website, that company was established in
1975 and became a Public Limited Company in 1994–1995. Nestor has two manufacturing plants, one at Farida-
bad Haryana (India) and the other at Goa (India). The company claims to produce “[o]ver 150 formulations of
essential medicines . . . to a burgeoning clientele in India and abroad.”

                     To the extent that Nestor and Pure Pharma did collude, the Government of
                  India’s decision to deregister those companies may have prevented the scheme
                  from flourishing. On numerous occasions, as discussed in more detail later in this
                  report, Nestor and Pure Pharma submitted bids that would have been deemed the
                  lowest qualified bid, were it not for the fact that the BEC deemed the bids non-
                  responsive because the companies were deregistered. Table 2 illustrates the stark
                  difference between the volume of Nestor and Pure Pharma’s actual contract awards
                  and the volume of awards those companies would likely have received had they not
                  been deregistered (i.e., the instances in which the companies were the lowest quali-
                  fied bidder, except for the fact of deregistration).

                     With regard to implementation, the DIR did not identify indicators that TCP
                  suppliers provided inadequate or poor quality pharmaceuticals. Nor did the DIR
                  discover indicators that prices were inflated.

                  A.	 Review of Procurement
                     The review of contract procurements identified indicators of collusive behav-
                  ior, the potential effects of which may have been mitigated by the Government of
                  India’s earlier decision to deregister the companies at issue. An earlier investigation
                  into allegations of fraud and corruption concerning the RCH Project revealed that
                  Nestor and Pure Pharma were part of a group of companies that engaged in fraudu-
                  lent practices, including bid rigging and collusion. The RCH Project ran from 1997
                  to 2004, overlapping substantially with the TCP’s 1999 to 2004 duration.

      The earlier investigation uncovered the following evidence to establish that
Nestor and Pure Pharma colluded to win the majority of pharmaceutical and kit-
ting contracts under RCH and the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood (CSSM)
project.74

       ■■     Nestor and Pure Pharma “split” the awarding of contracts by repeatedly
              bidding unit prices that varied by less than INR 5 (USD 0.11), and alter-
              nating the instances in which one of the companies’ bids was slightly lower
              than the other’s.75

       ■■     In 2002, Nestor and Pure Pharma bid identical unit prices for the supply of
              358,590,000 IFA (Ferrous sulphate with folic acid) tablets.76

       ■■     The companies also split contracts by bidding complementary quantities,
              meaning that each company submitted unit prices that were nearly identi-
              cal to the other’s, but bid on only a portion of the overall quantity offered
              by the tender. Each of the companies would then be awarded a portion
              of the overall contract. In one such instance, nine companies submitted
              bids with unit prices differing by as much as INR 132.52 (approximately
              USD 2.95), but the difference in prices offered by Nestor and Pure Pharma
              was a mere INR 0.90 (approximately USD 0.02).77

       ■■     Nestor, Pure Pharma, and two other companies won 93 percent of the total
              value of CSSM contracts, with Nestor winning USD  15 million of con-
              tracts, Pure Pharma USD 2 million, and the two other companies USD 3.2
              million each.78

       ■■     Nestor and Pure Pharma also dominated the award of contracts under
              RCH, with Nestor winning 196 contracts worth USD 37 million and Pure
              Pharma winning 62 contracts worth USD  12 million, accounting for
              65 percent of the total value of the contracts awarded.79

      As a result of Nestor and Pure Pharma supplying substandard pharmaceuticals
in connection with other procurements (unrelated to Bank-financed projects), the
MSO deregistered both companies for various periods, apparently beginning in

                  the late 1990s.80 As described below, there were numerous occasions—relating to
                  more than USD 16 million of contracts—on which those companies submitted the
                  lowest qualified bids under the TCP, but were disqualified because they had been
                  deregistered.

                        According to Dr. P. P. Singh, a senior MSO officer, the MSO is responsible for
                  maintaining a register of all suppliers authorized to provide the Government of
                  India with pharmaceuticals. MSO regulations provide that a company may be
                  “deregistered” (i.e., removed from the registry) for a period of time if it violates
                  certain MSO rules (e.g., by providing substandard pharmaceuticals). Although the
                  deregistration process has typically been applied only to companies that fail to
                  supply drugs of the required quality in connection with tenders conducted by the
                  MSO itself, the deregistration is binding on all agencies of the MOHFW.81

                        The MSO registry is not publicly available, so requests for information may be
                  made only in accordance with formal procedures specified in local legislation.82
                  As a result, when the Bank is presented with requests for no-objections under
                  MOHFW tenders, it does not have the benefit of access to the registry.

                        The BEC overseeing the 1999 TCP tender process excluded Pure Pharma
                  because the company was deregistered at the time. Subsequently, on April 28, 2000,
                  Pure Pharma was deregistered for one year as a provider of the injection form of
                  dexamethasone 4 mg/ml. On December 10, 2002, the company was deregistered
                  again, precluding Pure Pharma from providing isoniazid 300 mg tablets for the
                  next three years. Nevertheless, as described in greater detail below, Pure Pharma
                  submitted bids during that period for TCP contracts to provide pharmaceuticals
                  containing isoniazid.

                        Nestor was deregistered as a provider of pyrazinamide 750 mg tablets for three
                  years beginning August 9, 2001. Pyrazinamide was also an essential element of a
                  number of TCP tenders for which Nestor submitted bids.83




                  80	
                      Pure Pharma was excluded from the 1999 TCP tender because the company was deregistered at the time.
                  However, the information reviewed by the DIR during a visit to the MSO had no details relating to the company
                  prior to its subsequent deregistration in 2000. Consequently, the DIR was unable to determine the basis for or
                  timing of Pure Pharma’s earlier deregistration.

                      During the 2002 TCP tender, companies were required to complete a declaration advising whether they were
                  deregistered by the MSO for any product types.
                  83	
                      In a separate action on June 17, 2002, Nestor was deregistered for three years as a provider of amoxycillin
                  oral, but that drug was not a component of any of the TCP tenders under review.

      In a decision dated April 5, 2006, the MSO extended the terms of both compa-
nies’ suspensions in light of the evidence of fraud uncovered during the investiga-
tion of the RCH Project.84

      Available documentation suggests that Nestor and Pure Pharma may have con-
tinued their collusive behavior in connection with their TCP tenders in 1999, 2000,
2001, 2002, and 2004. As noted above, identical or nearly identical unit prices and
apparent attempts to rotate which companies’ bids would win various tenders were
among the factors supporting the Sanctions Board’s conclusion that Nestor and
Pure Pharma colluded during the RCH tender processes.

      In connection with their bids on approximately 30 TCP contracts, those same
two companies similarly submitted identical or nearly identical unit prices. As
described in greater detail below, those companies submitted numerous bids
whose values were within one percent of each other, bid identical unit prices, and
bid in a way that suggests that the two companies may have intended to split the
contract awards between themselves.

      1.	 The 1999 Tender

      In connection with the 1999 tender for pharmaceuticals (the 1999 tender,
HSCC-PUR-TBCP-P&V), Pure Pharma submitted bids relating to all 12 PCs
and Nestor bid for all except for PC5.85 Table 3 summarizes the bids submitted
by all of the prospective suppliers under the 1999 tender and illustrates the bid
price range for each PC, the winning bidder, the companies that were declared
non-responsive, and individual contract values in USD. 86




84	
   The MSO information shows that Pure Pharma’s previous suspension was extended for six months, com-
mencing on February 12, 2006. Nestor’s suspension was extended until further orders from the MSO.
85	
    The BEC recognized that Pure Pharma had been deregistered “for a period of one year as per MSO letter
No 1-18018-96-TB(ST-IV) dt 03.02.99.” See 1999 BER, p. 19. Accordingly, the BEC excluded Pure Pharma from
competing for PC 1–4, 7, and 8. Ibid., pp. 19–22. In light of the constituent drugs making up those PCs, it ap-
pears that Pure Pharma was deregistered for Pyrazinamide 500mg (contained in PC1–4 and 8) and isoniziad tab
100 mg (contained in PC7). However, the DIR has not reviewed the referenced MSO letter and has no further
details regarding the deregistration.
86	
     Following the bid openings, three companies were immediately declared non-responsive, either because
the company failed to provide evidence of the required manufacturing license or because the company was
deregistered for one or more product codes. 1999 BER, p. 19. With respect to PC3, six companies who submit-
ted lower bids than the winning bidder were subsequently declared non-responsive. Ibid., pp. 20, 28. Ten such
companies were subsequently declared non-responsive with regard to their bids for PC10. Ibid., pp. 23, 29–30.

        As Tables 3 and 4 illustrate, the prices quoted by Nestor and Pure Pharma were
less than one percent apart in their bids for seven of the 11 PCs for which they both

fairly dramatically from prices offered by other bidders.

        In addition to containing similar or identical unit prices, Nestor and Pure
Pharma’s bids suggest that the companies may have attempted to split the contract
awards between themselves. PC10 was the only item for which bids were submit-
ted to fill only part of the order. Nestor offered to supply 43 percent of the required
quantity at a unit price of INR 15.24 and was deemed to be the lowest evaluated
bidder (although it was ranked 10th on price).88 Pure Pharma bid a unit price of
INR 15.47 (within 1.5 percent of Nestor’s unit price) and was the second lowest
evaluated bidder (although 11th on price). Because Nestor had bid to fulfill only
part of the order, the balance of the order (3,537,858 units) was awarded to Pure
Pharma at the slightly higher price.89

        Moreover, the pattern of bids submitted by Pure Pharma and Nestor suggests
that the companies may have desired to rotate which of the companies would win
each contract, with Pure Pharma underbidding Nestor slightly on one lot, and
Nestor underbidding Pure Pharma slightly on the next. As a result, and as depicted
in Table 5, had Nestor and Pure Pharma collectively outbid their competitors on
all of the contracts associated with the 1999 tender, the awards would have been
split almost exactly evenly between the two companies.

             Non-responsive bidders
India DIR (TCP)


                                   The procurement agent did not provide the DIR with copies of nine of the com-
                            panies’ bid submissions, making it impossible for the DIR to conduct a thorough
                            review of this procurement process. For example, the DIR was unable to evaluate
                            the propriety of the BEC’s decision to declare 16 of the 20 companies’ bids non-
                            responsive.90 As a result of that decision, the BEC excluded the lowest bidders in all
                            but one of the bidding processes. On six of those occasions, Novartis was the low-
                            est bidder but was excluded for purportedly failing to submit or correctly execute
                            the bidding documents.91 The lack of documentation also prevented the DIR from
                            understanding fully the BEC’s decision to declare that all of the bids for two con-
                            tracts (relating to PC1 and PC5) were non-responsive.92

                                   The documentation was sufficient to determine that Pure Pharma submitted
                            bids relating to 10 of the 13 PCs and Nestor bid on seven of the PCs.93 Table 7
                            demonstrates that Nestor and Pure Pharma quoted unit prices that were less than
                            one percent apart across three of the six product codes for which they competed,
                            and submitted identical prices for PC10.94

                            again declared Pure Pharma to be non-responsive, thereby excluding that company from consideration with
                            respect to all of the PCs.

                                 The other bidders’ unit prices for PC10 during the 2000 tender ranged from INR 10.8 to 15.38 (USD 0.24
                            to 0.34). See 2000 BER, pp. 17–33. Paragraph 6 of the Jul. 9, 2007, Decision of the Sanctions Board on the RCH
                            investigation considered as particularly compelling the evidence relating to an incident of identical pricing
                            between Nestor and Pure Pharma, finding that they had failed to provide adequate explanation for this incident
                            and that the evidence supported the conclusion that it was more likely than not that Nestor and Pure Pharma
                            had engaged in collusive practices.

      The DIR did not note any indicators of collusion in connection with the 2001
tender. However, the DIR did discover that on July 17, 2001, the BEC recom-
mended Nestor as the winner of three of the six lots for which it had bid,95 despite
the fact that, in a letter dated June 18, 2001, the CTD had informed MECON that
Nestor had provided substandard antituberculosis drugs to the GMSD in Kolkata,
resulting in the company being deregistered as a provider of pyrazinamide 750
mg.96 As a result, after the CTD apparently reminded the BEC of its earlier letter,
the BEC declared Nestor’s bids for PCs 1, 3, and 4 (which required pyrazinamide)
non-responsive, even though Nestor was the lowest bidder for those PCs.97

      As reflected in Table 9, below, had the CTD not rejected the BEC’s initial rec-
ommendation, Nestor would likely have won contracts worth USD  3.8 million,
amounting to 60 percent of the contracts issued under the 2001 tender.

      Note: The BEC excluded Nestor and Pure Pharma from competing for all PCs except PCs 10 and 11 because pyrazinamide (the subject of Nestor’s deregistration) and isoniazid
      (the subject of Pure Pharma’s deregistration) were present in the PCs for which the companies were excluded. See 2002 BER Cover Letter, p. 2.

                                   As reflected in Table 11, Pure Pharma’s and Nestor’s bid prices were within
                            one percent of each other with respect to seven lots, and within three percent of
                            each other on five other occasions.

                                   In addition to containing similar or identical unit prices, Nestor and Pure
                            Pharma’s bid prices would also have resulted in the splitting of lots had those com-
                            panies underbid their competitors. Nestor and Pure Pharma submitted the low-
                            est bid prices in connection with the lots associated with PCs 1–4, 9, and 11. As
                            depicted in Table 11, the two companies’ unit prices differed just enough to ensure
                            that, had the companies not been excluded because of their deregistrations, they
                            each would likely have won six lots under the 2002 tender.

                                   However, the BEC excluded Nestor and Pure Pharma from competing for all
                            PCs except PC10 and PC11 because pyrazinamide (for which Nestor was deregis-
                            tered) and isoniazid (for which Pure Pharma was deregistered) were present in the
                            PCs for which they were excluded.98 As a result, Nestor won only two contracts, for
                            a total of USD 149,836, and Pure Pharma did not win any contracts. As set forth
                            in Table 12, had Nestor and Pure Pharma not been excluded, they would likely
                            have won 79 percent of the lots for which they competed—for a total of USD 4.9
                            million—since those companies were otherwise the lowest qualified bidder for
                            those lots.

      5.	 The 2004 Tender

      Nestor’s and Pure Pharma’s deregistrations figured most prominently during
the 2004 TCP pharmaceutical tender (the 2004 tender, IFB-MECON-RNC-RN-
TCP-2004-12), which initially involved 27 lots relating to nine PCs. 99 Table 13
summarizes the bids submitted by all of the prospective suppliers under the 2004
tender and illustrates the bid price range for each PC, the winning bidder, the com-
panies that were declared non-responsive, and individual contract values in USD.

     These included PC1 (lots 1–5), PC2 (lots 6–10), PC3 (lots 11–15), PC4 (lots 16–17), PC6 (lots 23–24), PC7
(lots 25–26), PC8 (lots 27–28), PC10 (lots 29–39), and PC11 (lots 31–32).

                  of a deregistration period extending from December 10, 2002, through December
                  10, 2005, and was precluded from providing isoniazid 300 mg during that period.
                  Isoniazid was an essential element of PC2 and PC7.

                         Nestor’s Attempts to Bid. According to the Bank’s internal documentation,101
                  Nestor was not pre-qualified to bid for certain elements of the 2004 tender because
                  the company was in the midst of a three-year deregistration period prohibiting it
                  from supplying pyrazinamide 750 mg, which was a required element of many lots
                  in the tender.102

                         After receiving the final list of pre-qualified companies, the Bank gave its no-
                  objection to Nestor’s participation in lots 29 through 32 because those lots did not
                  include pyrazinamide,103 but refused to accept MECON’s inclusion of Nestor in
                  the group of companies who could compete for lots in which pyrazinamide was
                  required.104 Nevertheless, Nestor submitted bids for multiple lots requiring pyrazi-
                  namide, and filed a writ petition with an Indian court, seeking an order requiring
                  the BEC to consider those bids.

                         The Contract Awards. The BEC’s initial conclusions—which were made while
                  Nestor’s court petition was pending—were ambiguous. The BEC analyzed and
                  chose winners for the 13 lots for which neither Pure Pharma nor Nestor submitted
                  bids (lots 5, 15, and 23–32).105 With respect to the lots for which Pure Pharma and
                  Nestor submitted bids despite their deregistration, the BEC prepared two different
                  comparison tables (one including the bids of those companies, the other without

                  Prequalification ensures that invitations to bid are extended only to those companies that have adequate capabili-
                  ties and resources. Paragraph 2.9 of the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines provides that “[p]requalification shall
                  be based entirely upon the capability and resources of prospective bidders to perform the particular contract
                  satisfactorily, taking into account their (1) experience and past performance on similar contracts, (2) capabilities
                  with respect to personnel, equipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities, and (3) financial position.”

them) and determined what the outcome would be under each scenario.106 The
BEC recognized that accepting Pure Pharma’s and Nestor’s bids would save the
government INR 125 million (around USD  2.8 million), but ultimately did not
recommend winners for any of those contracts.107

       On January 25, 2005, the High Court of New Delhi granted Nestor’s peti-
tion, allowing the company to submit bids for all of the lots it had identified in its
pre-qualification submission.108 On February 25, 2005, MECON sent a letter to
the Bank explaining that the MOHFW had decided to accept Nestor’s bids, and
requesting the Bank’s no-objection to the decision to award Nestor 17 of the 2004
tender’s 23 contracts.109

       Regarding lot 10, for which Pure Pharma was the lowest bidder, the Ministry
delayed a decision pending the results of tests that were being conducting in Kol-
kata. On March 5, 2005, MECON informed the Bank that Pure Pharma’s products
had failed the tests, leading to a decision to exclude Pure Pharma’s bid and award
the contract to the next lowest evaluated bidder.110

       On April 25, the Bank objected to the award of lots 1–4, 6–9, 11–14, 16, and
17, which MECON had proposed awarding to Nestor, despite the fact that that
company was not pre-qualified.111 In light of the conflict between the court’s ruling
(that the MOHFW was required to accept Nestor’s bids) and the Bank’s objection,
the MOHFW decided simply to cancel the tender relating to those lots and to pro-
cure the items according to WHO rules.112 The Bank gave its no-objection to the
cancellation.113

       In the end, Nestor won two contracts (for lots 29–32, which did not require
pyrazinamide), worth a total of USD  2.3 million. Had the additional proposed
awards not been opposed, Nestor would most likely have won an additional 14
contracts, worth a total of USD 7.8 million.

       There is a stark difference between the volume of Nestor’s and Pure Pharma’s
actual contract awards and the volume of contracts those companies would likely

                  have won had they not been deregistered (i.e., the instances in which the compa-
                  nies were the lowest qualified bidder, except for the fact of deregistration).

                     The situation involving Pure Pharma and Nestor might be viewed as an exam-
                  ple in which—despite the failure to recognize indicators of collusion—certain con-
                  trols may have prevented a possible collusive scheme from flourishing.

                  B.	Review of Implementation
                     The DIR analyzed the project’s supply and distribution chain for indicators that
                  the goods were unaccounted for, undelivered, or of a lesser quality than what was
                  required by the applicable contracts. In accordance with its methodology, the DIR
                  chose a sample of locations in the states of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka,
                  and Chhattisgarh.

                     1.	 Review of Pharmaceuticals Supply and Distribution Chain

                     Using consignee lists obtained from the bidding documents and, later, revised
                  lists provided by the CTD and additional documentation obtained during field
                  visits, the DIR visited State Drug Stores, treatment units, and the other locations
                  described above and did not observe any significant deviations between the quan-
                  tities of pharmaceuticals specified in the contracts and the quantity actually deliv-
                  ered.

                     The DIR examined the internal supply chain (i.e., the project’s distribution of
                  drugs from the contract consignee to patients) and observed that at the GMSD,
                  state, and district level, adequate records were generally maintained and reflected
                  the proper receipt and dispatch of stock to the intended delivery points. Below the
                  level of the district stores (i.e., distribution from the district stores to treatment
                  units and DOTS centers, which are usually located in small, local primary health
                  centers), the quality of the recording systems varied among states and districts,
                  and accurate records were not always maintained. However, the DIR generally
                  found comprehensive patient registers and patient cards showing drugs actually
                  being delivered to end users as intended.

                     2.	 Quality Testing of Pharmaceuticals

                     During the implementation of the TCP, the procurement agents were respon-
                  sible for ensuring that pre-delivery tests were conducted. Although the GMSD
                  provided the DIR with copies of “Inspection certificate-cum-dispatch clearance”
                  letters from MECON, which refer to sample testing having been undertaken,

                                                                         Detailed Implementation Review, India Health Sector


no documentation of the tests was provided to DIR, despite a specific request to
MECON for such documentation.114

       The DIR obtained drug samples relating to contracts issued under the 2002
and 2004 tenders and commissioned SGS Nederland B.V (SGS) to conduct inde-
pendent laboratory testing of the collected samples. The DIR selected the samples
from shelves in state and district stores and from bulk storage at the GMSD in
Mumbai. With respect to the 2002 tender, samples of pharmaceuticals provided by
Hindustan Laboratories (PC5), Lupin (PC10), and Nestor (PC11) were collected
from the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka.115 With regard to the 2004 tender,
samples of pharmaceuticals (PCs 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11) supplied by Microlabs, Ajanta
Pharma, and Nestor were collected from the states of Raipur, Mumbai, Thane, and
Nagpur.116

       SGS applied the India Pharmacopoeia 2006 protocol, including description,
identification, average weight, uniformity of weight, dissolution (by ultraviolet
light), and assay (by titration). All of those samples complied with the applicable
contractual specifications.


Equipment
Procurement of equipment through ICB represented only about USD 3.2 million
of the total funds spent under the TCP. It was composed of three tenders for bin-
ocular microscopes and one tender for LCD projectors, resulting in:

       ■■   A USD 1.8 million contract awarded to Light Instruments in 1999 to sup-
            ply binocular microscopes

       ■■   A USD 0.8 million contract awarded to NK Jain Instruments in 2000 to
            supply binocular microscopes

       ■■   A USD 0.5 million contract awarded to Olympus in 2002 to supply bin-
            ocular microscopes




   In addition, the DIR found no documented communications between TCP procurement agents and the
114	

MSO. Considering the MSO’s important role in registering and controlling drug manufacturers, there would
almost certainly be value in the MSO receiving and reviewing test results as well as providing greater transpar-
ency in the testing process.

     The samples were taken from the GMSD Mumbai; Mumbai District TB Control Society; Thane District Of-
fice Store; Mandya General Hospital; and Janyanagar General Hospital.

                  A.	 Review of Procurement
                     The DIR reviewed the bids, bid evaluation reports, and other documentation
                  relating to each of the four tenders. The DIR analyzed those documents for indica-
                  tors of collusion, bid rigging, improper exclusion from the bid process, and other
                  forms of fraud or corruption. The DIR did not identify any indicators of fraud or
                  corruption in connection with the procurement processes relating to the equip-
                  ment at issue.

                  B.	 Review of Implementation
                     Based on consignee lists and other information obtained by the DIR, the DIR
                  did not identify any indicators calling into question the quantity or quality of equip-
                  ment supplied under the TCP contracts under review. The DIR traced the delivery
                  of microscopes to the user level (microscopy centers). Based on an examination of
                  the equipment and discussions with the end users, the DIR found the equipment
                  fit for its intended purpose. The DIR also found that LCD projectors were deliv-
                  ered as stated on the revised consignee list and were meeting user requirements.

                     The DIR did not receive any substantial complaints from RNTCP operational
                  staff regarding the performance of the equipment provided under the contracts.
                  Problems with using the equipment were generally attributed to a difficult operat-
                  ing environment in which frequent power fluctuations sometimes cause equip-
                  ment to malfunction.


                  Locally Procured Contracts
                  Local shopping is particularly conducive to creating an environment where com-
                  panies can collude, because companies were invited by the DTO to submit quota-
                  tions, thereby limiting competition from the outset. The likelihood of fraud and
                  collusion is further heightened because of the relatively small value of the con-
                  tracts, which typically fall below the threshold for the Bank’s prior review, and
                  which, because of the high volume of such contracts and their geographical dis-
                  persion, are extremely difficult to supervise and post-review. The DIR reviewed
                  locally procured contracts because in the follow-up project to the TCP it is antici-
                  pated that a significant portion of project funds will be allowed to be spent on local
                  procurement.

   DIR findings in both Maharashtra and Karnataka indicate an elevated risk to
local procurement funds. This risk appears to have gone undetected by the Bank’s
traditional supervision methods and procurement post-reviews. The patterns of
indicators of collusion, fraud, and corruption discovered in Maharashtra and Karna-
taka were very similar and included indicators of collusive practices among bidders
and indicators of corrupt behavior between bidders and procurement officials.

   Table 14 summarizes the number and value of the contracts reviewed by the
DIR in each district, the number and value of contracts in each district that were
associated with indicators of fraud or corruption, and the overall  percentage of
such contracts in terms of both number and value, as compared with the universe
of contracts reviewed.

A.	 Pune, Maharashtra
       The DIR found indicators of fraudulent, corrupt, or collusive practices in 22 out
of 45 contracts reviewed in Pune, for a total value of INR 1,063,487 (USD 23,633),
representing 60 percent of the total value of the Pune contracts. Table 16 describes
the frequency of observed indicators.

       The DIR observed multiple indicators associated with some contracts.

       1.	 Indicators of Collusion or Bid Rigging

       In Pune, the DIR identified many indicators of collusive agreements entered
into for the purpose of sharing the award of contracts. The following sections
describe specific practices and provide examples of those indicators of collusion.

       Strong Similarities in Competing Bids’ Language/Presentation. One prac-
tice or event suggesting collusive bidding or price-fixing among competitors is
the appearance of identical formatting, calculations, spelling errors, or abbre-
viation form in two or more competitive bids. This indicator was present in 18
of the 45 Pune contracts reviewed by the DIR, with a total value of INR 818,072
(USD 18,179). These indicators were present in contracts for printing services;117
for civil works;118 and for providing pamphlets and stickers,119 disposable syringes
and needles,120 eye pieces,121 and banners.122

                              For example, with respect to contracts awarded to Bhakti Enterprises to supply
                       disposable syringes and needle contracts (World Bank Contract Numbers [WBCNs]
                       11135 and 12557), 123 the DIR observed similarities in the bids of Siddhi Surgicals,
                       Bhakti Enterprises, and M.M. Suppliers. Siddhi Surgicals and M.M. Suppliers both
                       used an equals sign between the main amount and the decimals, e.g., “4=15” instead
                       of 4.15. Quotations of Siddhi Surgicals and M.M. Suppliers misspelled “disposable”
                       as “dispocable.” Bhakti Enterprises and Siddhi Surgicals submitted handwritten quo-
                       tations with an introductory sentence ending with “we quote our lowest rates” and
                       the same closing sentence: “Thanking you, Yours faithfully.”

                          Separate Bidders with the Same Phone Number Bid under the Same Con-
                       tract. The DIR found that Tirupati Sales Corporation Mumbai and Balaji Surgical
                       shared the same phone number, 6239195, indicated on Tirupati Sales’ letterhead
                       and Balaji’s envelope. WBCNs 14214 and 10412 were awarded to Tirupati Sales
                       and were valued at INR 46,800 (USD 1,040), equal to 2.6 percent of the value of all
                       45 Pune contracts reviewed.124

                              Unit Rates of Bidders Were Related to a Common Formula. The DIR observed
                       prices quoted by bidders that appeared to be related to a common formula. One
                       Pune contract awarded to Sarvesh Distributors, valued at INR 24,300 (USD 540),
                       showed this indicator.125 Table 17 shows that all quotations on that contract were
                       in the range of ±INR 4 from each other (Sarvesh Distributors, INR 108; Global
                       Laboratories and Labline Stock Center, INR 112; and Supreme, INR 116).

                       124	
                           The DIR also observed that these two companies were linked to another company, Star Diagnostic Vasai,
                       and that these companies participated in other contracts under the World Bank–funded NACP II in Nashik and
                       Nagpur. Refer to NACP II WBCNs 10354, 12886, and 14354.

       2.	 Indicators of Fraudulent and Corrupt Practices

       In addition to collusion indicators, the DIR found indicators of the presence
of or enhanced potential for fraud at various stages in the contract award process.
Indicators of fraudulent activity in Pune were:

       Potential Tampering of Documents. The DIR found handmade corrections to
an item price on a quotation submitted by Ganesh Printers for a contract ultimately
awarded to Nandanvan Enterprises.126 The amount initially quoted by Ganesh was
INR 65, but was modified to INR 69, while Nandanvan Enterprises quoted INR 65
for this item and was awarded that contract. The lack of notations or initials by this
change indicates the possibility of tampering.

       Quotations Accepted after Submission Deadline. The DIR found an instance
where quotations were submitted and accepted by the BEC after the submission
deadline. The review team identified this indicator in one contract, valued at INR
198,615 (USD 4,414), which is equivalent to 11.17 percent of the value of all 45 con-
tracts reviewed, and 18.7 percent of the 21 contracts with identified indicators.127
In this instance, P.P. & Company’s quotation was dated February 2, 2000, Pradeep
Satalkar’s February 4, and Dabhade Brothers’ February 5, while the request for
proposals established a deadline of February 1. No date or time stamp or register
of bid receipt was found.

   Company Winning the Overwhelming Majority of Contracts Sought Con-
tract Splitting. In Pune, from 1999 to 2002, two affiliated companies, Kalyani Cor-
poration and Kalyani Associates, won the majority of RNTCP printing contracts in
Pune (Figure 3). Between November 2003 and March 2005, two companies—Max
Computers and Nandanvan Enterprises—were awarded all printing contracts.
From 1999 to 2002, 47 printing contracts valued at INR 947,714 (USD  21,060)
were awarded. The review team analyzed 22 of the 47 contracts128 and observed
that two companies, Kalyani Corporation and Kalyani Associates, were linked
through the same principal, Galada Goutam Manikchand. Kalyani Corporation
won 24 contracts, equal to 51 percent of the total number of contracts, and Kalyani
Associates won one contract, on April 23, 2002. Combined, these two companies
won 53 percent of the number of contracts awarded.

India DIR (TCP)


                  Figure 3. Distribution of Award of Printing Contracts, 1999 to 2002




                         The DIR observed that 38 printing contracts were awarded between November
                  2003 and March 2005, valued at INR 470,333 (USD  10,452). The DIR analyzed
                  these contracts and observed that two companies, Max Computers and Nandan-
                  van Enterprises, were awarded all printing contracts. It appears that Max Comput-
                  ers competed for 14 printing contracts and won all 14. These contracts were worth
                  INR 232,800 (USD 5,173), equal to 13 percent of the value of the 45 Pune contracts
                  reviewed and to 21.9 percent of the 22 contracts with indicators.

                         The DIR closely examined five of the 14 contracts awarded to Max Comput-
                  ers.129 The DTO apparently issued one request for quotations for 17 different
                  items. According to the evaluation sheet, Max Computers was the lowest bidder
                  on 14 items, equal to other bidders on two items, and higher bidder on one. Max
                  Computers was the selected contractor for all items, indicating the possibility of
                  preferential treatment. All contracts were under the Government of India guide-
                  line threshold of INR 25,000, the value that would have required higher approval
                  authority.130 Contract splitting is an indicator of the intention to avoid incurring
                  higher thresholds and possibly the review of higher authority. The DIR review team
                  also found evidence that Max Computers instructed the DTO by letter that ongo-
                  ing and future printing contracts awarded to Max Computers would be executed

and paid to Nandanvan Enterprises.131 Nandanvan Enterprises submitted quota-
tions for 13 contracts and apparently was awarded all 13.

       From 2003 to 2005, none of the companies that competed in the previous pro-
curement period participated in tenders; an entirely new group of companies were
solicited for quotes. Among those solicited, only Max Computers and Nandanvan
were awarded contracts. Max Computers specifically indicated that Nandanvan
would operate on its behalf, and after July 2004 Max did not bid for any more
contracts. Nandanvan won all contracts for which it bid, and a number of other
companies competed from 2003 to 2005 but never won.132

       3.	 Inability of the Bank’s Procurement Post-Review to Identify Fraud
       Indicators

       The DIR did not analyze the contracts reviewed by the Bank’s procurement
post-review. However, the DIR analyzed one contract that was previously reviewed
during procurement post-review. 133 The Bank’s post-review did not raise any
observations, while the DIR review team identified the fraud indicator of strong
similarities between competing bids.

B.	 Bangalore, Karnataka—Bangalore City
       The DIR segmented its local contract review in Bangalore, Karnataka, accord-
ing to the three districts examined: Bangalore City (Bangalore Mahanagara Palike),
Bangalore Rural, and Bangalore KSTCS (the Karnataka State Tuberculosis Con-
trol Society). Table 18 shows that the DIR reviewed procurement documents on
98 Bangalore contracts, mostly local shopping, procured at the state and district
level.



131	
     A letter written by Max Computers to the Pune DTO dated March 2, 2004, may provide an explanation.
In that letter, Max Computers referred to an existing rate contract with the Pune District Tuberculosis Control
Society. The letter informs project authorities that Max Computers “will work under the name of ” Nandanvan
Enterprises and that all future printing orders and payments should be made to Nandanvan Enterprises “under
the same terms and conditions of running rate contract.” The fact that the Pune DTO was employing the rate
contract procurement method while attempting to comply with Bank local shopping procedures may also
explain why the DIR observed a high incidence of quotations with indicators of fraud and collusion. If the DTO
had agreed to award Max Computers all printing contracts for that year at an agreed rate, it would still be neces-
sary, under Bank procurement guidelines, to file three quotations to justify the repetitive award to Max Comput-
ers. It is possible therefore that Max Computers would have provided all three quotations themselves, or at least
had an arrangement with two other companies for them to provide higher quotes.

                         The DIR found deficient and inaccurate procurement data pertaining to Ban-
                  galore. The project provided incomplete or incorrect initial data with respect to
                  contract amount, bidder names, and winning bidders. Initially, the Karnataka State
                  Tuberculosis Control Society in Bangalore did not provide any data to the Depart-
                  ment of Institutional Integrity (INT). Later, a spreadsheet was obtained during the
                  DIR’s stay in Bangalore.

                         Meetings with project staff for Bangalore City, also called Bangalore Mahana-
                  gara Palike, revealed that only local shopping procedures were used to procure
                  goods. The team reviewed 50 Bangalore City contracts, valued at INR 1,919,867
                  (USD 42,664).134 Of those contracts, 35 were found to have one or more indicators
                  of fraud or corruption, for a total value of INR 1,424,662 (approximately equiva-
                  lent to USD 31,659), roughly 74 percent of the total value of Bangalore City con-
                  tracts. The frequency of indicators found in the contracts with indicators is shown

       1.	    Indicators of Collusion or Bid Rigging

       For brevity, an exhaustive narrative of each local procurement indicating col-
lusion or fraud is not included here. Rather, representative examples of specific
procurements indicating collusion due to similarities in bids are as follows.

       Strong Similarities in Competing Bids’ Language and/or Presentation. In
connection with the bidding for 15 contracts, quotations from different bidders had
strong similarities. Those contracts had a total value of INR 634,110 (USD 14,091).
These indicators were present in contracts for printing services 135, and for supply-
ing plastic cups,136 books,137 lab consumables,138 and office furniture.139

India DIR (TCP)


                         For example, the DIR observed indicators of collusion in connection with
                  printing contracts awarded to P.V. Printers, V.N. Print Graphics, SS Printers, and
                  Padmashree Printers.140 Both P.V. Printers, which won contract WBCN 12571, and
                  V.N. Print Graphics, which won contract WBCN 10062, misspelled “Quatation”
                  and “Practioners” in their bid documents. The DIR also found that although P.V.
                  Printers was the lowest bidder for certain items, V.N. Print Graphics was awarded
                  both contracts for all items, supplied the items, and issued cash/credit bills for pay-
                  ment of both contracts.

                         In addition, V.N. Print Graphics, HiTech Graphic Prints, SS Printers, and Mah-
                  ant Offset Printers used similar formats and language in their bids.141 Similarities
                  included misspelling “Yours” in the final salutation as “Your’s” or “Yours’s”; using
                  two or three different fonts in the same quotation; all bidders indicating the quan-
                  tity for items as “25[space]000 Cards” and two bidders describing an item 4 as “1
                  Set 465x 4 = 1860”; and photocopy marks indicating use of the same photocopy
                  machine.

                     Separate Bidders with the Same Phone Number Bid under the Same Con-
                  tract. The DIR also identified two instances where bidders were linked to the same
                  phone number. These contracts were valued at INR 157,465 (USD  3,500). For
                  instance, in the case of WBCN 13154, two companies, S.V. MediWorld and GK
                  Sales, shared the same three phone numbers and e-mail address.

                         Unit Rates of Bidders Were Related to a Common Formula. The DIR
                  observed instances where prices quoted by bidders appeared to be related to a
                  common formula, an indicator of price collusion. The DIR identified this indica-
                  tor in six contracts, valued at INR 257,400 (USD 5,720). One example of those six
                  contracts is WBCN 12341, the bids for which are summarized in Table 20.

       2.	    Indicators of Fraudulent and Corrupt Practices

       Awards without Competition. The DIR found 10 contracts awarded without
competition, with a total value of INR 457,120 (USD 10,158), equal to 23.8 percent
of the value of the 50 contracts reviewed. In this circumstance, direct contracting
is prohibited for the procurement of goods and works. Initial data indicated that
five of the 10 contracts awarded without competition were procured through local
shopping.142 Yet, the actual documentation for these contracts consisted of direct
purchase orders and sole source justifications, with no indication of competitive
procedures. These apparent no-bid contracts may have violated the provisions of
the credit agreement.143

   Awards Made without Adequate Documentation—Endemic Recordkeeping
Failures. The DIR observed four instances where key documents were missing. For
example, the data provided on a printing contract award to Viking Printers (WBCN
10322) indicate that three bidders submitted quotations for this contract. This infor-
mation could not be verified because of missing quotations from all bidders.

       Broad Contract Specifications Impeding Objective Review. Bid specifications
and statements of work are intended to provide bidders and the selecting officials
with a firm basis for making and accepting bids. Carelessly written specifications
encourage overcharging and under delivery. During its review, the team found
numerous instances of general specifications that precluded objective review.
For instance, the DIR found descriptions in a request for quotation (RFQ) for “1.
Tables 10”; “2. Office Chairs 12”; “3. Plastic Chairs 40”; “4. Big Steel Almarah 20”;
“5. Racks 10”.144 No further specifications were indicated, such as measurements,
material, or color, for any of the items. The losing bidders (AS Industries and Ban-
galore Urban District Supply & Marketing Co-Operative Society Ltd.) offered
items with the same or very similar description, and the winning bidder, Sumukha
House of Furnishing, offered items with different specifications. Only the winning
bid contained copies of a catalogue showing the items offered, indicating that the
broad RFQ language did not encourage competitive bids from the other bidders.

       Tampering of Documents to Favor Specific Bidders. The DIR found instances of
apparent alteration, backdating, or modification of bidding or contract documents.
For instance, unit prices for quotations submitted by A.B. Enterprises and Chro-


142	
       WBCNs 12831, 13625, 13866, 12049, and 14234.
   In other instances (WBCNs 10777 and 10855) the review team found that only two, rather than three, quotes
143	

were obtained prior to award.

                  mographics Offset and comparative sheets appear to have been modified. Chromo-
                  graphics Offset’s unit rate was changed from INR 1.25 to INR 1.35 and total amount
                  changed from INR 62,500 to INR 67,500. Bidder Modplast’s rate of INR 1.30 was
                  unchanged. The rate of the winning bidder, A.B. Enterprises, was changed from INR
                  1.45 to INR 1.25. The DIR found a second, separate quotation by A.B. Enterprises
                  on file, issued on the same date as the other, but indicating a unit rate of INR 1.25.
                  The DIR observed a number of cancellations with whitening liquid on the original
                  comparative sheet, which were subsequently overwritten. Chromographics Offset’s
                  name was whited out and replaced with A.B. Enterprises. Also, by examining the
                  comparison sheet against the light to identify words whited out, the DIR observed
                  that the word “offset” of Chromographics Offset appeared clearly under the whited-
                  out section at the end of the first line of comments.145

                         Adding Items to Winning Contract after Contract Award. Adding items to
                  a contract post-award, particularly items that are beyond the scope of the original
                  award, may indicate favoritism toward a contractor and therefore may indicate
                  possible corruption. For example, in the case of WBCN 12017, the DIR observed
                  that out of the total contract value of INR 68,150 (USD 1,514), an amount of INR
                  19,000 (USD 422), equal to 28 percent, was spent on one item, 500 boxes of micro
                  slides. This item was not included in the original RFQ, or in the bidders’ quota-
                  tions, in the BER, or in the comparative statement. The supply order issued to the
                  winning bidder, Karnataka Traders, indicates that 500 boxes of micro slides were
                  added, at a cost of INR 38 per box, for a total amount of INR 19,000 (USD 422).
                  The contract documentation does not contain any document, such as the file notes,
                  justifying the addition of that item to the supply order issued to Karnataka Trad-
                  ers, nor the quantity or the price paid for such item.

                         Contract Awarded to Bidder Other Than the Lowest Evaluated Bidder.
                  The DIR found that a printing contracts award resulted from one tender for three
                  items.146 P.V. Printers was selected to be awarded contract WBCN 12571 (two
                  items) and V.N. Print Graphics was selected to be awarded contract WBCN 10062.
                  Purchase committee meeting minutes suggest that two companies should have
                  been awarded contracts. However, V.N. Print Graphics was awarded both con-
                  tracts for all items tendered under these two contracts, and it supplied and issued
                  cash/credit bills for payment of both contracts.

C.	 Bangalore, Karnataka—Bangalore Rural
       In Bangalore Rural, the DIR reviewed a total of 42 contracts, valued at INR

       Strong Similarities in Competing Bids’ Language and/or Presentation. The
DIR identified 32 contracts with strong similarities among quotations. The total
value of these contracts was INR 1,527,946 (USD 33,954), equal to 72 percent of
the value of all 42 contracts reviewed. Many of the same similarities discussed
above with respect to Pune and Bangalore City were present in Bangalore Rural,
and indicators were present in contracts for printing services147 and for the supply

                  and computer software.

                         In a contract to provide electrical works, Sreyas Electricals, Radha Enterprises,
                  and MER Machine & Equipment misspelled the word “Quotation” as “Quatation,”
                  and the word “compete” as “complet.” Bidders Radha Enterprises and MER also
                  misspelled the word “each” as “eatch.” Sreyas Electricals and M.M. Electrical Enter-
                  prises each misspelled the word “fitting” as “feting.”150

                     Separate Bidders with the Same Phone Number and Address Bid under
                  the Same Contract. Many instances in Bangalore Rural showed bidders sharing
                  the same phone number or address.151 Examples include at least seven instances
                  in which companies were linked to each other by the same phone number and
                  submitted quotations under the same contracts, with a total value of INR 303,504
                  (USD 6,744).

                         Unit Rates of Bidders Were Related to a Common Formula. The DIR
                  observed instances in which the prices quoted by bidders appeared to be related
                  to a common formula. The DIR identified this indicator in 11 contracts, valued at
                  INR 585,171 (USD 13,004). An example of this indicator includes printing contract
                  WBCN 10396,152 where quotations on lab forms from the losing bidders, Sreeman
                  Printer, Sristi Color Process, and V.S.V. Enterprises, relate to a common formula
                  of ±INR 0.02 per item, as follows: Vinay, INR 0.48; Sreeman, INR 0.49; Sristi, INR
                  0.51; and V.S.V., INR 0.53.

                         2.	 Indicators of Fraudulent and Corrupt Practices

                         Missing Procurement Documents. In Bangalore Rural, the DIR observed six
                  instances out of 42 contracts reviewed where key documents were missing from
                  the file, thus prohibiting a full review of the contract documents. Specific instances
                  include a missing RFQ for the purchase of a Hewlett Packard computer (WBCN
                  12978). Specifications of the requested computer could not be verified against the
                  quotations. This is also significant considering that the DIR observed that the quo-
                  tation submitted by the winning bidder is very detailed, indicating all technical

                  152	
                       The DIR identified three indicators in WBCN 10393: (1) strong similarities between competing bids’ lan-
                  guage/presentation; (2) the unit rate of bidders is related to a common formula; and (3) separate bidders’ identi-
                  cal phone number in same contract.

bidders.

       Failure to Solicit Quotations. The DIR observed that WBCNs 10065, 14456,
12273, and 13988 may have been procured using the direct contracting method.
Direct contracting is not allowed for goods and works under the provisions of this
project. In the case of WBCNs 10065 and 13988, the contractor, Nirmithi Kendra,
appears to be government owned and submitted four quotations for works to be
conducted in four health centers. No other quotation was sought for these con-
tracts and Nirmithi Kendra appears to have been the only bidder.

       Winning Bid Received/Opened after Losing Bids. The DIR found that bidders
submitted two sets of quotations for a treatment/identification card contract.153
Ultraprint Offset Printers’ quotation was apparently opened on May 29, 2001, AB
Enterprises’ on May 30, 2001, and Chromographics Offset’s on June 1, 2001. The
quotation of the winning bidder was the last to be opened, indicating possible
favorable treatment toward this bidder. The contract was awarded to Chromo-
graphics on June 1, 2001.

       Narrow Specifications Favoring a Specific Product or Manufacturer. The
DIR found that one RFQ identified brand and make of an item to be procured,
in addition to the technical specifications describing the qualities of the item.154
More specifically, the RFQ required quotations for “PHIL METEOR Plus Compact
Overhead Projector. . . .” The winning company, US Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., was the
only bidder using this same description (including use of upper case), while the
other two bidders, Audivision India Pvt. Ltd. and Polestar Enterprise, quoted for
“Meteo Plus” overhead projector, without specifying the brand. In addition, the
winning bidder’s quotation specifies the technical specifications, while the losing
bidders’ quotations mention only the model of the item quoted and the cost.

                     Like other sites, KSTCS contracts showed similarities among quotations. For
                  instance, quotations for printing contract WBCN 14682 were submitted by com-
                  panies Maithri Screens, Sai Printers, and Sarika Printers and Publication. The con-
                  tract was awarded to Maithri. All quotations submitted by the bidders were hand-
                  written and all bidders mention on the envelope that they are submitting quota-
                  tion for “A, B, C and D” form printing, while the RFQ mentioned A, B, C, D, and E
                  forms. The quotation forms submitted by the bidders all have a date on the bottom,
                  August 17, 2005. On three out of four quotations, the date is written in the same
                  format “17/8/05” followed by “Bangalore.”

                     In addition, the DIR found two sets of two companies submitting quotes for all
                  four contracts, sharing the same address. As depicted in Figure 4, GRR Creation

Project Reports and Assessments
To assess the effectiveness of the Bank’s supervision of the TCP’s implementation,
the DIR reviewed supervision documents and reports provided to and produced
by the Bank. These documents and reports were reviewed for the purposes of
assessing (1) whether those documents reflect an awareness of the indicators iden-
tified by the DIR; and (2) how the Bank responded to any identified indicators. The
DIR also reviewed how the Bank addressed complaints filed regarding the TCP,
because such complaints often provide strong indicators of problems with certain
aspects of a project.

A.	 Supervision Documents
   The TCP audit reports provided the Bank with information about a number
of problems with the TCP’s procurements and implementation, although they did
not indicate that the problems were pervasive. Despite the identification of these
problems, the Bank’s supervision documents—such as ISRs and PSRs—did not
address these issues or modify the project’s performance ratings because of them.

                  The audit reports therefore suggest a deficiency in the Bank’s response to the indi-
                  cators of fraud and corruption of which it becomes aware.

                         1.	 Audits of Project Finances

                         The TCP credit agreement required annual audits of the project’s finances but
                  did not specify how the audits were to be conducted or the level of government
                  (national, state, or district) that was responsible for conducting the audits.155 The
                  DIR identified the following types of reports relating to the TCP:

                          ■■    CTD (National) Reports. Yearly audit certificates and inspection reports
                                prepared by the Office of the Director General of Audit, which opine
                                whether “the expenditure statement/financial statements read with the
                                observations [contained therein] represent a true and fair view of the
                                implementation (and operation) of the Project for the year”156

                          ■■    State Tuberculosis Control Societies. Yearly audit reports, related opinions,
                                and utilization certificates, conducted by external auditors, which review
                                state and district consolidated financial statements and opine, in part, on
                                the propriety of TCP expenditures.157

                         The DIR received a total of 116 reports relating to the years 2002 through 2005.
                  Those included 113 state audit reports and three audit certificates/inspection
                  reports prepared by the Office of the Director General of Audit.

                         The TCP audit reports noted the following indicators of fraud that corroborate
                  and expand upon the DIR’s findings:

                         Internal Control Weaknesses. A solid internal control framework is neces-
                  sary to ensure the propriety of financial transactions and the reliability of financial
                  statements. As described in greater detail below, the TCP audit reports reviewed
                  by the DIR include a number of references to internal control breakdowns and
                  recommendations as to how to improve internal controls.158

                  spondence to the Deputy Director General (TCP) in 2005, 2006, and 2007, highlighting specific issues requiring
                  immediate attention. For example, in a 2006 letter, the Bank’s Senior Public Health Specialist wrote: “Internal
                  control issues continue to be weak in a number of cases which is evidenced by no physical verifications of assets,
                  bank reconciliation statements not being prepared regularly and delay in obtaining utilization certificates for
                  civil works, etc.” Letter from Birte Holm Sorensen, World Bank, to Dr. L. S. Chauhan, Deputy Director General

       ■■   Lack of Reconciliations and Inadequate Tracking of Outstanding Advances.
            The audit reports document at least 12 instances of delinquent outstand-
            ing advances159 and at least eight instances of incomplete or delinquent
            reconciliations, including reconciliations of claimed cash balances to bank
            statements.160

       ■■   Inadequate Controls Surrounding SOEs. The reports contain at least five
            references to inconsistencies between expenses recorded on SOEs and
            expenses recorded in financial accounts.161 The reports also noted delays
            in the completion of SOE claim submissions.162

       ■■   Inability to Maintain Accurate Financial Accounts. The audit reports con-
            tain at least 12 references to issues relating to poor maintenance of finan-
            cial accounts, including the failure to maintain consistent account head-
            ers, to record transactions in the correct periods, or to run trial balances
            at recommended intervals.

       ■■   Inadequate Procedures Surrounding Handling of Cash. The audit reports
            identify at least nine instances of deficient procedures surrounding the han-
            dling and recording of cash. These included allowing cash payments above
            approved limits, failing to record cash transactions properly, and failing to
            maintain consistency between opening and closing account balances.163

                          ■■    Verification of Fixed Assets Not Performed. At least 16 audit reports indi-
                                cate a failure to maintain fixed asset registers and/or to perform periodic
                                physical counts.164

                         Indicators of Possible Fraud and Corruption. In addition to the internal con-
                  trol issues identified throughout the audit reports, the reports include a number of
                  indicators of fraud and corruption, including:

                          ■■    Unsupported or Questionable Cash Transactions. Several audit reports
                                described fraudulent cash withdrawals and suggested the adoption of spe-
                                cific internal control measures for banking activities.165 Another reported
                                bank withdrawals that were not recorded on the project’s books.166

                          ■■    Unsupported or Questionable Expenditures. The 2003–2004 audit report for
                                Himachal Pradesh referred to an “adjustment” relating to an INR 91,000
                                (USD  2,022) “advance” that was made to “the Resident Commissioner,
                                Killar (Pangi),” for which “[n]o bills and vouchers” existed and for which
                                “[e]ven the dates of the payments and the names of the persons to whom
                                payments have been made have not been given.”167 The 2005–2006 audit
                                report for Delhi indicated that certain expense items were re-categorized
                                as “advances” due to the lack of proper support for the use of funds.168
                                Other reports noted instances where expenditures lacked proper sup-
                                port169 or were mischaracterized.170

              a vehicle was being used by a government official.171 The 2003–2004 audit
              report for Bihar noted that certain TCP consumables were stored at an
              official’s residence.172 The 2003–2004 audit report for Rajasthan noted that
              one district had not disclosed any fixed assets on its balance sheet at all,
              and suggested that management take steps to rectify the situation.173

        ■■    Procurement Irregularities (Lack of Competitive Bidding). Two audit
              reports noted instances in which items were procured “without inviting
              quotations.”174

       Bank Response to Audit Reports. In general, because of the limited amount
of correspondence and documentation reviewed by the DIR, the DIR was not able
to determine the extent to which the Bank followed up, on a systematic basis, on
specific audit report findings.175 The DIR did note some requests for clarification
and status reports regarding issues raised in specific audit reports, such as in the
case of a USD  22,222 fraudulent withdrawal in the Kerala State TCP Society.176
However, with respect to many of the issues raised in the audit reports, the DIR is
not aware of any documentation suggesting that the Bank took note of the issues
or took any action to address them.

       2.	 Procurement Post-Reviews

       The Bank conducts procurement post-reviews to (1) verify the procurement
and contracting procedures; (2) verify technical compliance and physical comple-
tion; (3) review contract management issues; (4) determine whether adequate pro-
curement, planning, implementation, and monitoring systems are in place; and (5)
identify remedies to correct any noted deficiencies.177

India DIR (TCP)


                         The DIR reviewed all of the TCP post-review reports that had been uploaded
                  to the Bank’s document management system (IRIS). Those reports related to
                  the Bank’s procurement team’s visits to the following states: Arunachal Pradesh,
                  Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Madhya
                  Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Sikkim,
                  Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.178 The Bank’s post-reviews
                  identified a number of indicators.

                         Indicators of Possible Fraud and Corruption. Because procurement post-re-
                  views are focused on determining adherence to the Bank’s procurement guidelines,
                  issues and findings highlighted in those reports may sometimes provide notice of
                  potential indicators of fraud and corruption. The TCP post-reviews examined by
                  the DIR include the following indicators of possible fraud and corruption:

                          ■■   Improper Procurement Method Used. The reports identified at least
                               37 instances across 11 states, relating to contracts with a total value of
                               USD 184,444, in which the incorrect procurement method was used. Of
                               these, 33 contracts were sole sourced; three were awarded on the basis
                               of repeat orders and were, therefore, effectively sole sourced; two were
                               awarded on the basis of state guidelines instead of competitive bidding;
                               and one was awarded to a company that did not even bid, effectively result-
                               ing in a sole source.179

                          ■■   Improper Bid Notification Procedures. The reports identify four instances
                               across three states, relating to contracts with a total value of USD 2,788, in
                               which no solicitation letters were issued and bids were provided over the
                               telephone.180

                          ■■   Vague Solicitation Letters. The reports indicate that in nine cases across six
                               states, relating to contracts with a total value of USD 19,609, solicitation
                               letters were too vague and failed to include required information such as
                               quantities, bid validity period, and delivery details.181 Vague solicitation
                  178

               letters can result in incomplete responses from some vendors while allow-
               ing others to obtain the clarification necessary to submit a more respon-
               sive bid.

        ■■     Orders Placed Prior to Vendor Selection. The reports indicate that in three
               separate instances in three different states, relating to contracts with a
               total value of USD 7,680, vendor selection or the actual receipt of goods
               occurred prior to the bid review and official vendor selection.182 The award
               of contracts prior to receiving offers may indicate that the winning ven-
               dors were pre-selected.

        ■■     Bids Submitted Prior to Issuance of Solicitation Letter. The Goa review noted
               a contract for USD 295 for which two bids were dated prior to the issuance
               of the solicitation letters, which may indicate that the bidders were con-
               tacted in advance and possibly provided advance information on bidding
               requirements.183

        ■■     Pricing Irregularities. In two separate cases, reviewers identified pricing
               irregularities within contracts. In Goa, USD  200 of bamboo sticks were
               sole sourced at twice the price paid for the same item a year earlier.184 In
               Chhattisgarh, several items were procured at prices higher than those
               offered by other qualified bidders.185

        ■■     Insufficient Time to Bid. The reports identify four instances across three
               states, relating to contracts worth a total of USD 8,355, in which the ten-
               der processes did not allow sufficient time for suppliers to submit bids.186
               Failing to allow for sufficient response times may result in interested and
               competitive suppliers being unable to bid properly, and can lead to the
               steering of contracts to preferred suppliers.

                          ■■   Contract Splitting. The Uttar Pradesh post-review report indicates that at
                               least one tender, totaling INR 29,350 (USD 652), was split into two con-
                               tracts to keep the value below the INR 15,000 review threshold.187

                          ■■   Unapproved Bid and Tender Modifications. The reports identify three
                               instances in which bids were modified after they were submitted. In Goa,
                               two bidders submitted modified bids two days after quotations were
                               opened for a USD 295 contract.188 The Tripura report identified three sep-
                               arate instances in which the same contractor submitted an alternate bid, in
                               the same amount, for three different remodeling contracts, each of which
                               was worth USD  778.189 It is not clear whether the new bid amount was
                               higher or lower than the original bid.

                          ■■   Bid Similarities. One tender file from Sikkim included three bids related
                               to a USD 864 contract. The reviewer noted that all three quotations “were
                               exactly identical in all respects except rates raising doubts about their
                               genuineness.”190

                          ■■   Missing Documentation. In 11 instances across three states, relating to
                               contracts worth a total of USD 9,550, no bid documents whatsoever were
                               available for review.191 The lack of tender documents brings into ques-
                               tion whether or not a competitive process was undertaken at all in those
                               cases.

                         3.	 SOE Financial Reviews

                         The SAR Financial Management representatives provided the DIR with five
                  Statement of Expenditure Financial Review reports related to TCP, for the states
                  of Assam, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat. These reviews were
                  performed to verify that claimed expenditures (1) were used for their intended
                  purpose, (2) were properly supported by adequate documentation, (3) were prop-
                  erly recorded in the accounting records, and (4) were eligible for financing by the
                  bank. Further, the reviews were performed to assess whether the projects had ade-
                  quate internal control frameworks to support the accurate preparation of SOEs.192

       The SOE Financial Reviews include several indications of internal control
weaknesses such as inadequate recordkeeping and failure to properly approve
SOE submitted to the Bank.193 In addition, the reports include several indicators of
fraud and corruption including:

       Advances Claimed As Expenditure. The report for Tamil Nadu indicates that
advances given for certain hospital repairs in the amount of INR 56,000 were
included in SOE expenditure figures.194

       Inadequate Handling of Cash and Fraudulent Withdrawal. The report for Assam
indicates that temporary employees were being allowed to handle banking trans-
actions, creating an opportunity for fraud. Further, at DTCS Nalbari, an embezzle-
ment of INR 112,200 was committed through a forgery. The report notes, however,
that the amount was subsequently recovered.195

       Discrepancies between SOE Amounts and Audited Financial Statements.
Each of the five reports included a finding that expenditure totals in the SOEs did
not agree to audited financial statements or the underlying books and records. The
total discrepancy aggregated INR 2,818,000.196

       4.	 The ICR

       Project Rating. The ICR rated the TCP’s implementation and achievement
of development objectives as “satisfactory.” The ICR concluded that the project
achieved its development objective “to reduce mortality, morbidity and disability
due to TB by curing TB cases, thereby reducing the incidence of infectious TB, the
annual risk of infection, and the development of drug resistance.”197 The ICR cited
the following statistics in support of its conclusion:

        ■■    “Initially it had been envisaged that, over the entire project period, public
              sector health services in the project districts would process 1.9 million

                                 The actual estimated number was slightly over four million. . . .”198

                          ■■     “Similarly, it had been envisaged that, over the entire project period, about
                                 800,000 patients would be put on DOTS treatment in the project districts,
                                 but the actual number was more than double this target, at almost 1.8 mil-
                                 lion patients.”199

                          ■■     “Also in 2004, a sputum positive case detection rate of 72  percent was
                                 achieved in the project districts against a target of 50 percent in the SAR
                                 [South Asia Region].”200

                          ■■     “The cure rate for cases treated in project districts in 2004 reached 86 per-
                                 cent, slightly higher than the project’s target of 85 percent. The public sec-
                                 tor TB cure rate nationwide before the start of the project was only about
                                 35 percent, which shows how large a difference the introduction of DOTS
                                 has brought.”201

                         The ICR also concluded that the project had “developed clear operational and
                  technical guidelines for treatment as well as procurement, financial management
                  and other technical aspects of the project.”202

                         “The Bank’s performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
                  project [was] rated satisfactory,”203 as was the Bank’s performance during super-
                  vision.204 The ICR concluded that “Aide-Mémoires were effective in alerting the
                  MOFHW and CTD to problems with project execution,” and that “Project Status
                  Reports (PSRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of
                  achievement of development objectives and project implementation.”205 The ICR
                  also determined that “[t]he Bank was . . . firm when the circumstances so required,
                  as demonstrated during suspension and restructuring of the project.”206 “By not
                  canceling the project at that time,” the ICR noted, “the Bank management took a
                  calculated risk and in retrospect this turned out to be a good decision.”207

       The Borrower’s overall performance was rated “moderately satisfactory.”208
The ICR concluded that, “[w]hile the government’s performance before suspen-
sion was clearly unsatisfactory, improvement after the lifting of suspension was
remarkable.”209

       Identification of Implementation Problems. The ICR identified “[t]wo aspects
of project design which became serious constraints to effective program implemen-
tation . . . (i) the centralization of decision making in the program and unclear role
assigned to the states; and (ii) weak procurement capacity of the MOHFW.”210

       With respect to the former, the ICR noted that “[t]he reluctance of the MOHFW
and WHO to provide wider responsibilities to the states, proved to be a major
constraint to ensure decentralized implementation and extending the [TCP’s]
coverage.”211 The ICR concluded that the problem was adequately “addressed dur-
ing the project restructuring [in 2002].”212

       With regard to inadequate procurement capacity, the ICR noted the MOHFW’s
failure to accede to the Bank’s insistence that an independent procurement agent
be appointed, which led to the project’s suspension in March 1998.213 Although
“the GOI [Government of India] signed a contract with RITES for this purpose” in
January 2000, the ICR concluded that “timely procurement of drugs remained an
issue even after this step was concluded.”214

       However, the ICR did not refer at all to any of the procurement problems and
other issues that had been noted in the various audit reports and procurement
post-reviews. Similarly, although the aides-mémoire sometimes referred to pro-
curement delays215 and an inadequate financial management infrastructure,216 they
never noted any of the fraud or corruption indicators described in the audit and
post-review reports.

                  B.	 Complaints Management
                         As detailed below, the DIR reviewed a number of complaints relating to
                  the pharmaceuticals and equipment procured under the TCP. In a number of
                  instances, the available documentation was not sufficient to determine whether
                  the Bank responded appropriately to the complaints. However, in the cases for
                  which documentation was available, the DIR concluded that the Bank generally
                  took appropriate steps to investigate and resolve the complaints.

                         1.	 Pharmaceuticals

                         The 1999 Tender. With respect to the 1999 tender, the Bank received com-
                  plaints from two companies (Lyka Labs and Maneesh) whose bids were deemed
                  non-responsive. The Bank referred the complaints to the procurement agency
                  (HSCC) for consideration.217

                         Both HSCC and the Bank determined that the BEC properly disqualified Lyka
                  Labs, which failed to provide evidence of a manufacturing license for the pharma-
                  ceutical “combi-packs” that were a required element of the products for which Lyka
                  Labs was the lowest evaluated bidder (PCs 1 and 3).

                         According to the BER, Maneesh’s bid was deemed non-responsive because the
                  company failed to demonstrate the necessary volume of prior sales. The documents
                  provided to the DIR do not reveal how HSCC dealt with Maneesh’s subsequent com-
                  plaint. However, Maneesh did not submit the lowest bid for any of the three items
                  for which it competed, so its complaint does not give rise to concerns with the BEC’s
                  ultimate findings.

                         The 2000 Tender. The DIR reviewed three complaints relating to the 2000 ten-
                  der. The first such complaint, a letter from Novartis to the Bank, argued that Novar-
                  tis should have been awarded the contract at issue because it was the lowest bid-
                  der. However, Novartis acknowledged in its letter that “due to an oversight, certain
                  documents were not submitted” with its bid. In response, the procurement agent
                  (MECON) properly stood by its decision to exclude Novartis on the basis of the
                  inadequate documentation.

                         Two other complaints, addressed to the Bank and others, questioned the decision
                  to exclude Cadila/Zydus from competing for PC1 contracts. In response, MECON
                  properly pointed out that the company failed to demonstrate that it had supplied a
                  217	
                      As noted earlier in this chapter, procurement was initially conducted by the MOHFW, then on an interim
                  basis by HSCC. In 2000, at the Bank’s insistence, an independent professional procurement agency, MECON,
                  was selected to oversee procurements. When the project was extended in 2005, WHO’s Global Drug Facility as-
                  sumed the responsibilities for managing procurement under the TCP.



                                                                      590

certain quantity of the drug over the past two years, as required by the tender docu-
ments. That requirement had been reviewed and approved by the Bank, which prop-
erly supported MECON’s interpretation.

   The 2001 Tender. The DIR reviewed four complaints relating to the 2001 tender.
Pure Pharma complained to the Bank about a clarification to the bidding documents
issued by MECON approximately one month before the bid submission deadline.
Specifically, Pure Pharma took issue with what it viewed as “unrealistic stipulations
sets regarding the annual turnover requirement of [International Tender Documents]
imposed at the end of the sale period” and complained that the huge bid securities
requested had financial implications for the companies. The DIR was not provided
with any other correspondence related to this matter. However, Pure Pharma was
not disqualified from this process, so this issue apparently had no impact in its abil-
ity to participate in the tender.

   The Bank was also copied on correspondence from Nestor, complaining that the
company had been unfairly excluded from the bidding process because of an unjust
deregistration by the MSO. The DIR did not receive additional documentation show-
ing how those complaints were processed. However, as noted above, Nestor had been
deregistered by the MSO at this time and was not authorized to provide drugs to the
MOHFW.

   I. D. Nagpal submitted a note to the Bank stating that one of the bidders, Lupin
Laboratories, had been debarred by the Ministry of Defence in April 2001 with respect
to supplying pyrazinamide 750 mg. According to Mr. Nagpal, the company sought to
avoid the debarment by merging with Lupin Chemicals, forming a new entity called
“Lupin Ltd.” The DIR did not receive additional documentation regarding this com-
plaint. However, the MSO registry does not record Lupin as being deregistered, so it
appears that the company was properly included in the 2001 tender.

   Finally, a complaint submitted by the Indian Society to Eradicate Corruption in
Public Spending supported Nestor’s claim that it was unfairly excluded and repeated
Mr. Nagpal’s complaint that Lupin Ltd. received a contract award for which another
company, Lupid Laboratories, submitted the bid. No documentation was provided
to the DIR to determine how this complaint was handled.

   The 2002 Tender. The DIR located only one complaint relating to the 2002 ten-
der. Pure Pharma wrote to the Bank, arguing that the company should have been
awarded certain contracts despite the fact that it had been deregistered as an autho-
rized supplier of isoniazid. The DIR has not been provided with documentation

                  showing how this complaint was handled. However, as discussed above, it is clear
                  that Pure Pharma was deregistered at the time and thus correctly excluded from all
                  PCs that included isoniazid.

                     The 2004 Tender. With the exception of the correspondence relating to Nestor’s
                  and Pure Pharma’s deregistrations, described in detail earlier in this chapter, no
                  complaints were submitted to the Bank with regard to the 2004 tender.

                     2.	 Equipment

                     The DIR located six complaints that were submitted to the Bank relating to the
                  procurement of equipment. Three of the complaints related to the interpretation of
                  certain bid specifications and the reasons why some companies’ bids (Carl Zeiss,
                  Labomed, and HD Consortium [HDC]) were deemed non-responsive. In the case
                  of Zeiss and HDC, the Bank sought clarification from HSCC and, after considering
                  HSCC’s response, rejected the complaint. There is no documentation showing how
                  the Bank handled the complaint submitted by Labomed.

                     The other three complaints (submitted by Leica Microsystems, Darbara Singh,
                  and Speed Fair Co.) related to the claim that MLW Intermed (provider of light instru-
                  ments equipment) was not the manufacturer of the microscopes and that the micro-
                  scopes were not manufactured in Germany. The correspondence reviewed by the DIR
                  suggests that the Bank’s South Asia Region procurement team (SAR team) properly
                  handled the matter, seeking clarifications from the Borrower and demanding that
                  specific measures be taken to establish whether the allegations were true. Only after
                  these additional steps had been taken did the Bank gave its No-Objection to the con-
                  tract award, with the proviso that if it was later established that the microscopes were
                  not produced by MLW in Germany, the Bank would not finance the contract. In addi-
                  tion, the SAR team contacted the Bank’s Oversight Committee for Fraud and Corrup-
                  tion (OCFC, within which INT was located at that time) setting out the allegations.
                  A member of the SAR team later visited the MLW premises in Germany to estab-
                  lish whether the company was producing microscopes, and the findings were shared
                  with the OCFC. Additionally, on its website, MLW Germany claims to have provided
                  microscopes to India in 1998–2000 under the RNTCP and Malaria projects.

                     The DIR was advised by Dr. H. R. Raweendra, a WHO consultant, that he had
                  heard from an unidentified lab technician that the microscopes were manufactured
                  in China. However, he was unable to provide the source of that information and
                  identify the contracts related to this rumor. In short, the DIR found no indicators
                  calling into question the origin of the microscopes.
