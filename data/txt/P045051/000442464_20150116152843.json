India's fight against HIV began\n            in earnest with the start of the World bank-financed\n            National AIDS Project, approved in 1992. To promote\n            nationwide efforts, the project set up AIDS control offices\n            in 32 states and union territories. It also helped establish\n            information, education, and communication (IEC) program,\n            exploiting media and traditional communications channels\n            such as folk music, festivals, awareness campaigns, and\n            elephant parades to highlight the risks of HIV or AIDS.\n            Building on initial phases of HIV or AIDS work, India now\n            faces the challenge of quickly and effectively implementing\n            programs in a number of states. Focusing on high-risk groups\n            and low-cost prevention efforts, the Second National AIDS\n            Control Project, approved by the World Bank in June 1999, is\n            helping India to carry on the fight against AIDS in India."}, "docdt": "2002-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
