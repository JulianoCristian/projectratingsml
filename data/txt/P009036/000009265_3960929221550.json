Project\n            will provide long-term funds to help finance the private\n            investments needed to sustain Turkey's export drive in\n            the 1990s.  By channeling these funds through the private\n            banking system the project will continue the process of\n            strengthening individual financial institutions as a\n            strategic complement of the on-going program to improve the\n            efficiency of the financial system.  The project will also\n            help the real sector respond adequately to on-going and\n            planned reforms by providing it with resources needed to\n            restructure existing, or invest in new, capacities that make\n            economic sense in the reforming environment."}, "docdt": "1991-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
