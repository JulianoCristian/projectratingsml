EMORANDUM  AND RECQOQ aTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MANM FOR REMCOISTUCTION AD DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REFUBLIC OF TURMEY
FOR A PRIVATE IESTMENT CREDIT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for US$200 million
equivalent. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 17 years
maturity, including a five-year grace period, and would help finance a private
investment credit proJect.
2.          Country and Sector Background.  Since 1980, the Government of
Turkey (GOT) has been pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy that
places increasing reliance on market forces and the private sector. Turkey's
major success in the 1980s was on the export front. Exports as a share of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tripled between 1980 and 1985 from 5X to 151,
while manufactured exports increased from $1 billion in 1980 to $9 billion in
1989, growing to 801 of merchandise exports. The growth of exports was,
however, made possible by expanding utilization of existing capacity from the
depressed levels of the early 1980s; investment in manufacturitig actually
declined significantly in real terms, and fell as a share of total investment
from 34X in 1980 to 15X in 1989. This decline reflects the drastic cutback of
public investment in manufacturing, in line with the Government's intention of
relinquishing its role in the productive sectors, but also the sluggish
response of private investment. Although public investment in manufacturing
is set to decline further, private investment in 1990 increased significantly,
mainly for modernization purposes. Export growth slowed considerably in the
second half of the 1980s; the exports/GDP ratio actually declined slightly
between 1985 and 1989. Owing partly to reduced export incentives and an
appreciating TL, exports hardly grew in 1989 and kept their share of GDP in
1990. Given the increasing competition in world markets, a further
acceleration of investment in tradeables has become increasingly important for
Turkey. The project aims at providing the initial impetus to increased
investments in export capacity needed for the 1990s.
3.          The Project is proposed in light of policy reforms and
institutional changes being undertaken and planned on the macroeconomic,
financial and industrial fronts. Macroeconomic performance in 1990 improved
with a rapid acceleration in the rate of growth to about 91 in 1990 from a
sluggish 1.71 in 1989. The Central Bank acquired sufficient autonomy to
implement an independent program of monetary restraint that counter-balanced
an expansionary fiscal stance. As a consequence, inflation had abated from
701 in 1989 to 491 in 1990 despite the inflationary effects of the Gulf
crisis. In response to this external shock the Government introduced
significant adjustment measures beginning in September 1990. In approving the
1991 budget, the Parliament introduced a 51 cut in non-personnel expenditures
across the board. These measures notwithstanding, inflationary pressures



-2-
tncreased by end-April 1991, when inflation stood at about 551, demonstrating
that without consistent fiscal adjustment, monetary instruments alone are
inadequate in achieving stability. Therefore, further fiscal adjustment is
needed to reduce the public sector deficit to a sustainable level, and to make
the fiscal stance supportive of anti-inflationary monetary policy objectives.
In the financial sector, policy and institutional reforms have been
successfully completed under the Second Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL
II). Major distortions (and quasi-fiscal subsidies) associated with
preferential credits have been eliminated, except in agriculture. Banks have
strengthened their capital base in line with new prudential regulations and,
after a special portfolio audit, have fully provided for non-performing loans.
A bank restructuring institution to resolve future bank failures and insure
small depositors is being established, and the system for bank supervision is
being improved. Reforms in agriculture credit interest rates and in the
agriculture bank are being pursued under the Third J'riculture Credit Project
(Loan 3090-TU). In the industrial sector, discussions with the Government on
an industrial sector adjustment program have focused on a rationalizatlon of
the structure of taxes and subsidies, to continue to remove anomalies and
allow market forces to provide a stronger guide to investment decisions.
4.          Assuming sustained progress on these fronts, private investment
demand for capital goods can be expected to grow, but the availability of
medium to long-term credit to finance such investment is likely to be
constrained over the short-term without Bank assistance. Even after the
planned adjustments have been made, there will still be a time lag until the
fiscal and industrial policy reforms appear to be irreversible, and the banks
are able to mobilize sufficient term deposits which can be used for investment
financing. During the time window between policy reform and changes in the
maturity composition of financial assets, it is essential that the Bank
provide financial and technical support for banks which want to establish a
presence in the term lending market. The objective of this loan is not to
substitute for the banks' own efforts to mobilize term resources. Rather, the
intention is that the proposed project will directly support the reform
process by providing long-term resources in the transition period between
policy changes and increased financial intermediation by the banking sector,
and by strengthening the financial sector's institutional capacity to carry
out prudent term transformation.
5.          Lessons Learned. The project is designed to build on the
successful experience of an earlier project. The Industrial Export
Development Project (IEDP) of US$300 million equivalent was approved by the
Bank in January 1988. While this loan was expected to be committed by 1992,
it was actually fully committed by mid-1989. IEDP has supported total
investments in export-oriented activities amounting to US$2.1 billion
resulting in annual incremental output of US$1.0 billion, of which US$500
million was for exports, mainly to OECD markets. Most investments were for
the expansion or balancing of existing capacity in activities in which Turkey
has comparative advantage -textiles, rubber products, glass manufacturing and
tourism - resulting in subprojects with high economic rates of return
(averaging 391). Through the project, compliance with the new prudential
regulations and audit guidelines issued under FSAL II was enforced for each of



the participating commercial and development banks, thus reinforcing at the
level of individual institutions the reforms being undertaken for the system
as a whole. The main lesson learned from the IEDP operation related to the
unsustainability of the subsidies implicit in the Foreign Exchange Risk
Insurance Scheme (FERIS). Under the proposed project, the FERIS is therefore
expected to be abolished.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project forms an
integral part of the Bank's country and sector assistance strategy and
contributes to the attainment of the development objectives in the industrial
*         and financial sectors.  In the industrial sector, it supports reforms that
have been undertaken or are planned by providing the private sector with long-
term funds to adjust by investing in, or restructuring, activities that make
*        economic sense under the reforming environment.  The Bank's involvement is
called for to help ensure the required supply response by providing the
additional resources needed as a consequence of the reform program in the
industrial sector. In the financial sector, it will continue the sector
assistance strategy (as successfully implemented under the IEDP) and
complement the reforms undertaken under FSAL II by helping indi-idual
financial institutions not only to continue to meet minimum creditworthiness
criteria, but also to develop into efficient intermediaries in an increasingly
competitive environment. The Bank's involvement in strengthening individual
financial institutions is thus a. logical and strategic complement to its
effort to strengthen the financial system.
7.          Project Objectives.  The proposed project has the following
objectives:  (i) to finance financially and economically viable prVA1tQ
investments, especially export-oriented activities, to increase the country's
productive capacity in areas of comparative advantage under a reforming
environment; (ii) to continue to assist the private development banks, Sinai
Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB) and Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB), in
their business and resource diversification programs to enable them to grow in
an increasingly competitive financial system; and (iii) to support sustained
implementation of the Government's banking reforms at the intermediary level
by ensuring that the participating private commercial banks (which together
account for over 80X of the private banking sector) continue to be financially
sound and grow into intermediaries capable of mobilizing and allocating long-
term resources more efficiently.
8.          Project Descrit&ion. The proposed project would provide long-
term funds to help fill the financing gap for private investments.  Private
industrial investment over the 1990-92 period is estimated at roughly US$6.3
billion, under a conservative assumption of no growth in investments. Out of
this amount about US$3.1 billion would be required in loan funds assuming a
debt/equity ratio of 1:1. The pipelines of investment projects of the
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and their projected lending
programs for the same period indicate a demand for loan funds in excess of
this magnitude. Bank funds would be on-lent by the Government initially to
ten private financial institutions (eight commercial banks and two development
banks) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan plus an on-lending
fee equivalent to an effective rate of 0.35X p.a., which has been negotiated



- 4 -
between the GOT and the PFIs. This fee represents a reasonable proxy of
market value of the government guarantee, and takes into account foreign
exchange and variable interest rate risks to be assumed by the PFIs. The sub-
borrowers would be able to borrow in one or more of five currencies (DX, Sf,
Sterling, US$, Yen), would bear the foreign exchange risk and would pay the
appropriate LIBOR cost of the currency or currencies selected plus a spread to
be negotiated with the PFIs on a case by case basis. The participating
financial institutions would re-lend the funds to sub-borrowers for a period
of eight years including three years grace, and carry and manage the cross
currency risk in accordance with the prudential regulations of the Banking
Law. The PFIs would also bear the credit risks and be responsible for
appraising investment projects in accordance with Bank standards, ensuring
that sub-projects are financially and economically viable with a minimum
internal financial rate of return and internal economic rate of return of 152
irk -.'sal terms. Any private investments producing tradeable goods and
serv.ces, excluding agriculture, would be eligible for financing. Based on
past experience and the project pipelines of the PFIs, however, the
expectation is that most of the funds would go to finance industrial
investments. The technical assistance component of the Project would provide
training and consultancy services to the participating financial institutions
to improve their project finance capabilities. A breakdown of project costs
and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
proo-urement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Turkey are gtven in Schedule C, and D and E
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. (9060-TU),
dated Hay 29, 1991, is being distributed separately.
9.          Ageed Actions.  During negotiations agreements were reached with
the Government on the following:
(i) FIRIS. With the opening-up of the capital account in August
1989 and the full convertibility of the Turkisn Lira, the need for foreign
exchange risk insurance as conceived under the FERIS, which had been
introduced in 1985, has disappeared. The Government, therefore, agreed in
principle to abolish the FERIS. In the meantime, it has been decided that
new resources would not be added to the FERIS until December 1992, the end of
its current political mandate. The FERIS would be wound down until existing
loans are fully disbursed. Should there be a reversal of this decision the
Bank would have the option of suspending or cancelling the project.
(ii) Participation Conditions for the Participating Financial
Intitutiona. It was agreed that only PFIs that meet the following conditions
would be allowed to participate in the Project: (a) a clern audit by external
auditors in accordance with internationally accepted accounting principles;
(b) compliance with the new prudential regulations on loan-loss provisioning,
capital adequacy and loan concentration; (c) a positive real return to equity;
(d) adherence to satisfactory policy and strategy statements approved by the
PFI boards and agreed with the Bank; and (e) minimum collection ratio on
medium and long- term loans.  Continued compliance with the participation
conditions would be monitored regularly in the course of project supervision.



- 5 -
Should a PFI fail to comply with any of the conditions at any time the Bank
would have the option of suspending that PFI's partLeLpation in the Project
until satLsfactory corrective measures are taken. Should a P7I's suspension
continue for a period of six months, its participation in the Project would be
cancelled. It was further agreed that the participating commercial banks
would be required to have competent staff to appraise and supervise investment
projects. The development banks, TSKB and SYKB, will be subject to additional
performance criteria, including the maintenance of a minimum debt-service-
coverage ratio, a maximum debt-equity ratio, and the satisfactory
implementatLon of their agreed business diversification plans.
(iii)  OQ  lgtJLn  ArrmnLtMs . The PFIs will initially comprise
two private development banks and eight private commercial banks. Any other
bank that is interested in participating in the project would be subject to
the same assessment vis-a-vis the agreed partlcipation conditions. Out of the
proposed Bank loan of US$200 million, US$50 million and US$40 million,
respectively, will be allocated to TSKB and SYKB. The balance of US$110
million from the Bank loan will be made available only to the commercial banks
on a first-come, first-served basis.
(iv) On-lending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk. It was agreed
that the sub-loans under the project be denominated in fcreign currency. The
Government will on-lend the Bank funds to the PFIs on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan plus an on-lending fee equivalent co an effective
rate of 0.35X p.a. The sub-borrower will be given an option to borrow in one
or more of the five currencies (DM, Sf, Sterling, US$, Yen) and to prepay the
sub-loan to the intermediary without any penalty, anytime after the three-
year grace period. The PFIs will charge the sub-borrowers the appropriate
LIBOR cost of the currency or currencies selected plus a spread to be
negotiated with the PFIs.
10.         Environmental Aspects.  All sub-borrowers would be required to
comply with the environmental protection regulations of the Government. In
appraising subprojects, the PFIs will be responsible for ensuring that sub-
borrowers have received clearance from the relevant regulatory agencies
regarding the environmental impact of their investments. Sub-borrowers will
thus be required to submit evidence of clearance from the environmental
authorities that environmental concerns identified would be addressed through
appropriate measures. During subproject implementation, the PFIs will review
compliance with environmental regulations and requirements by subprojects ln
the course of normal subproject supervision. The PFIs would report and
coordinate regularly with the environmental authorities to help monitor
compliance. This approach to environmental protection by the PFIs is
reflected in their policy and strategy statements.
11.         Project Benefits and Risks.  The project will provide some of the
long-term funds needed to expand Turkey's productive capacity to sustain its
export drive in the 1990s. In the transition to a more stable economy, the
Bank's assistance will help the banks develop the capacity to mobilize
resources internally and prudently perform their term transformation function.
Based on past experience, the project is expectad to support private



- 6 -
l'e"stments In the order of US$400 million and exports of about US$200
m.,aion. The project would continue to promote greater competition among
financial institutions and Improve their performanee. The potential project
risks would stem from: (1) a slow-down In private investment due to
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and a change in the Investment climate;
(ii) a change In relative prices due to a reversal of trade liberalization
policies; and (iii) a reluctance of Turkish investors to assume foreign
exchange risk ln unstable economic conditions. Such a deterioration in
economic conditions would trigger a reconfiguration of the Bank's overall
relationship with Turkey, and a possible suspension or cancellation of the
project.
12.         Rec2MMAMIAti   . I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the loan.
