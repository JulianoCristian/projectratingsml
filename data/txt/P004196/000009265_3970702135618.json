1) forest policy, legal and regulatory\n            framework; 2) commercial forestry; 3) community-based\n            forestry; 4) conservation and biodiversity protection; and\n            5) institutional structure and capacity.  The objectives of\n            the project are to: 1) institute a new resource management\n            system for balanced and sustainable use, conservation and\n            protection; 2) implement a clear forest policy that fosters\n            sustainable use and guardianship; 3) underpin policy with\n            requisite legal assurance on critical issues of forest\n            access and use; 4) implement policy-based incentives for all\n            stakeholders - commercial loggers, villagers, and government\n            - to adopt sustainable practices; and 5) unify government\n            forestry institutions.  Beyond policy, legal/regulatory and\n            institutional reform, the project creates new capacity among\n            government institutions and commercial and community\n            forest-users to plan, manage and use forests sustainably.\n            It also underwrites three national programs on forest\n            inventory and zoning; economic use and environmental\n            conservation; and a system of protected areas for\n            biodiversity conservation."}, "docdt": "1993-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
