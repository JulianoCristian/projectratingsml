MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THR PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE' S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic for
SDR6.3 million (US$8.7 million equivalent) to help finance a Forest Management
and Conservation Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with a maturity of 40 years- The project would be cofinanced by a SDR3.7 million
(US,5.0 million equivalent) grant from the Global Environment Trust Fund (GET)
and a Finnish Marks 28.0 million (US$5.6 million equivalent) grant from the
Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) for parallel financing.
2.        Countrv/Sector Background.   The Lao economy is among the least
developed in the world, with an average per capita income of about US$200 (1990).
With a populatien of about 4.2 million people for a total area of 236,000 sq km,
the country has a low population density of 17 persons per sq km, but population
is growing at 2.9% per year. About 89% of the people live in some 11,000 rural
villages. Up to 75% of the land area is hilly to mountainous, predominantly in
the north and east, and due to the shortage of lowlands, is under increasing
pressure from forest encroachment.
3.        The Forest Resource.   Lao PDR is heavily dependent on its natural
resource base to provide a livelihood for the bulk of its population and to earn
foreign exchange. In 1991, wood products accounted for up to 54% of official
exports, while the share of forestry in the Gross Domestic Product was estimated
at about 15%. Moreover, some 80% of domestic energy consumption is wood-based,
while the forests also provide a host of minor products, foodstuffs and medicine
which are also exported.  However, the forest cover of Lao PDR is declining
steadily. From 1940 to 1981, the national forest area fell from 16 million ha
(70% of the country) to 11 million ha (48%), corresponding to an average annual
loss of 120,000 ha, or about 1% of total forest area per annum. The Tropical
Forestry Action Plan (TFAP) for Lao PDR, which was completed in 1990 with multi-
donor support, reported that of the 300,000 ha annually under shifting
cultivation, about 100,000 ha involved clearing of forest land while another
100,000 ha were degraded by forest fires. Illicit logging was estimated at about
50% of authorized logging, and unsustainable commercial exploitation using
destructive logging practices also significantly contributed to forest
degradation. Other factors included the marginalization of forest communities,
distortions in pricing and taxation policy which encouraged malfeasance and
transfer pricing, and inefficient domestic processing.
4.        Forestry Sector Reforms.  In the past two years, Government has been
developing a forestry reform program. The main features are the improvement of
forest inventory and management planning, change of emphasis from forest
extraction to sustainable management, provision of incentives to resource users,
re-establishment of central jurisdiction over forest management, and elimination
of distortions in resource pricing and taxation. To support this reform program,
Government issued in November 1993 a Prime Minister's Decree No. 169 on the
Manacement and Use of Forests and Forest Land (the Forestry Decree), and the



-2-
entry into effect of the Decree is a condition of Credit effectiveness. This
project, wh.ch supports the reform program, is consistent with the Bank's
forestry policy.
5.        Project Obiectives.   The project aims at assisting Government to
itnplement a new resource management system in Lao PDR to better achieve the
sus<..tinable management and conservation of the country's forest resources. The
integrated project focuses on implementing forestry sector reforms, developing
the Department of Forestry's operational capacity, and implementing improved
programs in forest inventory and planning, and sustainable forest management and
protection. Project activities in production and village forest areas would b,e
supported by IDA, while the establishment of protected areas for biodiversity
conservation would be funded by GET for a Wildlife and Protected Areas Management
Project which is an integral part of the project. FINNIDA would fund technical
assistance and human resource development for production and village forest
areas, and GET for the protected areas.
6.        Proiect Description.   The project would cover an estimated total
forest area (Maps 23388 and 23534) of about 500,000 ha in provinces throughout
the country with forest resources, to be zoned and delineated into village,
protection, conservation and production forests, and placed under sustainable
forest management and protection. The project areas are located mostly in the
central and southern regions, which still have a large proportion of relatively
intact natural forest and include several proposed protected areas for
biodiversity conservation. Specifically, the five-year project would support:
(a) implementation of an appropriate institutional framework and
formulation of the necessary regulatory framework for the forestry
sector;
(b) field implementation of three programs: (i) forest resource inventory
and planning; (ii) sustainable forest management and protection; and
(iii) establishment and management of protected forest areas;
(c) human resource development; and
(d) technical assistance.
7.        Project Imnlementation.   The project would be implemented by the
Department of Forestry. The total project cost is estimated at US$20.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$14.8 million equivalent
(73%).  The total financing required is US$19.3 million, of which IDA would
finance US$8.7 million equivalent (41t of total foreign exchange costs and 46%
of local costs), GET US$5.0 million (25% of foreign exchange costs and 24t of
local costs), and FINNIDA an amount of US$5.6 million on a parallel basis. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Lao PDR are presented in Schedules C
and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
10276-LA, dated February 23, 1994, is being distributed separately.
8.        Proiect  Sustainabilitv.   The  sustainability of  the project  is
dependent on continued Government commitment to the new resource management



-3-
system, based on the provision of adequate incentives to forest users and
effective field capability for regulation and control of forest resource use.
In addition to supporting the formulation of the necessary regulatory framework,
the project design includes the protection of traditional access of users to the
forest resources and limited buffer zone development to reduce unsustainable
forest exploitation in exchange for forest conservation measures for community
and private forest users.   Public agencies would be compensated for reduced
dependence on forest products from the Forest Management Fund to be established
under the Forestry Decree from resource tax revenues and other sources. This
Fund would be managed by DOF and used to fund its activities, including the
operation of the protected areas system. The establishment of a Conservation
Trust Fund under the project is aimed at securing additional longer term
financing for the operation of the protected areas.
9.        Lessons Lear-ned from Previous  IDA Onerations.    The  first  four
agricultural projects supported by IDA were implemented under a centrally-planned
economy. They were constrained by a weak institutional framework, unclear or
inappropriate sectoral policies, and lack of production incentives. The PCRs and
PPAR of these projects highlight the importance of good technical preparation and
the critical role of IDA supervision as Lao project skills are limited. Grant
funding was thus obtained from the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development
Fund to support detailed project preparation, and intensive IDA supervision would
be  undertaken  during  project  implementation.    For  sustainable  resourc-
management, a system based on adequate resource planning and management and on
adequate incentives to all resource users needs so be established and sustained.
The project is designed to achieve these objectives.
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvem-ent.  Since 1986 Lao PDR has beer moving
from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented economy and implementing structural
reforms. Macroeconomic stabilization measures, such as restoration of monetary
and fiscal control and price and exchange rate stabilization, have been very
successful. Emphasis is now being placed on longer run institutional development
measures, such as legal, public administration, and state enterprise reform, and
on the sustainable devulopment of its natural resource base.  The Government
remains committed to these reforms and to the development cf basic physical
infrastructure, and social and support services.
11.       The objectives of IDA's country assistance strategy, as discussed by
the Board on October 6, 1992, are to support: (a) Government efforts to move to
a market economy and maintain macroeconomic stability; (b) development of the
physical capital needed to expand production;  (c, sustainab.e use of the
country's natural resources; and (d) human resource development, both to increase
labor productivity and alleviate poverty. This project is a key component of the
Bank's overall assistance strategy as it will help to implement key reforms in
the forestry sector necessary to attain sustainable forest management, and
develop and strengthen sector institutions and the human resource base to
implement this strategy.   IDA has mobilized substantial cofinancing for the
proposed project, and has sought to coordinate its activities with other
multilateral and bilateral donor agencies to help ensure a sustained and
coordinated development effort in the sector.
12.       Agreed Actions.  Conditions for Credit effectiveness include: (a) the
Forestry Decree shall have become effective; (b) establishment of the Project
Coordination Committee; and (c) the FINNIDA Cofinancing and the GET Grant



-4-
Agreements shall have become effective.  Covenants in the Development Credit
Agreement include: (a) award of a minimum of two forest management contracts
incorporating sustained yield and conservation practices by competitive bidding
by Mar-7h 31, 1996; (b) presentation of satisfactory land and forestry legislation
to the National Assembly by September 30, 1997; (c) issuance of implementing
regulations to the Forestry Decree is a condition of disbursement for incremental
operating costs (on declining basis) of salaries and other allowances;
(d) establishment of a uniform pricing and taxation system to ensure parity
pricing for the sale of logs for both the domestic and export markets by June 30,
1995; (e) forming of an advisory Consultative Forum by the Project Coordination
Committee not later than December 31, 1994; (g) carrying out of a mid-term review
of the project by MAF and IDA not later than October 31, 1997; and (h) cross-
default conditionality in respect of the FINNIDA Cofinancing and the GET Grant
Agreements.
13.       Environmental Asnects.  The environmental impact of the project would
be positive due to improvements in sustainable resource management and
biodiversity conservation.   The strengthening of the resource data base and
management planning, the implementation of sustainable forest management and
conservation practices, the enforcement of a regulatory system, and the
establishment of protected areas would. reduce deforestation and the destruction
of wildlife habitats, biodiversity, and watershed values. Environmentally sound
village  development  activities  would  assist  in  reducing  unsustainable
exploitation of forest resources.
14.       Proctram Obiective  Categories.    The  project  would  support  the
development of forest communities, which are among the poorest segments of the
Lao population. It also addresses the Bank's other program objectives, including
sustainable resource management and conservation, and human resources and private
sector development.
15.       Proiect Benefits.   Only the benefits from improved efficiency in
forest management and rent capture can be readily quantified. The Net Present
Value of the potential rents that could be captured under a ten-year phased
program of improved forest regulation and taxation would amount to US$30.5
million at a 12% discount rate, including US$31.6 million from export parity
pricing and taxation, US$8.1 million from reduction in the mis-specification of
export logs, and US,5.8 million from reduced log wastage and degradation.
Benefits which are difficult to quantify include those from maintaining the
integrity of watersheds, biodiversity, non-wood forest products, and from the
impact of maintaining forest cover on the potential for hydro-electric
development. If the project is not implemented, continued unsustainable forest
exploitation will accelerate forest degradation and loss of wildlife habitats,
plant and animal species.
16.       Risks.   The main risks would arise from delays and inadequate
implementation of the new system of resource management, including only partial
acceptance of the national program approach by provincial governments, slow
adoption of community mobilization for resource management, poor application of
regulation and control activities, failure to establish and apply the Forest
Management Fund appropriately, and administrative weaknesses. The provision of
adequate incentives to managers and users of the forest resources for sustainable
forest management and conservation is designed to minimize these risks. For the
protected areas, shortage of budgetary funds for longer term recurrent cost



-5-
financing may affect thp sustainability of the system. The establishment of the
Forest Management Fund under che Forestry Decree is aimed at addressing the issue
of financing of DOF operations.
17.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
