"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall outcome of the Forest\n            Management and Conservation Project is rated as\n            unsatisfactory. Government's signing on, without\n            adequate analysis, to supply driven development programs\n            contributed significantly to the unsatisfactory achievements\n            of the project. Highly centralized decision-making and a\n            confused and changing policy framework contributed to the\n            unsatisfactory project outcome. The main lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) In designing a large sectoral\n            project with multi-donor funding, it is essential that the\n            institutional, administrative, and financial arrangements\n            are uniform, and set realistic targets for the project\n            period and linkages among project components or\n            sub-programs. 2) It is vital that Government policy\n            framework and institutional arrangements be adequately\n            analyzed during project design, to fully understand the\n            implications of proposed model development and ensure\n            willingness to modify policy in light of pilot experience.\n            3) Village-based forest management benefits not only rural\n            communities, but also the Government, through more efficient\n            collection of royalties and taxes, improved forest\n            protection and sustainable management, and enhanced rural\n            development. 4) In piloting the Integrated Conservation and\n            Development (ICAD) process, less attention should be paid to\n            the academic and philosophic intricacies of ICAD conceptual\n            models and more attention to winning the confidence of the\n            community and local government."}, "docdt": "2001-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
