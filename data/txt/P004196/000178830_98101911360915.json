As the first of several\n            sequential operations that IDA may support in Lao PDR over\n            the next 10-15 years, the project will focus at this stage\n            on completing forestry sector reforms, developing the\n            Department of Forestry's operational capacity, and\n            implementing programs in forest inventory and planning,\n            sustainable forest management and protection, and\n            establishment of protected forest areas for biodiversity\n            conservation. Specifically, the five-year project will\n            support: (a) implementation of an appropriate institutional\n            framework and formulation of the necessary regulatory\n            framework for the forestry sector; (b) implementation of\n            national programs in forest resource inventory and planning,\n            sustainable forest management and protection, and\n            establishment and management of protected forest areas; (c)\n            human resource development; and (d) technical assistance.\n            The Global Environmental Trust Fund will finance the\n            protected areas activities, including technical assistance\n            and human resource development.
