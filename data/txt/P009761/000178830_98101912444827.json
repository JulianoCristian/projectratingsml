program in the States of Kerala, Karnataka,\n            Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, together with necessary\n            supporting facilities. Cashew plantations would include new\n            planting on 53,775 ha and improvements of existing\n            plantation on 7,500 ha. About 30,500 ha of new planting and\n            4,500 ha of improvements would be carried out by smallholder\n            farmers, and 23,275 ha of new planting and 3,000 ha of\n            improvements by State Corporations. The project would also\n            strengthen cashew development units in each State,\n            strengthen State Corporations, and implement a program of\n            research and training and a cashew industry study. Project\n            risks include the possible lack of coordination among the\n            numerous agencies involved in implementation, and a possible\n            lack of adequate response from the farmers for the proposed\n            long-gestation investments. Measures have been included to\n            coordinate, monitor and expedite all phases of\n            implementation, and necessary services and incentives would\n            be provided to farmers. The risks are, therefore, no greater\n            than normally found in this kind of project."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
