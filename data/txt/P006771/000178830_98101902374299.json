life. The project comprises the first stage\n            (1981-85) of Corporacion Electrica de la Costa\n            Atlantica's (CORELCA) 15-year Rural Electrification\n            Program to expand and improve electricity supply in the main\n            villages throughout the Region. The project consists of: (a)\n            provision of electricity supply to about 120 rural villages;\n            (b) rehabilitation of old, deteriorated distribution\n            networks in six villages; (c) interconnection with the\n            CORELCA system of twenty-five villages now dependent upon\n            unreliable and costly local diesel generation; (d) a\n            training program to strengthen the technical skills of\n            CORELCA and the Electrificadoras' staff; and (e) a\n            study to help minimize heavy power losses in the\n            Electrificadoras' distribution systems."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
