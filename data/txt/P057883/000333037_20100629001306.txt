1.     The closing date for Tajikistan, Dushanbe Water Supply Project (P057883), IDA
Credit 3664-TJ, and Additional Financing, Dushanbe Water Supply Project (P101592)
IDA Credit 3664-1-TJ / Grant H264-TJ, will be extended from June 30, 2010 until June
30, 2011.

2.      This will be the third extension of the project. The Dushanbe Water Supply
Project (Credit 3664-TJ for SDR 13.5 million) was approved on June 18, 2002 and its
Additional Financing (Credit 3664-1-TJ, Grant H264-TJ for SDR 3.4 million) on
December 19, 2006. The AF included an 18-month extension of the closing date from
June 30, 2007 to December 31, 2008 to scale-up activities and enhance project impact.
The Project closing date was further extended in December 2008 by another 18 months to
June 30, 2010 in consideration of implementation delays caused by the extremely cold
winter of 2008 and the time needed to provide opportunity to the implementing agency to
get acquainted with the proposed pilot water disinfection scheme by visiting operators in
the region, re-design, re-bid and execute a major contract introducing a new pilot water
disinfection scheme. With such second extension, the AF benefited from a 3-year
cumulative extension, the maximum normally allowed under OP/BP 13.20.

3.       The project has improved reliability, efficiency and financial viability of the water
supply services in Dushanbe. Project Development Objective (PDO) rating was upgraded
in March 2009 from Marginally Unsatisfactory to Marginally Satisfactory, in light of
steps taken in 2008 and 2009 towards putting the project back on track to achieving its
objectives. Implementation progress (IP) was also rated Marginally Satisfactory,
accounting for slow progress in procurement of two remaining large contracts
(reconstruction of rapid sand filters and procurement and installation of a sodium-
hypochlorite pilot plant) which was completed at the beginning of 2010. Progress review
and technical specialist missions in Spring 2010 focused on supporting accelerated
implementation of the two new contracts and of a third ongoing contract, and determined
that, although duly mobilized, the implementing agency would complete major part of
planned civil works under the project but would not be able to install the equipment by
June 30, 2010. The inability of the implementing agency to complete all activities is in
large part due to delays in importing equipment and materials. The task team confirmed
that the Project continues to be implemented in a satisfactory manner and that the PDO
achievement is highly likely pending completion of the three contracts.

4.      Procurement under the project has been progressing satisfactorily according to the
procurement plan. Overall procurement performance of the PCU is considered
satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank. The FY2008 audit report was found satisfactory
to the Bank. There are no overdue audit reports, and financial management procedures
are deemed moderately satisfactory and overall acceptable to the Bank.

5.     In a letter dated April 14, 2010, the Borrower has requested Project Closing Date
extension of six months from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010. The extension is
sought to ensure that all civil works are completed satisfactorily to achieve the PDO.
Considering the non-technical factors beyond the control of the Borrower that have
delayed and may continue to delay the import of relevant goods into Tajikistan, the team
recommends that a 12-month extension is granted instead of the requested 6-month
extension.

6.      Extension of closing dates beyond the 3 years allowed under OP/BP 13.20 may be
granted under exceptional circumstances when factors clearly external to the operation
and outside the control of the Borrower or implementing agency have prevented timely
project completion. A waiver to allow this exception has been obtained from the OPCVP.
The justification for the requested extension is the following:

   a) Original contract implementation schedules to deliver equipment and complete
      civil works before June 30, 2010 could not sufficiently account for substantial
      transit delays in supply of foreign materials and equipment, beyond the control of
      Borrower or implementing agency. Such delays have materialized with recent
      import constraints affecting Tajikistan, a land-locked country with a strong
      dependence on the railway network of transit countries. These delays are
      substantially affecting the implementation of the remaining contracts.

   b) Completion of the ongoing activities is critical to achieving the PDO in terms of
      further improvement of the safety and quality of water supply through the upgrade
      and modernization of the existing facilities in an integrated manner and thus the
      health of the population of Dushanbe connected to the water supply system.
      Given the very high rate of connection to the water supply network, the
      completion of the ongoing activities will benefit the great majority of the
      population including its poorer segments.

7.      The task team has reviewed the detailed implementation schedule submitted by
the implementing agency with the 6-month extension request. In light of the real progress
made to date, but taking into account the import delay risks that may further affect
implementation, the team estimates that a 12-month extension is both sufficient and
justified to i) to complete all project components satisfactorily, and ii) start up of the
operation of the facilities in sustainable manner including the sodium hypochlorite plant
(a new technology for the country). The task team further recommends that the legal
covenant under which the Borrower is required to review tariffs on a quarterly basis (as
discussed in section 4 above) be modified to require yearly instead of quarterly reviews
as deemed more currently relevant with the practice of the Government of the Republic
of                                                                              Tajikistan.
