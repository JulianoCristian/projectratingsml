                         1. The Dushanbe Vodokanal and the Municipality have also made good progress since June 2010 in the implementation of the two key remaining contracts, albeit with some delays

                         due to disruptions in the transit of imported materials and equipment into Tajikistan during March - June 2010, namely the contract for rehabilitation of rapid sand filters at Napornaya
                         Water Treatment Plant (NAP) signed in December 2009 and the contract for purchase and installation of a sodium-hypochlorite pilot plant for the Samotechnaya Water Treatment

                         Plant (SAM), signed in March 2010.
                         2. On April 14, 2010, the Government requested a Project Closing Date extension of six months from June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2010. The extension was sought by the
                         Government to ensure that all civil works are completed satisfactorily to achieve the Project Development Objective. In light of the real progress made to date, but taking into account
                         the non-technical factors beyond the control of the Government that have delayed and may continue to delay the import of required goods and materials into Tajikistan, a 12-month
                         extension was granted by the Bank instead of the requested 6-month extension, taking the closing date to June 30, 2011.
                         3. Measures to improve quality of civil works according to recommendations made by the World Bank last spring have been implemented.
                         4. The quality of the produced reports and their timely delivery to the Bank and other stakeholders has continued to show improvement since September 2009 (the hire of the
                         Monitoring and Evaluation consultant). Final monitoring and evaluation report by the Monitoring and Evaluation consultant submitted to the Bank on July 12, 2010 was also found
                         acceptable.

                         contract for rehabilitation of rapid sand filters at Napornaya Water Treatment Plant (NAP) especially with the regard to the latter needs to be accelerated to ensure their completion
                         before the Closing Date of the Project (June 30, 2011).

                         were implemented, or at least significant progress was shown on them during last three months.
                         - The preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results Report for the project launched in July 2010 is under way. The Project Coordination Unit and the Dushanbe
                         Vodokanal provided their input to the Implementation Completion and Results Report the form of their own project completion report submitted to the Bank on October 8, 2010.
