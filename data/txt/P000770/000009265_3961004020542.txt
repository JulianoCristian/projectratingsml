MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IN11TERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO E13:1OPIA
FOR A RECOVERY AND REHABILITATION PROJECT FOR ERITREA
1.    This -memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to Ethiopia for SDR 18.1
million (US$25 million equivwient) is submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA
terms with 40-year maturity, and would finance an emergency Recovery and Rehabilitation Project
for Eritrea (Project), as part of a larger package of donor support for the Recovery and Rehabilitation
Program (RRPE) for Eritrea. Parallel cofinancing of the overall Program is e^xpected from donors.
2.    Origin of the Program. In March 1992, a project was approved by IDA tc provide support
for the Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Program (ERRP) of the Transitional Goverment of
Ethiopia. Becausa the total reonstruction needs of Ethiopia far exceeded the resources that IDA and
the other cofinancing donors could provide, the implementation of the ESW was not extended to
Eritrea. Later, the Provisional Government of Eritrea (POE) made a requlest to the Transitional
Government of Ethiopia (TGE), that the TGE request from the World Bank an IDA credit to support
the PGE's Recovery and Rehabilitation Program for Eritrea (RRPE), on the undertaking that Eritrea
would assume all the debt obligations once Eritrea becomes a member of the World Bank. This
request followed an earlier PGE request to the TGE to allocate a portion of Ethiopia's European
Community (EC) Lome IV funds for their RRPE. This request was approved, and the EC allocation
of some US$38 million will provide the foundation for a broad program which includes the
agricultural, social, roads, ports and water supply sectors, as well as technical assistance for studies
and project implementation support. In addition, the Italian Government identified a number of areas
for support to the PGE's recovery efforts In December 1992, a team consisting of World Bank and
other donor representatives, coordinating closely with the EC and Italian Initiatives, appraised the
overall Program and agreement was reached between PGE, TGE and the World Bank on a legal
framework which would make it possible to propose an IDA credit as a contributiou to the RRPE.
3.    Background. In May 1991, the forces of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF)
defeated the armies of the Mengistu regime. This coincided with the victory of the Ethiopian
People's Liberation Front in Ethiopia, and the securing of Addis Ababa, the capital city. The
victories were followed in July 1991 by a National Conference on Peace and Democracy in Addis
Ababa, which adopted the Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia. The Charter established the basis
for the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (rGE), and also recognized the right of the Eritrean
people to administer their own affairs within their own defined terrtory, through the Provisional
Government of Eritrea (PGE). It was also agreed that the future status of Eritrea would be
determined by an intationally supervised referendum that would be held within two years of the
National Confernce. The dates for the referendum have now been set for April 23-25, 1993.
4.    Three decades of war have devastated the economy and society of Eritrea; the devastation was
further compounded by recurrent droughts, and inappropriate economic policies of the previous
regime. War damage has affected residential houses, schools, clinics and hospitals, and government
offices; towns like Massawa and Nacfa were largely destroyed by bombing. Much of the
infrastructure, once some of the best in Africa, is in ruins in several parts of the territory from the
destruction caused by the war and lack of maintenance. Bridges, roads, and port facilities are
damaged; the railway system has been completely dismantled; electricity is sporadic and ura watr
sysm  leak up to half their supply.



5.    Agriculture has been seriously affected by the prolonged war and periodic droughts. The
military conflict displaced farmers, reduced the availability of agricultural inputs, destroyed extension
services, and contributed to environmental degradation through the destruction of soil and water
conservation systems. It is estimated that food production fell by some 40 percent In the 1980s, while
the livestock sector shrank by more than 60 percent during the same period. Exceptional rains in 1992
and the distribution of inputs have led to a substantial increase in agricultural output. This recovery,
however, is fragile and incomplete, as nearly 50 percent of the population is still dependent on food
aid to meet their consumption requirements for at least part of the year. The agricultural sector
continues te face several constraints including lack of oxen, tools, seeds, fertilizer and pesticides.
6.    The industrial sector was also badly damaged by the destructive war and negligence of the
previous regime. Most industries are operating at no more than 25 to 30 percent of their capacity due
to lack of foreign exchange to purchase imported inputs (the limited foreign exchange had been
diverted to other regions of Ethiopia to support the war efforts), erratic electricity supply, and
obsolete plants. Besides the damage caused to industries, service sectors such as telecommunications,
postal and banking services have also deteriorated as a result of the war and poor maintenance.
7.    Along with the damage done to the economic base of Eritrea, the social conditions of the
population, especially in the rural and war devastated areas, have also worsened. Most social
indicators for Eritrea are well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The average life expectancy
at birth is low (46 years), the infant mortality rate is high (135 per 1000 live births), adult illiteracy
rate is high (around 80 percent), and the average daily calorie intake per capita is around 1,750. The
prolonged war has resulted in large numbers of refugees, displaced people and unaccompanied
children. The estimates provided by the Commission for Eritrean Refugee Affairs suggest that there
are around one million Eritreans abroad. The largest number, ranging between 300,000 to 600,000,
are said to be scattered over 48 refugee camps in Sudan. Most of these refugees come from the
provinces bordering on Sudan and are extremely poor and live under harsh physical conditions. It is
estimated that some 60,000 spontaneous returnees from Sudan have already returned to Eritrea.
8.    The PGE has had very limited resources to work with so far. Because of the extensive
disruption to economic activities, there are few revenues, and these are used for essential services like
health, and the reintegration of spontaneous returnees from Sudan. Government officials at most
levels work without salaries. Essential reconstruction work such as emergency road repair, some
rehabilitation of buildings and water supply systems has started using the limited resources of the
PGE, the contributions from the local communities, and some financial assistance from international
NGOs. Eritrea has received essential drugs and medical supplies from WHO, UNICEF, the EC, and
some international NGOs.
9.    Besides the immediate need to reconstruct and rehabilitate the economy and society, the PGE
has also taken some initial steps towards creating a new economic environment. It has introduced
proclamations to reform the labor, investment and commercial codes. The new investment code, for
example, provides guarantee against uncompensated nationalization, the right to full repatriation of
profits, and a minimum of red tape in setting up new businesses or restarting old ones. The PGE and
the TGE have agreed to maintain close trading links. The PGE currently has a dual exchange rate
system. The official exchange rate, determined by the TGE, is at Birr 5 per US$; this is applied to
goverment transactions and foreign nationals visiting Eritrea. The other exchange rate is determined
in the market. Over time, the PGE intends to move to a liberal exchange rate regime that is filly
market determined. The formulation of a new economic policy framework, however, will take time
as the required institutional capacity and data base do not yet exist. The centralized policies of the
previous regime left Eritrea with very weak economic management and financial institutions.

10.   Status of Bank Relations with Eritrep.. In September 1991, the World Ba; : resumed
operational relations with the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE). Urder tht, Transitional
Charter of Ethiopia adopted in July 1991, the TGE recognized the Provisional Government of Eritrea
(PGE) as an nterim administration. The PGE has indicated that once it is independent following the
planned referendum (para. 3), Eritrea plans to apply for membership of the International Monetary
Fund (IMP) and the World Bank. If, as anticipated, Eritrea becomes independent and applies for
IMP and World Bank membership, the Bank intends, in addition to the proposed IDA support for the
RMPE, to carry out preparatory work in concert with IMrP and UNDP to help the Government
establish a functional economic and financial management structure and system. The Bank will also
work with other key donors to develop a framework for measures to reduce Eritrea's substantial
poverty and to renew and strengthen the country's human resource development services and
institutions. Finally, during this transitional period, the Bank will work with the Government on an
overall assessment of the policy framework that will stimulate economic growth and employment.
Through these preparatory measures, the Bank will define a program of assistance that can commence
rapidly after membership is achieved.
11.   Donor Activity. Eritrea's interim status has created an obstacle to assistance from
international donors. The European Community has taken the lead in mobilizing support for Eritrea's
reconstruction priorities, and some countries like Italy, Sweden, and the US have established
consulate level (or equivalent) relations with Eritrea, and have initiated actions to provide assistance.
Many other countries have sent delegations to Eritrea to explore future possibilities for support once
Eritrea is regarded by the international community as an independent country. However, despite
considerable dialogue between the PGE and various donor agencies very little external financing has
yet been secured. More recently, the PGE has used RRPE as a framework for attracting donor
support in a coordinated fashion, and discussions are now well advanced for donor contributions to
the RRPE with the EC, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Germany and UNDP. In addition,
interest in supporting the RRPE has been expressed by the US. Most donor interest is focused at this
stage on the RRPE, but additional donor support has emerged for longer-term development activities,
most significanty, UNDP support for fisheries development and for analysis and planning in key
productive sectors and priorities for environmental rehabilitation; and support from EC and Italy for
initiatives in rural development and health.
12.   Program Design. RRPE is a multi-sector program, consistent with Eritrea's recovery and
rehabilitation needs. The recovery and rehabilitation needs were first assessed by PGE's sector
departments and agencies. These needs were consolidated and prioritized by PGE's Department of
Economic Development and Cooperation into RRPE. IDA and participating donors appraised RRPE
and identified some US$156 million of urgent requirements. Within RRPE, IDA financing has been
allocated, taking into account sectoral priorities and other donor financing preferences.
13.   Program Objectives. RRPE would assist Eritrea to launch a program of urgent recovery and
rebabilitation that will have important economic and social benefits and lay the basis of future
economic growth. The main objectives would be to: (a) help restore essential agricultural and
industrial activities; (b) repair and rehabilitate infrastructure on which agricultural and industrial
restoration depend; (c) provide a means of community level rehabilitation activity that will both
restore social assets and provide employment; and (d) support urgent measures needed to build
institutions and systems for economic management.
14.   Program and Project Description. RRPE would support a package of interventions in the
productive sectors (agriculture and industry); infrastructure rehabilitation (roads, power, water supply
and ports); community level activities (community find); and institution/capacity building



-4 -
mplelmentaion assistance, economic/financial management and urgent technical assistance to
sdective sectors). RRPE has the flexibility to permit redesign and reallocation, should new priorities
dictate a shifting of resources among components. RRPE world have the following main
components:
(a)    Agricultural Inputs: Supply of seeds, fertilizers, insecticides/fungicides, hand tools,
tractors and irrigation pumps. The program would provide financing for: 5,000 tons
of fertilizer; cereal, potatoes, vegetable and forage seeds; hand tools including 500
hand/pedal threshers; 270 small-scale irrigation pumps and 100 tractors with tillage
equipment.
(b) Livestock: Provision of veterinary drugs acd vaccines; 1,35) draft animals; in-calf
heifers; and 20,000 layers and broilers to restock the poultry industry.
(c)   Industrial Inputs: Provision of raw materials, equipment and spares for the private
and public sector industries assessed as viable and key to econom.c recovery.
(d)    Roads: Provision of road maintenance equipment and tools; spare parts for
rhabilitation of vehicles and equipment; road maintenance materials; technical
assistance for preparation of designs for rehabilitation works.
(e)    Power: Provision of spare and replacement parts for diesel generators; transmission
line poles/cross arms; vehicles; office and communication equipment.
(f)    Community Rehabilitation Fund: Provision of materials and equipment and civil
works to support rehabilitation by local communities of basic social and economic
infrastructure, e.g., health posts/centers, primary schools, micro dams, check dams,
hillside terraces, and private micro income generating activities.
(g)   Institution Building: Support to (i) RRPE implementation, 0ii) economic/financial
mianagement, and (iii) selected sectors through provision of technical assistance,
training, vehicles and equipment.
Within the overall RRPE, the proposed IDA credit of US$25 million would support: '.) agricultural
and industrial inputs-US$15.69 million; (ii) rehabilitation of roads and power facilities-US$8.17
million; Qi) Community Rehabilitation Fund-US$1.0 million; and (iv) Program Management Unit
Support-US$0.14 million. The Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1995.
15. Program Costs and Fhancdng. The total cost of RRPE is estimated to be US$147 million,
with a tfreign exchange cost of US$134 million. RRPE would be funded from: (a) the proposed IDA
credit of US$25 million; (b) cofinancing of US$73 million from donors (EC, Italy, Sweden, the
Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and UNDP); and (c) PGE contributions (US$8.6 million), leaving a
shortfall of about US$40 million. The IDA funds would be onlent from TGE to PGE through a
subsidiary loan agreement on the same terms and conditions as the IDA credit. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the Status
of Bank Group Operations in Ethiopia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Technical
Annex and a map are also attached.



-5-
16. Other Donor Contributions. A number of donors who are interested in principle In
supporting the RRPE have yet to make firm commitments because they are either exploring ways to
establish a relationship with Erkrea or are seeking a funding mechanism that will satisfy their
procedural requirements. For ta reason, it may take several months before the ful Program Is
funded, and financing arrangemens can be finalized. Tne current Cost and Financing Table shown In
Schedule A,  idkats that the following donors ot.er than IDA have made fairly firm commitmets:
EC, Italy, Sweden, UNDP, Germany, Denmark and Netherlands. Total donor support including the
proposed IDA credit at this stage amounts to about US$98 million. Further support is anticipated
from the US, and tie possibility of support is being explored with a number of other financiers
including the African Development Bank.
17.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. Although PGE has a realistic and well thought through
framework for emergency recovery, it lacks the necessary resources to make much impact without
external assistance. Eritrea faces a phase of zirgent rehabilitation and economic start-up, in a siuation
where it has been unable to attract sufficient external support because of its unresolved inteational
stt. Assistance from IDA is important, not only in terms of direct IDA funds, but also because
World Bank assisftnce is likely to trigger a more rapid response fom some donors who are already
willing to assist Eritrea in principle, but have been seeking a vehicle and framework for the!r help.
Although Eritrea is still considered by the Bank as part of Ethiopia. F,ritresa did not benefit from the
recently launched ERRP for Ethiopia.
18. Lasons from Expeience of Other Operations. Lessons from experience from a number of
other emergency operations in Ethiopia (mcluding the 1985 Drought Recovery Program, and the more
recent ERRP?) have been incorporated into the design of RRPE. The most important lesson is &t an
emergency program relies more than anything else on effective procurement and disbursement
procedures, ad the coordination of the activities of implementing sector ministries. These needs are
al the more important given the limited experience of PGE in managing large-scale, multi-donor
progrums that involve extensive international procurement. As a result, POE has established a central
Program Management Unit (PMU) and, with the assistance of UNDP, support is being provided to
both the procurement and disbursement functions of the unit. Special efforts are also being made to
ensure an ealy start of program implementation by utilizing donor finds that are already available.
19. Program Implementation. As noted above, program management will be the responsibility
of the PMU in the Departme  of Economic Development and Cooperation (DEDC). The PMU will
be responsible for the overall management, procurement, and reporting of all donor contributions
made to RRPE. A Steing Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of DEDC, and
consisting of the secretaries of all the implementing sector departments, will oversee implementation
of the program and take policy decisions on issues related to implementation effectiveness. A
Procurement Committee under the chairmanship of the Head of the PMU will bring together the
procurement expertise in the PMU and the technical expertise of representatives of the paricipating
Sector Departments. ibe Community Rehabilitation Fund will be managed by a small Community
Rhabilitation Fund Unit (CRFU) located in the Office of the Secretary General. 'Te CRFU will
work directly with local authorities and local Project Committees that will formulate project proposals
based on local community needs.
20.   Agreed Actions. PGE has taken a munber of decisions to ensure timely implementation of
the Project. These include appointment of the Head of PMU, establishment of the Steering
Committee and the Procment Committee, and setting up the CRFU. PGE has also provided
asurances regarding allocation of resources for industrial inputs to private sector enterprises,
applicable foreign exchange rate for private and public sector industries and finalization of a data bank



-6-
on private sector industrial enterprises. Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between TGE and
PGE would be a coidition of credit effectiveness.
21.   Environmental Aspecs. RRPE would not have any adverse environmental impact. On the
contrary, it is expected to have a positive impact through soil and water conservation; reduction '-l
emissions from diesel generators; and development of pest management policies. The PMU has oeen
provided with a special fund to contract advisory services, as necessary, to assess the environmetl
impact of components of the project, and to propose environmentally acceptable options and solutions.
The components of the program that will be closely monitored for their environmental impact include
road rehabilitation, water supply rehabDlitation, the use of pesticides, and the importation and use of
industrial chemicals. The technical specifications of all inputs satisfy World Bank environmental
standards.
22.   Benefits. Economic benefits would arise from: (a) increased agricultural production, critical
for food security and provision of inputs to industrial activity; and (b) increased supply of essendal
consumer and intermediate goods to meet basic needs and provide inputs for growth in the
agriculture, industry and transport seutors. The repair and rehabilitation of economic infrarctumre
would support increased agricultural and industrial activities, and generate employment opporunities.
The community fimd activities would increase rural absorption capacity for returnees, generate
employment, and provide the basis for longer-term increases in rural incomes. The long-term
benefits would arise from building PGE's institutional capacity for economic/financial management
and laying the foundation for longer-term economic development.
23.   Poverty Reduction. RRPE will make an important contribution to increasing employment
opportunites, through an increase in agricultural and industrial activities, through infrastructure
reconstruction, and by funding local community projects. RRPE's contribution to employment-
genrating economic growth will help in PGE's efforts to reduce Eritrea's substantial poverty and
under-employment. The Community Rehabilitation Fund will be especially important in providing
work and a livelihood in districts that will carry a heavy burden of reintegrating returing refugees
from Sudan. Among the refugees and the chronically poor settled inhabitants of these districts,
women are specially disadvantaged, and the Community Rehabilitation Fund will be important in
pr'wlding them with opportunities to supplement meagre incomes.
24.   Risks. The main risk relates to delayed arrival of goods and supplies. This risk would be
minimized by providing PMU with appropriate technical assistance, training and other facilities to
cope with procurement related activities. In addition, PMU would also be supported in -*" monitoring
role by setting up appropriate monitoring and financial management systems; and the institutional
capacity of the implementing departments/agencies would be strengthened to assist them in managing
the project's interventions.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

Disbursenent Issues
1.    The IDA portfolio for Ethiopia consists of 18 projects totalling US$884.7 million, with about
US$580 million undisbursed. Since FY81 gross disbursements have averaged US$54 million a year,
wlith a peak of US$77 million in FY89 and FY90. Until about FY89, Implementation was generally
satisfactory. Since then, as a result of the worsening civil war, inadequat, provision of counterpart
funds and lack of construction materials has slowed down implementation and disbursements. Over
the last few years, there have also been recurring problems in the application of IDA's procurement
guidelines and in the timely preparation and audit of fnamcial accounts.
2.    Under the Agricultural Research project (Credit 1521-El), early implementation was slow due
to severe droughts and delays in civil works construction. More recently and despite the set back due
to damages caused by the civil war, significant progress has been made in strengthening major
research programs, achieving closer collaboration with International and Regional Regional Research
Centers, improving research services, and in manpower development
4.    Disbursements on the Education VI project (Credit 1520-ET) lagged due to problems arising
from shortages of building materials and of Government matching fuids. At the present time,
however, more than 70 percent of the contracts for the physical works have been committed and
disbursements should accelerate.
4.    To accelerate the country's economic recovery under the Emergency Recovery and
Reconstuction Program (ERRP), about US$80.7 million was reallocated from a number of slow
disbursing projects in the infastucture (Credits 2002-ET and 2103-El), agriculture (Credits 1782-ET
and 1956-EI), energy (Credit 1704-ET), and PHR sectors (Credits 1873-ET and 1913-El).
Implementation of the related ERRP project (Credit 2351-E0), Is quite satsfactory.

RECOVERY AND REHABIUTATION PROJECT FOR EPITREA 1/
TECHMCAL ANNEX
I. BACKGROUND
1.    Origin of the Program and the Project. In May 1991, the forces of the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front (EPLF) finally defeated the armies of the Mengistu regime occupying
Eritrea. This coincided with the victory of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic
Front in Ethiopia, and the securing of Addis Ababa, the capital city. The victories were followed
by a National Conference on Peace and Democracy in Addis Ababa in July 1991, which adopted
the Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia. The Charter established the basis for the Transitional
Government of Ethiopia (TGE), and also recognized the right of the Eritrean people to administer
their own affairs within their defined territory, through the Provisional Government of Eritrea
(POE). It was also agreed that the future status of Eritrea would be determined at a referendum
hat would be held within two years of the National Conference. The dates for that referendum
have now been set for April 23-25, 1993, and the Referendum will consist of a single question as
to whether Eritrea should become an independent country. It is widely anticipated that there will
be a majority vote for independence.
2.    The World Bank re-established operational relations with the TGE in September 1991,
and subsequently appraised Ethiopia's Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Program (ERRP),
which received support from a consortium of twelve donor agencies. ERRP did not respond to
Eritrea's considerable reconstruction needs, in part because overall donor support Gust over
US$600 million) did not cover Ethiopia's extensive emergency recovery needs (estimated at over
US$1 billion). Until Eritrea becomes independent and a member of the Bank, the Bank Group
can operate in Eritrea only through TGE. At the time of effectiveness of the ERRP, PGE
expressed its interest in establishing contact with the Bank, and with the agreement of the TGE, a
reconnaissance mission visited Eritrea in September 1992. It was clear to the mission that
Eritrea's economy had been devastated by more than thirty years of war, and that there was an
urgent need for rapid reconstruction/rehabilitation assistance. After the mission, PGE requested
the TGE to approach the World Bank for an IDA credit to support Eritrea's Recovery and
Rehabilitation Program, on the understanding that Eritrea would assume the debt and project
obligations once Eritrea becomes a member of the World Bank.
3.    On the basis of TGE's request to the World Bank for such an operation, RRPE was
appraised on the understanding that a suitable legal framework would be established, consisting of
the following: (a) the Development Credit Agreement would be signed between the World Bank
and TOE; (b) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be signed between TGE and PGE providing
the terms and conditions for on-lending the proceeds of the credit, and the assumption by Eritrea
of the debt obligations once Eritrea becomes a member of the World Bank; (c) a Project
I/  Reoovey and Reconstucdion Projec for Era  (Poject) forms an integrl part of the Recovery and
Rablotatn Prgm for Etrea (RRPE) and therofome is disacussed within the latter's conteXt in tie Technical
Annex.



- 18 -
Implementaton Agreement signed between the World Bank and PGE laying out all the
arrangements for implementation; and (d) a letter from POE to the Bank expressing Eritrea's
iention of becoming a member of the Bank should the Referendum vote for independence, and
Eritrea!s agreement to assume debt and project obligations under the I1DA operation on becoming
a member of the Bank. Ibis legal framework was agreed by TGE and PGE during the appraisal,
and formed the basis for negotiation.
4.    Governmewt Srategy for Reovery and Rehabilitation. The decades of war caused
widespread economic and social devastation in Ertrea. Enttea's once sound infrastructure and
industrial base, inherited from the colonial era, have been left in shambles. Bridges and roads
have been severely damaged and neglected, towns like Nacfa and Massawa destroyed by
bombing, the railway between Asmara and Massawa dismanded, and essential port facilities
destroyed. Agriculural production has been disrupted by conflict, earth mines in many areas,
lack of essenti inputs and draught animals, periodic droughts, and environmental damage.
Output has dropped by 40 percent during the eighties, and livestock has shrunk by over 60
percent. Most industries are eithea closed or operating at no more than 30 percent capacity due to
obsolete plant, and lack of foreign exchange for parts and materials. Electricity supply is too
erratic to support continuous production lines, leading to loss of raw materials and machine
damage. In many urban and rural centers, basic services like water supply and sanitation have
been severely disrupted or have ceased to exist. One of Eritrea's most pressing problems relates
to the half a million refugees currently in the Sudan, and the need to provide for their return and
reintegration into their communities.
5.    POE's approach to recovery and rehabilitation has consisted of three main thrusts. 'Te
first has focused on the recommencement of basic economic activities and the rehabilitation of
sential infrastructure. Using its very limited funds and an advanced level of improvisional skills
developed during the liberation struggle, PGE has provided farmers with at least part of their
most essential requirements so that the recent planting season could take advantage of the best
rains for many years. However, although estimated crop yields are higher than normal, a
significant food deficit remains, and the counry still remans, without the resources to support the
next plantng cycle. Some scarce foreign exchange has been provided to public and private
industries, sufficient to restart some of the most essential activities, but far short of overall
requirements. The EPLF army and local communities have made impressive progress in
reconstrucing damaged roads, social facilities and other infrastructure, and especially in carrying
out water conservation measures that are critical to this drought-prone land.
6.    The second major thrust of PGE's recovery strategy has focused on the return and
reintgration of refugees. PGE has been negotiating for many months with UNHCR on an overall
package to support the return and reintegration of refugees, but these negotiations have not yet
resulted in an agreement. As a result, PGE has decided to focus its strategy for supporting
refugee return on measures that will strengthen the regions which are expected to carry the most
significant burden of refugee reintegation, and on ensuring that the economic sectors that will
provide a livelihood to reurning refugees have the necessary level of resources and services.
7.    The third, very recent thrust of POE's recovery strategy has been to conceive its needs
and activities in terms of RRPE. This approach materialized with the first significant level of
donor support, from the European Community, and with the agreement in principle that IDA
would appraise an emergency project as a contribution to RRPE. Until this point, PGE had been
dealing with donors strictly on a bilateral basis with litde coordination among the donors. The
esults in tms of delivered eal aistance had been disappointing. The EC initiatve, which



- 19-
followed from an extensive programming exercise, together with advanced discussions with taly,
and the agreement of the Bank to appraise a project, set the scene for a comprehensive program
approach with donors agreeing to work together on an overall framework of defined needs, and a
coordinated set of responses.
8.    Donor Respomne  The donor response to the RRPE is still emerging, pardy becaus
many interested donors are still attempting to identify funding sources and components of the
program to support, and pardy because some donors have to find modalities to channel funds to
Eritrea given that they do not have formal relations with Eritrea. It is anticipated that some donor
financing will be delayed until some time after the outcome of the Referendum, and that the full
program financing table may not be complete until the late summer. However, a significant level
of donor support has already been secured. The most substantial and fiuthest advanced is the
support from the EC, which with the agreement of TGE has made available to Eritrea an
allocation from Lome IV resources. The total EC support of US$38 million to Eritrea covers a
wide range of emergency recovery and other longer term developmental needs. This EC
contribution includes about US$5 million for the social sectors, and ongoing support to port
rehabilitation at Massawa. The portion of the assistance direcdy related to RRPE which the Bank
and donors appraised, is about US$20 million, focused on agricultural equipment, road
maintenance and repair equipment and materials, water supply rehabilitation equipment and
materials, and an extensive and urgent study of Eritrea's agricultural resources using remote
sensing tecnology.
9.    Italy has agreed, as part of their overall program of support to Eritrea, to provide almost
US$21 million, for a wide range of inputs: seeds, pesticides, livestock and draft animals,
agricltural tools and equipment, support to the agricultural department; inputs for industry;
equipment for road maintenace, the port, water supply, power, and telecommunications; support
for the Community Rehabilitation Fund; and technical assistance in economic and financial
management, and the health sector. Sweden has agreed to provide about US$11 million, which
includes inputs to public industries, power generation spares and equipment, the funding of an
urgent study on the energy sector, and technical assistance in accounting and financial
management. The Netherlands has agreed to provide US$2.2 million for agricultural inputs,
including fertlizer, seeds, and veterinary drugs, as well as technical support to the agricultural
departme   Discssions are still proceeding with Germany, African Development Bank,
Denmark, the US and other donors, on their possible participation in the RRPE.
10. UNDP has played an important role in Eritrea over the last year, through its liaison office
in Asmara, and with an allocation from the Ethiopia IPF. UNDP has taken the lead in providing
assistance to PGE in overall donor coordination, in beginning the process of programming longer-
term development efforts in key productive sectors, and in helping to establish a framework for
future public secto' --nagement. As part of the RRPE, UNDP has agreed to fund the economic
and financial manabzent component, and to fund the RRPE Implementation Support component
described later in this annex.
11.   World Bank Response. RRPE as presented in this document is the result of the appraisal
which the Bank carried out in close coordination with other donors of PGE's Program. The
components proposed for IDA support, which have been carefully dovetailed with the support of
other donors for RRPE, total US$25 million.

I. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SrlUATION
12.   Esonondc Situation. The three decades of war to liberate Eritrea has devastaed the
economy and society of Eritrea; this devastation was further compounded by recurrent droughts,
and inappropriate economic policies of the Mengista regime. War damage has affected residential
houses, schools, clinics and hospitals, and government offices; towns like Massawa and Nacfa are
largely destroyed by bombing. What was once, towards the end of the colonial period, one of the
best infrastructures in Africa, is in ruins in several parts of the country from the destruction
caused by the war and lack of maintenance. Bridges, toads, and port facilities are damaged; the
railway has been completely dismantled; electricity is sporadic and urban water systems suffer
significant losses through leaks.
13.   Agritulture has been seriously affected by the prolonged war and droughts. The military
conflict displaced farmers, reduced the availabity of agricultural inputs, destroyed extension
services, and contributed to environmental degradation through the destruction of soil and water
conservation systems. It is estimated that food production fell by some 40 percent in the 1980s,
while the livestock sector has shrunk by more than 60 percent during the same pwriod.
Exceptional rains in 1992 and the distribution of inputs have led to a substantial increase in
agricultural output. This recovery, however, is fragile and incomplete, as nearly 50 percent of
the population is still dependent on food aid to meet their consumption requirements for at least
part of the year.
14.   Agriculture, including livestock and fishery, is the principal source of employment and
income for Eritrea; it was also one of the important sources of foreign exchange earnings. There
are three major agricultural regions in Eritrea: the lowlands are generally flat and undulating with
fertile soil but little rainfall; the second region, known as the green belt, is a narrow strip running
between the eastern lowlands and the highlands and receives rain twice a year enabling a wider
variety of crops to be grown; and, the central highlands that get sufficient rainfall to allow the
cultivation of a wide variety of crops, e.g., wheat, barley, millet, teff, maize, sorghum, chick
peas, lentils, oil seeds, cotton, vegetables and fruits. In the southwestern lowlands, a large
mumber of people rely on livestock rearing as the primary source of income (e.g., sheep, goats,
camels). Agricultural productivity has been low in the past with nearly 90 percent of the sector
characterized by subsistence farming. The traditional farmers do not use much fertilizer because
of the arid climate and rely on human power or oxen for fanning. The impact of poor
agricultural practices on productivity has been further compounded by environmental degradation.
The excessive use of fuel wood as a source of energy, overgrazing, bush burning, and lack of
adequate water and soil conservation systems due to war conditions and lack of maintenance
resulted in deforestation.
15.   The farmers in Eritrea face several constraints including: (a) the severe shortage of
agricultural inputs; (b) damaged infrastructure (e.g., rural roads destroyed by the war) reducing
the access of farmers to inputs; and (c) weak instutional support (e.g., poor extension services).
Seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools are in short supply due to lack of foreign exchange. The
shortage of animal power is another major constraint faced by traditional farmers. PGE's
emergency rehabilitation program for the agricu tural sector includes increasing the availability of
seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, and oxen. The rehabilitation of the livestock sector would require
the importation of foundation stock (e.g., dairy cows, poultry). Besides the immediate need to
rehabilitate the agricultral and livestock sector to bring them to their previous production levels,
there is potential to expand output further by increasing the land under cultivation. There are at



- 21 -
least two regions (the Gash-Setit region and the eastern lowlands) that have the potential to grow
cash crops.
16.   Industry. The origins of the industrial enterprises can be traced to the Italian and British
periods during the 1940s and 1950s when significant industrial development took place in Eritrea.
The industrial enterprises in Eritrea consist of light manufacturing industries producing a variety
of goods including processed food, beverage, textiles, leather goods, bricks, chemical products,
ceramics, glassware, petroleum products, and metal products. There are nearly 500 private
small-scale enterprises, anid some 35 public enterprises. Most public enterprises are medium-scale
with a few on the larger side such as the textile factory. In general, the market structure is
competitive and the local enterprises face external competition from imports as a result of the
liberal import regime. The industrial sector was badly damaged by the destructive war and
negligence of the previous regime. Most industries are operating at no more than 25 to 30
percent of their capacity due to lack of foreign exchange to purchase imported inputs, erratic
electricity supply, and obsolete plants.
17.   Social Situation. Along with the damage done to the economic base of Eritrea, the social
conditions of the population, especially in the rural and war devastated areas, have also worsened.
Most social indicators for Eritrea are well below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The
average life expectancy at birth is low (46 years), the infant mortality rate is high (135 per 1000
live births), adult illiteracy rate is high at around 80 percent, and the average daily calorie intake
per capita for Eritrea is around 1,750. The prolonged war has resulted in large numbers of
refugees, displaced people and unaccompanied children. The estimates provided by the
Commission for Eritrean Refugee Affairs (CERA) suggest that there are around one million
Eritreans abroad. The largest number, ranging between 300,000 to 600,000, are said to be
scattered over 48 refugee camps in Sudan. Most of these refugees come from the provinces
bordering on Sudan and are extremely poor and live under harsh physical conditions. Within
Eritrea, there are nearly 50,000 unaccompanied children; the breakdown of the families associated
with war and droughts has left thousands of children as destitutes, orphans and disabled. It is
estimated that son1e 60,000 spontaneous returnees from Sudan have already returned to Eritrea.
Because of the extensive disruption to economic activities, there are few revenues and these are
used for essential services like health, and the remtegration of spontaneous returnees from Sudan.
Government officials at most levels work without salaries. Essential reconstruction work such as
emergency road repair, some rehabilitation of buildings, and water supply systems, has started
using the limited resources of PGE, the contributions from the local communities, and some
financial assistance from international NMOs. PGE is reorganizing the health and education
services and has achieved a lot considering the limited resources at its disposal. Eritrea has
received essential drugs and medical supplies from WHO, UNICEF, the EEC, and some
international NGOs. Currently, most of the essential drugs are available; however, PGE will
have to continue to rely on imports in this area because local production will not cover all the
needs.
18.   Policy Progress. Besides the immediate need to reconstruct and rehabilitate the economy
and society, PGE has also taken some initial steps towards creating a new economic environment.
PGE has introduced proclamations to reform the labor, investment and commercial codes. The
new investment code, for example, provides guarantee against uncompensated nationalization, the
right to fill repatriation of profits, and a minimum of red tape in setting up new businesses or
restarting old ones. PGE has also introduced initial reforms in the areas of external and domestic
trade policies, exchange rate policy, fiscal policy and financial policies. However, the
formulation of a new economic policy framework will take time as the relevant institutions do not



- 22 -
yet exist. Data on Eritrea are extremely scanty. Tnere are no national income accounts, no trade
or balance of payments figures, almost no banking statistics, and no aggregate price or wage
statistics; some rudimentary accounts of revenue and expenditure over the past twelve months are
available. A population census needs to be conducted, including the hundreds of thousands of
refugees that are likely to return over the coming few years. There are some data on the social
situation and particularly on the food security situation gathered by a Leeds University team
which conducted surveys in 1987/88 and 1991. There are also some data available in Addis
Ababa which would need to be examined to construct time series data. It is apparent that a long-
term effort is required to reconstruct a data base for Eritrea.
19.   Trade Policy. Given its strategic location, Eritrea has historically been a trading nation.
Its trading capability, however, diminished under the restrictive trade policies of the previous
regime and their policy to centralize trading agencies in Addis Ababa. PGE has attempted to
reform some of these policies. The maximum consolidated import duties (customs duty and sales
tax) has been reduced to 49 percent for luxury goods; it is only 2 percent for food items. No
other import duties, such as import surcharges, are levied on imports. The incentive to export
has increased as a result of the introduction of a more devalued and floating exchange rate. There
are several small private companies that operate as trading houses. The majority of imports come
through the franco valuta system, under which Eritreans who have the foreign exchange are free
to import. The main import items include building materials, chemicals and fertilizer, diesel,
kerosene, steel, machinery and equipment, road vehicles and spare parts, metal tools, pipes and
fittings, and household and travel goods. The main export items include beverages, hides and
skin, textiles and clothing, shoes, salt, oil seeds and pulses, fruits and vegetables, spices, and
some high value fish. Thb. major trading partners are Sudan, Ethiopia, the Middle East, and
Italy. PGE and TGE have agreed to maintain close trading links. With regard to domestic trade,
PGE has dissolved the government monopoly of Ethiopian Industrial Distribution Corporation
(EIDC), previously responsible for distributing products of public factories and acting as a
warehouse for imports. Currently, all factories have the freedom to market their own products.
20.   Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy. PGE has not yet issued any proclamation to
establish an independent central bank. The National Bank of Eritrea does not have the legal stus
of a central bank nor the capability of a policy-making body. Thus, the exchange rate and
monetary policies for Eritrea are de facto determined by the policies of TOE. POE has begun
exploring options for reforming the existing exchange rate and monetary policy mechanisms.
21.   With regard to the exchange rate policy, PGE currently has a dual exchange rate system.
The official exchange rate, determined by TUR, is at BrS per US$; this is applied to government
transactions and foreign nationals visiting Eritrea. The other exchange rate is determined by the
market. Over time, PGE intends to introduce a liberal exchange rate regime that would be fully
market determined.
22.   Fiscal Policy. As with the monetary and exchange rate policies, budgetary issues for
Eritrea were previously decided in Addis Ababa as part of Ethiopia's national budget. Since
liberation, Eritrea has introduced its own budget. PGE maintained an essentially balanced budget
for 1991/92, given the absence of major inflows of aid or the ability to print its own currency.
Major sources of revenue o the government are sales tax on domestic goods, sales tax on
imported goods, custom duties on imports. The major expenditure categories include salaries,
and operations and maintenance expenditure; nearly 70 percent of the revenue was spent on
salaries and the remaining 30 percent was spent on operations and maintece. Currently, funds
are allocated to sector departments based on reviews of their requests; the budgetary process is



- 23 -
still evolving. The decision making authority for the budget-for both recurrent and capital
expenditure-is with the Department of Economic Development and Cooperation. PGE intends to
reform the tax system (including tax rates and tax collection) to make It more efficient; an added
emphasis would be placed on harmonizing the Eritrean tax rates with those of the neighboring
countries.
23.    mnancisl Policy. The Commercial Bank of Eritrea has 13 branches. TILe other banking
institutions in Eritrea include a branch of the Housing and Savings bank, Agricultural and
Industrial Development bank, and an Insurance Corporation. With the exception of the
Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank, most financial institutions have begun to function,
although they are operating at a low level.
24.   PGE has inherited a weak banking system. There is a shortage of qualified people (e.g.,
accountants, credit analysts); telecommnunications and operation systems are in need of repair and
rehabilitation; and linkages with the international banking system need to be strengthened. PGE
has provisionally limited the ownership of banks to the government sector and there are
restrictions on foreign banks operating in Eritrea.
MII. PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIION
23.   Rationale and Objectives. Although PGE has a realistic and well thought through
framework for the emergency recovery phase, it lacks the necessary resources to make much
impact without external assistance. Eritrea faces a phase of urgent rehabilitation and economic
start-up, in a situation where it has been unable to attract sufficient external support because of its
unresolved international status. Assistance from IDA is important, not only in terms of direct
IDA funds, but also because World Bank support may help trigger a more rapid response from
some donors who are willing to assist Eritrea in principle, but have been seeking a vehicle and
framework for channeling their assistance.
26.   RRPE would assist Eritrea to launch a program of urgent economic recovery that will
have important economic and social benefits, as well as laying the basis for future economic
expansion. The main objectives would be to help restore essential agricultural and industrial
activities, repair and rehabilitate infrastructure on which agricultural and industrial restoration
depend, provide a means of encouraging community level rehabilitation activity that will both
restore social assets and provide employment, and support the urgent measures needed to build
the institutions and systems needed for normal management of the economy.
27.   RRPE provides a coherent framework for a coordinated donor response to Eritrea's most
urgent needs, within which the proposed IDA credit has been allocated taking into account
sectoral priorities and other donor preferences. RRPE's components are organized to permit
parallel financing among donors. RRPE is flexible enough to permit redesign, should new
priorities dictate a shifting of resources among components. RRPE also takes into account the
capacity of the sector agencies to implement rehabilitation activities within two and a half years.



- 24 -
Agriculture
28.   Background. Exceptional rains in 1992 and the distribution of inputs have led to a
substantial increase in agricultural output. This recovery is, however, fragile and incomplete, due
to the fact that some land could not be ploughed for lack of oxen and lack of land preparation
equipment, and supplies of seeds and fertilizer were insufficient. Lack of tools and oxen will
remain a severe constraint for next season, and it is expected that poor households will still need
assistance in obtaining access to suitable seeds of major field crops; good vegetables seeds are
mostly not available, particularly for potatoes. Access to fertilizers and pesticides, particularly
needed for vegetables, is also a severe constraint. Rapid revitalization of commercial farming
would depend on the provision of tractors, pumps and inputs. Resuming milk and poultry
production for the major urban areas requires new stock and the disease control and vaccines,
now not available, need to be provided.
29.   The capacity of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) to provide advisory and support
services (animal health, artificial insemination, etc.) has been seriously affected by the shortage of
staff, equipment and vehicles. Although the DOA has been very active in the rehabilitation effort
during the past months, services have been provided in a mostly ad hoc basis, without sufficient
planning and monitoring.
30.   Objectives. The objective of the agricultural component of RRPE is to support the
recovery of the agricultural sector by providing critical inputs and services to the farming
community on an emergency basis. In addition, the program would provide institutional support
to the DOA to implement the proposed activities and to lay the grounds for planning future
development activities.
Program Components
31.   Input Supply. A total of 800 t of seeds for the major food crops will be provided over
two years to supply needy farmers and to serve as a security stock. Vegetable and potato seeds
(300 t), as well as forage seeds (5 t), will be supplied from outside. About 5000 t of fertilizers
would also be procured and sold to farmers. Insecticides and fungicides will be provided for sale,
mostly for vegetables, and for the control of major pest outbreaks by DOA services
(US$200,000), and a total of US$500,000 is earmarked for veterinary drugs and vaccines.
32.   Replenishment of Stock and Equipment. The program will contribute to replenish
farmers' assets by providing hand tools and plough shares, (US$610,000), and by procuring 500
hand/pedal threshers to free oxen for ploughing. The following stock will also be procured from
neighboring and other countries: 1350 draft animals, 150 in-calf heifers (Friesian) for dairy
farms, and 20,000 layers and broilers to restock the poultry industry. For small-scale irrigation,
particularly for horticultural crops, 270 pumps are to be procured, and for commercial farmers,
100 tractors with tillage implements. One lowbed trailer and truck will also be provided to ease
the current difficulty of DOA in transporting machinery.
33.   Strengthening of Agricultural Services. Support to the DOA includes the procurement
of vehicles (10 4-WD vehicles, 30 motorcycles, and 50 bicycles), office equipment, veterinary
equipment (including simple lab equipment and refrigerators), and artificial insemination
equipment. In addition, the program will support training (US$650,000) for new staff, and
refresher courses, with particular emphasis on planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting for
the staff involved. RRPE also includes studies to facilitate the planning of fiurher developments,



- 25 -
partlcularly with regard to area development and irrigation, for a total of US$1.5 million. Short-
term consultancies (48 mm) would be provided to support management and assist in developing
planning capacities, to prepare an agricultural research strategy; and to assist in specific fields
such as environmental protection, animal health and production, potato multiplication, and forage
development.
34.   Implementation Arrangements. The agricultural component would be implemented by
the line divisions of DOA. The program activities would be coordinated by the Head of the Rural
Development Division. Each division would initiate and prepare the plan of its activities for
approval by DOA and submnission to the PMU.
35.   The inputs material and equipment would be delivered to farn'ers in the following
manner:
(a)    Distribution of seeds of cereals, pulses and oil seed crops by DOA free of charge
to farmers who did not produce crops or who had poor harvest or had poor
quality seed;
(b)    Sale by DOA on cash or loan basis of agro-chemicals, vegetable and forage seeds,
farm tools, chicks and draft animals. These items would be sold for cash at the
sale point at the Wareda or village level; or when given on loan, repayment would
be recovered by the head of the village and given to the DOA for channelling to
the treasury;
(c)    Sale of tractors with accessories, threshers, motor-pumps, milk cows. These
items would be physically delivered to purchasers by DOA after full payments
have been made by them either from their own resources or loans from banks.
Thus, once procured, they would be consigned to DOA, which will arrange for
the delivery of these items and deposit of the sale proceeds in the treasury.
36.   The distribution of inputs procured in 1991/92 has been fairly efficient under DOA;
however, monitoring, credit delivery and recovery procedures have not been tested on any large
scale, and will require detailed attention from the PMU. Some potential purchasers may need
financial assistance to enable them to purchase inputs. Arrangements are under finalization
whereby the Commercial Bank of Eritrea would provide credit for tractors, and possibly for
pumps and livestock. DOA is preparing an implementation plan for its components which would
include:
(a)    criteria for farmers accessing medium-term loans;
(b)   selection criteria for distribution of seeds free of charge;
(c)    a system to ensure that cows procured under the pioject are supplied to disease-
free farms;
(d)    an outgrower program for potato seed multiplication;
(e)    agreement with Commercial Bank of Eritrea on a modus operandi in implementing
the proposed medium-term loans; and



- 26 -
(f)    a detailed plan for the staff training program.
Local authorities would be involved in identifying beneficiaries following the agreed criteria.
37.   Private Sector. Whilst the possibilities of using the private sector to distribute equipment
and inputs are still limited, care will be taken to ensure that the involvement of the public sector
does not squeeze out private initiative. This emphasizes the need to charge real costs and to
recover credit.
Industry
38.   Background. Due to the foreign exchange shortages (and consequential lack of imported
inputs) created by the war, the output of industrial enterprises suffered drastically. Whatever
limited foreign exchange was available for industries was allocated primarily to public enterprises
in other regions of Ethiopia, particularly to produce supplies for the war effort. In Eritrea,
presently: (a) many enterprises require to replace discrete pieces of production equipment; (b) the
aggregate capacity utilization in industrial enterprises is down to 30 percent; and (c) the in-process
inventory and safety stocks of raw materials and spares have been almost completely depleted.
Consequendy: (i) many industrial enterprises are on the verge of closure; and (ii) the consumer
will suffer for want of essentials (such as edible oils), and some of the farmer's enhanced output
with RRPE support may not be processed by the industrial sector for want of matching imported
raw materials or spares and equipment needed to restart machinery and production.
39.   Objectives. The support to the industry sector is aimed at generating vital supply
response by supporting the import of raw materials, equipment and spares. Ihe supply response
will: (a) provide essential consumer products (food, clothing etc.); (b) produce construction
materials to facilitate reconstruction; (c) supply spare parts for agriculture, industry and transport
sectors; and (d) result in export (eather, edible oils, textiles, etc.) to support the foreign exchange
balance.
40.   The Sector Program. The Program would provide funding for imported materials and
spares to: (a) private industrial enterprises; and (b) industrial public enterprises that have been
determined as viable and essential to economic recovery. ITe appraised requirements are: (a) $20
million for private industrial sector, and (b) $66 million for industrial public enterprises. The
requirements for the industrial public enterprises have been further split into first priority (termed
Category A) which requires $35 million, the rest ($31 million) being for Category B. As against
this, the current total tentative commitments from donors come to $20.89 million only. As the
available resources are substantlally short of appraised requirements, government will canvass
other donors to: (i) support selected public enterprises; and (ii) contribute to the funds being set
aside for private industrial enterprises' import requirements.
41.   Government has indicated that it is committed to providing equal opportmity to private
industrial enterprises to support the industrW recovery effort. For this purpose, government
proposes to ensure that the resources finally obtained to finance the industry sector program are
split in an equitable manner between public and private enterprises; the split ratio will be 3:1,
consistent with the appraised total requirements for the industrial sector and the current potental
productive capacity. Proceeds of the IDA credit would be made available to public and private
enterprises at the same exchange rate.



- 27 -
42.   Systems of Allocation of Resources. Separate systems for allocation of the funds to
Industrial Public Enterprises (IPEs), and to Private Industrial Enterprises (PIEs) have been agreed
with Government. All imported inputs will be from a positive list agreed with Government.
43.   The System for IPE: (a) identifies relative priority among IPEs and sectors in which they
operate; (b) avoids spreading the limited funds too thinly to all IPEs; and (c) ensures that funds
allocated to any selected IPE provide critical mass to ensure adequate capacity utilization for a
palpable supply response from that enterprise. First priority has been accorded to Category A (15
IPEs), with Category B consisting of 22 IPEs; 3 IPEs have not been included in the program.
Enterprises in Category A are viable ones producing essential products (food, textiles,
construction materials, and soap). Due to shortage of resources for RRPE, Government will
utilize 'other' resources, when available, to fund the appraised requirements of the remaining
IPEs.
44.   For Private Industrial Enterprises (PIE), the agreed modification to the existing system of
foreign exchange allocation will: (a) provide transparency; (b) ensure that only genuine
manufacturers can access the limited foreign exchange; and (c) check that the allocated amount is
related to the physical capacity of the manufacturer to utilize this resource. The allocated amount
will be based on the Data Bank of the Department of Industry (DOI) and the available foreign
exchange. The decision making for the actual allocations will be the responsibility of the National
Bank of Eritrea (NBE). For this function, the NBE will be supported by an Allocation
Committee which will include the DOI and a repzesentative of the private sector. As the
resources available for private industrial enterprises are short of the appraised requirements, each
private enterprise will receive allocations proportionate to its own requirements (as appearing in
the Data Bank) within the aggregate resources available. Also, in this system, all enterprises will
be permitted to directly import their raw materials and spares, instead of through any channelizing
agency. The Data Bank of the DOI will be updated periodically; the current updating will be
completed by May 31, 1993 in time for utilizing RRPE resources.
45.   Funding would be provided, for the present, from: (a) the proposed IDA credit; (b)
Swedish International Development Association (SIDA), (c) Italy, and (d) Germany. Other donor
contributions are expected to provide additional support to the public or private enterprises
consistent with the system of prioritization and allocations referred above.
Community Rehabilitation Fund (CRF)
46.   Objectives. The main objective of the CRF is to support the rehabilitation of basic social
and economic infrastructures critical to the improvement, in the short term, of the economic and
social conditions of the population, especially in the rural and war devastated areas of Eritrea.
The CRF also aims at supporting the full participation of the communities in the rehabilitation
process, both at the level of decision making and at the level of implementation, which is a
critical component of the government approach to Eritrea's rehabilitation (communities will
contribute at least 10 percent of the costs). The CRF will finance, through matching grants, up to
75 percent of the costs of rehabilitation of basic social and economic infrastructures in the
following areas: (a) social sectors-health posts, health centers, health stations, primary schools;
(b) water supply-micro dams, rehabilitation of existing water pumps and wells; (c) natural
resources management-check dams, hill side terraces, tree planting; (d) roads-rehabilitation of
feeders road; and (e) support to Income generating activities -support to private micro earning
generaing activities at the local level (this will be started only during the second year of the
project).



- 28 -
4-7.   Implementation Arrangements. The CRF will be managed by a Community
Rehabilitation Fund Unit (CRFU) based in the Office of Local Government which is presently
part of the Secretary General's Office. CRFU will screen project proposals submitted by the
project committees through the administrator of provinces, appraise the proposals, select projects
for cofinancing, prepare the project documents, agree on implementation steps with the partners
of the projects (communities, local government, NGOs, etc.), procure the required inputs or
services, ensure delivery of the inputs, monitor project implementation. It will also train staff of
local government and provincial administrations to take over these tasks at the end of the project.
The CRFU will consist of a finance officer and accountant; a logistician in charge of local
procurement and transportation of materials to the project sites; and three project officers in
charge of project preparation and monitoring. Two members of the Local Government
Department will also be part of the CRFU. The government will provide one CRFU
representative in each province to support operations at the local level.
48.   The project cycle follows the existing mechanisms to implement rehabilitation projects
with the participation of the communities. The mechanisms are fairly simple and it is important
that they stay this way to ensure rapid implementation. The first step in the project cycle will be
the outreach activities; this will be done through the present structure of local government and
local assemblies. A simple brochure will be prepared explaining the objectives of the CRF and
the procedures. These would also be broadcast over the radio. In most cases local governments
already have a pipeline of requests from representatives of local communities. A minimum
allocation of funding will be guaranteed for each province. The CRF project officer, after having
visited the sites, will write a simple project document for each project indicating the level and
type of contributions of all the partners (community, local administration, CRFU, other partners).
The CRFU will then procure the material and equipment needed for the projects, transport it to
the site of the works, or/and contract a local contractor to carry out the works. It will also
supervise project implementation. The CRFU will have a strong monitoring and evaluation
capacity and management information system. CRF will provide a framework to channel further
donor contributions once CRF has demonstrated the capacity to use such funding effectively.
Infrastructure
49.   Roads. The objective of this component is to assist PGE in rehabilitating essential
roads/bridges and maintaining the roads network through providing Eritrea Road Works (ERW)
with the necessary equipment and materials. ERW has long experience in carrying out road
works and maintenance operations under very difficult conditions. The quality of work,
especially masonry work, is very good considering the limited resources that are available.
Grading and graveling work is affected by lack of equipment. There is good road building
materials to be found in most areas. Local building contractors are beginning to establish
themselves in Eritrea; however, in the road sector, no local contractor is currently operating. In
the road component of the RRPE, private contractors would be expected to play a role in the
bridge program and in rehabilitating existing equipment. Later as the industry develops, the road
sector should take advantage of the private contractors in periodic maintenance work and major
road works, including rehabilitation and upgrading.
50.   The road component of RRPE totals about US$27 million and consists of: (a) road
maintenance workshop and office equipment and tools (US$18 million); (b) road maintenance
materials (US$7.0 million); (c) technical assistance and training (US$0.6 million); and (d) civil
works (US$1.1 million). The overall program, including contributions from EC and Italy, will
finance the procurement of new road maintenance equipment. ERW has about 54 pieces of



- 29 -
equipment in working order at present. With the new equipment in place, ERW should be in a
position to bring the classified main road network upto a standard that can be properly
maintained, and to maintain it thereafter. It is also proposed to rehabilitate 34 pieces of presently
unserviceable heavy earthmoving equipment through the original supplier's service organization.
ERW is in short supply of virtually all road maintenance materials. Materials for the most
urgently needed road rehabilitation have been included in RRPE.
51.   The roads component would be implemented by ERW. With some technical assistance
and training provided under RRPE, ERW is adequately staffed to implement the roads
component. During implementation, priority would be given to the establishment of depots that
can receive and look after the new equipment. Building of the depots is within the capacity of
PGE supported by the materials provided under RRPE.
52.   Ports. The ports component of RRPE focusses on Massawa port which was significantly
damaged during the intensive bombing of the town. The program consists of: (a) civil works to
rehabilitate 11 lighthouses, pavement rehabilitation on 40,000 msq. and rebuilding warehouses
that were demolished by bombs; (b) equipment for the lighthouses, two vessels for port
operations, cargo handling and fire fighting equipment; and (c) technical assistance and training
including a consultancy for updating the 1982 Port of Massawa Master Plan. The repair to the
lighthouses can be done by the Ports Authority but assistance is needed to purchase replacement
of electrical installations. The normal operation of the port requires two tugboats. The port has
obtained a new vessel through WFP assistance but the second one has reached the end of its
usefud life being 40 years old and constantly out of service. Anticipated donor resources are not
sufficient to finance the requirements and additional donor support will be needed.
53.   Water Supply. Both rural and urban water supply installations have been badly damaged
as a result of the war and many years of neglected maintenance. The water component of RRPE
aims at rehabilitating some of the most urgent urban water supply systems, and also supporting
rural water schemes with drilling capacity and other tools and equipment. RRPE provides for
procurement of urgendy needed equipment and materials. The cost of labor and local raw
materias would be provided by PGE. Priority will be given to two towns, Adi-keh, southeast of
Asmara, and to Keren, northwest of the capital. Both the towns were badly affected by the war.
54.   Power. The Eritrean Electricity Authority (EEA) is responsible for generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity throughout Eritrea. The power stations at Asmara
and Massawa supply electricity to the interconnected system (ICS). There are also some self-
contained schemes which supply power to the provincial towns.
55.   Much of EEA's equipment is old, and several electricity generators, which nevertheless
still supply the ICS, were commissioned more than twenty five years ago. EEA maintains and
operates its systems without radio communications equipment, using a fleet of vehicles, some of
which are thirty years old. Also, because of the conditions which have prevailed in Eritrea, the
power stations in Asmara and Massawa have had to be maintained with limited supplies of spares,
replacement parts and consumables. As a result of these factors, the stations consume expensive
diesel oil instead of the cheaper heavy fuel oil for which they were constructed, and are also
inefficiently operating well below their design capacities.
56.   In 1989, the ICS demand, constrained even then by the capacity of the power stations,
was 29MW. EEA's current capacity to supply the ICS, using its inefficient generators of
deteriorating capacity, amounts to about 25MW. With the installation by the staff of EEA in



-30-
1993 of a Govement-fuanced 6MW diesel power station in Asmara, and the overhaul by EEA
of plant with spares, being procured under a recently arranged 3-year SIDA grant, EEA's firm
capacity will still only amount to 29MW compared to an estimated ICS demand of 31MW. 5MW
of this capacity, of necessity, will be from a 27 year old unreliable steam generator. The impact
of the proposed Program on the commercial and industrial sector will further raise the demand for
electricity in 1993/94, and if supplies are to be reliable, at reasonable costs, and not cause a
botleneck to this development, EEA must install and commission additional new capacity as soon
as possible.
57.   Preliminary analysis indicates that the next components in EEA's least cost development
program should consist of four heavy fuel oil fired 8MW diesel generators which for technical
and economic reasons should be constructed at the port of Masawa with a 132kV transmission
line supplying Asmara and the ICS. Ideally, to obtain the maximum economic effect, and taking
account of the time required to arrange financing, procurement, manufacture and installation, the
first generator should be commissioned in the third quarter of 1994. The SIDA grant (para. 56)
will finance technical assistance which will include a study to advise EEA on the next components
of its least cost development program.
58.   The power components of RRPE have been identified as an interim emergency measure,
based on the assumption that the 32MW power station and 132kV transmission line described
above are constructed as soon as possible in a follow-up operation. The components will consist
of: (a) spare parts and replacement parts for EEA's diesel generators (US$7.3 million); O)
purifiers to enable the new 6MW station to burn heavy fuel oil (US$0.35 million); (c) closed-
circuit cooling radiators for some of the existing Asmara generators to enable them to continue to
generate in the event of a water shortage and replacement sea water pumping euipment for the
Massawa power station (US$0.2 million); (d) transmission line poles and cross arms and
conductor to replace damaged and old equipment on the ICS and EEA's district systems (US$2.2
million); (e) diesel generators for provincial towns (US$0.5 million); (t) vehicles, radio
communlications equipment and computers (US$0.5 million); (g) electric meters and tools
(US$0.85 million); and (h) technical assistance (US$1.15 million). The installation of the
equipment and materials, to be supplied under RRPE, would be carried out by the staff of EEA,
who have effectively performed such tasks in the past.
InstItutional Development
59.   RRPE includes support for a number of areas that are direcdy related to the capacity of
the Government to form an effective economic management team, and to future developments in
critical sectors.
60. Economic and Flnanclal Management. PGE has established an effective operational
adminitaon, but lacks most of the systems, procedures, and institutional structures necessary
for the key economic and development management tasks of a central government. This is partly
a reflection of the many decades of civil strife, during which the EPLF managed to establish a
functional adiministration in territories under its control but one which lacked the systems and
facilities of a fully formed government; and partly the result of the fact that Eritrea was run by
the Ethiopian authorities as a province with all the main policy and governmental decisions taken
in Addis Ababa. As a result, although PGE has a structure of sector departments, it lack the
critical information bases, accounting and financial management systems, independent central and
commercial banking functions, and other tools and facilities necessary to make key economic
policy decisions.



-31 -
61.   The Economic and Financial Management component comprises a series of inputs and
support modules that will tmild up the essential systems and functions of the key economic and
financial management agencies: the DEDC; the Department of Finance (DOF); the National Bank
of Eritrea; and the Commercial Bank of Eritrea (CBE). The main components consist of the
provision of expert advice, and inputs that will help POE both absorb this advice and translate it
into practical working systems, procedures, and information bases.
62.   The major areas of focus include the following: (a) establishing essential data series and
statistical bases, and carrying out important surveys, which include national accounts, government
revenue and expenditre, fiancial statistics, balance of payments, external debt, price statistics,
household surveys, population census, industrial statistics, agricultural statistics, domestic trade
data, employment and labor statistics, and an initial poverty assessment; (b) building the critical
financial management and revenue functions in central government, including public investment
programming, public expenditure management, accounting and auditing, pensions, and customs
and inland revenue; (c) building critical financial sector functions; for central banking, the legal
framework, banking supervision, research, monetary and exchange rate management, and
accounting and auditing systems; for commercial banking, the policy framework, portfolio
assessment, and the systems and structures of the commercial banking sector; and (d) developing
and strengthening PGE's national and sector planning systms, budget preparation and
management, and aid coordination.
63.   Inputs to help PtE utilize expertise and build self-reliance, consist of assistance in
bringing back well qualified Eritreans from overseas to join critical functions in the central
agencies; funding for short-term consultancies (both external and local); computers,
communications equipment, and vehicles; and study tours and training programs.
64.   Although the Economic and Financl Management component is part of RRPE, it will be
implemented as a parallel component over a time period longer than Program implementation.
The component will be launched as a preparatory phase lasting about one year, to be followed by
a longer-term period of implementation, which could extend for another two years. The
component will be jointly funded by a UNDP project, and support to specific components from
Sweden, Italy, (and the US) at an estimated overall total of about US$3.5 million. The World
Bank and the IMP will join these donors in providing technical assistance and advice as part of
the program: This effort will be closely coordinated with an overall support project provided by
UNDP's Management Development Program, which aims to provide a framework for the
development of the functions, structures, and systems of central government administration, and
management of public sector parastatals, enterprises, and other agencies.
65.   Sector Studies. As part of the overall emergency response, a number of donors have
agreed to fund urgent studies that are vital for POE to carry out during this emergency phase.
Some of the studies are still being discussed and negotiated, and will be included in later versions
of the Cost and Financing Table. Ibree areas of study have already been agreed. The first
consists of the drawing up of a master plan for the development of the agriculural sector beyond
the recovery and rehabilitation phase. This study, which will be funded by EC at a cost of
US$1.5 million would use satellite imaging technology. Secondly, Sweden has agreed to fund a
US$800,000 study of the immediate needs and options, and longer-term development strategy for
Eritrea's critical power sector. Thirdly, Italy has agreed to provide US$400,000 for training
health sector personnel in running a rehabilitated health structure.



- 32 -
66.   Program Implementation Support. UNDP has agreed to fund an Implementation
Support Project, which will assist the central Program Management Unit (PMU) that PGE has
established to manage RRPE implementation; and which will assist the CRFU. The UNDP
project will fund a number of international and local advisors for the two units: a Procurement
Specialist and a Financial Specialist for the PMU, and a Financial Specialist, a Logistics Expert,
and a number of Project Officers for the CRFU. Both units will also be given funds which will
enable them to contract expert advice to deal with technical aspects of implementation (for
example environmental issues relating to RRPE implementation, expert advice on port and
transport issues relating to the importation and distribution of inputs, and engineering and
technical advice relating to local community projects under the Community Rehabilitation Fund).
Both units will also be provided with essential computing and communications equipment, and
vehicles. The Implementation Support Project will cost about US$1.4 million. The Office of
Project Services (OPS), UNDP, will be the Executing Agency and the World Bank will be
Associated Executing Agency.
IV. COSTS AND FNANCING
67.   Costs and Financing Plan. The total cost of RRPE is estimated to be US$147 million
with a foreign exchange component of 91 percent. Program costs are shown net of taxes and
summarized in Schedule A of the Memorandum of the President. No physical contingencies have
been included and price contingencies represent about 6 percent of the base cost.
68.   The proposed credit would finance US$25 million or 17 percent of total cost. The entire
proceeds of the credit would be onlent through a subsidiary loan agreement to POE in foreign
exchange on the same terms and conditions as those of the IDA credit to TGE. Signing of the
subsidiary loan agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness. Other sources of
financing are: (a) US$23.01 million from EC; (b) US$24.25 million from Italy; (c) US$9.11
million from SIDA; (d) US$2.22 million from the Netherlands; (e) US$5.49 million from
Germany; (f) US$6.5 million from Denmark; and (g) US$2.5 million from UNDP. Each donor
agency would conclude its own bilateral agreement with PGE for financing agreed components of
RRPE, but it is anticipated that some of the bilateral donors will channel their contributions
through trust funds with the World Bank.
V. ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Progam Magement
69.   Given its very limited experience at managing large-scale multi-donor, multi-sector
programs, and its limited exposure to international procurement, PGE has decided that the most
efficient method of implementing RRPE will be through a central body established in the DEDC.
This body, the PMU, will coordinate and manage the contributions of all the donors participating
in the Program, and the donors have agreed to this arrangement.
70.   The PMU, which has already been established and is being supported by technical support
described earlier, consists of a Head responsible for three sections: a Monitoring and Evaluation
Section, which is responsible for overall program management, management information, and
reporting; an Accounting and Financial Management Section, which maintains the program



- 33 -
accounts and records; and a Procurement Section, which will undertake all procurement for
imports and purchases under RRPE. The Procurement Section works with a Procurement
Committee made up of technical speciaists from each of the Sector Departments participating in
RRPE. The PMU is responsible for overall supervision, coordination, and reporting on project
progress, as well as for the specific function of procurement. The Sector Departments are fully
responsible for implementing their components, and for reporting on their progress to the PMU.
The structure of the PMU is shown in Annex 3.
71.   The PMU reports in turn to a Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary of DEDC,
which includes the Secretary, Department of Finance, and the Head of PMU. The Steering
Committee is responsible for monitoring overall progress in implementing RRPE, for policy
decisions and problem solving that can remove obstacles to or improve the pace of
implementation, and for overall relations with the various contributing donors.
72.   The Community Rehabilitation Fund will be managed by a Community Rehabilitation
Fund Unit (CRFU) that has been established in the Department of Local Government in the Office
of the Secretary General. The CRFU will screen project proposals presented by local Project
Committees that have been set up by local communities. The CRFU will also assist in the
preparation of project documents (or provide technical assistance to local groups to develop such
documentation), agree on implementation steps of approved projects, assist with contracting inputs
and services needed for implementation, and provide or arrange for other types of technical
support and training. The local Project Committees will be responsible for collecting community
contributions to project resource requirements, for local purchasing and contracting of services,
and for managing and monitoring project implementation. The CRFU consists of a Coordinator,
a Finance and Accounting Officer who will also be in charge of running a very simple
computerized Management and Information System on financing and implementation; a Logistics
Specialist in charge of local procurement and transportation of materials to project sites; and three
Project Officers in charge of project preparation and monitoring. The Project Officers will spend
a large part of their time in the field. The Unit will be overseen by a small Committee consisting
of the Head of the Department of Local Government, the Head of Local Government Affairs
Office (part of the above-mentioned department), and the Coordinator of the CRFU. This
Committee will also be responsible for the selection of projects proposals. Each province will
have one staff member in charge of supporting CRF activities at the local level. Annex 4 shows
the structure of the CRFU.
Procurement ZI
73.    All procurement of goods, works and services to be financed under the proposed IDA
credit would follow World Bank Procurement Guidelines. Consultants would be recruited
according to World Bank Guidelines on use of consultants. Procurement methods are summarized
in Schedule B of the Memorandum of the President. About 72 percent of procurement would be
through Iternational Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures and the PMU will use the IBRD/IDA
samples as models for the bidding documents. The PMU would be responsible for all
procurement except for private sector industries. Details of procurement activities and procedures
for each component are given below.
PI urem  and Disrm   ections refr to the IDA credit only.

74.   Agriculture (US$5.29 milUon). Procurement of 270 small-scale pumps and 100 tractors
(US$4.67 million) will be by ICB. Procurement of vehicles, bic;cles, motorcycles, office and
laboratory equipment (IJS$.62 million) will be through international shopping procedures. These
items are urgently needed, and each package is expected to be for less than US$200,000.
75.   Roads (US$4.92 million). Equipment and goods valued at US$3.91 million will be
procured following ICB procedures. Civil works consisting of construction/rehabilitation of
depots and rehabilitation of some bridges valued at US$0.66 million would be awarded on the
basis of Lccal Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures. Tbese small value works wIll be spread
throughout Eritrea and may not interest international contracts. The services of consultants
would be procured following World Bank Guidelines on Use of Consultants. Rehabilitation of
road maint ce equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or less may be
procured through direct negotiations with original suppliers on the basis of unit costs satisfactory
to the Association.
76.   Industral Sector Supplies (US$10.40 million). Industrial raw materials and spares for
public sector industries, valued at US$6.0 million, would be through ICB procedures. Spare parts
and some urgently needed inputs amounting to US$3.00 million for public sector industries and
US$1.00 million for private sector industries would be procured through international shopping
procedures. Specialized or proprietary items estimated to cost up to US$400,000 equivalent
would be procured direcdy under negotiated contracts with original suppliers in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Association. Such procurement will be limited to the list below.

transmission and distribution equipment and parts will be performed through ICB procedures.
ease of the urgent need for about US$0.5 million worth -  qhicles, office equipment,
including computers, and radio communication equipment an . uecause each package will be worth
less than US$200,000, procurement will be through international shopping procedures with
quotations sought from at least three suppliers with a spread of at least two eligible countries.
78.   Conmnunity Rehabilitation Fund (US$1 nMillion) and PMU (US$0.14 miEon). LCB
procedures would be used for civil works contracts under US$70,000. The total value of such
contracts will not exceed US$300,000. Construction materials estimated to cost US$20,000 per
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000 would be procured through local shopping
procedures acceptable to 1DA. ICB procedures will be used for purchases of construction
materas (US$600,000). Procurement for vehicles/equipment costing US$140,000 would be
required urgently and procured through international shopping procedures.
79.   Review by IDA. All ICB contracts and contracts for goods and works estimated at
US$100,000 or more will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. All consultant contracts
will be subject to IDA's prior review. The estimated percentage of procurement subject to prior
review will be about 90 percent. PMU will monitor procurement and maintain records of all
procurement activities.
Disbursements
80.   The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against a positive list of materials and
equipment, civil works, consultants' services and training. Schedule B of the Memorandum of
the President also shows an indicative schedule of disbursements. All disbursements would be
requested in accordance with Bank guidelines and operate under procedures acceptable to IDA. A
Special Account will be utilized for all payments under US$200,000 equivalent; payments above
this threshold may be made under the direct payment or Special Commitment procedure.
Replenishment of the Special Account will be made monthly. Disbursements would be fully
documented except for contracts less than US$100,000 equivalent, which would be on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOE). Supporting documents would be retained and made available
for review by the auditors and IDA supervision missions.



-36 -
Reporting and Monitoring
81.   The PMU will be responsible for monitoring the progress of RRPE and for preparing
quarterly and consolidated semi-annual and annual progress reports based on the submissions of
participating Sector Departments. The progress reports will be sent to the Steering Committee at
the end of each quarter, and a final summary version will be prepared, to include Steering
Committee decisions on policy issues and problems related to Program implementation, and sent
to IDA and other participating donors within 45 days of the end of each quarter. Tle reports will
include the following components: (a) status of procurement and disbursement of all Program
components, including a submission from the CRFU on the Community Rehabilitation Fund
component; (b) status of the arrival of all supplies, their clearance through the port, and their
transportation and delivery to beneficiaries; (c) the status of all rehabilitation activities being
supported under RRPE; (d) a summary of the Program fnancial accounts for the quarter (and
consolidated semi-annual and annual accounts), showing the breakdown both by sector for all
RRPE donors, and by individual donor; (e) any problems or policy issues relating to
implementation, indicating whether these issues require action or responses by IDA or any of the
other participating donors, and recording any decisions taken by the Steering Cominitee on these
issues at their quarterly review meetings; (f) an account of the counterpart funds generated from
the sale of foreign exchange provided under RRPE, and a description of the status and use of
these funds; and (g) an overall assessment of the progress and achievements of RRPE. The
CRFU will provide the PMU with a quarterly report on the progress of the Community
Rehabilitrion Fund, showing the projects approved, funding disbursed, the status and progress of
individual projects, and the technical assistance and support provided. The CRFU report should
also highlight any special issues or problems related to the implementation of the Conmmunity
Rehabilitation Fund, and actions that have been taken or are proposed to improve implementation
and beneficiary impact.
Accounts and Audits
82.   PMU and CRFU will maintain records and accounts of all transactions under RRPE. All
project accounts will be audited on a six-month basis by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
Audited accounts, including Special Accounts, SOEs and counterpart funds, will be provided to
IDA and other donors within six months of the end of the audit period.
Supervision Plan
83.   While overall supervision is the responsibility of the task manager, sector task managers
will be responsible for their respective components. A project launch mission is planned for
April/May 1993. The mission will consist of the task manager and specialists in infrastructure,
industry, community fund and procurement. Participating donors will be invited to take part in
the project launch mission. Subsequent supervision of individual components would be carried by
the component task managers, coordinated by the task manager. A Mid-Term Review will be
carried out by March 31, 1994 and will include sector task managers, consultants and donors.
Environnental Impact
84. RRPE is not expected to have a negative environmental impact. On the contrary, it would
promote soil and water conservation through rehabilitation of small dams and soil conservation
measures. Fertilizer use will remain extremely modest. Pesticide use will also be limited; the
program includes assistance to initiate development of pest management policies. Environmental



- 37 -
protecton, epeially water and soil consvation, would have top priority In Communiy
Rehabfiitation Fund activities. Most of the planned soil conservation measures consist of
building hillside terraces and tree plantig.
85. The power component of RItRPE is expected to have a positive impact on the environment;
the emissios from the diesel generators would be reduced, and less water would be used to cool
them.
86. The road component does not include any new road construction; some realignments of
exitng roads may be necessary. Mitigatory actions would be taken to prevent erosion in areas
whore soft sandstone may be predominant. Wher road sections have to be raised, the sides
would be planted with grs to prevent erosion.
87.   RRPE contains funds for the employment of specialists to advise PGE on any RItPE
inputs and activities that might have a negative environmental impact. The PMU would draw up
the terms of refence for such an environmt aysis. The anticipated areas for scrutiny
include: (a) transport, storage and use of pesticides; (b) environmental impact of major
enineeing efforts related to road rehabilitation; and (c) the use of industrial chemicals provided
under RRPE.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED
88. Prior to Effectiveness of the Proposed Credit. TGE would conclude a subsidiary loan
agreement, satisfactory to IDA, with PGE onlending the proceeds of the IDA credit (par 68).
89.   Other Agreements. POE would:
(a)   ensure that foreigr. exchange provided under the project is made available to all
enterprises, whether private or public, at the same exchange rate (para. 41);
(b)   publish the updaed Data Bank of private industrial enterprises (for purposes of
operation of the allocation system) by May 31, 1993 (para. 44);
(c)   prepare and submit to IDA quarterly progress reports of RRPE (para. 81);
(d)   have all project accounts audited on a six-month basis by external auditors,
acceptable to IDA and present such audit reports within six months after the end
of each six-month period (para. 82); and
(e)   together with IDA and other donors, carry out a Mid-Term Review of RRPE not
later than March 31, 1994 (para. 83).
