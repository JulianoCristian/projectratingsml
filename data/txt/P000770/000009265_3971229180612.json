Some lessons learned included: there is need\n            for greater flexibility in International Development\n            Association (IDA) procurement and disbursement procedures.\n            These are intended to ensure that IDA resources are\n            effectively used for the designated purposes; the emphasis\n            is on accountability, not speed of implementation. In\n            multi-donor projects of this nature, the responsibilities in\n            donor coordination of the government and IDA or any other\n            key donor should be clearly defined at the outset.
