Procurement
A.   International Competitive Bidding
1.   Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and civil works
shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for
Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by
the Bank in March 1977 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the
basis of international competitive bidding as described in Part A
of the Guidelines.
2.   For goods and civil works to be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding, and in addition to the require-
ments of paragraph 1.2 of the Guidelines, the Borrower shall
prepare and forward to the Bank as soon as possible, and in any
event not later than 60 days prior to the date of availability to
the public of the first tender made under the Project or prequali-
fication documents relating thereto, as the case may be, a general
procurement notice, in such form and detail and containing such
information as the Bank shall reasonably request; the Bank will
arrange for the publication of such notice in order to provide
timely notification to prospective bidders of the opportunity to
bid for the goods and works in question. The Borrower shall
provide the necessary information to update such notice annually
so long as any goods or works remain to be procured on the basis
of   international competitive bidding.
3.   Identical or similar equipiaent and materials shall be
grouped together for purposes of bidding, such groups to be of
a size satisfactory to the Bank.
4.   For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids for
the supply of goods to be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding: (i) bidders shall. be required to state in
their bid -the c.i.f. (port of entry) price for imported goods,
or the ex-factory price for domestically manufactured goods.;
(ii) customs duties and other ,import taxes on imported goods,
and sales and similar taxes on domestically supplied goods, shall
be excluded; and (iii) the cost to the Company in question of
inland freight and other expenditures incidental to the delivery
of goods to the place of their use or installation shall be
included.


﻿- 38 -
B.   Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
In the procurement of goods in accordance with the procedures
described in Part A of this Schedule, goods manufactured in
Brazil may be granted a margin of preference in accordance with,
and subject to, the following provisions:
1.   All bidding documents for the procurement of goods
shall clearly indicate any preference which will be granted,
the information required to establish the eligibility of a bid
for such preference and the following methods*and stages that will
be followed in the evaluation and comparison of bids.
2.   After evaluation, responsive bids will be classified
in one of the following two groups:
(1) Group A: bids offering goods manufactured in
Brazil if the bidder shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Borrower and the Bank that
such goods contain components manufactured in
Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of
the complete goods.
(2) Group B: bids offering any other goods.
3.   All evaluated bids in each group shall be first compared
among themselves, excluding any customs duties and other import
taxes (including merchant fleet renewal and port improvement
taxes) on goods to be imported and any sales or similar taxes
on goods to be supplied domestically, to determine the lowest
evaluated bid of each group. Such lowest evaluated bids shall
then be compared with each other, and if, as a result of this
compari6on, a bid from group A is the lowest, it shall be selected
for the award.
4.   If, as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3
above, the lowest bid is a bid from group B, all group B bids
shall be further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from group
A after adding: (i) to the evaluated bid price of the imported
goods offered in each group B bid, for the purpose of this further
comparison only, an amount equal to: (A) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which a non-exempt importer would
have to pay for the importation of the goods offered in such group
B bid; or (B) 15% of the c.i.f. bid price of such goods if said
customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price; and (ii) to the


﻿- 39 -
evaluated bid price of the domestically supplied goods offered in
each group B bid an amount equal to: (A) the amount of customs
duties and other import taxes which would be levied on such goods
if they originated from the same foreign country as the goods
involved in a group B bid which enjoy the lowest customs duties
and other import taxes; or (B) 15% of the ex-factory price of such
goods if said customs duties and taxes exceed 15% of such price.
If the group A bid in such further comparison is the lowest, it
shall be selected for the award; if not, the bid from group B,
which as a result of the comparison under paragraph 3 is the
lowest evaluated bid, shall be selected.
C.   Other Procurement Procedures
Contracts for equipment estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of $500,000 and contracts for civil works estimated to
cost less than the equivalent of $3,000,000 shall be procured in
accordance with locally advertised bidding procedures satisfactory
to the Bank.
D.   Review of Procurement Decisions by the Bank
1.    Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before
qualification is invited, inform the Bank in detail of the pro-
cedure to be followed, and shall introduce such modifications in
said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The list
of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their
qualifications and of the reasons for the exclusion of any
applicant for prequalification, shall be furnished by the Borrower
to the Bank for its comments before the applicants are notified
of the Borrower's decision, and the Borrower shall make such
additions to, deletions from, or modifications in, the said list
as the Bank shall reasonably request.

works estimated to cost the equivalent of $3,000,000 or more:
(a) Before bids are invited by the Borrower, the Borrower
shall furnish to the Bank, for its comments, the text of the
invitations to bid and the specifications and other bidding
documents, together with a description of the advertising pro-
cedures to be followed for the bidding, and shall make such


﻿- 40 -
modifications in the said documents or procedures as the Bank
shall reasonably request. Any further modification to the bidding
documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before it is issued
to the prospective bidders.
(b) After bids have been received and evaluated, the
Borrower shall, before a final decision on the award is made,
inform the Bank of the name of the bidder to which it intends to
award the contract and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient
time for its review, a detailed report on the evaluation and

the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower
and state the reasons for such determination.
(c) The terms and conditions of the contract shall not,
without the Bank's concurrence, materially differ from those
on which bids were asked or prequalification invited.
(d) Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to furnishing
to the Bank the first application for withdrawal of funds from the
Loan Account in respect of such contract.
3.   With respect to each contract not governed by the preceding
paragraph, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, promptly after
its execution and prior to the delivery to the Bank of the first

SCHEDULE 4
Sub-project Selection Criteria
(a) Sub-projects shall comply with the following conditions:
(i) Each Sub-project must have been approved by the
Borrower or have been included in the last EVG
approved by the Borrower and accepted by the Bank;
(ii) Total Sub-project cost shall not be substantially
higher than that included in the respective EVG.
If the Sub-project scope or costs are substan-
tially different from those contemplated in the
EVG, satisfactory evidence shall be presented
to the Borrower and the Bank that their inclusion
and financing will not deteriorate the Company's
financial position; and
(iii) Sub-projects shall be the least-cost solution.
(b) Water supply Sub-projects to be carried out in cities
with populations greater than 50,000 shall have water
rates equal to or higher than 75% of the long-run
average incremental cost (equivalent to an internal
financial rate of return of 5% or higher).
(c) Sewerage Sub-projects, or water supply Sub-projects to
be carried out in cities with populations between
5,000-50,000, shall have water (or sewerage) rates
equal to or higher than 60% of the long-run average
incremental cost (equivalent to an internal financial
rate of return of 1% or higher).
(d) Sub-projects to be carried out in communities with
populations of less than 5,000 shall have a per capita
construction cost of less than the equivalent of $180 in
1980 prices.   (The per capita construction cost shall
be determined by dividing construction cost by the
population to be served after the completion of Sub-
project construction.)
(e) Sub-projects not meeting the criteria set forth herein
shall be redesigned to lower acceptable standards or
carried out in stages. If the Sub-project does not


﻿- 42 -
fulfill the criteria after it has been redesigned, it
shall be eligible for Bank financing only if a satis-
factory social and economic justification is furnished
to the Bank.
(f) Calculations of long-run average incremental costs
for Sub-project acceptability, and of present value
and long-run average incremental cost for least-cost
analysis, shall use an annual discount rate equal to
the opportunity cost of capital (11%) or another value
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank. These
calculations will be based on the Sub-projects' capital
costs, operating costs, and complementary investments.
(g) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) above, "long-run
average incremental cost" means the present value
of capital invested in, plus the present value of
incremental operating, maintenance and administrative
costs of such Sub-project, minus the present value of
incremental installation charges or other consumer
contributions to capital expenditures, divided by the
present value of the incremental volume of water (or
sewerage) billed. All costs and revenues are to be
projected in constant prices and in accordance with
methods satisfactory to the Bank and the Borrower.
(h) For purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the
average rate to be used shall be obtained by dividing
the revenues billed in each city for water (or sewerage)
services by the respective volume. When the present
average rates do not satisfy the selection criteria, the
average rate to be put into effect within the following
12 months would be used.
