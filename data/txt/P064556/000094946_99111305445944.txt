Background. Burundi is a small, mountainous, landlocked country in Central
Africa. Its population of 6 million is growing at 2.9 percent per year,
exacerbating population pressure in a land with population density of 215
persons per square kilometer, which is second highest in Africa, and GDP per
capita of about US$160 (1996) which is among the lowest. The country has
known repeated ethnic violence since independence in 1962. The 1993 internal
conflict degenerated into genocide which killed over 150,000 persons and
displaced more than 600,000. The "convention" government negotiated under UN
and OAU auspices in 1994 was overthrown in a Tutsi-led coup d'etat in 1996;
regional leaders then imposed economic sanctions covering trade and
transportation that remained in force until January 1999.
The strife and sanctions have had a particularly severe impact on the poor.
In the five years following 1993, child immunization coverage declined from
83 percent to 54 percent, infant mortality increased from 110 per thousand
live births to 136, malnutrition increased from 6 percent of children under
five to 20 percent, and reported cases of major endemic diseases increased by
over 200 percent; HIV prevalence is rapidly rising. Over 14 percent of the
population was displaced from its home during 1997. Industrial value added
has fallen by 60 percent since 1992, leading to layoffs from formal sector
enterprises. Village social and economic services and their infrastructure
have been the target of ethnic reprisals and militia attacks. Many schools
and health clinics have been destroyed or damaged, qualified personnel have
withdrawn to urban areas, and public expenditures in the education and health
ministries have been reduced to little more than salary payments to teachers
and medical staff who continue to attempt to provide services throughout the
country.
Project Scope and Objectives. The Bank's interim strategy for Burundi (Report
19592-BU, August 1999) draws on the Bank's experience in dealing with
conflict and post-conflict situations to attempt to prevent further worsening
of poverty and to stabilize the economy as the peace process evolves. The
interim strategy rests upon three legs: (1) promoting governance and
"ownership" through participation in rehabilitation and reconciliation of
social infrastructure, (2) creating productive employment and rural
purchasing power, and (3) restoring minimum levels of essential social
services and restoring key imports to support private sector activity. Future



support will be linked to improvements in government transparency, probity,
accountability and fiscal management which are legitimate objectives of a
transition government; policy choices facing an elected post-transition
government will later be the subject of a Country Assistance Strategy.
The third leg provides strictly monitored and controlled resources for
poverty alleviation. This credit contributes to the third leg by providing
operating funds for the rehabilitated infrastructure in health, education,
agriculture and resettlement. The credit will provide balance of payments
support to the private sector. The local currency proceeds of the foreign
exchange auctioned to private users will finance increased government support
to an agreed list of activities in sector programs in health, education,
agriculture and reintegration and resettlement.
The transparency of Government fiscal activities will be addressed by a
Public Expenditure Review under the EERC, with early outputs to provide a
framework for aid coordination. The EERC will also provide an interim
monitoring tool to assure that military expenditures are capped and other
policy measures are taken.
Project Financing. IDA: US$30 million equivalent. The Bank is working
closely with the major actors in the peace process, and other donors have
expressed interest in co-financing this EERC. The IMF may consider Emergency
Post-Conflict Assistance in calendar year 2000.
Poverty Category. The heritage of instability is rural poverty incidence
increasing by 80 percent since 1993 and urban poverty incidence doubling. At
the end of one year the EERC will have helped to stabilize the macro-economy.
The resources provided by the credit will directly address poverty
alleviation by improving the availability of materials and services in
primary education and health, to complement the restoration of village level
social infrastructure..
Environmental aspects. In accordance with the Associations Operational
Directive on Environmental Assessment (O.D. 4.01, Annex E), the proposed
operation has been placed in Category C and does not require an environmental
assessment.
Implementation arrangements. The credit will provide a predictable flow of
resources over a period of 12 months, and will be disbursed in four quarterly
installments subject to monitoring and audit to assure agreed use of local
currency proceeds and consistent with capacity of the economy to absorb the
resources.
