country in\n            maintaining macroeconomic stability, in line with the\n            Interim Strategy. The credit will provide, and support\n            balance of payments, and increase foreign exchange to\n            facilitate private sector imports to prod economic growth.\n            The civil conflict hindered economic stability, thus the\n            project will be instrumental in the rehabilitation,\n            maintenance, and operation of priority sectors. Counterpart\n            funding will finance public expenditures in health,\n            education, agriculture, and infrastructure sectors, to\n            alleviate poverty, and restore peace. Furthermore, the\n            operation will assist the Government in re-establishing, and\n            improving budget systems, allowing transparency to foster\n            foreign external donors. Policy reforms will be supported,\n            in an effort to improve macroeconomic performance,\n            permitting legislative oversight, and making government\n            activities more transparent. However, the risks include the\n            potential return to widespread violence, increased military\n            expenditures, a reduced political will to negotiate with\n            government opponents, and, above all, inadequate efforts to\n            achieve budget transparency."}, "docdt": "2000-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
