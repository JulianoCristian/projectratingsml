APPRAISAL OF THE EXPANSION PROGRAM
of the
DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS (DGT)
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of China has asked the Bank for a US$17 million
loan to finance most of the foreign exchange cost of a project to expand
and improve the domestic telephone and telegraph services of Taiwan. The
Project would cover certain specific construction works and would be carried
out in the period 1967 through 1971, with disbursements commencing in 1968.
Total costs of the Project are estimated at US$50 million equivalent.
ii.       The proposed Borrower is the Directorate General of Telecommuni-
cations (DGT). This Government enterprise was established under the
Ministry of Communications in 1943. Through its agencies, the Taiwan Tele-
communications Administration (TTA) and the Chinese Government Radio
Administration (CGRA), it operates all Taiwan public telephone and telegraph
services, national and international.
iii.      The DGT and its agencies have experienced staff. With a sma-l
amount of assistance from consultants and continued training of personnel,
they should be able to carry out the expansion program satisfactorily.
iv.       The proposed program is technically sound and consists of the
installation of facilities urgently needed to meet the principal local
and domestic long-distance telecommunication requirements of Taiwan. Also,
its completion should materially improve the quality of service rendered.
v.        Plans and equipment specifications would be prepared with the
assistance of competent consulting engineers. All of the equipment to be
financed under the proposed Bank loan would be purchased through inter-
national competitive bidding.
vi.       Financial results in recent years have been satisfactory and
are expected to continue so during the foreseeable future. No change in
tariffs is required at the present time.
vii.      The Project provides a suitable basis for a loan of US$17 million
with a 20-year term including a grace period of 4 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE EXPANSION PROGRAM
of the
DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS (DGT)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of China has a program for the expansion and
improvement of the telephone and telegraph facilities of Taiwan for which
total construction costs during the period 1967 through 1971 are estimated
at NT$4.9 billion (US$122 m il l ion). Out of this program, certain
specific works (the Project) estimated to cost NT$2 billion (US$50 million)
are proposed for Bank financing. The proposed loan of US$17 million would
cover most of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. The balance of
thLe funds required for the program would be covered by the DGT's opera-
tions supplemented by a small amount of supplierst credits. Disbursements
under the proposed loan are scheduled to be made during the years 1968
through 1971. The late commencement of disbursements is because the DGT
does not normally make any down payment upon signing an equipment purchase
contract and because approximately a year and a half is customarily re-
quired for the detailed engineering, ordering and manufacturing of major
quantities of telephone equipment.
1.02      The Borrower would be the Directorate General of Telecommunica-
tions (DGT) of the Ministry of Communications of the Republic of China.
The DGT, through its agencies, operates the national and international
public telephone and telegraph services of Taiwan.
1.03      The principal parts of the project are the installation of
118,000 lines of automatic telephone exchange equipment in the areas of
Taipei, Keelung, Taichung and Kaohsiung, and the construction of switching
centers for subscriber long-distance dialing.
1.04      The report has been based upon a comprehensive feasibility study
of June 1966 prepared by the DGT, supplemented by information obtained by
a Bank appraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. R.N. Walsh and J.M. Vance,
which visited Taiwan in September 1966. DGT subsequently submitted actual
operating results for 1966. The negotiation of the loan was delayed because
of the time required to complete the legislative action to authorize borrow-
ing from the Bank.
2. THE BORROWER
Organization - General
2.01      The Borrower, the Directorate General of Telecommunications (DGT).
is a Government enterprise established under the Ministry of Communicationm
in April 1943 pursuant to the Organization Law for the Directorate Genera'
of Telecommunications.



- 2 -
2.02      The DGT operates through the following three agencies:
(a) The Taiwan Telecommunications Administration (TTA), established
in Taiwan in 1949 and operating the domestic telephone and
telegraph services;
(b) The Chinese Government Radio Administration (CGRA), established
in Shanghai in 1930 and in Taipei in 1949. It operates inter-
national telephone, telegraph, telex and radio photo services;
(c) The Radio Wave Research Laboratories (RWRL), established in 1951
and engaged in radio propagation observations and research.
The DGT was originally responsible for the supervision of operations of the
various provincial telecommunication entities providing service throughout
mainland China. When the Government of the Republic of China left the
mainland, the headquarters of the DGT was established in Taipei and its
operating functions were reduced to the single province of Taiwan. As a
consequence of these historical events the DGT staff is now directly
involved in the administration of TTA and CGRA. Although there is some
overlapping of functions between the DGT staff and that of its agencies,
the organization is operating effectively. Separate financial records
are kept of TTA, CGRA and DGT. However, as the distribution between enti-
ties of part of the revenues is done on an arbitrary basis, the consoli-
dated accounts for the DGT present the best basis for judging the financial
results of telecommunication operations in Taiwan.
2.03      Organization charts are shown in Annexes 1 through 4.
Management
2.04      The DGT and its agencies are well qualified to carry out the
expansion program and to operate effectively the new facilities. As a
result of the low wage levels and the employment of personnel which left
the mainland, the organization is overstaffed. It has now 39 employees
per thousand telephones. (This is about five times the comparative U.S.A.
figure, twice as much as in Venezuela and a third higher than in Argentina.)
However, as facilities are added, under the proposed and subsequent con-
struction programs, a gradual improvement in the utilization of personnel
should be obtained. Most of the senior staff has over twenty years exper-
ience in telecommunications, acquired not only on the island of Taiwan
but also on a broader scale on the mainland of China prior to 1949. The
average level of education is high, approximately 6% of the employees having
a college or university degree. In addition, the U.S. AID-financed program
of 41,500 lines of automatic telephone equipment, completed early in 1967,
has provided the organization with recent experience in preparing for and
carrying out a substantial expansion program.
Training
2.05      Special efforts have been made over many years to train engineer-
ing and operating personnel in advanced telecommunications techniques and



- 3 -
practices. During the period 1953-66, 208 employees were sent abroad
for specialized training in manufacturers' plants or in operating systems,
mainly in Japan, but 48 received training in U.S.A., others in England,
Hong Kong, the Netherlands and West Germany. For lower levels of employ-
ment, such as equipment installers, cable splicers and linemen, most of
the training has been done on the job. It is planned that this training
of staff will be continued but that, starting in early 1968, the Telecom-
munications Training Center now proposed will become the principal place
for this work. The qualifications and experience of the existing staff
together with the planned training program should assure the successful
installation and operation of the additional facilities to be provided by
the expansion program.
3. EXISTING FACILITIES
Exchange Telephones
3.01      There were 191,000 telephones in service at the end of 1966.  At
that time the equipment installed in the telephone exchanges had a capacity
for 158,000 subscriberst lines of which 109,000 provide automatic service
and 49,000 provide manual service.
3.02      Approximately 69% of the lines are automatic.  Most of the
automatic telephone equipment is installed in or near the main cities of
Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Tainan, Keelung, Changhua and Hsinchu.
Taipei, including its 11 suburban areas, has the greatest concentration
of telephones.
3.03      The automatic telephone switching equipment is comprised of
Japanese-made step-by-step type of Strowger and Siemens design and 41,500
lines of U.S.A. step-by-step type of Strowger design recently installed by
the General Telephone and Electronics Corp. In attached Annex 5 are listed,
by exchanges, the number of lines and type of equipment in service or under
construction throughout Taiwan as of December 31, 1966.
3.04      Most of the switching equipment is in good condition but of
insufficient capacity to meet the present needs for service. The tele-
phone instruments are of a semi-obsolete type. To obtain improvements in
transmission and operating efficiency a new high efficiency telephone instru-
ment of modern design is being adopted as the new standard in connection
with the expansion program.
3.05      The exchange cable distribution system is largely comprised of
locally manufactured lead-covered, paper-insulated underground telephone
cables placed in locally manufactured polyvinylchloride tubes encased in
concrete. The gradual adoption of plastic-insulated and plastic-sheathed
cables is planned when local production facilities have been expanded.
Cable pair utilization is about 70% which should be improved with sub-
scriber growth. The condition of the cable system is fair, there being
about 0.7 cable troubles per year per kilometer of cable. This is



slight2ly more than is usual in independent telephone companies in U.S.A.,
but it is not unreasonable because of the frequent occurrence of typhoons.
A program of more extensive pressurization is limited to interoffice and
main feeder cables. Telephone poles are generally of reinforced concrete.
Service drops are of copperweld conductor insulated with neoprene. Good
design and construction practices are employed.
Long-Distance Telephone
3.06      At the end of 1966, the domestic long-distance telephone system
had a total extension of 157,000 circuit kilometers.   Its total of 2,457
circuits were distributed among the various types of facilities as follows:
Circuit Capacity
Sub-Total Total
Carrier System
Underground cable                       231
Open wire                                271   502
Microwave System
Back-bone (West Coast)                  348
Branches                                 70    418
VIF System
Back-bone (East Coast)                   39
Branches                                 15     54
Rural Telephone Lines                                199
Short Cable and Open Wire Circuits                 1,284
TOTAL CIRCUITS                          2,457
3.07      The long-distance network consists of open wire, cable, carrier
on cable, VHF and microwave radio systems. As shown on Map 1, a back-bone,
large-capacity microwave system, inaugurated in 1964, liniks the principal
cities of Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung. This was built along
the West Coast by Collins Radio Co. A small capacity VHF radio system
links the cities of Ilan, Suao, Hualien and Taitung on the mountainous
East Coast. In addition to the microwave and VHF radio systems, there
is an underground cable carrier system from Keelung at the northern end
of Taiwan to the southern city of Pingtung. This cable carrier system is
largely used for medium and short-distance services.
3.08      Considerable improvement has been made in the speed and quality
of service rendered during recent years. On more than half the long-
distance circuits the operator makes the connection while the calling
subscriber waits on the line. Nevertheless, before subscriber long-distance
dialing can be introduced on a large scale, a major increase in circuits
and switching facilities is essential.



Telegraph
3.09      At the end of 1966, there were a total of 342 telegraph circuits.
Most of the operatioin is by the old type manual key and sounder but some
conversion to teletype operation has been made in recent years. In 1966
a total of 1,296,000 messages were dispatched. The average time for deliver-
ing a telegram from its sender to its receiver was 45 minutes in that year.
This compares favorably with the service rendered in more developed countries.
International
3.10      International telephone, telegraph and telex service is operated
by means of high-frequency radio equipment located in Taipei. The prin-
cipal direct circuits are to Hong Kong, Manila, Oakland and Tokyo. A list
of all cities connected by direct international circuits from Taipei is
shown in Annex 6.
3.11      The service rendered suffers from the inherent inadequacies of
high-frequency radio transmission. To improve the quality of service,
other means of overseas communication have been under consideration for
some time. The first improvement resulting from these studies and nego-
tiations was the inauguration in June 1967 of a tropospheric scatter system
between Taiwan and Hong Kong. This will have an ultimate capacity for
64 circuits but is equipped to provide initially 16 circuits. Preliminary
plans have been prepared for the future construction of a ground station
for satellite communication. An agreement has recently been reached to
construct within two years a tropospheric scatter system between Taiwan
and the Philippines.
4. DEMAND FOR SERVICE
Local Telephone Service
4.01      Taiwan has a telephone development of 1.32 telephones per 100
population. While this is higher than many other underdeveloped Asian
countries, such as the Philippines with 0.50 and Ceylon with 0.38, it is
well below that of industrialized nations, for example, Japan with 14.18
telephones per 100 population.
4.02      As a result of the growth of the national economy and improve-
ment in living standards, the demand for telephone service in Taiwan has
been high and consistently maintained for over 10 years. A back-log of
unfilled demand continues despite the substantial telephone expansion
carried out in recent years. This demand is evidenced by the abnormally
high calling rate of 16.1 per day per subscriberts line in Taipei and an
average of 15.8 throughout Taiwan. This is nearly four times the calling
rate in U.S.A.
4.03      The number of telephone subscribers in Taiwan has increased from
56,000 at the end of 1960 to 113,000 at the end of 1966 which corresponds
to an average annual growth of 12.5 per cent. As a result of the



facilities to be added during the construction program it is estimated that
the number of telephone subscribers will increase to 321,000 by the end
of 1973, the estimated average rate of growth amounting to 16.0 per cent.
Details are given in Annex 7.
4.04     The case for arguing that the demand for telephones is such as
to give ample economic justification for the Project is strengthened by
the existence of a connection fee of about US$350 which is charged to new
subscribers.  This is well above the costs of making a connection.   It has
existed at its present high level for several years, partly to provide
finance for investment and partly to restrain demand. Were a fee more in
line with actual costs charged, demand would be even greater than is cur-
rent'y projected. Given the facts that demand is already pressing so hard
on facilities and that revenue from the fee will be important for carrying
out the Project, this fee should not be reduced before completion of the
Project. Forecasts of demand thus assume the continuation of the fee. The
forecast and underlying assumpt-ions were reviewed by Mr. John J. Hanselman,
a former Assistant Vice-President of the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company, who was employed by the DGT as a consultant in the early part of
1966. He found that the records and data available were fully satisfactory
and that sound and reasonable procedures had been used in preparing the
estimates. To arrive at these estimates, the number of telephone lines
in service during past years in each of the major cities was classified by
major categories of customers (Residential, Industrial, Commercial, Govern-
ment and Paystation) and from trends of growth observed in each group, the
expected rates of growth were determined for the future. He confirmed that
the forecasts of growth could be expected to be attained. It is also the
opinion of the appraisal mission that these growth rates are reasonable.
Long-Distance Telephone Service - National
4.05      The demand for domestic long-distance telephone service has been
growing at a rate approximating that of the growth in telephones. Improve-
ments made in the facilities and consequently the grade of service rendered
have stimulated usage. The introduction of subscriber toll dialing under
the Project, providing almost immediate toll connections, will further
stimulate growth.
4.06      During the period 1958-66 the number of long-distance telephone
calls increased from 12.0 million to 24.3 million per year which corresponds
to an average annual growth of 11.0 per cent. In this period the growth
was not only restricted by shortage of facilities but also because of
tariff increases and the enlarging of the local dial area of Taipei which
transformed the toll calls between Taipei and its suburbs into local calls.
It is estimated that the annual number of long-distance calls will increase
to approximately 67 million by the end of 1973 and that the annual increase
will average nearly 15 per cent. Details are given in Annex 7.



- 7 -
4.07      These estimates are based upon the continuance of current
tariff levels and compare reasonably with past experience.
Telegraph Service - Naticnal
4.08      The average annual rate of growth of national telegraph service
has amounted to about 15% for the period 1958 through 1966. Owing to
the planned improvement in the quality of telephone service it is expected
that the public will more and more use the telephone in preference to
telegraph service. For this reason it is estimated that the annual rate
of growth of national telegraph business will gradually taper off to
about 8% in 1973. This estimate is realistic.
International Service - Telephone, Telegraph and Telex
4.09      In the 1958-66 period, the annual number of international
telephone calls has increased from 72,500 to 265,800 and international
telegraph messages from 435,000 to 800,000. Telex service, introduced
in 1960, has grown rapidly; 430,000 minutes of traffic was handled in
1966. Details of the past growth of international services are given in
Annex 7.
4.10      It is estimated that, during the years of the program, inter-
national telecommunication traffic will increase at annual rates of 15%
for telephone, 8% for telegraph and 20% for telex. These estimates are
in general accord with past trends and considered reasonable.
5. THE PROJECT
General
5.01      The DGT has embarked upon a program of expansion and improve-
ment of telecommunication facilities to be brought into service during
the period 1966 to 1971. In the early part of 1967 it completed the
installation of 41,500 lines of automatic exchange telephone equipment
distributed principally among the cities of Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung
and financed under a US$4.2 million loan from U.S. AID. During 1967 an
additional 13,000 lines of automatic exchange telephone equipmenit and
expansion of certain long-distance routes are to be financed by means of
a Japanese credit equivalent to US$3.9 million. A number of other works,
of wthich the principal ones are a tropospheric scatter radio system to
Hong Kong and extensions to the exchange telephone facilities in the
smaller cities, would be self-financed. In addition, the program includes
the purchase, through suppliers' credit, of additional channeling equip-
ment to increase the capacities of existing microwave radio systems.



.- 8 -
5.02      The remaining part of the expansion program is proposed for
Bank financing and would be carried out during the 1967-71 period. It
would comprise the installation of 118,000 lines of exchange telephone
facilities in the cities of Taipei, Keelung, Taichung and Kaohsiung; the
establishment of subscriber toll dialing between 11 toll centers with
automatic toll switching systems located in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung;
and the establishment of a Telecommunications Training Center. Each of
these major works, proposed for Bank financing, is described in more detail
below.
Exchange Telephone Facilities - 118,000 Lines Automatic Equipment
5.03      Automatic equipment of the Crossbar type would be provided as
follows:

5.04      The replacement of the Taipei South No. 2 exchange is required
because the existing equipment cannot be expanded from five to six-digit
numbering nor is there space for the installation of the additional inter-
office trunking equipment. About half of the equipment of this exchange
is 30 years old and will be scrapped, the balance being recovered for
reconditioning and re-use in other offices.
5.05      The 10,000 lines of equipment to be replaced in Taichung consist
of a 7,000-line exchange, which completely fills the building, and three
1,000-line mobile exchanges, being installed as a temporary expedient.
Under the program a new building will be erected and 16,000 lines of equip-
ment installed in it. The equipment in the old exchange and the mobile
units will be recovered for subsequent re-use.



-9-
Line Plant
5.06      Coordinated with the expansion of the exchange automatic equip-
ment, necessary extensions and improvements would be made to the exchange
cable network. These works involve mainly local currency expenditures as
practically all the materials required (cables, terminal boxes, conduits,
poles and pole line hardware) are produced in Taiwan. Orders for telephone
cables with a substantial total value would be placed with a single local
cable manufacturing plant. Although these cables would not be financed by
the proposed Bank loan, a confirmation was obtained from DGT that it would
maintain a satisfactory procedure to assure that orders for cables would be
placed at competitive prices.
Telephones
5.07      In connection with the expansion program, the DGT plans to adopt
a modern telephone instrument equivalent to the Western Electric No. 500
type set, standard in U.S.A. The change will result in a substantial trans-
mission improvement over the present No. 4 type which is largely purchased
locally. As it is expected to take several years for the local manufacturers
to produce enough of the new type telephones to meet requirements, it is
planned that approximately 25% of requirements of the Project would be pur-
chased under international competitive bidding and financed by the proposed
Bank loan.
Buildings
5.08      Seven buildings would be constructed in the principal cities
to house the telephone switching equipment. Only a small portion of the
costs would be in foreign currencies for the purchase of air conditioning
and emergency power equipment.
Establishment of Subscriber Toll Dialing System
5.09      The Project includes the installation of a subscriber-to-
subscriber long-distance dialing system between eleven toll centers with
automatic toll switching systems located in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.
This would be a first major step toward providing subscriber toll dialing
throughout all Taiwan. It is proposed to use Crossbar type switching
equipment at the Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung offices in accordance with
the recommendations of the consultants (see paragraph 5.lh below). The
attached map No. 2 shows the subscriber toll dialing network to be estab-
lished under the Project.
Telecommunications Training Center
5.10      To meet the needs of trained personnel to operate the increased
quantity of facilities and the new types of equipment resulting from the
expansion program, a Telecommunications Training Center will be constructed.
This would be a permanent training school with room for 200 trainees in



- 10 -
new buildings specifically designed for classroom, shop and laboratory
work. The trainees will come from all over the island and, because of
lack of available housing and in accordance with common practice in
Taiwan, housing as well as teaching facilities are to be provided.
5.11      The training program would provide new employees with technical
knowtledge regarding telecommunications systems and equipment and also
would provide refresher courses to increase the technical competence of
telecommunication engineers and technicians.
5.12      The teaching staff would consist of five permanent instructors
selected from the DGT staff. This permanent staff would be supple-
mented with lecturers temporarily recruited from universities, outside
business firms and the DGT.
5.13      Most of the construction costs would be in local currency and
financed from the DGT's operations. Only those imported items, such as
models of working telecommunication equipment, which, because of their
nature could be purchased under international competitive bidding proced-
ures, are proposed for financing under the Bank loan.
Engineering and Construction
5.14      The DGT engaged two experts to assist in the planning and the
engineering design. MLr. John J. Hanselman, a former Assistant Vice-President
of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, among other observations,
confirmed the reasonableness of the growth forecasts. Mr. Roy E. Bradstrum,
former Chief Engineer of the lichigan Bell Telephone Company, assisted in
the preparation of the basic engineering plans particularly with regard
to the long-range development plans for the local and long-distance
automatic switching network.  Mr. William Rupp, formerly Equipment and
Buildings Engineering Director of the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company has been engaged to assist in the execution of the automatic
equipment program. The program is technically sound and the engineering
design is in accord with generally accepted practices.
5.15      Estimates have been drawn up of the additional personnel required
to construct the line plant and install the switching equipment included
in the expansion program. Recruiting and training of the necessary people
commenced in 1967.
5.16      These arrangements for engineering and construction are
satisfacotry.
Procurement
5.17      All purchases to be financed under the proposed Bank loan are
to be made in accordance with international competitive bidding procedures.
The contracts will be placed through the Central Trust of China which
acts as purchasing agent for the DGT and other organizations of the
Government.



Schedule of Construction
5.18      The Bank-financed Project would be implemented as follows:
Engineering and specifications     Feb. 1966 to July 1967
Manufacture of equipment           Mar. 1968 to Dec. 1970
Equipment installation             Jan. 1969 to Dec. 1971
5.19      A bar chart shoTwing by exchanges the schedule of building con-
struction and related equipment installation is given in Annex 8. This
chart also shows the installation schedule of the exchange equipment of
the interim program now being implemented.
5.20      Installation of the subscriber toll dialing equipment would
start at the beinning of 1969 and be completed in March 1970.
5.21      These schedules include reasonable margins for possible delays
and may be improved upon during execution.
Cost Estimates
5.22      The cost of the Project proposed for Bank financing is estimated
as follows:
Foreign Exchange Local Cost    Total Cost
US$         NT$      NT$      US$      NT$
(millions)
Exchange facilities                13.25      530      1,i92     43.05  1,722
Subscriber toll dialing             1.70       68         36      2.60    104
Training Center                     0.15        6         23      0.72     29
Administration and consultants      0.30       12         56      1.70     68
Contingencies                       1.60       64         20      2.10     84
TOTALS                   17.00      680      1,327     50.17  2,007
5.23      The cost estimates are reasonable and have been based upon the
actual prices charged for recent purchases.  The principal item to be imported
is exchange automatic equipment for which an estimated price of US$92 per line
has been taken.  This price is based on recent tenders obtained for the supply
of equivalent equipment. Foreign costs include allowances of 10% for con-
tingencies. Only a nominal amount has been included for local cost contin-
gencies.  However, the 1967-71 program includes the equivalent of about
US$72 million for construction works in addition to the Bank-financed Project,
and part of these works could be rescheduled if required to offset possible
cost increases in the Project proposed for Bank financing.

6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
6.01      Telecommunication tariffs are established by the DGT but are
subject to review and approval of the Ministry of Communications, the
Executive Yuan (Cabinet) and the Legislative Yuan (Congress). No regula-
tions establishing a specific tariff policy have been issued by the
Government. In recent years tariffs have been approved permitting the
DGT to maintain a satisfactory rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation of over 10%. In connection with existing loans obtained from
U.S. AID a minimum rate of return of 6% was prescribed but calculated on
a rate base including allowances for working capital and other items.
6.02      The present tariffs were made effective on September 1, 1965,
and were estimated to increase total annual revenues by some 13%. The
principal reason for this tariff increase was the introduction of a special
payment by the DGT to the Government (see paragraph 6.19). The details of
the existing tariffs are given in Annex 9. In general, they are of the
same order of magnitude as tariffs charged by Government-owmed telecommund-
cation services in Western Europe.
6.03      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that the DGT
would be authorized to charge tariffs to enable it to maintain a minimum
rate of return of 10% on average net fixed assets in operation, adjusted
to reflect currency revaluations, changes in prices or similar factors,
in accordance with a method satisfactory to the Bank.
Accounting_and Audit
6.o4      The accounting procedures of the DGT have been established in
accordance with the "General Instructions for Communications Accounting
System" issued in 1956 by the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts
and Statistics, which forms a part of the Executive Yuan. The account-
ing staff is capable and efficient and the accounting system is modern
and follows generally accepted commercial practices. The accounting
records are kept on a calendar year basis.
6.05      The DGT's accounts are subject to an annual examination followed
by an audit. The examination is carried out jointly by the Ministry of
Communications, the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounts and Statistics. Subsequently the Ministry of Audit carries
out the audit and its findings are incorporated in a report on all Govern-
ment enterprises which is submitted to the Legislature.
6.06      In connection with the Bank loan made in 1965 to China to finance
railways, a similar auditing procedure was found to be satisfactory and the
Bank's normal requirement of independent auditors was therefore waived. This
auditing procedure would also be satisfactory with respect to the DGT and
agreement was reached during loan negotiations that the unaudited financial
statements will be submitted to the Bank within three months after the clos--
ing of the fiscal year. The audited accounts and the auditors' reports,
together with the certified auditors' statement, will be submitted to the
Bank within seven months after the end of the financial year,

Total Liabilities                3,176             79.4
6.08      As a result of inflation the DGT's fixed assets and the reserve
for depreciation were revalued in 1959 and 1961 in accordance with general
legislation and to reflect changes in the Wholesale Price Index compiled
by the Bureau of Accounting Statistics. There has been no significant
fluctuation in the lNholesale Price Index since 1961. Capital Surplus was
credited with the two revaluations in the amaunt of NT$710 million.  The
connection fees account for most of the remainder of capita' :supius.



- 14 -
6.09      All new subscribers are required to pay in advance a connection
fee. This varies from NT$14,000 (US$350) for subscribers in Taipei to
NT$4,000 (US$100) for subscribers connected to manual exchanges. This
fee has been in effect for a number of years and was found to be necessary
in order to raise funds to finance expansion programs. The connection
fees continue to supply a substantial portion of the capital funds needed
for telephone expansion. In 1966 they totaled NT$197 million (US$4.9
million) or approximately 29% of total internally generated funds.  During
loan negotiations assurances were obtained that the connection fees would
not be lowered before completion of the Project.
6.10      In Metropolitan Taipei only, the connection fee includes  a
construction allocation of NT$7,200. In theory two-thirds (NT$4,800) of
this allocation is subject to refund if the telephone subscriber discontinues
service within two years after installation and one-third (NT$2 ,400) is
subject to refund if the subscriber discontinues service within the third
year after installation. In practice, however, a refund has never been
requested. Taking this into consideration the DGT includes the total paid-
in connection fees as capital surplus in the equity portion of its capital
account. No interest is paid on the connection fees.
6.11      Each subscriber is required to pay a telephone set deposit of
NT$l,000 (US$25) which is refundable without interest upon termination of
service.
6.12      The DGT's assets have been largely financed from retained earn-
ings and connection fees and to a negligible extent by long-term borrowing
and Government investment; the Government has not provided capital funds
since 1961. The DGT's total assets at the end of 1966 amounted to NT$3,176
million while total debt was NT$546 miLlion or about 17% of total assets.
6.13      As of December 31, 1966, outstanding long-term debt totaled
NT$248 million (US$6.2 million) representing about 91o of the total
capitalization and consisting entirely of U.S. AID loans as follows:
Original  Year         Amount Outstanding
Amount    Made         at 12/31/66              Terms
(in millions of US dollars)
4.1       1955-58               1.6             15 years at 5%
2.0       1960                  1.2             11 years at 3-1/2%
4.2       1962                  3.4             11 years at 3-1/2%
6.14      At the end of 1966 the current assets were NT$1,047 million
as compared with current liabilities and subscribers' deposits totaling
NT$293 million.  The greatest portion of current assets is in the form
of cash amounting to NT$721 million. It will be utilized over the next
few years to meet part of the local currency costs of the planned expansion
program. Most of the funds are on deposit in banks in Taiwan earning
interest of about 9%0 per annum.



- 15 -
Past Operations
6.15      Detailed operating statements for the years 1961 through 1966
are shown in Annex 11. The DGT's total operating earnings have consisted
of approximately 80% from telephone revenue, 19go from telegraph revenue
and 1% from other operating revenue, mainly leased circuit rental.
6.16      During the years 1961-1964 the rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation ranged from 10.2% to 11.9% and the operating ratio
from 70/% to 73%. This ratio compares favorably with the level normally
achieved by an efficiently managed telecommunications operation. Prini-
cipally as a result of abnormally high plant utilization and the tariff
adjustment of September 1965, the rate of return for 1965 reached 14.7%
and an operating ratio of 66% was achieved.
6.17      During recent years accoLnts receivable have amounted to
approximately 12% of operating revenue. The collection performance is
satisfactory.
6.18      Depreciation has been cc.puted on a straight line basis, based
on the service life of the various categories of plant in service. Rates
vary from 1.7% for buildings to 20% for vehicles resulting in an annual
composite rate of about 5%, which is reasonable.
Taxes and Dividends
6.19      Government regulatiLns exempt the DGT from paying income tax,
but stipulate that 25% of its annual net income must be paid to the Govern-
ment. In addition, in connection with the tariff increase authorized
on September 1, 1965, the Government introduced a special payment by the
DGT to the Government. This payment is calculated on the basis of charges of
NT$34.90 on each subscriber's monthly rental, NT$1.20 on each toll call
and NT$0.50 on each public telephone call.  As a result most of the addi-
tional revenue generated by the tariff increase is paid to the Government.
6.20      To assure that DGT has adequate funds to meet the estimated
cost of its expansion program, assurances were obtained during loan
negotiations that during the 1967-71 construction period, the payment to
the Government of 25% of DGT's annual net income would not be increased.
Insurance
6.21      Like most government entities the DGT does not carry insurance
against losses on its fixed assets from major risks such as fire, typhoon
and earthquake. During loan negotiaitons assurances were obtained that
the Government would indemnify the DGT for any substantial losses from
such casualties.

Financial Plan
6.22      A forecast of Sources and Applications of Funds for the period
1967 through 1971 is shown in Annex 12. During this period the DGT's
construction costs are estimated at NT$4,876 million (US$122 million)
including the works currently under way and those to be financed by the
proposed Bank loan (see paragraphs 5.01 and 5.02).
6.23      The forecast is summarized as follows:

6.2h      The estimated funds available would be sufficient to cover con-
struction costs, debt service requirements, payments to the Government,
increase working capital and leave reasonable cash balances. All interest
rate of 6% per annum and a term of 20 years including a grace period of
four years have been assumed for the proposed Bank loan. Although no Bank
funds are scheduled to be drawnn down until 1968, it is necessary for budget-
ary as wiell as acninistrative reasons that the DGT has reasonable assurances

- 17 -
6.25      Arrangements are completed for the procurement of equipment
from Japanese suppliers to be installed during 1967 and 1968. The cost
of this equipment, estimated at US$3.9 million ecuivalent, is being
financed under a general credit of US$150 million equivalent extended by
Japan to the Republic of China. The funds are being made available to the
DGT at an interest rate of 5.75% and a term of 12 years including a grace
period of three years.
6.26      It has been assumed that the equipment required to increase the
capacity of the existing microwave systems would be purchased directly from
the original suppliers and that the cost, totaling about US$1 million,
would be financed by suppliers' credits on reasonable terms. For the pur-
pose of financial forecasts a term of 7 years including a 1-year grace
period and an interest rate of 7 per cent have been assumed. In view of
the comparatively small amount involved, the terms of financing will not
appreciably affect the financial projections. During loan negotiations
the DGT confirmed that it expects to conclude satisfactory financing
arrangements for this purchase and assurances were obtained that, before
it is concluded, the purchase contract would be submitted to the Bank
for its review and comments.
6.27      The proposed Bank loan would cover about 34% of the total costs
of the works included in the proposed Bank project, and about 13% of
total funds required during the 1967-71 period. The balance would be
covered by net internal cash generation (46%), connection and subscribers'
fees (?51%), reduction of cash reserves (12%), the Japanese loan (3%0), and
U.S. AfD loan and possible suppliers' credits (1%).
Estimated Future Operations
6028      A forecast of earnings for the period 1967 through 1971 is shown
in Amaiex 11. In preparing these estimates the DGT used the following
reasonable assumptions based upon past experience:
(a) Revenues are based upon the continuation of tariffs at existing
levels and the growth estimates discussed in paragraphs 4.03-4.10;
(b) Traffic and commercial expenses would increase at an annual rate
of about 15%;
(c) General and administrative expenses would increase at an annual
rate of about 10%;
(d) Maintenance expense is calculated at 5.2% of fixed assets;
(e) Provision for depreciation is computed on a straight line basis
at a composite rate of approximately 5% of fixed assets.
6.29      The forecast shows that the operating ratio will remain at a
satisfactory level of about 70,", during the period 1967-1971.  The rate
of return on average net fixed assets in service ranges from a high of
4l5h.   in 1967 to a low of 10.1% in 1971.  The reduction toward the end
of the period results from the substantial assets being added to the



- .18 -
system. These new facilities would provide for a limited time a small
margin of spare capacity desirable for the efficient operation of the
system.
Future Financial Position
6.30      Estimated balance sheets for the period 1967 through 1971
are shown in Annex 13. They show that the DGT will remain in a satisfac-
tory financial position. The following financial ratios should be viewed
in the light of the DGT's unusual capital structure in which a substantial
portion of the equity has been built up by connection fees credited to
capital surplus (see paragraphs 6.09 and 6.10).
6.31      Net plant in service would increase from NT$1,850 million at the
end of 1966 to NT$4,619 million at the end of 1971. The long-term debt/
equity ratio varies from a,low of 12/88 in 1967 to a high of 17/83 in
1969 and 1970 reflecting the comparatively small amount of debt incurred
in financing the DGT's expansion program.
6.32      Both debt service and interest are amply covered throughout the
program. Debt service coverage by internal cash generation rar.ges from
10.9 times in 1967 to 5.1 times in 1971. Interest coverage by net income
available for fixed charges ranges from,l5.7 times in 1967 to 7.7 times
in 1971.
Debt Limitation
6.33      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that the, DGT
would not incur additional debt unless annual debt service requirements
were covered at least twice by annual net revenues. The DGT should have
no difficulty in meeting this commitment.
7. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The program is technically sound and well designed to meet the
immediate and most essential needs for the expansion of the DGT's tele-
communication services. The DGT is well organized and its operations are
efficient.
7.02      Estimates of costs are reasonable and financing proposals are
satisfactory.
7.03      The DGT's financial position is sound and forecasts show it
would remain so throughout the period required for the execution of the
proposed program. Construction costs of the program not covered by the
proposed Bank loan will largely be met fram the DGT's own resources.
7.o4      The program is suitable for a Bank loan of US$17 million with
a term of 20 years including a grace period of 4 years.
