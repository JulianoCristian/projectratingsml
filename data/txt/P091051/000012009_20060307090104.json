narrowing\n            the gap between the cost of implementing its key elements,\n            and resources available from the Government's own\n            domestic revenues, in addition to other donor support. This\n            one-tranche operation is the second of a planned series of\n            three PRSCs, and will aim at strengthening the three\n            crosscutting, and institutional issues that were emphasized\n            in the first operation: fiduciary reforms of the State;\n            decentralization process; and, health services, with a focus\n            on improving information, financial and human resources\n            management in the sector, as well as enhancing the access to\n            improved quality basic health services, identified as\n            important factors for determining the performance of this\n            sector. Concurrently, in view of the progress achieved under\n            PRSC-I, this project shall also expand its coverage to two\n            additional areas, perceived as crucial for PRS\n            implementation: a) promoting wealth creation, by supporting\n            ongoing reforms in the labor market, and of improvements in\n            the judiciary system; and, b) improving the living\n            conditions of the most vulnerable groups. While there are\n            several risks associated with this operation, the\n            determination shown by the Government in overcoming\n            resistances, and its efforts to build broad consensus for\n            reforms through consultative processes, (despite a sometimes\n            slow pace of reforms), the benefits of this operation\n            however, clearly outweighs its risks."}, "docdt": "2006-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
