Mining may cause\n            pollution to water, to air and the contamination of soils\n            and sediment, hence laboratories need to be able to analyze\n            solid, liquid, and gaseous samples. It is foreseen that the\n            Department of Environment shall require analytical services,\n            both for the control of discharges from mines, and for the\n            determination of background conditions in various natural\n            environments. The analysis for mercury related to\n            contamination from artisanal mining is a possible future\n            need, if Mozambican authorities decide to embark on an\n            investigation of this potentially serious problem. This\n            would mean the analysis for mercury in such media as natural\n            soils; stream sediments; water (less likely as the\n            solubility of mercury in water is extremely low); fish (or\n            other fauna); and, human hair and blood. Such analyses\n            requires sophisticated equipment to determine expected low\n            concentrations, as well as strict routines for cleanliness,\n            and inter-laboratory quality control. The inefficient use of\n            natural resources creates the following potential problems:\n            incomplete recovery of ore reserves in mine or deposit; poor\n            recovery of metals/minerals in the beneficiation process;\n            and, wastefulness regarding consumption of water and energy.\n            Sources or reasons for this are the use of unsuitable mining\n            methods, inferior beneficial methods, and/or poor\n            optimization of processes, slack management and work\n            routines. Recommendations include implementation of baseline\n            studies in regions where future mining is expected to take\n            place, or in areas of ecological sensitivity. It is\n            suggested to study groundwater conditions, as well as the\n            vegetation characteristics of coastal areas hosting deposits\n            of titanium-rich heavy mineral sands. In addition,\n            guidelines for occupational health and safety matters at\n            mining sites should be developed, in close cooperation with\n            the Department of Mine Safety."}, "docdt": "2003-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
