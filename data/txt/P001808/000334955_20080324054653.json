The overall\n            outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned: (i) improving the enabling\n            environment for mining increases the ability of a country to\n            attract and retain appropriate private investment, reform of\n            the enabling environment should focus on improving sector\n            performance and growth, and the contribution of mining to\n            the national economy; ensuring the sustainability of the\n            mining industry; and ensuring that the host country gets a\n            fair share from the benefits of the development of the\n            sector; (ii) enactment of the necessary legal, fiscal, and\n            environmental policies, and the establishment of strong\n            mining institutions to implement and administer them, have\n            proven to be keys to success. Progress also depends on the\n            continued development of institutional capabilities, in an\n            environment of sensible macroeconomic policies to ensure the\n            sustainability of progress achieved; and (iii) Government\n            ownership and emphasis on beneficiary participation in\n            project preparation, intensive supervision, organization,\n            and coordination in the field are critical for timely and\n            effective implementation."}, "docdt": "2007-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
