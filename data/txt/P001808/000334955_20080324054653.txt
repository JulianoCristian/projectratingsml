F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives:

The overall objective of the Mineral Resources Management Capacity Building Project was to provide
technical assistance to the Government of Mozambique for (a) institutional development and regulatory
reform designed to encourage the expansion of private investment in mining in a socially and
environmentally sound way; and (b) targeted interventions to alleviate poverty in areas of strong
incidence of small-scale and artisanal mining. Specific Project objectives included (a) improving the legal
and regulatory framework to help establish an enabling environment to promote private investment into
mining, while ensuring real and sustainable contribution to economic growth; (b) building institutional



                                                    5

capacity to develop capabilities to effectively enforce laws and regulations, administer mining titles, and
monitor the sustainable development of small-scale mining; (c) developing a data bank and geological
maps to strengthen the government's capacity to make essential geoscientific and natural resources
information available to potential investors; (d) institutional strengthening to establish capacity in the
country for environmental management and to develop the understanding of and the capacity to address
social impacts from mining; and (e) identifying and adopting appropriate mechanisms to increase
revenues and improve the quality of life in selected areas of strong concentration of artisanal miners,
through the establishment of legal rights for their activity and the provision of extension services to
improve the social, welfare, health, and environmental conditions of artisanal miners.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Country and Sector Background. The Government of Mozambique (GoM) was actively seeking to
attract private and foreign investment to promote growth in the sector. The sector policy approved in
February 1998 by the Council of Ministers clearly defined GoM's role as a regulator, promoter,
facilitator, and supervisor of mining activity, leaving the operational and implementation role to the
private sector. Because of the country's geological potential and GoM's pragmatic approach to the
implementation of the sector policy, investors had shown positive interest in exploration.

Although Mozambique had a favorable geological environment for mining, the impact of mining on the
economy was very small: less than 0.25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and about 1.4
percent of exports (1997). The value of Mozambique's mineral production rose from virtually nil in 1990
to around the US$7.0 million in 1998, of which about US$6.0 million came from industrial minerals and
construction materials, and US$1.0 million from gold and gemstones. Most of the activity in gold and
gemstones was taking place in the informal sector. The Ministry of Mineral Resources (MIREM) had
estimated that about US$10 million worth of gold and US$30-40 million worth of semi-precious stones
were illegally exported from Mozambique each year. Annual fiscal revenues arising directly from mining
(including surface rental fees for exploration) represented about US$1 million.

The fiscal year 1999 joint MIREM/World Bank Mining Sector Policy Review identified four major
constraints to the development of the sector (a) insufficient geological information available on the
country; (b) a deficient legal and regulatory framework; (c) lack of capacity of government institutions in
the sector; and (d) and lack of infrastructure. The conclusions of these reports were discussed in a Mining
Policy Dialogue Seminar, Policy and Strategies for Mining Development in Mozambique: Attracting
Foreign Investment into Mining, in Maputo in July 1999 and funded by a World Bank Institutional
Development Fund Grant.

Four key issues requiring immediate action were identified during the seminar (a) introduce a new mining
code to bring Mozambique into line with contemporary international mining legislation; (b) improve
inter-ministerial coordination and build capacity for efficient and effective administration in the relevant
government agencies; (c) collect, process, and make available the geoscientific data currently available in
Mozambique; and (d) simplify and standardize procedures for granting mining titles, and create a separate
unit for their administration. Other issues that were identified in the Mining Sector Policy Review
included (a) prevailing barriers for mineral exploration by large mining companies had to be reduced so
that Mozambique could attract the annual flow of US$50-100 million in exploration investments needed
to develop the sector; (b) the focus of overall mining taxation should be shifted towards profit-related
taxes and away from royalties; and (c) transparency and security for investors should be improved by the
introduction of standard mining agreements with stability clauses and automatic incentives, reducing to
the maximum extent possible the derogation to the common regime subject to case-by-case negotiation.

Rationale for Bank Assistance. The prevailing Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)1 at the time of Project
approval was aligned with GoM's program for poverty reduction, through the promotion of rapid, broad-
based private-sector led growth. The Project supported this goal as it was aimed at promoting and

facilitating foreign as well as domestic investment into a high potential growth sector in Mozambique,
through the creation of a business-friendly environment.

Since 1992, Mozambique was making good use of the Bank's experience in macroeconomic and sector
reform, particularly with respect to capacity building of public institutions, modernization of its legal and
regulatory framework, and privatization of state-owned enterprises. Given its experience and established
presence in the country, the Bank's involvement was expected to facilitate the implementation of the
Project in a timely and efficient manner and ensure that GoM maintained its focus on the objectives of the
Project. The Bank had a competitive advantage in mining building on its experience as the leading
provider of assistance to mining sector reforms in African and Latin American countries during the 1990s,
contributing to an upsurge in mining activities on both continents. The Bank was the only donor capable
of providing an integrated approach to the technical assistance to be given to GoM, which was targeted at
institutional development and regulatory reform designed to encourage the expansion of private
investment in mining in a socially and environmentally sound way.

The Bank's intervention in the sector also leveraged substantial parallel financing: total Project cost was
US$37.5 million, of which US$18 million was financed by the World Bank, and about US$18.5 million
was financed by other donors. The Nordic Development Fund (NDF) provided a 12 million credit to
fund geological and geoscientific activities under the program; the African Development Bank (AfDB)
provided a US$3.3 million credit to finance geological and geochemical activities under the program; and
the Government of South Africa provided a US$1.3 million grant for supervision of these activities,
executed by the Council of Geosciences (CGS). The Bank assumed sole responsibility for the funding of
the other Project components as well as for overall Project coordination.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall objective of the Mineral Resources Management Capacity Building Project was to provide
technical assistance to the Government of Mozambique for (a) institutional development and regulatory
reform designed to encourage the expansion of private investment in mining in a socially and
environmentally sound way; and (b) targeted interventions to alleviate poverty in areas of strong
incidence of small-scale and artisanal mining. Specific Project objectives included (a) improving the legal
and regulatory framework to help establish an enabling environment to promote private investment into
mining, while ensuring real and sustainable contribution to economic growth; (b) building institutional
capacity to develop capabilities to effectively enforce laws and regulations, administer mining titles, and
monitor the sustainable development of small-scale mining; (c) developing a data bank and geological
maps to strengthen the government's capacity to make essential geoscientific and natural resources
information available to potential investors; (d) institutional strengthening to establish capacity in the
country for environmental management and to develop the understanding of and the capacity to address
social impacts from mining; and (e) identifying and adopting appropriate mechanisms to increase
revenues and improve the quality of life in selected areas of strong concentration of artisanal miners,
through the establishment of legal rights for their activity and the provision of extension services to
improve the social, welfare, health, and environmental conditions of artisanal miners.

Key Indicators included:

(i) Increase private investment, exports, and fiscal revenues:

     (a) Increase in the number of private operators involved in mining.
     (b) Increase in average annual investments in mining.
     (c) Increase in average annual minerals exports.
     (d) Increase fiscal revenues from mining.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The main beneficiaries of the Project included:

· Public Sector Mining Institutions. The Ministry of Mineral Resources (MIREM) and its National
     Directorate of Mining (DNM) and National Directorate of Geology (DNG) benefited from a detailed
     institutional assessment, capacity building, and institutional reform activities under the Project. An
     Environmental Monitoring Unit was introduced in the DNM and capacity to oversee the development
     of the Moatize coal deposit strengthened. Enhanced sector information and monitoring systems, in the
     form of the mining cadastre, environmental management information system (EMIS), and minerals
     information system (MIS), were introduced and successfully commissioned, and the ability of the
     institutions to manage the sector improved. The Mine Development Fund was formally restructured



                                                      13

    under a new charter and quasi-independent management to encourage the development of the sector,
    preserve the independence of the mine cadastre, and support artisanal and small scale mining.

· Private Sector Investors. Private sector investors benefited from updated and expanded geological
    information on the country, a more efficient and rules-based exploration licensing system, and a more
    transparent and comprehensive legal, regulatory, and fiscal framework.

· Artisanal and Small Scale Miners. Artisanal and small scale miners benefited from formalization of
    their activities, through the formal allocation and demarcation of legal areas for artisanal and small
    scale mining. Formation of artisanal and small scale mining cooperatives was promoted to improve
    miners' access to tools, services, and markets. Updated environmental, health, and safety regulations,
    including and HIV/AIDS strategy, were also introduced.

· Central Government. Through an improved legal, regulatory, and fiscal framework, and improved
    capacity to manage the mining sector, the central government benefited from increased revenues
    generated through the attraction of mining sector investments.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project consisted of five components:

Component 1. Institutional Reform and Capacity Building of Public Mining Institutions (estimated
cost: US$6.93 million)

The component included (a) strengthening the policy making, regulatory, and sector management
capabilities in MIREM; (b) rationalizing the role of the State from being an owner and operator of mining
assets to a regulator and administrator by reducing State involvement in exploration and mining by
allowing and promoting private sector participation; (c) finalizing the implementation of an enabling legal
and regulatory framework aimed at promoting private mining enterprises; (d) restructuring and
modernizing of DNM and DNG; based on the redefinition of their mandates and internal procedures, in
order to transform them into a sector promotion tool providing a good base for the provision of sound
geological information; (e) deconcentrating DNM and DNG away from Maputo into four inter-regional
points; (f) establishing proper computer-based cadastre and mine-reporting systems as well as explicit
criteria and non-discretionary procedures for the granting and foreclosing of mining rights; and (g)
improving capacity at MIREM to attract private sector investment by allocating resources for promotional
programs and institutional development.

Component 1 activities were grouped into five sub-components: (A.1) Modernization of the Legal and
Regulatory Framework (US$0.5 million); (A.2) Institutional Reform and Capacity Building (US$5.03
million); (A.3) Mining Cadastre and Registry (US$0.77 million); (A.4) Investment Promotion (US$0.33
million); and (A.5) Intranet Network (US$0.3 million).

Component 2. Development of the Country's Geological Infrastructure (estimated cost: US$18.61
million, including parallel financing)

Component activities included to (a) complete the regional airborne geophysical coverage of the country,
and finance a denser coverage over selected promising areas; (b) update and improve of the existing
coverage of geological maps at 1:250,000 scale, and support the detailed coverage of selected areas of
high mineral potential; (c) compile the existing geochemical survey data, including the re-analysis of
existing samples and some complementary sampling; (d) strengthen the network of seismic stations to
monitor the seismic activity of the country; (e) establish a modern, computerized MIS, to compile and


                                                    14

catalogue dispersed data, and modernize and improve DNG's documentation center; (f) conduct an
inventory of industrial minerals and construction materials in Mozambique in order to promote
investment opportunities to the local private sector; and (g) strengthen the National Museum of Geology
and DNG's central laboratory.

Component 2 activities were grouped into 10 sub-components, all of which benefited from parallel
financing by AfDB, NDF, and/or CGS: (B.1) Component Supervision (US$1.15 million); (B.2)
Geophysics Airborne Survey (US$4.82 million); (B.3) Geological Mapping (US$8.19 million); (B.4)
Geochemical Sampling (US$1.31 million); (B.5) Seismological Network (US$0.11 million); (B.6)
Document Center (US$0.46 million); (B.7) Minerals Information System (US$0.76 million); (B.8)
Industrial Minerals Survey (US$0.88 million); (B.9) Rehabilitation of the National Museum of Geology
(US$0.43 million); and (B.10) Strengthening of DNG's Central Laboratory (US$0.5 million).

Component 3. Environment Management System (estimated cost: US$2.35 million)

The component was to assist in the (a) preparation of an environmental and social sectoral assessment that
would help identify the location of protected areas and areas of high value biodiversity that should be
restricted to mining activities, as well of prospective locations for the development of mining operations
where environmental baseline studies should be carried out; (b) definition of sector specific
environmental regulations and standards, including the procedures for the rehabilitation of the area after
mine closure; (c) implementation of adequate procedures and guidelines for the preparation of
environmental impact studies in mining; (d) capacity building of MIREM's Mining Environmental
Management Unit to monitor and enforce environmental regulations; (e) preparation of socio-economic
baseline studies over selected mining districts as a basis for development of methodology and capacity to
assess and monitor social, cultural, and economic impacts of mining on local communities; (f)
development of consultation and participatory procedures; and (g) establishment of environmental
management system data basis for the environmental impacts of mining, with linkages with other relevant
environment data banks in other ministries, namely MICOA's area planning department. MIREM's and
MICOA's capabilities to deal with sector environmental issues would be strengthened through the
training of their staff, in order to ensure that mining operations are conducted in compliance with sound
environmental practices.

Component 4. Sustainability of Small Scale and Artisanal Mining (estimated cost: US$2.20 million)

This component was to improve the general awareness of small-scale and artisanal miners on the ways to
improve their technical and environmental performance and overall impacts of their activity on local
communities. It aimed to (a) support an integrated management and technical assistance program to
enhance technical yields, reduce serious adverse impacts on the environment, improve living conditions
of artisanal miners, and increase tax revenues; (b) support DNM to design and deliver technical advice,
geology information, and extension services to small-scale miners, including the establishment of a pilot
training center for small scale miners; (c) build capacity within MIREM for the management of social
issues in the sector, namely the preparation of a generic framework for potential resettlement and
compensation, and alternatives for revenue sharing with local communities; and (d) health hazards
campaign to improve health conditions within small scale and artisanal miners communities.

Component 5. Project Coordination and Management (estimated cost: US$1.91 million)

The Mining Project Coordination Unit (UCPM) was responsible for coordinating Project implementation
and managing (a) procurement, including all contracting for works and purchases and the hiring of
consultants; (b) Project monitoring, reporting, and evaluation; (c) the contractual relationship with the
Bank; and (d) financial record keeping, management of the Special Account, and disbursements. At the


                                                     15

outset, UCPM staff consisted of a Project Coordinator, a Project Financial Officer, a Project Procurement
Assistant, a Project Secretary, a Kitchen Servant/Maid, and a Driver. AfDB financed an Assistant Project
Financial Officer, who acted as deputy to the Financial Officer UCPM, working closely with the Project
Steering Committee2, was responsible for coordination among the different institutions of MIREM
participating in the Project as well as other state and private institutional stakeholders in the Project's
objectives. UCPM was the direct link to the World Bank concerning Project implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

The Project components were not revised--Project components remained flexible enough over the
Project's six-year implementation period to accommodate changing circumstances, such as the unforeseen
rise in mineral prices and the development of the Moatize coal deposit.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

While there were no changes in the Project's design, there were changes to the Project's schedule,
category allocations, and procurement arrangements to accommodate evolving circumstances over the
Project implementation period. These changes are described below.

Project Schedule. In February 2006, the closing date of the Project was extended by one year, from June
30, 2006 to June 30, 2007. The extension was sought for the following reasons:

· To allow for reinterpretation of the airborne geophysics and geological data gathered with Project
    support and its incorporation into regional mapping, and the production of an updated, flagship
    1:1,000,000 map of Mozambique's mineral resources. The production of a 1:1,000,000 map had not
    been planned under the Project, but given the availability of data and the utility of such an investment
    promotion tool, it was added. NDF approved an additional 359,000 to produce the map and
    additional training for DNG and DNM staff on the use and maintenance of the geological
    databases/MIS. While all other NDF-funded activities were completed by the extended Project
    closing date, GoM and NDF agreed on a delivery date of March 2008 for the 1:1,000,000 map.

· Implementation of AfDB-funded activities, which included the equipping of the geological laboratory
    and geochemical sampling, experienced start-up delays at the beginning of the Project owing to the
    crisis in Cote d'Ivoire and disruption of AfDB's headquarters. Further delays in the delivery of
    equipment were experienced near the end of the Project, due to the refusal of select international
    suppliers to deliver the specialized equipment to Maputo without upfront payment. AfDB extended
    the closing date of its activities through December 31, 2007 to accommodate these delays.

· Completion of the outstanding World Bank-funded activities, including (a) the statutes for DNG; (b)
    final communications aspects of the regional mining cadastre and incorporation of an environmental
    management system (EMIS); (c) investment promotion strategy and training; (d) procurement for and
    completion of the small-scale mining gold and ceramics pilot projects; and (e) support to GoM in its
    response to CVRD regarding development of the Moatize coal concession, which emerged at short



2   The Steering Committee was composed of MIREM's Director of Economy, the National Director of Geology,
    the National Director of Mines, and two advisers, one representative from MICOA (Head of Environment
    Impact Assessment Department), and the Supervisor of the Geologic Infrastructure component.

    notice toward the end of the Project and which had potentially significant revenue and regional
    development impacts that were fully aligned and consistent with the Project objectives.

Funding Reallocations. During implementation, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was revised
twice to reallocate funds among expenditure categories. The reallocations are shown in the table below.


            Category                 Original Allocation    Reallocation July 2004  Reallocation Feb. 2006

The first reallocation, in July 2004, aimed to redistribute funds to better meet Project needs identified
during the Project mid-term review (MTR) in May 2004. This increased funds to the Consultant Services
category to accommodate the appointment of regional consultants to help implement activities under the
small-scale and artisanal mining component. The Goods category was increased to meet the increased
demand from MIREM/DNG/DNM to equip regional offices, particularly for the mining cadastre and
management of small-scale mining activities. Unallocated funds and funds from the Works and
Training/Workshop categories were used for the reallocation--savings on Works were experienced due to
better than expected performance of airborne geophysical surveys; savings on training were achieved by
maximizing on-the-job versus overseas training.

The second reallocation, in February 2006, was a result of a careful review of actual and planned
expenditures to that point, which revealed that the Project over-spent or would overspend in the categories
of Training/Workshops and Goods, while spending on Works and on Publications was not as high as
expected. In addition, budget overruns for Recurrent Costs--primarily resulting at the beginning of the
Project for higher than expected operating costs of the DNM, DNG, and the Provincial Directorates--
required modest additional funds. Project funds for recurrent costs for DNM, DNG, and the Provincial
Directorates were phased out as a result of the MTR and progressively borne by GoM.

Modification of Scale. Due to early over-spending on operating costs and the provincial Directorates,
certain non-critical activities were identified and deferred due to an expected lack of budget after taking
into account beneficial movement in exchange rates (exact budget monitoring was extremely difficult
because of the denomination of Credit proceeds in SDRs; the Project team was conservative in taking
exchange rate fluctuations into account, to avoid overspending the Project budget). The main Bank-
financed activity that was postponed was the completion of the intranet network. GoM, however, plans to
allocate some of the surplus funds under AfDB financed component to complete the intranet network by
end 2007.

Change in Procurement Arrangements. It became apparent during a post procurement review
undertaken in 2006 that the cumulative value of local shopping exceeded aggregate ceilings for both
Goods and Works provided for in the DCA. While excessive, it was to a large extent understandable since
the procurement of goods represented small a large number of purchases (each under US$50,000)
destined for several geographically diverse provincial beneficiaries and extending over a number of years
(making it difficult to package the goods and works together). To rectify this situation, aggregate ceilings

in Schedule 3 of the DCA were deleted in favor of the adoption of the Procurement Guidelines of May
2004, which had been introduced subsequent to the Project's approval. Strict adherence to an agreed
procurement plan, developed by GoM and agreed by the Bank, was also introduced. All remaining
contracts under the Project were subject to prior review by the Bank.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Lessons of Earlier Operations Taken into Account. During preparation lessons learned from ongoing
projects in Mozambique and from other countries where the Bank had financed similar technical
assistance operations in the mining sector (e.g., Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali,
Mauritania, and Tanzania) were taken into account. Results of a Bank review on mining sector reform in
Latin America were also instructive to the situation in Mozambique.3 Lessons included the following:

· Improving the enabling environment for mining increases the ability of a country to attract and retain
    appropriate private investment. Reform of the enabling environment should focus on improving
    sector performance and growth and the contribution of mining to the national economy; ensuring the
    sustainability of the mining industry; and ensuring that the host country gets a fair share from the
    benefits of the development of the sector.

· Enactment of the necessary legal, fiscal, and environmental policies, and the establishment of strong
    mining institutions to implement and administer them, have proven to be keys to success. Progress
    also depends on the continued development of institutional capabilities, in an environment of sensible
    macroeconomic policies to ensure the sustainability of progress achieved.

· Government ownership and emphasis on beneficiary participation in project preparation, intensive
    supervision, organization, and coordination in the field are critical for timely and effective
    implementation.

Participatory Processes. Small-scale and artisanal miners were involved in a policy dialogue seminar in
Nampula (close to the northern provincial mining area) and were fully involved--either directly through
the small-scale mining survey funded under a Project preparation PHRD Grant, or indirectly through their
association--in Project preparation with respect to the small-scale mining component. The Project was
discussed with mining companies and reflected their comments. The Project was also discussed directly
with interested NGOs, mainly from the area of environment.

The Project's scope was the result of more than two years of dialogue between MIREM and the Bank,
and was based on MIREM's planned and ongoing activities. GoM fully owned the Project, participating
in Project preparation by helping to realize the seminars and workshops dealing with in-depth analysis of
sector reforms to be supported by the Project. At the sector level, commitment was evident from GoM's
efforts before the Project to improve the legal and regulatory framework (with virtually no support from
donors) and to attract private mining sector investment.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)




                                                      19

The Project was not restructured and was never at risk. Given the five--extended to six--year
implementation period, the Project evolved somewhat overtime, in line with significant developments in
the sector, but the PDO remained relevant and was largely successfully achieved. Initial slow
disbursements under the Project were addressed, and the May 2004 MTR identified implementation
issues and proposed remedial actions to ensure successful Project completion.

Factors Affecting Project Implementation. Implementation challenges and issues identified during the
MTR included the need to (a) strengthen UCPM, namely to recruit an Administrative Coordinator and a
Senior Procurement Specialist; (b) closely monitor Project costs, ensure timely contribution of
counterpart funds, and reform procurement and financial management processes followed by UCPM; (c)
review implementation arrangements of the artisanal and small scale mining pilot projects; (d) take into
account the proposed restructuring of the Minerals Development Fund; and (e) consider MIREM's
request for assistance on restructuring CARBOMOC (the state-owned company previously operating in
the Moatize concession area) for capacity building in anticipation of the development of the Moatize
coking coal deposit. The MTR also focused on Project sustainability following closure, including (a) the
ability of the legal and regulatory framework to promote sustainable private sector investment in the
sector; (b) the sustainability of public mining sector institutions; (c) human resources sustainability; and
(d) financial sustainability. Factors affecting Project implementation outside of and subject to GoM's
control are discussed below.

Factors Outside of Government Control:

· Donor Responsiveness. The World Bank changed the Task Team Leader (TTL) once, around the
    time of the Project MTR, with a relatively smooth transition. For a variety of reasons the AfDB TTLs
    were changed more frequently, leading to a lack of continuity and follow through. In contrast,
    activities funded by NDF moved relatively quickly and additional activities were able to be
    effectively reviewed and added (e.g., the 1:1,000,000 map) due to efficient implementation.

· Lack of Qualified Local Suppliers. Mozambique's domestic mining industry--in terms of
    suppliers--remained relatively undeveloped over the course of the Project. Local suppliers who were
    able to service the Project often lacked the financial capacity to provide goods or works without an
    initial, upfront payment. This affected the pace of implementation, exacerbating some of the
    procurement and financial management problems discussed below.

· Exchange Rate Fluctuations. Given the multitude of activities under the Project, the Bank team
    together with the UCPM Financial Management Officer established a strong budget monitoring
    process for Project activities. However, denomination of the Credit in SDRs created difficulties in
    tracking exactly available Project funds due to exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. Dollar.
    UCPM and the Bank team took a conservative approach to managing expenditures under the Project
    to avoid overspending Project resources and put GoM in a position of having to reimburse the Bank.

Factors Subject to Government Control:

· Administration of Counterpart Funds. Under the DCA, the World Bank paid 85 percent of contract
    value while GoM paid 15 percent to vendors. While GoM met its counterpart funding obligation in
    full, in many cases there were substantial delays in suppliers receiving the 15 percent for contracts
    denominated in foreign currency again due to the bureaucratic constraints. Suppliers were aware of
    this and were to a large extent reluctant to service the Project without upfront payment. To address
    this, in some cases UCPM made upfront payments against pro forma invoices. The annual audit
    highlighted this unconventional practice and the MTR introduced actions to address it.



                                                    20

· Weak Capacity of UCPM. Lack of project management skills and familiarity with Bank procedures
    on the part of UCPM staff, particularly in regard to procurement and administration of the Special
    Account, slowed implementation in the initial stages of the Project. Difficulty in recruiting an
    experienced and competent Project Coordinator and high turnover of staff (especially competent
    procurement specialists familiar with World Bank procedures) aggravated UCPM's problems in
    executing the Project efficiently. These issues were highlighted during the MTR, with actions
    undertaken to address them. From January 2007, the UCPM functioned with a reduced staff
    complement in view of Project closure, with the well-performing Financial Management Officer
    taking on a heightened role and the Head of the Project Steering Committee, the Director of Studies
    in MIREM, taking on the Project Coordinator role.

· Procurement. Procurement represented a major challenge for Project implementation. Specific issues
    are discussed in Section 2.4.

2. 3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Project was designed in 2000/2001, before the Bank adopted the 2004 template and
guidelines for the Project Appraisal Document. Thus, the design of the results framework follows the
format used under the old Project Document System and is not as detailed as results frameworks currently
used in projects. By contrast, this Project focused on measuring specific outputs under each component,
linking Project outputs to the overarching CAS goals/outcomes of broad-based growth led by private
foreign investment; improvement in the performance and institutional capacity of government; and
enhancement of social development, including poverty reduction and HIV/AIDS awareness.

Review of M&E Design. A comprehensive review of the Project's results framework/indicators was
carried out under the Project in 2005. In line with the terms of reference for the review, recommendations
were made on developing a results framework more closely aligned with the new format. However, based
on the detailed information on progress-to-date on existing indicators gathered as part of the exercise, the
Bank task team decided that the original Project monitoring indicators remained relevant. The key
performance indicators included in the PAD were directly linked to the PDO, quantitative, and
monitorable. While there was a lack of milestones/targets against which to track progress during Project
implementation, at Project completion the key performance indicators provide a good basis against which
to judge Project achievements. That said, in the area of artisanal and small-scale mining, the Project's
focus over the course of implementation was increasingly related to the establishment of the artisanal
ceramic and gold pilot sites. Successful establishment of the sites would serve as models to improve the
lives of small-scale miners. Thus, the indicators reported on in the ICR are more closely related to the
establishment of the pilot sites than originally set out in the PAD.

M&E During Implementation. The Bank regularly undertook monitoring and evaluation over the course
of the Project during supervision missions. The Bank task team held regular meetings with MIREM/the
Project Steering Committee (including the Minister and Vice Minister), DNM, DNG, UPCM, and
Ministry of Finance (as necessary) to review the Project's implementation progress. In addition, not later
than 45 days after each quarter, UCPM was to submit to the Bank a quarterly progress report on all
Project activities, including procurement, and a financial summary report. While the reports provided
some useful information on Project implementation, the quality and timeliness of such reports varied over
the course of the Project and remained weak. The MTR (30 months after effectiveness) provided an in-
depth analysis of implementation progress, including performance on selected performance indicators. A
more complete data gathering was carried out in the context of the 2005 review of the results framework
as described above. As mentioned previously, the UCPM Financial Officer and Bank task team used a
strong budget monitoring process for resource allocation at the Project sub-component level, which also



                                                      21

served as a mechanism for tracking progress on Project achievements. The Project budget was updated
regularly and provided flexibility to adjust various subcomponent activities to fit within available funds
and in line with achievement of the PDO. In terms of strengthening DNM's and DNG's capacity for
monitoring and evaluation, the information systems that the Project helped put in place, i.e., the MIS,
mining cadastre and associated geological information and EMIS, and strengthening of the
Documentation Center, allow for enhanced tracking of data and information.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Safeguards. The Project was classified as environmental category C for safeguard purposes because of its
technical assistance nature. While Project activities did not have any direct effect on the environment, the
Project helped to further the government's capacity to deal with environmental issues in the mining sector.
As a result of the Project's Institutional Reform and Capacity Building of Public Mining Institutions
component, a well-functioning Environment Monitoring Unit within DNM was established; under the
Project's Environmental Management System component, an Environmental Management Information
System was established and linked to the cadastre so that requirements for environmental action
plans/impact assessments related to mining developments can be tracked easily. New environmental
regulations (general to mining activities and specific to artisanal mining) were also adopted under the
Project and are being implemented.

Fiduciary Compliance. As mentioned in Section 2.2, lack of project management skills and familiarity
with Bank procedures on the part of UCPM staff, particularly in regard to procurement and administration
of the Special Account, slowed implementation in the initial stages of the Project. Procurement, in
particular, posed a major challenge: In Mozambique, disbursements against contracts in foreign currency
are subject to approval of the Ministry of Finance and issuance of Boletim de Autorização de Pagamento
by the Central Bank. Due to bureaucratic and cumbersome procedures, approval of contracts often faced
substantial delays, which in turn significantly slowed Project implementation. Because of the
administrative delays experienced with contracts denominated in foreign currency, local shopping through
domestic intermediaries was used whenever possible. This led to a situation, addressed during the MTR,
in which local shopping substantially exceeded the aggregate ceilings for both Goods and Works as
provided for in the DCA. To rectify this, the Bank agreed to delete the aggregate ceilings initially
included in the DCA in favor of the adoption of, and strict adherence to, an agreed procurement plan, in
line with procurement procedures adopted by the Bank in May 2004. As mentioned above, due to lack of
resources, a few local suppliers providing equipment to the small scale and artisanal mining pilot sites
were provided upfront payments against pro forma invoices. One company in particular failed to deliver
the goods against payment received; GoM agreed immediately to refund the Special Account the requisite
amount. While various Project audits and review of fiduciary procedures by the Bank's Procurement and
Financial Management Specialists noted the fiduciary weaknesses discussed, there was no
misprocurement declared under the Project and all of the Project audit management letters were
unqualified. Despite delays, the Government met its counterpart funding obligations.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

It is expected that the operating budget for activities implemented under the Project will continue to be
provided by MIREM. In particular, MIREM has decreed that a portion of the Minerals Development Fund




                                                     22

be allocated to cover the operating budget of the mining cadastre, which is important both for sustainability
and operational independence.

MIREM expressed interest in a follow-on project, particularly to continue capacity building activities.
However, while relevant to GoM's development strategy, given competing areas of need GoM did not
choose to include mining among Bank lending operations planned under the 2007 CAS. In general, the
Bank--together with Mozambique's other donor partners--have focused heavily on GoM's agenda in
regard to service delivery (e.g., education, health, water) and building public sector capacity (e.g.,
budgeting and governance). While significant revenues from the mining sector could help to fund service
delivery programs and will affect budgeting and governance, scarce IDA resources forced selectivity in
the Bank planned interventions. That said, the Bank is likely to use regional IDA funds to support a
Southern Africa Technical Advisory Services Project. The Project, which will include Mozambique,
Malawi, and Zambia in its first phase, is modeled upon the just-in-time, expert advisory assistance
provided to GoM in the context of the Moatize coal development, and will focus on large infrastructure
projects in the Southern African region, including in the minerals sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Although limited resources and competing priorities forced selectivity in regard to the Bank's future
mining sector interventions, the Project's objective was and remains consistent with the country's
development agenda and the Bank's strategies to assist Mozambique. The Project spanned Mozambique's
development of its first and second Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA I and II),
both of which feature mining as a driver of growth. The Project was aligned with PARPA objectives
related to mining. The Project also spanned three CASs--2000 (i.e., the CAS prevailing at the time the
Project was prepared and approved); 2003 (i.e., the CAS developed during Project implementation); and
2007 (i.e., the CAS developed near Project completion). All three CASs are aligned with PARPA
objectives, and thus discuss mining in the context of growth and improving the investment climate. The
2006 CAS Progress Report included an emphasis on cross-sectoral synergies in the Bank's program,
introducing more attention to growth poles and regional integration, natural resource management, and
local development.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

The Project was successful in achieving its objective. On balance, the Project has made a significant
contribution to improving the investment climate and MIREM's capacity to promote and manage
investment and growth in Mozambique's minerals sector. The Government continues to fully own the
agenda implemented under the Project and, while additional support from donors to further reforms and
enhance capacity in the mining sector has been requested, the Government is committed to sustaining
Project activities after closure.

Impressive achievements include significant reforms to the mining legal, regulatory, and fiscal
framework; implementation of a state-of-the art, decentralized mineral license application and granting
system (cadastre); reform and strengthening of the key public mining institutions, namely DNM and
DNG; and collection and dissemination of geological data and production of up-to-date geological maps,
which are being used locally and abroad to promote minerals sector development in the country. Although
not originally planned under the Project, given the availability of the data, an updated 1:1,000,000


                                                    23

geological map of the country is being produced (via parallel funding by NDF). As a result of Project
activities, MIREM is better placed to handle the current increase in mineral investment in the country, as
evidenced by Kenmar's development of the MOMA mineral sands deposit, planned development of the
Corridor Sands titanium deposit, and CVRD's development of the Moatize coal deposit.

Achievements in each of the main areas covered by the Project are described below, with additional
details by Project component in Annex 2.

Strengthened Legal and Regulatory Framework. A new Mining Law was adopted in 2002 and updated
Tax and Mining Fiscal Laws, and an associated Model Mining Contract (drafted with Project assistance),
were adopted in 2007. New environmental regulations were adopted in 2004; regulations on the trading of
mining products and a statute on the Minerals Development Fund were adopted in 2005; and health and
safety regulations and regulations on environmental management in artisanal and small-scale mining
activities were adopted in 2006. Internationally competitive mining fiscal regulations, which accompany
the 2007 laws, have also been drafted and are expected to be adopted in early 2008.

Establishment of a Modern Mining Cadastre. A state of the art, digital mining cadastre for the
registration and granting of mineral licenses was established with Project support. A central bureau in
Maputo and four provincial bureaus (Manica, Nampula, Tete, and Zambezi) are functioning, with "on
line" communication with the central cadastral database via 3G technology supplied by Vodacom under
contract with MIREM. The cadastre is linked to geological information of concession areas (plotted using
GPS technology) as well as the EMIS, allowing for automatic tracking of required environmental
assessments/studies. The establishment of the cadastre is a success story in that it improves transparency
of the management of mineral resources, giving more confidence to investors. The cadastre has greatly
facilitated access to mineral resources by the private sector and supported the enforcement of legal rights
in the sector. Clients are served on a first-come-first-served basis, and each applicant is given a
documented number to guarantee orderly processing of the application. The cadastre has reduced average
processing time from over 130 days in 2000 to 46 in 2003.4 The number of licenses processed has
increased from 315 in 2001 to a high of 978 in 2005 (and 866 in 2006).

Institutional Reform. A study on the institutional restructuring of DNM and DNG was carried out under
the Project. Based on the study, DNM fully implemented the recommended restructuring, including the
introduction and staffing of an Environmental Monitoring Unit. DNG only partially implemented the
study's recommendations due to the sensitivity of the reforms, right sizing, and necessary skills alignment.
However, DNG geologists have benefited from on-the-job training and are now able to conduct field
sampling and analysis in line with international standards on their own. Over time, with natural attrition,
further training and selective recruitment, DNG aims to implement more of the study's recommendations
to fulfill its revised mandate more effectively.

Reform of the Minerals Development Fund. The Minerals Development Fund was restructured under a
reformed charter in July 2006, with a quasi-independent Board with term limits. The Fund receives
allocations from the Treasury based as specified under the Mining Law based on a proportion of surface
fees, royalties, and penalties levied on the mining companies. The Fund has a mandate to support the
sustainable development of small and artisanal mining; provide institutional support and funding to the
expanding network of regional mining associations; and fund the independent operation of the mining
cadastre and geological survey. Additional reforms are planned, as part of the formulation of a five-year,
strategic plan.

Investment Promotion. Investor interest in the Mozambique is strong. In 2005, 2006, and 2007, DNG
participated in local and international events promoting the country's geological information (e.g., 21st
African Geological Colloquium in Maputo in 2006, PDAC 2005 in Canada, Indaba 2005, 2006, and 2007
in South Africa). In follow-up to the institutional restructuring, DNM created an investment promotion
division within the Technical and Economic Department. With Project support, DNM commissioned an
investment promotion strategy, which includes recommendations on marketing and communications that
DNM plans to implement.

Minerals Information System/Intranet Network. The establishment of the MIS, housed in DNG, was
successfully completed. Connection to a central intranet network, linking DNM, DNG, and other MIREM
units, was postponed indefinitely due to a projected lack of funding. MIREM requested that this be
completed using excess funds available under AfDB financing.

Development of Geological Infrastructure/Documentation Center. A geophysics regional airborne
survey covered 192,441 line kilometers (about 168,189 km2), and a high density airborne survey covered
521,837 line km (about 136,218 km2). All data was delivered to DNG in digital format. The impact of
this new data has been positive, with strong demand by mining investors. Several lots of maps on various
scales were produced, including: Lot 1, 31 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 13 maps at 1:50,000 scale; Lot 2,
20 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 20 maps at 1:50,000 scale; Lot 3, 24 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 11 maps
at 1:250,000. All maps are available in digital format at the DNG Documentation Center. The updated
1:1,000,000 map is expected in March 2008. DNG collected 1,820 geochemical samples in 2005 and
2006--472 samples were analyzed and 1,348 are currently in Finland for analysis; of 11,700 historical
samples located, 1,144 have been subject to geochemical analysis in Finland. Results of the geochemical
analysis were presented at a major international conference on African geology in Maputo in July 2006,
partially supported by the Project. An industrial minerals survey was also completed under the Project.

Seismological Network. Regarding the establishment of a seismological network, parallel funding by
CGS equipped Tete, Nampula, Manica, and Changalane with modern seismological equipment, feeding
into the processing center in Maputo. MIREM purchased equipment to outfit Lichinga and re-equip
Manica in May 2007. Modernization of DNG's Documentation Centre was completed, and more then 65
percent of existing maps and reports have been scanned into the system, with scanning of the remainder
ongoing. The new digitized maps produced under the Project are also available at the Documentation
Center. The National Museum of Geology was successfully rehabilitated and has remained independent.
While AfDB's equipping of the national geological laboratory and associated training for its staff has
experienced delays, GoM remains confident that the laboratory will become operational, serving
Mozambique and possibly other countries in the region.

Environmental Management System. Environmental regulations were adopted in 2004 with Project
support. The EMIS was completed and incorporated into the mining cadastre to allow for better tracking
of required environmental action plans and impact assessments of license holders. MIREM will likely
need additional support for further dissemination of the new environmental regulations, particularly as
pertains to small-scale and artisanal miners.

Small Scale and Artisanal Mining. A new law delineating specific areas for small-scale and artisanal
mining was approved with support of the Project, as were new health and safety regulations. An
HIV/AIDS strategy for artisanal and small-scale mining was also completed and local social workers
employed by DNM are involved in implementation of the strategy's recommendations, including
sensitization programs in small-scale mining areas. Regarding the artisanal ceramic and gold pilot sites,
which became increasingly important as the course of the Project as a demonstration activity, DNM
reassessed some of the sites to chose more appropriate, higher-impact locations. While delays in the
supply of equipment were experienced, the pilots are largely complete, and associations have been formed


                                                    25

with training of operators at the sites. The table below provides information on the number of ceramic and
gold pilot sites equipped and artisans trained. The sites are expected to be sustainable. The issue of
artisanal and small-scale mining is complex and further attention in this area is needed, including through
the global Communities and Small-scale Mining (CASM) initiative. Mozambique will likely host the
international CASM conference in 2009, when it returns to Africa.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

As a technical assistance operation, no specific efficiency assessment was undertaken. However,
during the Project period, the country experienced a significant increase in foreign direct investment in
the minerals sector, including the commissioning of the MOMA beach sands deposit, and concessioning
of the Moatize coal deposit through public tender to CVRD for in excess of US$100 million. The latter
will be the country's largest ever mining investment once it is commissioned (expected in 2009).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory

As discussed in Section 3.2, the satisfactory rating is based on the fact that the PDO remained relevant
and was achieved. MIREM's capacity to promote and manage the minerals sector has been enhanced
significantly. GoM has adopted an internationally competitive mining legal and fiscal framework as well
as a transparent, rules-based, best practice mining cadastre; private sector investment in Mozambique's
minerals sector has increased; the country's geological infrastructure--including digital geological maps
and geochemical samples--has been greatly improved; an environmental management system has been
introduced; and artisanal and small scale miners have been formalized and policies to better serve them
are being implemented.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)



                                                      26

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

With CVRD's investment to develop the Moatize coal deposit, significant revenues are expected to
accrue to GoM in the future. Such revenues can be used to fund GoM's poverty reduction and social
development programs. The Moatize coal development is also expected to have significant development
impacts in the northern region of Mozambique, and also to affect Malawi and other nearby countries
given the rail, port, and power linkages. The increase in exploration activity and payments in royalties and
license fees will support the Minerals Development Fund and accelerate its efforts to develop small scale
mining and rural job creation. More immediately, the small-scale and artisanal mining pilot projects are
benefiting over 900 ceramists, 60 percent of which are women, while six artisanal gold mining
associations benefited from equipment and training under the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Institutional reform and capacity building of public mining sector institutions was a key Project goal. As
mentioned in Section 3.2, a study on the institutional restructuring of DNM and DNG was undertaken.
Recommendations related to DNM were fully implemented, resulting in five operational units within
DNM (a) Mining Cadastre, involved in licensing and registry of permits; (b) Mining Safety, working on
security and safety issues; (c) Technical and Economic Department, in charge of investment promotion
and technical and financial evaluations; (d) Small-scale Mining, providing technical assistance to artisanal
miners; and (e) Environmental Protection, responsible for overseeing implementation of the new
environmental regulations, including social impact assessments, working in close collaboration with
MICOA. While DNG only partially implemented the study's recommendations, over time, with natural
retrenchments, DNG aims to implement more of the study's recommendations.

The Project has also contributed to enhanced staff performance as a result of training. This included
training for DNM staff on the management of the mining cadastre, implementation of the environmental
and health and safety regulations, negotiations skills in the context of the Moatize development...training
for DNG geologists in collection of field samples, management of geological information (in digital
format). The refurbishment of DNG and DNM work spaces with necessary equipment (e.g., computers)
also helped to improve efficiency. Institutional reform and capacity building is a long-term activity and
additional support in this area is needed.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

During Project implementation, in 2002, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was
launched. While Mozambique is not yet a resource-rich country, the ongoing policy dialogue in the
mining sector under the Project provided a good basis for discussion around Mozambique's possible
interest in future adoption of EITI to improve transparency, revenue management and avoid the potential
consequences of the "resource curse." There were no unintended negative impacts of the Project.

                                                     27

Significant reforms in regard to the legal and regulatory framework, institutional reform; strengthening
and enhancement of the country's geological infrastructure; and formalization and support of artisanal
and small scale miners have been achieved. While GoM is expected to continue funding the institutions
and programs begun under the Project (e.g., an allocation from the Minerals Development Fund will help
sustain the independent operation the mining cadastre and management of the application and granting of
mineral licenses), without continued technical assistance to consolidate and deepen achievements under
the Project (e.g., continued capacity building of DNM/DNG staff, ensuring that the geological laboratory
becomes a world class facility), the overall sustainability of the development outcome is judged to be
moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in Project identification, preparation, and appraisal is rated satisfactory. Bank
assistance to support mining sector reform in Mozambique was based on the Mining Sector Policy
Review, a joint MIREM/World Bank report that identified priority technical assistance requirements. The
follow-on Mining Policy Dialogue Seminar helped to build consensus around the reform agenda, identify
issues to be addressed, attract the attention of potential foreign investors, and mobilize donor support.
Thus, the design process was highly responsive to GoM's sector needs and priorities. It was also aligned
with GoM's poverty reduction strategies and, in turn, the prevailing CAS. During preparation, the Bank
also responded to GoM's request for assistance by securing a PHRD Grant. The Project provided a
participatory framework, for example small-scale and artisanal miners were fully involved in Project
preparation with respect to the small-scale mining component. The Project was discussed with mining
companies and interested NGOs. No QEA for the Project was performed. Weaknesses in Project design,
which became evident during Project implementation, included an overly ambitious agenda and lack of
adequate attention to under-developed commercial environment and donor coordination in regard to the
parallel financing of activities (see lessons learned).

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory

On balance, the Bank's performance during supervision is rated satisfactory. Sufficient budget and staff
resources were allocated to supervise the Project. The Bank Project team regularly prepared aide-
memoires in follow-up to missions and alerted GoM and UCPM counterparts to implementation problems,
introducing remedial actions. The Bank acted quickly to address fiduciary management issues identified
during the MTR, and a post procurement review was conducted in January 2006 to ensure compliance
with remedial actions. That said, the Bank should have picked up on such issues much earlier.
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated Project performance, with all 13 ISRs rating both
DO and IP consistently satisfactory.




                                                      28

Good cooperation between the Bank and other Project sponsors, i.e., AfDB and NDF, existed throughout
Project implementation. However, coordination among donors could have been enhanced, and this issue
should have been addressed more explicitly in the Project design stage. Frequent changes of task team
leaders on the part of AfDB made it more difficult to track progress on AfDB-funded activities, while
good oversight by CGS and engagement by NDF saw NDF-funded components implemented relatively
efficiently.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the above, overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

As discussed, the Borrower's commitment to the Project and the reform agenda it supported was clear
from the outset. The Project was aligned with GoM's poverty reduction strategies and GoM ownership
was evidenced by participation in the Project preparatory seminars that addressed in-depth the sector
reforms to be tackled.

During implementation, both the Minister and Vice Minister of MIREM were extremely supportive of
and actively engaged in the Project and followed its progress closely. While the Minister and Directors of
DNM and DNG each changed once, respectively, during Project implementation, the transitions were
smooth and the incoming personnel were drawn from the Ministry and were very familiar with the issues.
The Project Steering Committee, created at the Ministerial level, was well organized, knowledgeable, and
responsive to the Project agenda and its implementation. The Committee met regularly to address
implementation issues. While systemic issues such as the processing of foreign-currency denominated
contracts were beyond MIREM's mandate, MIREM officials helped to facilitate when necessary and the
Committee was proactive in addressing implementation issues.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

UCPM, established within MIREM, acted as the Project Implementation Unit. It was responsible for
overall Project management and coordination and in this context handled (a) procurement, including all
contracting for goods, works, and services; (b) financial management, including the Special Account,
withdrawal applications, and payments; (c) the contractual relationship with the Bank; and (d) Project
monitoring and reporting.

The Project Coordinator was responsive in organizing meetings and facilitating exchanges between the
Bank Project team and MIREM officials. However, weaknesses in understanding of Bank procurement
procedures, high turn over of procurement staff, and broader systemic issues related to procurement in
Mozambique (e.g., bureaucratic delays related to approval of foreign-currency denominated contracts) led
to an excessive use of less competitive procurement methods, such as shopping through local
intermediaries. Since this kept disbursement rates steady, the Bank failed to pick up on this issue early on.



                                                    29

Adequate record keeping was also an issue identified during a post procurement review in 2006, although
UCPM was able to rectify this and reconstitute the necessary documentation in compliance with the
provisions of the Development Credit Agreement.

Regarding financial management, the Project accounting system was based on conventional accounting
software called FINPRO. This accounting package proved to be adequate to produce necessary reports
required to manage and monitor financial operations. However, weakness in financial management were
observed during Project implementation, including lack of regular Financial Management Reports and
deficiencies in the system of internal control (e.g., instances of payments supported by pro-forma invoices,
instances of payments processed without the requisite signatures).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

While GoM's commitment to the Project was high, based largely on weaknesses in UCPM's Project
management capabilities, overall Borrower performance is judged to be moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Key lessons learned from Project implementation included:

· Targeted, Flexible Technical Assistance Can Succeed. While technical assistance projects often fail,
    this Project was successful because it customized assistance to very specific areas and responded
    directly to a reform agenda specified by the government. The Project was also flexible enough to
    accommodate evolving circumstances, such as GoM's urgent need for assistance to respond to CVRD
    in regard to the development of the Moatize coal concession.

· Align Project Design with Implementation Capacity. While successful in achieving its objective, the
    Project was overly ambitious, particularly in regard to the amount of procurement needed to
    implement the activities. Given the country's general lack of capacity, the number of activities should
    have been limited, prioritized, or implemented using a phased approach, to better align with project
    management capacity. To help build such skills and reinforce government ownership and
    sustainability, future projects in the sector should integrate project coordination and management into
    government institutions rather than using a separate project implementation unit, although retention of
    specific skills would be a challenge.

· Take into Account Limitations in the Commercial Environment. Technical Assistance does not
    occur in a vacuum and certain limitations in the commercial environment and supply of specialized
    goods needs to be taken into account during Project design--especially in the mining sector.

· The Bank Has a Role in Promoting Good Sector Practice. Given limited human resources and often
    weak negotiations skills in many resource-rich developing countries, the Bank has an important role
    to play in helping governments use standard mining agreements rather than having to negotiate
    individual mining project agreements. This also helps increase transparency and accountability.

· Establish a Clear Understanding Regarding Fiduciary Management. While certain procurement
    issues encountered under the Project could not have been foreseen, more proactive monitoring of
    procurement activities should have been instituted from the start. Regarding financial management,



                                                       30

    the format and timing of Financial Monitoring Reports should have been agreed during Project
    preparation and their delivery strictly enforced during Project implementation.

· Donor Coordination is Key. Due to the significant amount of parallel financing for various Project
    components, the Project was effectively implemented as a set of "sub-projects" with each parallel-
    financed component implemented according to the rules of the respective funding agency. Additional
    time and effort should have been spent upfront with donor partners to agree on a more harmonized,
    integrated approach to implementation (e.g., regarding procurement, M&E, timing and pace of
    implementation).

                                   · Mining Fiscal Regulations drafted, for adoption in early 2008
A.2: Institutional Reform/Capacity A study on the institutional restructuring of DNM and DNG was carried out
     Building                      under the Project. DNM fully implemented a restructuring, while DNG
                                   only partially implemented recommendations in the study due to the
                                   sensitivity of the reforms. DNG aims to implement the reforms over time,
                                   via labor attrition, training, and alignment of skills.
A.3: Mining Cadastre and Registry  A state-of-the-art, decentralized Application and Granting of Mineral
     System                        Licenses System (mining cadastre) is operational ­ a central bureau in
                                   Maputo and four provincial bureaus (Manica, Tete, Nampula, Zambezi) are
                                   functioning, with "live" communication of the cadastral database via 3G
                                   technology supplied by Vodacom under contract with MIREM. The
                                   Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) has been
                                   integrated into the cadastre. DNM, which houses the cadastre, worked with
                                   the technical consultants to migrate the database to a larger server to ensure
                                   un-interrupted functioning of the system.
A.4: Investment Promotion          In 2005, 2006, and 2007, DNG participated in local and international
                                   events promoting the geological information of the country (e.g., 21st
                                   African Geological Colloquium in Maputo 2006, PDAC 2005 in Canada,
                                   Indaba 2005, 2006, and 2007 in South Africa).
A.5: Intranet Network              The intranet network was not installed under the World Bank component
                                   due to fear of insufficient funds. GoM has requested that the intranet
                                   network be implemented using available funds under the AfDB component.
Component 2. Development of the Country's Geological Infrastructure
B. 1: Component Supervision and    The Council for Geosciences of South Africa ably carried out supervision
     Coordination                  of this component, coordinating the different consulting firms and
                                   contractors to undertake the activities involved.
B.2: Geophysics Airborne Survey    Regional airborne survey covered 192,441 line km (about 168,189km2);
     (parallel financing by NDF)   high density airborne survey covered 521,837 line km (about 136,218km2).
                                   The program was successfully concluded. All data was delivered to DNG
                                   in digital format including the Final Report. The impact of this new data is
                                   positive, and there is much demand for it by mining investors.

B.3: Geological Mapping of        Mapping undertaken resulted in several lots of maps on various scales
     Mozambique (parallel         being produced: Lot 1: 31 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 13 maps at 1:50,000
     financing by NDF)            scale; Lot 2: 20 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 20 maps at 1:50,000 scale; Lot
                                  3: 24 maps at 1:250,000 scale and 11 maps at 1:250,000. All maps are
                                  available in digital format at the DNG Documentation Center. An updated
                                  1:1,000,000 map is expected by March 2008.
B.4: Geochemical Sampling         DNG collected 1,820 samples in 2005 and 2006. 472 samples were
     (parallel financing by AfDB) analyzed, and 1,348 are currently in Finland for analysis. 1,144 historical
                                  samples (collected by Hunting) have also been subject to geochemical
                                  analysis. The results of the geochemical analyses were presented at the 21st
                                  Colloquium on African Geology in Maputo in July 2006.
B.5: Seismological network        Parallel funding by CGS equipped Tete, Nampula, Manica, and Changalane
     (parallel financing by       with modern seismological equipment, feeding into the processing center in
     Government of Mozambique,    Maputo. MIREM purchased equipment to outfit Lichinga and re-equip
     CGS)                         Manica in May 2007.
B.6: Documentation Center         Modernization of the Documentation Centre was completed. More then 65
     (parallel financing by AfDB) percent of existing maps and reports have been scanned into the system,
                                  and scanning to complete the remainder is ongoing. New digitized maps
                                  produced under the Project are also available at the Documentation Center.
B.7: Minerals Information System  The establishment of the MIS was successfully completed at DNG. DNG's
     (parallel financing by       web site/home page is partially functional. The system is still functioning
     AfDB )                       partially due to configuration. The effort is being done to complete the
                                  configuration to allow the system to hold more information.
B.8: Industrial Minerals Survey   The field work for the industial mineral survey was carried out in 2005 and
     (parallel financing by NDF)  2006, and a report with final results was submitted to DNG. Associated
                                  raining of DNG staff was completed with good results, however more
                                  extensive field work training would be desirable.
B.9: National Museum of Geology   The National Museum of Geology was successfully rehabilitated. It has
                                  remained independent and is functioning well.
B.10: Reinforcement of DNG's      Supply of equipment for the lab experienced delays. AfDB extended this
     Central Laboratory (parallel Project sub-component through December 2007, which allowed for
     financing by AfDB)           delivery and installation of basic equipment for the lab including for
                                  chemical analyses, mineralogical determinations, and basic sample
                                  preparation/preliminary studies of geological samples.
Component 3.                      Environmental regulations were produced and approved during the Project.
Environment Management            The EMIS was completed and incorporated into the mining cadastre (by
System                            Spatial Dimension of South Africa) to allow for better tracking of required
                                  environmental action/management plans and environmental impact
                                  assessments of license holders.
Component 4.                      A new law delineating specific areas for small-scale and artisanal mining
Sustainability of Small Scale and was approved during the Project, as were new health and safety regulations.
Artisanal Mining                  An HIV/AIDS strategy for artisanal and small-scale mining was also
                                  completed and local social workers on the ground carry out educational
                                  programs to implement its recommendations (MIREM should pursue
                                  longer-term funding with the national HIV/AIDS agency). While delays in
                                  the supply of equipment for the ceramic and gold pilot artisanal mining
                                  sites were experienced, the sites are nearly all complete. Regarding the
                                  ceramic pilots, 12 sites in four Provinces were equipped, including with
                                  kilns. In Gaza province, this included two sites for associations of
                                  Macupulane, one site in Chibuto, and once site in Xai-Xai; two units were
                                  established in the Province of Inhambane; three ovens were established in
                                  the Province of Maputo, and three in Province of Cabo Delgado (two in
                                  Muitimbe and one in Meluco). For these sites, 50 people have been trained
                                  in pottery, 20 of which were women. In addition, there are over 900
                                  ceramists in the areas surrounding the sites who have benefited from direct



                                                    34

                          support from the Project, 60 percent of which are women. Regarding the
                          gold pilots, three associations in Manica Province (Munhena, Mimosa and
                          Bandire) benefited from support, including a processing plant in Munhena.
                          Together among these sites, 60 association operators were trained, 10 of
                          them women. The associations of Jagoma and Muva in Nampula Province
                          and the association of Namunono in Zambezi Province were also supported
                          with equipment. Thirty mining operations were trained. The pilots are
                          expected to be sustainable.
Component E.              The Project Implementation Unit, UCPM, within MIREM was responsible
Project Man5gement and    for overall Project management and coordination, including (a)
Coordination              procurement; (b) financial management; (c) the contractual relationship
                          with the Bank; and (d) Project monitoring and reporting. While the Project
                          Coordinator was responsive in organizing meetings and facilitating
                          exchanges between the Bank Project team and MIREM officials,
                          weaknesses in understanding of Bank procurement procedures, high turn
                          over of procurement staff, and broader systemic issues related to
                          procurement in Mozambique (e.g., bureaucratic delays related to approval
                          of foreign-currency denominated contracts) led to an excessive use of less
                          competitive procurement methods, such as shopping through local
                          intermediaries. The Project MTR picked up on the issue and introduced
                          actions to address it. Adequate record keeping was also an issue identified
                          during a post procurement review in 2006, although UCPM was able to
                          rectify this and reconstitute the necessary documentation. All Project audits
                          were unqualified, although weaknesses in financial management, including
                          lack of regular Financial Management Reports and deficiencies in the
                          system of internal control (e.g., instances of payments supported by pro-
                          forma invoices, instances of payments processed without the requisite
                          signatures), were observed under the Project. From January 2007 to Project
                          close, UCPM functioned with a reduced staff complement in view of
                          Project closure.

MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT (MRMP)
          IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR) ­ OCTOBER 2007


A.       Institutional Reform and Strengthening of Institutional Capacity

The Institutional Reform and Strengthening of Institutional Capacity component was developed to
modernise the legislation and strengthen institutional capacity in terms of control and application of the
laws, provision of efficient support service provision to mining communities and development of
favourable environment to private sector investment to the sector.

This component includes five sub-components: (A.1) Modernisation of the legislation; (A.2) Institutional
reform and capacity strengthening; (A.3) Mining cadastre and registration system; (A.4) Promotion of
investments; and (A.5) Extranet Intranet, to improve the flow of information within MIREM and to the
different stakeholders of the sector.

A.1     Modernisation of the Legislation

This component was fulfilled satisfactorily. The initial work consisted in the carrying out of two seminars
on political dialogue in Maputo and Nampula, where consensus was reached with the different
stakeholders of the sector on the intention of the legislation reform supposed to be carried out. Central and
local Government, the private sector, small-scale mining operators and the communities supported the
reform, thus allowing the setting of the basis for the reformulation and approval of the new legislative
package for the sector, which included:

    -   Approval of the new Mining Law (nr.14/2002) of 26 June 2002;
    -   Regulation approved by Decre nr. 62/2006, of 26 of December;
    -   Environmental Regulation applicable to Mining Activity, approved by Decree nr. 26/2004, of 20
        August;
    -    Regulation for Technical Safety and Health for Geological and Mining Activities, approved by
        Decree nr. 61/2006, of 26 December;
    -    Regulation for the trading of Mining Products, approved by Decree nr. 16/2005 of 24 June;
    -   Statute for the Mining Development Fund, approved by Decree nr. 17/2005, of 24 June;
    -   Law nr.12 /2007, of 27 June, Tax Law Specially focused on the Mining Activity;
    -   Law nr.13 /2007, of 27 June, Law of the Fiscal Incentives Regime for the Mining and Petroleum
        areas;
    -   Ministerial Diploma nr.189/2006, of 14 December, approving the Basic Norms of Environmental
        Management for Artisanal Mining Activity;
    -   A new Contract Model was designed
    Except for the brochures on Mining Legislation, the activities planned for this component were all
    carried out, the legslation was disseminated country-wide, it is an on-going process, and supposed to
    reach the bottom level: the Aministrative Posts and communities.




                                                    40

A.2      Institutional Capacity Building

    i)        Adjustment and Implementation of the New Model
The aim was to adjust the structure to the geological-mining policy and to the dynamics of economic
development, where the Government plays the role of legislator and promoter, leaving the productive
activities in the hands of the private sector.

The general guidelines of the mandate and the structure to be implemented had already been defined
during preparation of the project. An instittional auditing to the National Directorate of Mines and
Provincial Directorates was carried out by an external auditing company, to adjust the structure to the new
challenges. A new structure was designed and implemented at the National Directorate of Mines, and it
entails two new units, namely the Cadastre Department and the Environment Department.

The consultant service concluded that DNM is complying with its mandate and role, despite the financial
and staff limitations. A major difficulty found was the lack of staff training in specific areas of the mining
industry. The auditing recommended the recruitment and training of staff. Regarding recruitment, new
personnel were recruited within the budgetary limitations, and the training of staff is being carried out in
the different sub-projects. It is an on-going project, within the budgetary limits.

Auditing at the Provincial Directorates concluded that there was a stressed disparity of skills (mining,
geology and energy) and need for training Provincial Directorates in terms of administration and
leadership, in order to facilitate the integration of the different sectors under its responsibility.

ii)      Infrastructures of the programme

Together with the implementation of the new model, the premises were improved and office and field
equipment were provided for, and vehicles were purchased to support field activities.

a) Improvement of Premises

In this sub-component, premises were improved to accomodate new units at the National Directorate of
Mines and Provincial Directorates of Tete, Zambezia and Nampula, were the mining cadastre sectors
were created.

b) Equipment

Equipments to be purchased within the institutional infrastructure programme included: i) computers and
office equipment; ii) equipment for geological fieldwork and duties of the department of mining safety;
iii) 4X4 vehicles for DNG, DNM and Provincial Directorates; iv) laboratory equipment for mining
premises at Provincial Directorates.

Vehicles, office furniture and office equipment were purchased. In general, the ergonomic working
conditions improved considerably the visible changes of commodity and work environment.

A.3 Mining Cadastre and Registration.

The establishment of a well-organised, mainstreamed and interactive mining cadastre constitutes a high
priority objective for the policy of the sector. A reliable and transparent mining cadastre represents an
essential component for the promotion of investments.




                                                     41

The Mining Cadastre sub-component progressed with some satisfaction. The main achievements of this
sub-component include:

Supervision
An international consultancy company was hired to assist DNM in the supervision of the works that
integrated the sub-component. It was essential to assure the timely coordination of all tasks for the control
of quality of the different consultancy compamies that were hired.

Validation and Codification of Existing Mining Titles

Before the implementation of the new Cadastre and Registration System, the validation and
transformation of all existing titles into the new cadastre rules was carried out. A new codification was
simultaneously designed. The implementation of the new Cadastre initiated in March 2003 with the pre-
cadastre team, under the supervision of the consultant, and the transformation of all existing titles into the
new codification was completed in July 2004.

Geodesic Network

Within the framework of the process of creation of the new cadastre system, the whole geodesic network
of Mozambique was reviewed. The network was constructed by 750 points at a common distance of 30
Kms and a rough precision of 10 meters which, unfortunately, was not compatible with the GPS
technology

The correct and precise use of the GPS technology for the positioning of the mining licenses required the
availability of a transformation algorythm, to avoid positioning errors. For the review of the whole
geodesic network of Mozambique, the services of DINAGECA were hired, and they worked in 2002. the
transformation software was designed later on and it is available in the form of a CD ROM.

Implementation of the New Cadastre System

The implementation of the new computerised cadastre system was successful. The Swedish Geological
(Sweden) ­ Spatial Dimension (South Africa) consortium was in charge of the works, which initiated in
September 2003. The consortium provided office and computer equipment and training for the
technicians working at the Mining Cadastre in Maputo and at selected provincial directorates, in order to
accommodate regional cadastres, namely Manica, Nampula, Tete and Zambezia.

The overall evaluation is that the cadastre system achieved the established objectives, i) the overlapping
of titles were reduced to insignificance ii) there has been a reduction in the timeframe for the processing
of mining titles, iii) regarding the success of the project as a whole, the number of applications for mining
titles increased considerably; and iv) the collected land tax increased.

The Arc GIS system, initially installed for the management of mining titles, has become inefficient with
the increase in the number of titles and users of the system, having the consultant altered it to SQL server.

A.4      Promotion of Investment

Promotion of private investment in the mining sector is the prime objective of the Project, therefore the
efforts made to strengthen the capacity of promotion of the institution, including the establishment of a
sector for the promotion of investment in DNM's Department of Mining Technology and Economy.




                                                    42

DNM has implemented most of the recommendations of the institutional auditing and has created a sector
for the promotion of investment in the Technical and Economic Department, according to the adjusted
model. The investment promotion unit has been providing its assistance in the preparation of printing
material for exhibition at events such as Indaba, PDAC, and other mining events.

Despite the substantial contribution towards promotion of investment, efforts must be made to improve
the limited capacity of the sector due to lack of training of its staff in terms of promotion and
communication strategy.

To assist DNM in designing the promotion and communication strategy , as well as training of staff in the
preparation of promotion material, a local company was hired and has already submitted the diagnostic
and strategy reports.

The project funded DNM's participation in various events of promotion of investment within and outside
the country, which increase the exposure and dissemination of the geological-mining potential of the
country and dissemination of the services provided by the institution to its clients.

A.5     Intranet Network

The Project previewed the establishment of various information systems (Mining Cadastre System (MCS),
Mining Information System (MIS) and the Environmental Management Information System (EMIS) to
guaranttee the formal collection, storage and recovery of technical information. However, these
information systems will form independent chains under the responsibility of different technical units.
The link to a central network was not carried out as planned.

The plan for the design and installation of the intra /extranet network to improve the flow of information
between the Ministry of Mineral Resources, the National Directorates, the Provincial Directorates, and
other related Ministries and Institutions in Maputo, was not implemented as planned. Nevertheless,
different computer equipment were purchased and a provisional network was installed.

In 2003, proposals for the installation of the intra/extranet network were submitted and evaluated. "No
objection" approval by the World Bank had been planned to take place by the end of the first semestre of
2004.

B. GEOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMME (GIP)

The mining policy of the Government of Mozambique focuses on the promotion of private investments to
develop the mining sector, based on a favorable geological environment and mining potential of the
country. As part of this policy, the Ministry of Mineral Resources, MIREM, through the National
Directorate of Geology (DNG), developed the geoscientific infrastructure of the country in support of
mining investments promotion, and the sustainable social and economic development of the country. The
availability of basic geological information is an important parameter to promote investments as well as
an essential tool for the planning of the construction of infrastructures and for natural disasters mitigation.

B.1 Airborne geophysical survey

Mozambique has made a great effort to develop the basic geoscientific infrastructure of the country. In
2001, the Government of Mozambique, in cooperation with the World Bank, the Nordic Development
Fund, the African Development Bank and the South African Government with the aims of developing the
following programmes:



                                                    43

    · Basic geological mapping programmes at 1:250 000 covering the total surface of Mozambique
        and 1:50 000 for selected mineral potential areas;
    · Regional and High Density (in selected areas) Airborne Geophysical Surveys;
    · Rehabilitation of the seismological network of Mozambique;
    · Geochemical and industrial mineral survey;
    · Modernization of the Documentation Centre (DC) and Establishment of the Mineral Information
        System (MIS);
    · Refurbishment of the National Geological Laboratory; and
    · Institucional Reform.

Training of the staff of the MIREM formed a central and very important part of the project to ensure that
all the new achievements are sustainable managed and systems were operated correctly and used to
maximum advantage. During the phase of implementation of the project the training programme was
developed in the field work and also at the headquarters of the consultants involved in the implementation
of the sub-component of the GIP listed above.

The Project Design fully met the Government objectives to respond to the needs of the private
investments to develop de mining sector of the country with the minimum risk. During the
implementation of the project we got useful experience such as contract negotiations, experience in large
projects design and management, experience in dealing with consultants from different backgrounds,
relationship with Mineral Resources Coordinating Unit in terms of project management and the major
lesson was the experience gathered by most of the staff along the project. The establishment of the
Mineral Resources Coordinating Unity (UCPM) and the Steering Committee which represented a strong
team to guarantee the successful management and implementation of the Objectives of the Project is
important aspect to mention.

B.2 Basic geological mapping programmes at 1:250 000 covering the total surface of Mozambique
and 1:50 000 for selected potential areas

The main achievements of the mapping projects are:
  · A complete set of topographical maps on a scale of 1:250 000 and data set of recent satellite images
      is now available for the whole country. The topographical map sheets have been specially prepared
      from digitally data and corrected throughout the project so that the final products are much more
      accurate than any other existing maps.
  · A complete set of aerial photographs which forms the basis of any mapping program is available at
      the DNG future use.
  · A complete set of new and modern geological maps at a scale of 1 : 250 000, covering the whole
      country. The geological maps are based on the latest available satellite images, new geophysical
      data and modern geological mapping methods, and are based on a lithostratigraphic classification.
      Furthermore the data is seamless in the sense that a single legend can be applied to the whole
      coverage, which is an exceptional achievement in geological terms. A set of detailed explanations
      that accompany the geological maps, were also published.
  · Detailed geological maps on a scale of 1 : 50 000 of selected areas with a high potential for mineral
      resources.
  · New geochronological ages, of which the results have been integrated with the geological mapping
      were determined and integrated in Mineral Information System, MIS. This aspect has made a
      significant contribution to the state of geological knowledge in Mozambique.
  · A new stratigraphic classification has been designed for the geology of Mozambique. This
      classification is in line with modern international accepted methods and concepts of stratigraphy,
      and make use of a lithostratigraphic basis, which is well suited for mapping and further



                                                   44

        interpretation. In addition, many stratigraphic units in Mozambique have now been properly named,
        a type area identified and properly described in detail, according to the newly created stratigraphic
        code for Mozambique. In the case of sedimentary and volcanic successions, lithostratigraphic units
        are further described by means of stratigraphic sections.
   · During the last phase of the program in July 2006 an International Conference on African Geology
        took place in Maputo. The meeting was partially sponsored by this project, via the World Bank.
        The conference was well attended by scientists from throughout the world. All the consultants who
        participating in the project made use of the opportunity to deliver papers as well as exhibit posters
        on aspects of the geology of Mozambique, from results obtained during the project.

 Regional and High Density Airborne Geophysical Surveys

 · Compilation and digitization of 273,000 line km of analogue airborne geophysical data over northern
      Mozambique. It was done the acquisition of 157 000 line km of total magnetic field and gamma-ray
      spectrometric data flown at 100 m a.g.l., from flight lines with a 1000m spacing. It was also carried
      out the acquisition of a high density survey consisted of a detailed airborne geophysical (magnetic
      and gamma-ray spectrometric) survey (300m flight line spacing) over areas of high mineral potential
      in northern Mozambique. This data is of very high quality and has been particular useful during
      geological mapping. It can potentially contribute enormously towards mineral exploration.
      Complementary expansion of the existing regional surveys (1 km flight line spacing) in the
      northeastern part of Mozambique, to cover gaps in previous regional geophysical data, was also done.
 · 75% of the country is covered with digital geophysical data of high international standard.

The demand for this new data from mining and exploration companies has been excellent. The
availability of quality data and the parallel world-wide increase in the demand for raw materials has
contributed to a significant increase in the number of new mining licenses.

 B.3 Geochemical mapping

 Capturing datasets of important previous geochemical surveys and reworking it into a format that is
 compatible with the MIS system.

 New geochemical surveys in economically important part of the country was carried out, some gold
 anomalies were identified. The follow-up soil sample survey confirmed the occurrence of gold anomalies.
      · The collection and reanalysis of old samples, it was managed to locate two major sets of samples,
          in total about 11 700 historic samples were located. Of these 1144 samples were reanalyzed for
          gold, palladium and Te, mostly from the Hunting survey in the northwest of Mozambique. The
          result of the analyses showed gold values below the results of previous studies, which implies that
          the methods of sampling used in previous studies must be carefully studied, and could potentially
          be questioned. However, the results in certain areas are still promising enough to warrant further
          work by exploration companies.
      · The results of the geochemical survey were presented during the 21st Colloquium on African
          Geology, held in Maputo in July 2006.
      · Training has been very intensive and can be considered as very successful, probably because it
          managed to combine a theoretical background to practical experience and allowed the trainees to
          operate independently by the end of the project. Two geochemists can operate as project leaders
          in geochemical sampling programs and train their own staff.




                                                    45

B.4 Rehabilitation of the seismological network of Mozambique

    · Three stand-alone digital seismographs were installed at stations in Nampula, Tete and Changalane.
       The equipment consists of 16-bit EARS event recorders developed in-house by the Council for
       Geoscience (CGS). Data are automatically archived at the stations onto zip drive. Each station was
       recording short-period, vertical ground motion.
    · Changalane is now equipped with broad band 24-bit, installed by Africa Array programme, Manica
       and Lichinga are equipped with 24-bit station but not broad band which transmit continuously data
       to processing centre in Maputo. The Government of Mozambique funded the installation of these
       modern seismological equipment.
    · A processing facility consisting of a PC, printer and analysis software was installed in Maputo in
       June 2006. For Processing Centre 6 Analysts were trained in Maputo as well as at the CGS.
       Through this Centre the magnitude and geographical coordinates of epicenters of the seismic events
       can be determined.

  B.5 Documentation Centre

  It was organized, categorized, catalogued, and scanned into digital form all the documents, papers and
  maps within the DNG into a single management system or database which is fully capable of
  communicating with internal and external systems, including over the Internet, and which is fully
  compatible with the parallel development of the Minerals Information System (MIS)
     · Provide government and the general public instant access to the DNG documents, including via
         the Internet. Supply and install the PANGIS MS-Access bibliographic database and migrate all
         currently captured data to the new system. The bibliographic database is fully Web-compatible
         and it is incorporated into the DNG Website, in order to make the bibliographic data available.
     · DNG web page, containing metadata on the spatial data and attribute data in the MIS, is
         functioning disseminating information via the Internet. This will form a major step towards the
         distribution of information to the various stakeholders in Mozambique and abroad, and the
         promotion of investments opportunities in the mining sector.

B.6 Mineral Information System (MIS)

       · It was categorised, catalogued, digitised, unified and integrated the results from mineral
           exploration and mining projects, both from the Government and private sector, into a GIS
           environment under a single management system and to import additional relevant datasets,
           including topography, geophysical data, geology, satellite imagery etc.
       · The MIS provides Government with instant access to a readily accessible, consistent and up to
           date set of data for information and planning purposes
       · The MIS encourages the public access to the system via the Internet and promotes knowledge
           of the country's mineral deposits and mineral potential.

  B.7 Industrial Mineral survey

  · The programme captured 300 deposits and occurrences, 117 of them were visited in a follow-up
     survey.
  · It was carried out laboratory studies on 114 samples from the above mentioned deposits by means of
     chemical and microprobe analyses, XRD determinations, particle size analyses (sand, kaolin) and
     brightness (for kaolin).
  · A total of 18 new thin sections have been studied from carbonate/carbonatite occurrences.




                                                   46

· The training component was very successful, with the DNG staff trained to compile and assess the
    data themselves. Generally the technicians already had basic knowledge and adjusted easily to the
    program.
· Field guide for Industrial Mineral surveys was compiled.
· The project has a major impact on the construction materials including road aggregate.
· A good index for the various development corridors in terms of the availability and need for specific
    material such as road aggregate, clay (brick clay), cement, sand and gravel was compiled
· In terms of road aggregate it was found that the Karroo rhyolites are well suited for this purpose and
    was well used, especially since it occurs near the largest development area around Maputo and in
    Gaza. In the Beira Corridor area, and in the Provinces of Manica, Tete, Zambezia, Nampula and
    Niassa there is adequate material but in the Cabo Delgad oare and Inhambane areas/provinces there is
    a lack of proper sources which need addressing.

In terms of brick clay it was found that there are many resources being used. However, the quality is
generally very inconsistent and is usually fuelled by firewood which contributes to environmental
problems.

B.8 National Museum of Geology

The National Geological Museum is an important tool in the education of the general public, especially
on school level.
    · The Museum was successful renovated. In addition the final renovations included a better
        security system and additional storage space for the specimens that are not exhibited.
    · The database to catalogue all the various specimens was installed and trained staff of the Museum
        in the use of it.
    · The staff of Museum received training in collection and data management so that it is prepared to
        run accordingly the institution.

The Museum promotes the mineral potential of the country not only through exhibitions in the Museum
but also develops gemological exhibitions/fairs.

B.9 DNG Central laboratory

    · Part of the basic equipment for laboratory for chemical analyses and mineralogical determinations
        was installed and ready to be used (XRF and XRD) as well as the equipment for basic sample
        preparation and preliminary studies of geological samples is also ready to be utilized.
    · The DNG posses a well-trained staff on all levels for carrying out analytical work responding to
        international standards. The staff has received extensive training in Finland, Tanzania, Brazil and
        South Africa. Services which can be offered to in-house customers and outside paying customers
        are already viable.

C.      Environment Management System

According to its plan of activities, this sub-component should include i) the carrying out of environmental
and social studies of the mining sector; ii) Pilot studies, instittional capacity building of the Environment
Department and development of participatory procedures; iii) Environment Management Information
System (EMIS); and iv) supervision.

C.1      Environmental and Social Evaluation

The environmental and social auditing was the first task to be carried out within component C, aimed at
making a global diagnosis of the environmental conditions and social impacts of mining activity, in order
to identify strategic priorities for environmental management in the mining sector.

The priorities identified would then be used for the planning of project activities in the environment
component and measures could be taken to mitigate the main problems or deficiencies of the
environmental control of former mines.

The environmental auditing was carried out by the Swedish consortium and the Mozambican company
Impacto during 2003. The report was submitted in December 2003 with recommendations for the
development of environmental management capacity and strengthening of the institutional capacity of the
Environment Department and Provincial Directorates through assistance, training and provision of field
equipment.

The consultant recommended various activities to be carried out to provide the Department with
fieldwork experience and training for DNM and DIPREMEs staff.

1. Execution of environmental auditings in former mines (Mundonguara mine - copper, Mavita Mine -
asbestos, Moatize coal mine).

2. Monitoring of basic conditions within the existing mining areas, with emphasis on land water quality,
flora and fauna.

3. Carry out baseline studies in regions where future Mines and ecological sensitivity areas, among others,
are to be installed.

In the first semestre of 2007, the environmental management system EMIS/SIGA linked to a mining
cadastre database was installed at DNM. The department was equipped with computer materials to help
fulfilling the mandate; the technicians benefitted from training extensive to DIPREMs technicians.

D.       Sustainability of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining

The aim is to guarantee the sustainable development of small-scale and artisanal mining exploration
(creation of economic and social conditions to guarantee environment protection, health and technical
safety)

D.1      Baseline Studies

This activity initiated prior to the approval of funding for the project. DNM carried out the first baseline
study on small-scale and artisanal mining for the characterisation and identification of areas for pilot
projects to assist operators in environmentally healthy and sustainable production techniques in the
provinces of Manica, Tete, Nampula and Niassa in 2003. The second study was carried out in 2003 in the
provinces of Zambezia and Cabo Delgado by the consortium CSA Group and MEPC.

The studies recommended:

- Review of the Mining Law and respective Regulation in terms of small-scale and artisanal mining
regarding its practices and develop a more inclusive policy for this sector of activity.



                                                   48

- Establish a participatory training programme to include DNM and DIPREMEs staff and artisanal miners
in issues concerning mining, health and hygiene and technical safety, with visits to various mining
operations to provide technical advice, support services and guidance to the miners.

The scope of the CSA work included the identification and design of an integrated pilot project focused
on improving mining techniques and mineral processing with appropriate technology, environment
protection, dissemination of information related to the equipment and demonstration of alternative
technologies. The pilot project would be executed as part of the next sub-component.

D.2     Pilot Projects

Based on the results of the study the following areas were proposed for the pilot projects: Namunanono,
near Mutala, in the Province of Zambezia; Munhena, in the District of Manica, Province of Manica; and
Morrupula, in the Province of Nampula.

Among these provinces, the Province of Manica was chosen for the implementation of the gold pilot
projects.

D.3     Health Sensitisation for Mining Sector Operators

Sensitisation camppaigns to raise awareness among the population towards HIV/AIDS and occupational
health care in artisanal and small-scale mining areas are being carried out as part of this sub-component.
The company Austral Consultoria was responsible for the design of the HIV/AIDS strategy and the
contract was adjudicated in mid-2004.

D.4     Supervision

Having into account the highly specialised content of the activities of this sub-component, the project
implementation plan previewed the recruitment of an expert in social studies and technical assistance to
artisanal miners as supervisor. It was in this context that Mr. Joachim Bayah, an expert in small-scale
mining, was hired for the supervision of the component. He provided important contribution in the
guidance of the project.

INSTITUTIONAL REFORM

Part of the recommendations from auditors to DNG was implemented among them the establishment of
the new structure in 2002 with introduction of the new Department of Applied Geology and Geo-hazard.
Some staff was transferred to other institutions of the MIREM in the context of the staff reduction. The
professional quality of the DNG staff improved significantly, consequently the quality of produced
geological information. The main advantage gained by institutional reform is the identification of specific
personnel allocated to specific functions.

EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE WORLD BANK AND OTHER DONORS

During the implementation of the Project regular Banks missions have been conducted, reviewing the
ongoing and future activities and we deeply appreciate the support provided by all TTL (the Nordic
Development Fund (NDF), the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank during the
mission towards achieving the Project goals. We also would like to underline the important role played by
the Council for Geoscience of South Africa in supervising all the components of the Geological
Infrastructure Programme listed above.



                                                  49

Some constraints were found during the life of the Project among them:
     · Constant changes of TTL, specially the AfDB;
     · Communications problems;
     · Delay in giving NO OBJECTION, consequently disbursement;
     · Lack of fund for implementation of some of the programmed components of the Project;
     · General biggest problems in this program was the timing of events. The program/project schedule
        was very tight with very little room for maneuvering

EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONSULTANTS INVOLVED IN MAPPING
PROGRAMME

This is the first experience of the country involving more then one consultant in the mapping. Although
the success of the mapping programme some constraints were encountered:
       · Language communication with Mozambican geologists;
       · Little time for consultants to transmit their experience accordingly to Mozambicans;
       · Correlation of the geology in the border of the areas mapped by different consultants;
       · Use of the same nomenclature for same geological formations; and
       · Different format of the final products, maps and reports.

The death of Dr Erik Hammerback in April 2006, brought serious constraints in the management of the
Project in terms of the supervision programme by CGS.

It is our pleasure to say that we appreciate the support and the effort of the World Bank extends to the
Government of Republic of Mozambique. We are convinced the World Bank will continue to be reliable
partner on a long-term based and will support the forthcoming programmes.
