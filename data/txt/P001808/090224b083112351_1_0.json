However, in 2001, the impact of mining on\n            the economy was hardly noticeable - representing less than 1\n            percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 2\n            percent of exports. In addition, the ministry of mineral\n            resources estimated that about 10 million dollars in gold\n            and 30-40 million dollars in semi-precious stones were\n            illegally exported from Mozambique each year. As a result,\n            the country seemed to be missing out on a great opportunity\n            to expand its economy, create jobs, and reduce poverty. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) - financed\n            mineral resources management capacity building project was\n            launched in 2001 to improve the institutional capacities in\n            Mozambique\u2019s mining sector. As a result of this investment,\n            mineral exports are set to skyrocket: from approximately\n            United States (U.S.) 6 million dollars in average annual\n            mineral exports from 2002-2006, to the promise of more than\n            U.S. 1 billion dollar annually with the new Moatize coal\n            mine, under construction since March 2009. As part of this\n            effort, IDA sponsored the resources industries corporate\n            social responsibility discussion aimed at enhancing the\n            development impact of resource industries through the\n            effective use of its revenues and investments in corporate\n            social responsibility."}, "docdt": "2009-08-29T03:11:02Z"}
