 handling. It will significantly raise smallholder incomes\n            and increase Tanzania's foreign exchange earnings.\n            Specifically, the project will finance bulking bags,\n            grading/baling centers, marketing centers, vehicles and\n            related maintenance equipment, storage warehouses and\n            ancillary facilities, and incremental staff and technical\n            assistance for TAT. The project faces no special risk. While\n            implementation could proceed at a slower rate than\n            anticipated as a result of institutional deficiencies, this\n            risk has been minimized through the provision of technical assistance."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
