project sustainability is considered likely. The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory. These were some of the lessons\n            learned: 1) This project which has served as a bridge loan\n            between the ASIL and the Water Sector Investment Project on\n            the one hand, and the Research and Extension Project and the\n            Agricultural Support Services Project. It was useful in\n            maintaining the momentum and progress achieved under the\n            earlier projects. Operations completed under previous\n            projects proved to be instrumental for the successful\n            implementation of the new project. 2) The project benefited\n            from a high level of commitment - both from the Bank as well\n            as the Borrower and which were in tune with the major\n            objectives of the CAS. This was underpinned by a robust\n            policy dialogue and solid analytical work. These have been\n            crucial to the project's success. The Bank's\n            readiness to adjust implementation arrangements to changing\n            circumstances and needs were also instrumental for the\n            project's successful implementation. 3) The\n            institutional development impact insofar as the creation and\n            strengthening of water users associations (GICs) has been\n            substantial albeit with significant variability in the\n            quality of the GICs. There is still a long way to go before\n            the GICs can be truly considered autonomous and\n            well-functioning. 4) The presentation of the environmental\n            management plan (EMP) to the concerned technical departments\n            during the appraisal of the project would have been useful\n            in sensitizing the various stakeholders regarding the\n            environmental aspects of the various investments. This would\n            have facilitated a more systematic approach to the\n            implementation of mitigation measures as well as perhaps\n            accelerated the adoption of the integrated terms of\n            reference for the creation of new irrigation perimeters. 5)\n            The underutilization of the hydraulic infrastructure and the\n            finding that irrigated farmers behave like rainfed farmers\n            (choice of cereals and forage; low diversification) has\n            underscored the need for actions on several fronts to ensure\n            that the economic benefits are justified. There needs to be\n            an improvement in the quality and delivery of the irrigation\n            service as also a need for intensification of technical\n            advice provided to farmers on crop choice and farming\n            practices. The lack of diversification into high-value crops\n            indicates the need for the improvement of the marketing and\n            commercialization networks, and the incentives system which\n            through tariffs and other mechanisms favors production of\n            lower value import substituting crops, particularly cereals,\n            over higher value export crops which also face restrictions\n            in overseas markets. 6) The progressive decentralization of\n            research activities has improved the linkages between\n            research and extension. CRDAs farmers and extension agents\n            participate in the research committees and during\n            information days. However, there is still a need for a more\n            collaborative arrangement between AVFA and IRESA to ensure\n            that new and relevant messages are being delivered to the end-users."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
