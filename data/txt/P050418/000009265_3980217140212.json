responsiveness to\n            user demand for agricultural research, extension and\n            training.  The project has four components.  First,\n            small-scale irrigation will result in expansion in area,\n            modernization, and installation of drainage systems.\n            Second, groundwater prospecting and monitoring will include\n            drilling of 212 exploratory tubewells, 115 piezometers, and\n            acquisition of one geophysical resistivity unit. Third,\n            research will support specific priority research projects.\n            Fourth, extension and training will finance rehabilitation\n            of seven existing training centers and the upgrading of the\n            central training unit at Sidi Thabet."}, "docdt": "1997-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
