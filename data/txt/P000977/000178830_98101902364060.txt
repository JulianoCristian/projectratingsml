PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      Republic of Guinea-Bissau
Beneficiaries: The Government would transfer the proceeds of the IDA credit
as a grant to Petrominas, the Government owned oil and mining
company.
Amount:        SDR 5.4 million (US$6.8 million equivalent)
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description:   The project would assist the Government to resume offshore
exploration. The project includes 80 man-months of technical
assistance to the National Corporation for Petroleum and
Mineral Research and Exploration (Petrominas) to evaluate and
gather further geological and geophysical data, to negotiate
exploration contracts with oil companies, and to devise a
petroleum accounting system and a system for monitoring the
activities of oil companies. It would also include the construc-
tion and furnishing of facilities for Petrominas, complete with
office and laboratory equipment, as well as staff training.
Under two PPF advances (totalling US$550,000) approved in May
and December 1980, a preliminary assessment of the existing
geological data to justify reprocessing and help define further
acquisition needs is being carried out.
Benefits       The project would help determine the existence of economically
and Risks:     exploitable oil deposits and is expected to attract foreign
capital for intensive exploration work. The risk associated
with exploration is that the prospects uncovered may not be
attractive enough for oil companies to sign exploration con-
tracts. In view of the geological potential, and the interest
already expressed by some oil companies, the potential benefits
outweigh the risk.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR A PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for an amount in various
currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 5.4 million (US$6.8 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a petroleum exploration
promotion project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Republic of Guinea-Bissau joined the Bank Group in March 1977.
A reconnaissance mission took place in May 1977, and a full economic mission
visited the country in October/November 1980. The following assessment of the
current situation and prospects of the economy is based on the findings of the
reconnaissance mission updated by a recent IMF report. Country data appear in
Annex 1.
The Setting
3.        Guinea-Bissau is a small country with a population of about 770,000
located on the West African coast between Senegal and Guinea. The country is
generally flat with a few hills, and its coastline is interrupted by six large
estuaries which run far inland. The soils are mostly alluvial and fertile;
rainfall is sufficient for a variety of crops, but the country is not immune
from drought. The economy is predominantly agricultural and, although cash
crops are grown for exports and domestic markets, subsistence farming is
dominant. The agricultural sector, together with forestry and fishing,
accounts for two thirds of GDP and employs about 90 percent of the labor
force. Industrial activity is little developed so far: a brewery/soft drink
factory, an automobile assembly plant, and some processing of agricultural
products form the bulk of manufacturing production. GDP per capita in 1979
was roughly estimated at US$170.
4.        The political system is based upon the single national party, the
PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde) which
covers both Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (The Secretary-General of PAIGC is
also President of Cape Verde).  Within the Government of Guinea-Bissau, many
of the twenty commissars (Ministers) are party members. Administratively,
the country is divided into eight regions, each headed by a governor who
also heads the regional party organization.
Past Developments
5.        Guinea-Bissau became independent in 1974 after a long war of libera-
tion which had disrupted its economy and destroyed or damaged much of the very
limited infrastructure. At the time of Independence, the country faced acute



-2-
shortages, especially in food supplies, trained manpower, budgetary finance,
and foreign exchange. Although, since then, much progress has been made
with international assistance, the country still faces major difficulties in
the transition to a peace-time economy.
6.        Despite efforts undertaken since Independence, transport remains
one of the major constraints to growth. The transport system, although
extensive, is in poor condition. Furthermore, the network was built to
serve military needs and not development. Thus, the southern part of the
country, where most of the rice is grown, is not serviced by roads. Paved
roads exist between some of the major towns, but regional roads in the south
are not passable during the rainy season, and feeder roads in the north are
inadequate. Transport of groundnuts from the northern region to Bissau for
processing and export has to be made by road and river. Currently, river
transport is also the only means of bringing rice from the surplus regions
of the south to the capital. IDA's first project in Guinea-Bissau (Credit
878-GUB approved in January 1979) for road rehabilitation and maintenance is
addressing some of these problems.
7.        The port of Bissau, which handles virtually all of the country's
foreign trade, can only be reached through a channel constantly threatened
by shoals and siltation. Inland waterway ports are also unsatisfactory, and
road links from these small ports to villages and farms are poor. The
coastal shipping fleet consists of 75 vessels that are obsolete and dilapi-
dated with the exception of four new ferry boats, four new motorized barges,
and one coastal vessel recently provided by foreign aid.
8.        Also impeding development is a shortage of trained manpower.  This
human resource problem is not helped much by the existing education system,
which has produced a literacy rate of 10 percent nationwide. The two major
problems are inadequate teacher training and lack of classroom space; both
these shortcomings are being addressed by the Government with foreign
assistance.
9.        Health conditions in Guinea-Bissau are poor.  There is a serious
incidence of malaria, gastrointestinal disease, filariasis, tuberculosis and
leprosy.  The infant mortality rate is estimated at 250 per thousand, and
the mortality rate among children under five years is slightly over 400 per
thousand. A program of health service development has been drawn up with
the assistance of the World Health Organization.  Immunization against the
most communicable diseases has been given high priority.
10.       In the productive sectors, the subsistence-based economy is still
attempting to regain its former self-sufficiency in rice, the basic staple
of the population, and to increase its modest level of cash crop exports
(mainly groundnuts, palm kernels and cashew nuts). During the three-year
period following Independence, agricultural output registered significant
gains, but suffered a sharp setback in 1978 and 1979 as a result of the
drought. Rice production, which had come close to eliminating the food gap,
fell by an estimated 60 percent in 1978, necessitating substantial imports
of rice, of which only a part was grant-financed.



11.       In the case of groundnuts, the major export crop and source of
cash income for the farmer, production was also reduced to pre-independence
levels (7,000-8,000 tons). All the gains achieved in 1974-77 with higher
producer prices and the introduction of new varieties were thus lost during
the 1978-79 drought. As discussed below, these developments were accompanied
by a weakening of the public finance and balance of payments positions.
Public Finance and Balance of Payments
12.       During the period 1975-78, the current budget deficit increased
almost threefold to reach a level equivalent to 17 percent of GDP. Budge-
tary revenues are relatively low, reflecting the small contribution from
import and export duties, a legacy from the colonial tariff structure which
is now being revised. In 1978, revenues only covered 44 percent of budgetary
expenditures, leaving a current deficit of GP 671 million (US$20 million)
which had to be financed by Central Bank advances and some external borrowing.
Extra-budgetary expenditures (mainly capital outlays, technical assistance,
and emergency food supply) are high (40 percent of total expenditures) and
growing rapidly. In 1978, they amounted to US$32.5 million (26 percent of
GDP) and were entirely financed by foreign assistance. The size of the
civil service (15,000 employees, exclusive of the military) represents a
serious medium-term problem, since domestic resources would probably not be
sufficient to maintain the present public payroll.
13.       On the balance of payments side, the need for food and capital
goods imports has created a large current account imbalance over the period
1975-78. Exports of goods and non-factor services only covered one-fifth of
the import bill, forcing Guinea-Bissau to rely heavily on foreign aid to
finance imports of essential consumer goods, petroleum products and equipment.
Despite very high levels of aid inflows, the overall balance of payments
deficit reached US$7.1 million in 1978. Gross official reserves, which at
the end of 1978 were equivalent to about 2.5 months of imports, are estimated
to represent less than two months of imports in 1979.
Strategy and Medium-Term Prospects
14.       During the first few post-independence years there was little room
for development planning, since the Government had to concentrate its efforts
on restoring essential services and setting up an administrative framework.
The Government is now in a better position to devote its attention to policies
that affect the long-term development of the country. The 1980-82 Development
Plan which is being finalized, has as its main objectives modernization of
the rural sector,which provides the livelihood for 90 percent of the population,
and restoration of the balance of payments equilibrium.
15.       The first objective is to be reached through the introduction of
better cultivation methods, improved seeds and fertilizers, expansion of
storage facilities and provision of extension services. The Government
believes that, in the near future, Guinea-Bissau should be able to regain a
position of self-sufficiency in food. Indeed, prospects for increased rice
production in the medium-term are considered promising, particularly if
efforts are made to develop irrigation and improve seed varieties.



- 4 -
16.       With regard to groundnuts, an extension of the area under cultiva-
tion, generous producer prices and increased yields through greater use of
pesticides and improved seed varieties are expected to increase production
to pre-war levels.
17.       The second objective is to be achieved through a vigorous promo-
tion of fish and timber exports but will also benefit from the expected
expansions of agricultural production (particularly rice and groundnuts).
Fishing agreements with the USSR were recently re-negotiated and new agree-
ments have been signed with France, Portugal and other countries to ensure
that Guinea-Bissau fully benefits from its fisheries resources. A French-
Guinean company, SEMAPESCA, recently constructed a fish processing plant
with a capacity of 1,200 metric tons in Bissau. The Government has also
started a training program for the sector, and has sent 70 students abroad.
18.       According to a recent study, Guinea-Bissau has the potential to
export annually 30,000 tons of timber in five years from now. The Govern-
ment is optimistic that timber production problems encountered by the
state-owned company, SOCOTRAM, owing to transportation and organizational
difficulties will be solved rapidly. A plan of action for the sector is
being prepared. This plan will include forestry legislation, a system of
control and taxation of logging operations, and a staff training program.
Also under preparation are: a forestry classification project, an aerial
photography project, and a pilot reforestation project.
19.       The Government is also giving high priority to the development of
renewable energy resources (wood, charcoal and crop residues), and to the
search for fossil fuels to bring about a reduction in the oil import bill,
and to promote new exports.
20.       Manufacturing is accorded a subsidiary role to that of the primary
sector. Nevertheless, the Plan intends to encourage small-scale industries
where there are possibilities for import substitution or export. The
Government is also developing an agro-industrial complex (rice mill and
groundnut crushing plant) near Bissau. Besides the production of groundnut
oil for internal consumption and exports, the plant will also produce soap and
animal-feed cake.
21.       In support of the production objectives described above, the
Government is placing strong emphasis on the development of infrastructure
and training of manpower, the two main constraints to the country's long-
term development. In the infrastructure sector, the Government's objectives
are to ensure that the country will be adequately and reliably served by the
Bissau port, and that the coastal and river transport system is adequate for
extending the transport network to the village level. Upon Government
request, IDA is at present preparing a project that would rehabilitate and
expand Bissau port and construct small out-ports on various rivers. The
African Development Fund agreed to finance a general transport study with a
view to developing a coherent and efficient road/river transport system.



- 5 -
22.       Medium-term prospects for the economy point to a moderate growth of
exports with some reduction in rice imports, continuing balance of payments
difficulties and large budgetary deficits to be mostly financed by foreign
aid.
23.       Over the period 1975-78, Guinea-Bissau received on average about
US$30-35 million a year in foreign grants and loans, which in comparison to
other West African countries was rather high (US$40 per capita per annum or
20-30 percent of GNP). Foreign aid consisted of substantial balance of
payments support to bridge the country's most difficult years, as well as
project aid to a variety of sectors (fisheries, agriculture, health, educa-
tion and telecommunications). In the next few years, foreign aid is likely
to remain at a high level, with a shift, however, from program aid to more
project-oriented assistance. In view of the critical balance of payments
position, Guinea-Bissau can only afford the necessary foreign borrowing if
it is made available at very concessionary terms. Preliminary Bank esti-
mates show that total debt outstanding in 1979 amounted to about US$70
million of which about US$20 Aillion disbursed. Although most of the debts
contracted carry maturities of at least 20 years, the service on public debt
in 1978 already claimed about 12 percent of total earnings from exports of
goods and non-factor services.
24.       On the budget side, it is unlikely that any savings could be
generated in the foreseeable future to help finance public investments.
Both the 1978 budget results and the 1979 estimates indicate a serious
deficit. Thus, in order to permit development activity to continue, foreign
donors should be prepared to finance a substantial proportion of local costs
of the high priority development projects that will go ahead in the next few
years. Financing of some recurrent costs linked to these projects may also
be necessary.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
25.       Following the Independence war, the Government of Guinea-Bissau
expressed a desire for IDA to take the lead in providing assistance in such
areas as the badly damaged roads, ports and other infrastructure, and energy
development, while smaller pilot projects in rural development are the sub-
ject of requests for assistance to bilateral agencies. Consequently, the
Bank Group has so far concentrated its preparation work on the transport and
energy sectors, while discussing with the Government ways and means through
which the Bank Group would also assist the Government in the agricultural
sector.
26.       IDA's first and only operation in Guinea-Bissau was a US$9.0 million
credit (Cr. No. 878-GUB of February 9, 1979) to finance a First Roads Project
which provides for the rehabilitation and maintenance of 226 km of asphalt
roads and 388 km of gravel roads, the purchase of equipment, material and
spare parts, and technical assistance and training. This credit was supple-
mented in January 1980 by a Special Action Credit of US$1.0 million which is



- 6 -
being applied primarily to finance local costs of the project. The proposed
project described in the present report, which would be the second IDA
investment in the country, would support the Government's objectives for the
energy sector.
27.       Future IDA operations in Guinea-Bissau in the medium term will
continue to be responsive to the Government-s requests for assistance in the
rehabilitation of its infrastructure, while identification and preparation
work is being carried out to mount a rural development type of project. The
next IDA credit would be to finance the rehabilitation of Bissau port and
other river ports in the interior. A review of the investments proposed for
the social sectors and the assistance available from other sources may open
the way for direct participation of IDA in those fields, which at present
are adequately covered by bilateral aid programs.
28.       The level of prospective IDA lending relative to that of other
official development assistance is modest, due to the high level of existing
aid flows. At the end of 1980, IDA commitments would account for about 8-10
percent of total external debt outstanding, including undisbursed.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
29.       While Guinea-Bissau has a variety of energy resources, the sector
is still at an early stage of development. About 70 % of the national
territory is covered with forests, a major source of energy. Vegetable
fuels such as rice, wood and groundnut residues are little used at present.
Concentrated along the Corubal and Jeba rivers there is an untapped hydro-
potential of about 60 MW. Solar energy in the northeast and aeolian energy
in the country's archipelago could also be exploited in due time. Further,
Guinea-Bissau-s offshore has promising oil shows. (See Annex IV for the
status of exploration).
30.       Averaging less than 4% of growth a year between 1976 and 1979,
energy demand has been low compared to other West African countries. But
there has been a steady increase, and if the Government's development projects
are implemented as scheduled, demand would grow at 6% a year in the 1980s. At
present, most of the demand (68%) is met by traditional energy (firewood and
charcoal), followed by petroleum products (31%) all of which are imported, and
vegetable residues (1%). About 4% of final energy consumption comes from
electricity. Total power consumption in 1979 was around 30 GWh (40 kWh per
capita), 60% of which is accounted for by the capital city. Power generating
capacity amounts to about 20 MW and is entirely diesel-based in small isolated
units.
Sectoral Institutions
31.       There are four ministries involved in the energy sector:  the
Commissariat of Economic Development and Planning makes overall investment
and development strategy decisions, and coordinates external borrowing; the



- 7 -
Commissariat of Natural Resources (CERN) is responsible for the development of
the hydrological and forestry potential; the Commissariat of Commerce admini-
sters the state organizations that handle import and distribution of petroleum
products, and, the Commissariat of Finance administers fuel taxation. Fuel
and electricity prices are determined by the Economic Council of the Cabinet.
Besides these ministries, there is the National Corporation for Petroleua and
Mineral Research and Exploration (Petrominas), a state enterprise under the
aegis of CERN (see para. 38), and the National Institute of Energy (INE), the
public utility company, responsible for generating and selling electricity
domestically as well as for developing alternate energy resources. Recently,
in an effort to coordinate energy activities, an interministerial committee
has been formed under the chairmanship of INE. This committee concentrates on
encouraging the use of alternate energy sources, especially solar and biogas.
The Government has also plans to strengthen the planning capacity of INE, and
UNDP funds are being allocated for that purpose.
Sectoral Objectives and Issues
32.       The Government considers the development of the energy sector a
key to economic growth and improved standards of living. So far, the country
is entirely dependent on imports of petroleum products for its commercial
energy supply, and this has exerted added pressure on the balance of payments,
especially with rising world oil prices. Guinea-Bissau is now at a turning
point in tackling the problems caused by a poorly developed energy resource
base. To ensure long-term growth of the economy, the Government is giving due
consideration to the development of renewable energy sources, especially wood,
charcoal and crop residues and. to the search for fossil fuels. Petroleum
exploration is an attractive option in view of the geology of the offshore,
and the Government has decided to actively promote it with foreign oil com-
panies likely to be interested.
33.       The investment program in the energy sector for the 1981-85 period
is expected to amount to US$35 million (in 1980 prices), most of which is to
be financed by foreign aid. Nearly 80% of this investment would be in power,
including the extension of thermal generation (for which IDA assistance is
sought) to meet requirements until other primary sources are developed.
French aid is financing the investigation of sites for microhydro schemes,
and UNDP is financing the feasibility study of a hydro plant on the Corubal
river to provide 30-40 MW base load capacity by the late 1980s. 1/ INE is
looking into ways of reducing its dependence on imported diesel fuel in
power generation, such as a switch to heavy fuel and the use of agricultural
and forestry wastes. Other public investments in the energy sector will
concentrate on the promotion of hydrocarbon exploration as part of the
proposed project. Projects for other energy sources (vegetable wastes,
solar applications) are still in the conceptual stage.
1/   The emphasis on the development of thermal-based electricity will
contribute in the medium-term to increasing the country's dependence
on imports of petroleum products for commercial energy. In the longer
term, harnessing of the hydro potential and the development of renew-
able energy alternatives are expected to contribute a substantial
proportion of the country's energy requirements.



- 8 -
34.       Between 1974 and 1980, increases in domestic prices of petroleum
products have generally matched rising import costs. However, important
exceptions were made for individual items; while gasoline retail prices are
in line with international prices, diesel, kerosene, aviation and jet fuels
enjoy preferential prices. Mainly for social reasons, the Government has
kept electricity prices at the same level since 1974, despite soaring fuel
costs. The recently introduced 12.5 percent tariff increase is by no means
enough to ensure the financial viability of INE. The state organizations
that import and distribute petroleum products have also suffered from the
preferential pricing system. In 1979, INE showed a deficit of US$0.6
million equivalent, and the state organizations losses amounted to US$1
million equivalent. The Government has come to realize that a sound energy
pricing policy is needed to ensure not only efficient energy use but also
the viability of sectoral organizations and is focussing in this matters with
a view to introducing remedial measures.
The Petroleum Subsector
35.       In the absence of domestic production and refining, Guinea-Bissau
depends on imports for all of its petroleum products needs. Until 1979,
these imports originated in Portugal and the USSR; since then, Guinea-Bissau
has resorted to purchases on the spot market.
36.       In line with the overall energy consumption level, Guinea-Bissau's
petroleum requirements are low, totalling about 22,000 metric tons or 30 kg
per capita in 1979. Power generation accounts for 45 percent of petroleum
product consumption, transport for 32 percent, Government administration for
about 10 percent, and commercial and residential use for the remainder.
Consumption declined sharply in 1974/75 with the departure of the Portuguese
Armed Forces following Independence. It increased by 6.5 percent a year
during 1976-79 because of fast growth in diesel demand for power generation
and transport; diesel's share in petroleum consumption rose from 61 percent
to 71 percent. Consumption of all other petroleum products declined or
remained the same after 1977 because of de facto rationing necessitated by
foreign exchange shortages.
37.       Despite their small size, petroleum imports have become a growing
burden on the balance of payments. They fluctuated around US$3 million per
annum during 1973-78, when import prices increases were compensated by
volume reductions. In 1979, they rose to over US$5 million, equivalent to
8.5% of merchandise imports and over 36% of merchandise exports, as high
volume growth was compounded by substantial price raises. Given the diffi-
cult balance of payments situation following the 1979 petroleum price
increases, the Government is again curtailing import volumes. Petroleum
product imports in 1980 are, nevertheless, likely to exceed US$7 million,
equivalent to 11% of merchandise imports and 45% of merchandise exports. If
implementation of agro-industrial, manufacturing and power expansion projects
goes forward as envisaged, the increase in petroleum product consumption
through the mid-1980s could reach 8% per annum. On that assumption and on
the basis of IDA-s forecast of the international petroleum price, imports
could approach US$19 million (current prices) by 1985.

Institutional and Legal Framework for Petroleum Exploration
38.     The Government agency in charge of petroleum exploration is Petro-
minas, a state enterprise, reporting to CERN. It was created in 1977 to
carry out petroleum and mineral exploration and exploitation. At present,
Petrominas has a skeleton staff of two professionals and is headed by a
hydrological engineer with no experience in petroleum. Its staff will be
strengthened progressively as Guineans in universities abroad complete their
studies and return home. For the next few years, however, given the lack of
experienced personnel, Petrominas will require the support of specialized
consultants. Petrominas' existing financial resources consist only of
budgetary allocations. Its total (current and capital) budgetary allocation
for 1980 is in the order of GP 40 million (US$1.15 million), of which GP 35
million (US$1.0 million) was devoted to a consultants' contract for the
compilation and review of existing data (see para. 42). At present, Petro-
minas does not keep adequate financial records. The proposed project would
assist in strengthening Petrominas' financial management.
39.       Hydrocarbon exploration and production is at present governed by
a Portuguese concession law dating back to the 1920's. The Government
considers this law obsolete in view of prevailing industry practices, the
country's socioeconomic realities and its geological potential. It has
drafted a new law and circulated it to oil companies for comments.  IDA also
has had the opportunity to discuss the draft law with Guinean authorities,
and has suggested a number of improvements, which the Government will take
into consideration with the assistance of consultants to be financed under the
proposed project (see para. 45).
Past Exploration and Present Situation
40.       The sedimentary area of Guinea-Bissau includes about 107,000 km2,
of which 35,000 km2 onshore, 42,000 km2 in the shelf area (in water depths
up to 200 m) and 30,000 km2 in the deep water area (water depth of more than
200 m). Based on geological conditions and results from previous exploration,
the petroleum potential is rated as fair to good, particularly the offshore.
Guinea-Bissau's geology is discussed in more detail in Annex IV. Petroleum
exploration started in 1958 when Esso (U.S.) obtained an onshore concession
from Portugal. Esso carried out geophysical surveys and drilled four wells
onshore, which were dry. After 1966, it concentrated its efforts on the
offshore where it recorded about 14,000 km of seismic data and drilled five
wells, all of which had shows of oil and gas. Esso's permits expired in 1976:
since then, two seismic surveys were conducted, one of 2,400 km by the Seagap
Consortium and one of 600 km by the French Petroleum Institute.
41.       Past exploration efforts, albeit limited, are bearing out the
potential of the Guinean offshore.  Of special interest is well PGO-3 drilled
by Esso in 1969, which tested a few barrels of good quality oil but did not
penetrate an attractive deeper structure.  Further study of the well data
and a detailed seismic survey of the structure are needed to determine
whether at current crude oil prices it is worth drilling the lower forma-
tions. The proposed project makes provision for this (see para. 45).

Government Approach to Hydrocarbon Exploration
42.       The Government attaches high priority to the search for hydro-
carbons. Several U.S. and European oil companies already have expressed
interest in signing exploration contracts. The Government did not want to
respond to such proposals until it had revised the contractual framework for
petroleum exploration and production, and increased its knowledge of the
country's hydrocarbon potential. It felt that these steps would ensure that
negotiations with the companies result in exploration contracts satisfactory
to both parties. In early 1980, the Government retained Atlantic Resources
Limited (ARL), a well-qualified Lisbon-based firm to (a) retrieve, review
and interpret geological and geophysical data collected by former operating
companies, and establish the petroleum potential of the country-s offshore,
and (b) monitor the preparation of a new legal framework. Following its
review of existing data, ARL advised the Government that the quality,
density and vintage of old seismic data was good enough to warrant extensive
reprocessing and reinterpretation, but that they needed to be complemented by
the acquisition of new geophysical data. The Government decided to have
this work carried out and then negotiate exploration contracts providing for
high working commitments including drilling, on specific acreage.
IDA's Role
43.       The Government's approach to oil exploration outlined above is
considered sound. Consistent with the World Bank Group program in petroleum
exploration, IDA's support would provide Petrominas with the expertise
needed to broaden its knowledge of the country's hydrocarbon potential, to
promote this potential, and negotiate exploration contracts with foreign
companies. In May 1980, IDA granted a US$400,000 advance from the Project
Preparation Facility to finance test reprocessing and interpretation of
seismic lines as well as an assessment of Petrominas' needs for technical
assistance, and laboratory and office equipment. A supplementary PPF advance
of US$150,000 to finance the completion of the work was granted in December
1980.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
44.       The proposed project was identified during the visit of an IDA
mission to Guinea-Bissau in February 1980 and was appraised in July 1980.
Credit negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. on December 1-3, 1980.
The Guinean delegation was headed by Mr. Samba Lamine Mane, Minister of
Natural Resources. A credit and project summary appears at the beginning of
this Report. No staff Appraisal Report has been prepared.
Project Objectives and Description
45.       The objective of the project is to promote the resumption of off-
shore hydrocarbon exploration in the country. To achieve this objective, the
project would strengthen the capacity of Petrominas to evaluate geological and



- 11 -
geophysical data and to carry out and supervise new surveys, so as to enable
the Government to open acreage for exploration by foreign companies, to nego-
tiate exploration/production contracts and to monitor work carried out even-
tually by the operating oil companies. The project would consist of:
(a)  Exploration consultants (64 man-months) to be retained by Petrominas,
including an explorationist and a geophysicist as well as other
specialists on short-term assignments to help:
(i)  complete the review, compilation, interpretation and integration
of existing geophysical and geological data;
(ii) conduct an offshore seismic survey, evaluate new geophysical
data, and reprocess existing data;
(iii) prepare a report on the petroleum potential of Guinea-Bissau;
(iv) promote the country's petroleum potential to attract interest
of oil companies;
(v)  negotiate exploration contracts; and
(vi) monitor the activities of operating companies.
During the review of geological/geophysical data, the consultants
would pay particular attention to the data pertaining to well PGO-3
(para. 41). Assurances would be obtained that before June 30, 1981,
the Government would discuss with IDA the consultants report on well
PGO-3 integrating the results from the review of the existing data
as well as those from the new seismic acquisition and recommending a
course of action for the Government (Section 3.06 of the Draft
Development Credit Agreement).
(b)  petroleum accounting consultants (3 man months) to be employed
by Petrominas to improve its own accounting system and to
establish a petroleum accounting system aimed at controlling,
monitoring and auditing expenditures by operating companies.
(c)  legal and economic consultants (13 man months) to prepare a draft
petroleum law and model contracts as well as economic-financial
models needed for negotiations with oil companies.
(d)  training:  two geologists and two geophysicists of CERN/Petrominas
would be granted fellowships to take specialized courses abroad.
The project would also include fellowships to enable CERN/Petrominas
staff to join international consultants and benefit from formal and
on-the-job training in exploration activity.
(e)  geophysical work:  Some 2,500 km of new seismic data would be
collected in Guinea-Bissau's offshore north of parallel 10040',
i.e. some 2,200 km on a reconnaissance grid complementing the
existing data and some 300 km on a detailed grid around PGO-3.
About 3,000 km of existing seismic data would be reprocessed.



- 12 -
(f) Petrominas facilities and equipment: Petrominas would be pro-
vided with two prefabricated buildings. The first would comprise a
basic laboratory, library, storage for well samples and documents
and office space for the consultants. The second would be a bungalow
ror the consultants during their stay. The project would also
provide the required office, laboratory and transportation equipment.
(g) basin study. Guinea-Bissau shares a sedimentary salt basin with
Senegal and The Gambia. To fully understand the geology of the
basin, the relevant geological and geophysical data from the three
countries need to be integrated. The proposed loan provides funds
for Guinea-Bissau-s share in such a basin study. Senegal and The
Gambia have requested World Bank Group assistance for the compila-
tion, review and interpretation of their geological and geophysical
data. The basin study would take place in 1983, when the basic
work is expected to be completed in Senegal and The Gambia. The
consultants for the basin study would have to be acceptable to the
three governments. Each government would enter into a contract
with the consultants and supply them with the available data.
After completion of the study, each government would receive a
basin report and a country report.
Status of Project Preparation
46.       Project preparation has proceeded speedily.  ARL has completed the
collection of information on past hydrocarbon exploration in Guinea-Bissau.
The reprocessing and reinterpretation of geophysical data financed by two
advances under the PPF (para 43) has begun, and is expected to be completed
in late December 1980. Bids for the offshore seismic survey were received on
December 17, 1980.
Cost Estimates and Financing
47.       The total cost of the project, net of duties and taxes, is esti-
mated at US$6.8 million. The cost of consulting services has been estimated
at US$15,500 per man-month including travel, computer services, subsistence
and overhead. This amount is reasonable taking into account the high level of
expertise required and fees prevailing in the petroleum industry. The cost of
the seismic survey and of the seismic data reprocessing have been estimated on
the basis of comparable work in neighboring West African countries. The cost
estimates include physical contingencies of 10 percent on all project compo-
nents. Price contingencies of 10.5 percent for 1980, 9 percent for 1981, 8
percent for 1982, and 7 percent for 1983 have been applied to all costs.
Total contingencies amount to US$1.14 million or about 20 percent of baseline
cost estimates. Estimated costs by project components are given in the
project summary. The proposed IDA credit of US$6.8 million would finance the
foreign exchange component of the project costs.   Local costs (US$180,000)
would be financed by the Government.



- 13 -
Project Implementation
48.       Petrominas, under the close supervision of CERN, would implement
the project. The relevant funds would be passed on by the Government to
Petrominas as a grant. Petrominas expects to keep the services of ARL as
exploration consultants for the duration of the project. ARL has performed
satisfactorily work under the PPF, and this arrangement would be satisfactory
to the Association. The legal, economic and accounting consultants would be
employed before June 1981. The geophysical survey would be carried out by
specialized contractors early in 1981 under the supervision of Petrominas and
its exploration consultants. The processing and reprocessing of seismic data
would be carried out by consultants on subcontracts from the exploration
consultants.
49.       Project implementation is heavily dependent on consultants.  All
consultants would be acceptable to Petrominas and the Association, and
employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association and Petro-
minas. They would be required to train on the job specific counterpart staff
who would eventually replace them. Agreement was reached that before the end
of each calendar year, starting with 1981, the Government would report to IDA
on the staffing of Petrominas and would submit annual plans for gradually
replacing foreign consultants by Guinean staff (Section 3.04(b) of the Draft
Development Credit Agreement).
50.       Petrominas plans to sell some of the data collected during project
implementation to interested oil companies. It has been agreed that the
proceeds of any such sales (expected to amount to about US$750,000) be kept in
a special account and used only for further investments in the hydrocarbon
sector. (Section 4.03 of the Draft Development Credit Agreement). The
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1983.
Procurement and Disbursement
51.       The contract for the offshore seismic survey would be awarded fol-
lowing international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Contracts for vehicles, office and laboratory equipment (estimated at
US$275,000) as well as for Petrominas prefabricated facilities (estimated at
US$300,000) would be awarded following limited international tendering. Dis-
bursements would be made against 100% of foreign expenditures. Conditions of
disbursement for the funds relating to monitoring the operating companies'
activities and to the basin study are respectively, that the Government sign
an exploration contract with an oil company, and that Senegal and The Gambia
would have contracted the consultants in charge of the basin study (para. 4 of
Schedule 1 of Draft Development Credit Agreement). The proceeds of the credit
are expected to be fully disbursed three years after Credit effectiveness.
Accounting, Auditing and Reporting
52.       Petrominas would employ before June 1981 an accountant acceptable to
the Association. Petrominas would keep separate project accounts. Petrominas
accounts as well as its project accounts would be audited by independent



- 14 -
auditors acceptable to Petrominas and IDA. The audit reports would be submit-
ted to the Association no later than six months after the close of the fiscal
year, starting with FY81. Petrominas would submit quarterly and annual
reports on implementation of the project in a format acceptable to the
Association. Petrominas would also submit a project completion report not
later than six months after the Closing Date of the Credit (Section 3.04(d) of
the Draft Development Credit Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
53.       The project is expected to yield two major benefits.  First, the
study of the area surrounding well PGO-3 will provide information as to
whether further exploration either by companies, Petrominas or a combination
of both is warranted. Second, the promotion effort is expected to attract
foreign capital for undertaking intensive hydrocarbon exploration offshore
Guinea-Bissau. It is expected that bidding on offshore blocks would take
place in 1981 and that several companies would be active from 1982 on. Any
ensuing petroleum discovery would have a positive impact on the country's
economy. The risk associated with the project is that the tracts offered for
bidding may not prove attractive enough to foreign companies. However, given
the geological conditions, companies interest and the current energy market
conditions, it is believed the expected benefits of proceeding with the
project outweigh such risks.
54.       Even if the ensuing exploration efforts by companies are unsuccess-
ful, the data gathered will remain valuable and serve as a reference for any
future exploration. Petrominas, with the equipment and assistance provided
under the project, would hold the geological and geophysical data collected
during project implementation in safe keeping, and have them readily avail-
able for further exploration and pursuit of its own interpretation of the
basin potential.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association, are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
56.       The Development Credit provides for the following special conditions
of disbursements:
(a) for the sedimentary salt basin study, the conclusion of agreements
between the Republics of The Gambia and Senegal and the consultants
in charge of the study; and
(b)  for the monitoring of exploration activities, the signature by
the Government of at least one exploration contract.



- 15 -
Other special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
III.
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

executed satisfactorily. The mobilization of counterpart
staff and the provision of adequate housing and office
accommodation for the consultants have proved difficult.
Some key counterpart positions have not been filled ade-
quately, but the Government is giving priority to this task
as more qualified Guineans emerge from the various training
programmes the country has underway. The housing problem is
being resolved with the renovation of four apartments and the
construction of five prefabricated houses.

HYDROCARBON GEOLOGY AND STATUS OF EXPLORATION
Background
1.        Though past exploration did not go much beyond the first recon-
naissance stage, it proved the existence of a thick sedimentary section
(10,000/15,000' along the coast to 20,000/25,000' along the slope) containing
both source and reservoir rocks and a variety of structural and sedimentary
entrapment possibilities which make Guinea Bissau an attractive oil play.
Geology
2.        Guinea Bissau consists mainly of a large Mesozoic basin extending
mostly in the offshore, but covering a small part of the onshore. It begins
in Lower Trias with the rifting between the African and American continents.
Continental deposits accumulated in grabens. The first marine transgression
during Trias and Jurassic corresponds to the deposition of evaporites,
including salt passing to dolomitic and sand layers in the upper Jurassic
Marine. Marine carbonates dominate during Lower Cretaceous grading into
sands toward the onshore. At the beginning of Upper Cretaceous, regression
of the sea brought a clastic and shale deposition with deltaic sequences.
During the rest of Upper Cretaceous, a marine transgression extended inside
the present shoreline. Important shale sequences alternate with sands
and locally with carbonate layers. The late Cretaceous (Maestrichtian)
deposited shales extend seaward and cut the previous formations with an
important unconformity along the slope.
3.        A large part of the basin near the outer shelf and extending along
the slope shows diapiric structures piercing to various levels of Cretaceous
and sometimes of Tertiary. Low relief intradomal structures are shown on the
seismic. Some of those structures in the deep offshore appear quite large
with several thousand feet of closure. A large updip extends along the
paleoslope of the Cretaceous, covered and cut by the Maestrichtian shales.
This feature certainly needs more accurate velocity studies to be proven, but
appears as important structural trend in the northern part of the basin.
Possibilities of reef development should be investigated in this area.
Evidences of roll over, growth faulting and low relief structures probably
linked with deep horsts and graben appear along the shelf though more accurate
seismic would be necessary to show clearly these structural leads. Strati-
graphic traps are possible on the eastern part of the basin where the forma-
tions from Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous are overlapping along the basement
slope. Bar sands, channel sands and deltaic deposits seem likely in several
areas but would need better seismic to be ascertained.
Past Exploration
4.        The six wells drilled in offshore by Esso vary in depth from 6545'
to 12,732' (PGO-3). They reached generally either salt or Middle Cretaceous
(Albian). Numerous shows of oil and gas are reported, in Paleocene, Upper and
Middle Cretaceous. PGO-3 is of special interest as it produced a few barrels
of good quality oil. The test (three hours) did not work properly, but was

not repeated. The water produced was rather fresh, probably from the invaded
zone. The electric logs show several good sands which could eventually be oil
bearing on a total thickness of 25'. This well was stopped in the Albian,
though a better looking structure seems to develop in lower formations
(Neocomian). After a more detailed study of the well logs and new seismic,
the PGO-3 area could eventually offer an opportunity for drilling.
Role of the Project
5.      The proposed project would assist Guinea-Bissau in understanding
its hydrocarbon potential and promoting it to the oil industry. Within the
next two years, Guinea Bissau is expected to enter a second, more intensive
phase of exploration for hydrocarbon.

Glossary of Geologic Terms
Anticline:                A term indicating a discrete positive (high) closure,
usually an upward arching of sediments caused by
compressional forces within the earth; often used to
denote any type of positive closure which may be the
result of drape over buried topography or residual
structure bounded by areas of negative closure
(syncline); with regional or nondiscrete positive
closures, the term arch is more common.
Diapir, diapiric:         A flowage of plastic sedimentary rocks, usually salt
or undercompacted shales (those which retain a high
fraction of formation water relative to depth of
burial), caused by an inversion in the specific
gravity of rocks with depth (light below heavy);
diapiric relates to structuring developed when
diapirs are present or to the cause of the diapir,
i.e., diapiric shale.
Dike:                     An intrusive body of crystalline rock whose geometry
is tabular with a vertical or near vertical attitude,
i.e., if the preexisting rock is sedimentary, cuts
across bedding planes.
Facies:                   Descriptive of sedimentary rocks of a common compo-
sition deposited in a particular manner; may apply to
both general and/or specific conditions of deposition.
Graben (trough):          A fault-bounded structurally low block in which move-
ment involved crystalline basement rock as well as
overlying sedimentary rocks; grabens are normally
associated with and adjacent to horsts.
Horst (horst block):      A fault-bounded structurally high block in which
movement involved crystalline basement rock as well
as overlying sedimentary rocks.
Intrusive:                A crystalline igneous rock injected in a fluid
phase into preexisting rocks, either igneous,
metamorphic or sedimentary.
Karroo:                   A thick, generally nonmarine sedimentary rock sequence
found in the sub-Sahara of Africa ranging in age from
the Paleozoic Carboniferous through Mesozoic Triassic
and into the Mesozoic Lower Jurassic; precise age
determination often difficult and thus lumped into
general term "Karroo."

Tertiary:                  The system of sedimentary rocks occupying
the more recent ages of the geologic time scale
(Cenozoic)                 comprising the Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene,
Iliocene, and Pliocene. The Cenozoic system is
(-65 to -2                 typified by the development of IMaTmals and Primates
million years)             and a flora whicht predicts the present one.  It
underlies the Quartenary (recent).
Mesozoic:                  The system of sedimentary rocks occupying the middle
ages of the geologic time scale, rmuprising the
Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods; the
Mesozotc system is typified by a reptilian fauna
and a coniferous flora which overlies the older
Paleozoic system and underlies the Cenozoic system
(Tertiary, Quartenary and Recent).
Paleozoic:                 The system of sedimentary rocks occupying the early
ages of the geologic time scale comprising the
(-600 to -230             Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian, Silurian, Carboni-
million years)             ferous and Permian Periods; the Paleozoic system is
typified by an invertebrate fauna but witnessed the
evolution of fish and near the shore prirlLiUve
reptiles as well and a flora evolving through algae,
ferns and primative conifers; the pre-Cambrian system,
consisting principally of nonsedimentary rocks and
occasionally sedimentary rocks deficient in fossils,
underlies the Paleozoic.
Play:                      A grouping of petroleum prospects in which the type
of trap as well as age and composition of reservoir
and source rocks (independently) are believed to be
common; synonomous with "trend" if and when prospects
become productive fields.
Progradation:              The deposition of sediments in a seaward direction
and outbuilding of shoreline, ultimately resulting
in nonmarine sediments overlying mar Lne, due to
regression (lowering sea level fIue- to uplift or
worldwide fall in sea level), rapid influx of
sediments into a static sea lev&, or at a rate
exceeding a rise in sea level.
Reef:                      A build-up of carbonate rocks (limestone or dolomite)
consisting of a particular assemblage of organic
skeletal material formed in warm, nonturbid seas;
following burial forms a unique type of reservoir
and trap.

Reservoir rock:           Those rock formations which have retained after
burial sufficient porosity and permeability (pore
space connections) to contain fluids; either oil,
gas or water.
Structure:                Used to indicate a geometric configuration in -the
sedimentary beds which can lead to trapping of the
oil (the anticline is the most usual structure).
Rift:                     Similar to graben except used on a more regional
scale such as riFt system when associated grabens
and minor intervening horsts are included in the
overall rift (system).
Show:                     A positive indication of the presence of oil and/or
gas either in the subsurface (wells) or at the sur-
face from seeps, notes from surface samples, drill
cuttings, subsurface cores or fluid recovery; shows
may vary widely both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Sill:                     An intrusive body of crystalline rock whose geometry
is tabular with a horizontal or near horizontal
attitude, i.e., if preexisting rock is sedimentary,
is parallel to bedding planes.
Source rock:              Those sedimentary rock formations which are either
known or thought to have retained the organic debris
which under conditions oF buriLl ileit, pressure and
time) are transformed into either oil or gas; usually
shale (compacted clay) or fine-grained carbonate
(limestone).
Transgression:            The invasion of the sea (introducing a marine
environment of deposition) over an existing sub-
aereal surface caused either by subsidence or a
worldwide rise in sea level; sediments deposited
during transgression are called a trans-ressive
facies and tend to be widespread in extent.
Regression:               Withdrawal of the sea (introducing a brackish to
continental environment).
Trap:                     A barrier to the migration of fluids through a
reservoir rock; may result from structural movement
or lateral change in reservoir characteristics.

Unconformity:             A surface of divergence in the attitude between
an underlying and overlying sequence of sedimentary
rocks caused by structural movement and/or a change
in the character of the depositional environment of
the overlying sediments or involving a hiatus in
deposition and a period of erosion of the underlying
sediment.
